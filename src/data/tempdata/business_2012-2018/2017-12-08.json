Thirteen of us have come here to learn the secrets of investing from the former Liverpool and England footballer and \u2013 we\u2019re told - \u201cproperty magnate\u201d Robbie Fowler. Adverts for the Robbie Fowler Property Academy picture Fowler and promise wannabe investors they will learn how to \u201cbuild a property portfolio without the need of a footballer\u2019s salary\u201d. Fowler became so well known for his reputed property empire that during his spell at Manchester City, fans used to sing \u201cWe all live in a Robbie Fowler home\u201d to the tune of Yellow Submarine. The former striker, however, is not going to be sharing any of his personal insight. He isn\u2019t here. The adverts point out in the small print: \u201cRobbie Fowler will not attend these events.\u201d Instead, lessons are delivered by a trainer with Legacy Education Alliance, a transatlantic training company that owns the Robbie Fowler Property Academy and that promotes its property investment courses using the BBC Homes Under the Hammer presenter Martin Roberts, the former Olympians Roger Black and Steve Backley and the US personal finance guru Robert Kiyosaki. The trainer explains at the beginning of the session that he is \u201cobviously\u201d not Fowler, \u201cbut I\u2019m here on behalf of Robbie\u201d. The first thing he wants to do is \u201ccongratulate every single one of you guys\u201d, because we have done what \u201c99% of the population are unwilling to do: invest in your financial education\u201d, and we should applaud ourselves. The second is to make sure we don\u2019t have any cameras or recording devices because everything he is about to teach is \u201ccopyright myself and Robbie\u201d. Once that\u2019s out of the way, the acronyms come thick and fast. In order to make money in property, the two most important things to remember are BMV and OPM, he says. That\u2019s below market value and other people\u2019s money. \u201cThis is not a get rich quick scheme,\u201d the 20-something trainer tells us. But if you do want to get rich quick, he says, borrow other people\u2019s money to buy properties at below market rates, then \u201cflip them\u201d (sell them on quickly for more money), and repeat. \u201cWrite this down,\u201d he says. \u201cMoney in, money out, asset for free, income for life.\u201d On the screen he flashes up examples of investors who have followed his advice and made hundreds of thousands, or even a million pounds, and secured their \u201cfinancial freedom\u201d. The big money, he says, comes from more acronym-based strategies. A favourite, he says, are HMOs (houses in multiple occupancy). \u201cThat\u2019s buying a house and splitting it up into rooms and letting them individually.\u201d The ROI (return on investment), he says, can be \u201cinfinite\u201d. The trainer is also a fan of repossessed homes. But, he says, there are bigger profits to be made by finding people at risk of repossession. \u201cI target repossessions before the people are repossessed,\u201d he says. \u201cI take out ads in the local paper: \u2018Are you facing repossession? Call your local landlord, [the trainer].\u201d He promises to teach us how to run a tax-efficient business because he \u201chates the taxman \u2026 doesn\u2019t everyone\u201d. Other methods include \u201ccreative finance\u201d, which he promises means even potential investors with no assets and bad credit ratings can borrow money to start their property empire. He then suggests that those in the room with poor credit ratings could offer their friends, or even strangers in pubs, 20% interest to borrow \u00a3100,000 to pump into schemes. \u201cEven if they want 50% [interest], you can still do it and make money. You should be able to make money in any market \u2013 up, down, sideways,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do, I\u2019m not a financial adviser.\u201d Noticing some scepticism in the room, the trainer then demands \u201c100% energy, focus and commitment\u201d and emphasises his point with a demonstration that involves throwing a glass of water on the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the hotel will send me the bill,\u201d he says. About halfway through the promised two-hour free session, he reckons we have now learned enough to declare ourselves property investors. It\u2019s official. \u201cBy the power invested in me by the Hilton Euston, I now declare you all professional property investors,\u201d he says. But property investing is complicated, and he can\u2019t possibly tell us all the secrets used by Fowler and others in only two hours. To learn all the \u201cstrategies\u201d, we are encouraged to sign up for a three-day weekend course. It costs \u00a31,994, but included in that price is a \u201chome study toolkit\u201d worth \u00a3497 and a 20-minute \u201cstrategy planning call\u201d with a property adviser, apparently worth \u00a3250. Ali, one of the potential investors in the room, lets out a shocked \u201ccor blimey\u201d as the prices are flashed up on screen. The trainer replies: \u201cLook, you don\u2019t know me, but judge me on these people [Fowler, Black and Roberts]. Their name is their brand.\u201d And he says the BBC had to vet the course before Roberts could lend his name to it. Legacy Education Alliance has not been endorsed by the BBC, according to a BBC spokesman, who added that Roberts was freelance and not a member of BBC staff. Roberts\u2019 wife, Kirsty Withyman, who represents him, said: \u201cHe feels the courses offer a good insight into the world of becoming a property investor, and that those who go on them have a better chance of success as a result. His own marketing states that the contents of the courses are not endorsed by the BBC, but the BBC are obviously aware that Martin takes part in them.\u201d Fowler, Black and Backley did not respond to requests for comment. Legacy Education Alliance, which is based in Florida, said: \u201cIn relation to the accusation regarding property repossessions, this has been taken out of context. Strategies and techniques that are taught are compliant and legal and do not encourage or endorse exploitation of vulnerable individuals. \u201cMany thousands of students have been taught and mentored by Legacy Education Alliance Inc the world over, during the last 15 years. Many of these success stories opt to give back and help others through crewing, training and mentoring the next generation of professional property investors.\u201d At the Euston Hilton, there is a special offer for those who sign up today. The home study toolkit is free, the planning call is free, the course can be picked up for \u00a3997 and students can bring a friend \u2013 but only if they get their credit cards out now. The weekend course, according to online reviews, appears to be a precursor to other courses that can cost \u00a330,000. The lecturer wants us all to build our own property empire so we can give up our jobs and devote our time to what\u2019s really important in life. Because of property, he says, when his best friend was \u201cin the hospice dying\u201d he could be there at her bedside even when her husband had to go to work. \u201cLast week, Tuesday, she passed away. And it was property that allowed me to be there.\u201d Half a dozen people walk to back of the room with their credit cards out and sign up for the weekend course, and the speakers pump out the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 I Gotta Feeling. \u201cThat tonight\u2019s gonna be a good, good night,\u201d the lyrics go. \u201cI got my money, let\u2019s spend it up.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Housebuilder Berkeley Group has posted a 36% leap in half-year profits and raised its profit expectations, despite warning of Brexit uncertainty. Berkeley, which specialises in building upmarket homes in and around London with average sale price of more than \u00a3700,000, reported profits of \u00a3533m for six months to 31 October. Revenues were up nearly 14% to \u00a31.6bn in the same period. The company said it now expected to make \u00a33.3bn in pretax profits in the five years to 2021, up from its previous estimate of \u00a33bn. Shares in the FTSE 100 firm rose by more than 9% higher to \u00a342.08 after the surprise upgrade, closing up 8.4% at \u00a341.68. It was the biggest one-day rise this year for Berkley, whose shares were trading at just over \u00a324 a year ago. The firm built 2,117 homes in the six-month period, 41 more than the same period a year earlier. The average selling price rose from \u00a3655,000 to \u00a3719,000, which the builder said was owing to a change in the mix of houses constructed. Berkeley\u2019s founder and chairman, Tony Pidgley, described the political climate for housebuilding as turbulent but added: \u201cWhere there is stability, the potential for growth and delivery remains strong.\u201d The company welcomed the increased target in the draft London plan of 66,000 new homes a year, announced by the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, last week. The company said its five-year profit upgrade would have no bearing on its controversial executive bonus scheme. Earlier this year, Berkeley capped future payouts under the scheme, which runs until 2021, after criticism from shareholders and advisory groups. This means Pidgley and his chief executive, Rob Perrins, will each get a maximum share award of \u00a38m a year, starting this year. The top five Berkeley executives can earn up to \u00a321.25m from the 2011 scheme this year. Including base salary and annual cash bonuses, they are in line for up to \u00a327.6m. Last year, the Berkeley bosses were handed bonuses worth \u00a385m under the share scheme. Including salary and annual bonuses, the total payout was \u00a392m, with Pidgley getting \u00a329m and Perrins \u00a328m. Perrins said Brexit uncertainty and concerns over economic growth and inflation, coupled with changes to stamp duty, continued to drag on the housing market. \u201cThere remains good underlying demand for property in London and the south east, but the combination of uncertain UK economic and political outlook and high property taxation continues to mean customers are more circumspect and inevitably purchasing later in the development cycle,\u201d he said. He added that there was still good demand from overseas buyers, who were benefiting from the weaker pound. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cHigher stamp duty on premium properties, plus Brexit uncertainty and economic weakness, means the outlook for Berkeley\u2019s domestic buyers remains relatively uncertain. \u201cHowever, with selling prices typically over \u00a3700,000, Berkeley isn\u2019t dependent on the average Brit for sales. One of the main positives coming out of these results is that demand is holding up well among overseas buyers. \u201cAfter the initial panic following the Brexit vote, the group has consistently delivered impressive results. The longer this goes on, the more faith investors will have in Berkeley\u2019s generous shareholder returns programme, which looks set to see the group return another \u00a31bn over the next four years.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s announcement of a review into homebuilders\u2019 land banks and unused planning permits led to a selloff of shares of large firms including Berkeley after last month\u2019s budget, but they have largely recouped their losses since then. Housebuilders have been accused of sitting on land.",

Earlier this year, Berkeley capped future payouts under the scheme, which runs until 2021, after criticism from shareholders and advisory groups. </p> <p>This means Pidgley and his chief executive, Rob Perrins, will each get a maximum share award of \u00a38m a year, starting this year. The top five Berkeley executives can earn up to \u00a321.25m from the 2011 scheme this year. Including base salary and annual cash bonuses, they are in line for up to \u00a327.6m.</p> <p>Last year, the Berkeley bosses were handed bonuses worth \u00a385m under the share scheme. Including salary and annual bonuses, the total payout was \u00a392m, with Pidgley getting \u00a329m and Perrins \u00a328m.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Perrins said Brexit uncertainty and concerns over economic growth and inflation, coupled with changes to stamp duty, continued to drag on the housing market. </p> <p>\u201cThere remains good underlying demand for property in London and the south east, but the combination of uncertain UK economic and political outlook and high property taxation continues to mean customers are more circumspect and inevitably purchasing later in the development cycle,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He added that there was still good demand from overseas buyers, who were benefiting from the weaker pound.</p> <p>George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cHigher stamp duty on premium properties, plus Brexit uncertainty and economic weakness, means the outlook for Berkeley\u2019s domestic buyers remains relatively uncertain. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, with selling prices typically over \u00a3700,000, Berkeley isn\u2019t dependent on the average Brit for sales. One of the main positives coming out of these results is that demand is holding up well among overseas buyers. </p> <p>\u201cAfter the initial panic following the Brexit vote, the group has consistently delivered impressive results. The longer this goes on, the more faith investors will have in Berkeley\u2019s generous shareholder returns programme, which looks set to see the group return another \u00a31bn over the next four years.\u201d</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s announcement of a review into homebuilders\u2019 land banks and unused planning permits led to a selloff of shares of large firms including Berkeley after last month\u2019s budget, but they have largely recouped their losses since then. Housebuilders have been accused of sitting on land.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A couple of positive political developments helped push European markets higher, while Wall Street benefitted from the stronger than expected US jobs data. The Brexit breakthrough was welcomed by investors, and even the pound losing its early gains helped the UK market, packed as it is with overseas earners which are helped by a weak sterling. In Germany, hopes that the current impasse in forming a coalition government could be resolved lifted the Dax higher. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 73.21 points or 1% at 7393.96 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.83% to 13,153.70 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.28% higher at 5399.09 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 1.4% to 22,773.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.57% better at 10,321.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.64% to 740.72 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 102 points or 0.42% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The early excitement in the pound following the morning\u2019s Brexit news was well and truly short lived, and sterling is now down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3370. In the wake of the deal news it climbed as high as $1.3519. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: At the start of the session, sterling was gaining ground on the back of the announcement that the UK and the EU had made sufficient progress in the first phase talks, so it can now move onto the discussions about trade. The early positive momentum in sterling, ran out of steam and it then the pound turned negative \u2013 which propped up the FTSE 100. Part of the reason for the fall was the EU telling the UK that trade talks would not start until February. Ratings agency Fitch has also opined on the Brexit news from this morning, and like S&amp;P, says it has no immediate effect on its AA rating and negative outlook: The agreement between the UK and the EU to move to the next phase of Brexit negotiations is a step towards a potential agreement on Brexit and trade, but the process remains lengthy and challenging, and the deal leaves many key uncertainties unresolved... The progress report\u2019s carefully crafted language fails to clarify how the UK can achieve all three of its commitments to leave the EU single market and customs union, ensure Northern Ireland retains \u201cunfettered access\u201d to the UK internal market, and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It states that \u201cin the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which... support North-South cooperation\u201d. This would appear to maintain the status quo if a trade deal is not agreed, but we think it would be politically very difficult for the UK government to guarantee regulatory equivalence between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in this event. More broadly, the negotiation process leading up to today\u2019s announcement has strained UK domestic politics, highlighting how June\u2019s general election has weakened policy cohesion, reflecting divisions in parliament and among the UK public regarding the desired post-Brexit relationship with the EU, and meaning the final outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. Fitch concludes: Overall, today\u2019s announcement does not alter the view we expressed when we affirmed the UK\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating in October, that the complexity of the issues, the magnitude of national interests at stake, the lack of a clear UK position, the EU\u2019s negotiating stance, and the limited timeframe will make it challenging for the UK to secure a favourable trade agreement. The Negative Outlook on the rating reflects the uncertainty and corresponding downside economic and fiscal risks. Any bursting of the Bitcoin bubble is unlikely to have a major impact on the global economy, says Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s Andrew Kenningham says: Unlike the bubbles in the tech sector in the late-1990s and in US residential property a few years later, a bursting of the bitcoin bubble should not have systemic, macroeconomic implications. The total value of bitcoin is (still) too small, and it has few links with the wider economy. ...As with many start-ups, the \u201ctrue\u201d value of bitcoin is unknown because it is unclear whether it has a long- term future. But we doubt that any cryptocurrency will become a serious rival to the dollar or other major fiat currencies, many of which have centuries of history behind them and the backing of governments and central banks. Also, technological problems, fraud or tighter regulation may undermine bitcoin. And even if cryptocurrencies in general have a future, one of bitcoin\u2019s numerous competitors, or a central bank digital currency, could kill it off just as plenty of early rivals to Facebook and Google were sunk without trace. Given this uncertainty, it makes sense that bitcoin is often compared to the famous Dutch tulip bubble. Like bitcoin, tulips became popular \u201cbecause of their strangeness and rarity\u201d and because they were new, having arrived from the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century. Their prices rose astronomically between 1634 and 1637 and then collapsed. But the crash apparently had little impact on the Dutch economy. There are several channels through which a bursting asset price bubble can, in principle, have macroeconomic consequences, but none are a major risk in the case of bitcoin. First, there may be a hit to household spending as people who have invested suffer losses. But bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation is too small for this to be a worry. It is currently around $240bn, which is much smaller than the total value of gold outstanding ($8trn) or the value of Apple ($0.9trn). If the price of bitcoin fell to zero today, the paper losses would be equivalent to a 0.6% fall in US equity prices. As most investors have bought bitcoin at much lower prices, the relevant losses would arguably be smaller. While a bursting bubble can affect the economy via the banking sector, this is not much of a risk either, precisely because bitcoin is held and traded outside the banking sector. Also, there is no evidence that people are taking out huge, sub-prime mortgages to finance their speculation in cryptocurrencies. A slump in bitcoin prices should not have much effect on wider investor and business confidence either. As we have pointed out elsewhere, there is no correlation between the prices of bitcoin and other risky assets, so a fall in its price should not affect wider financial conditions. And nor would it tell us anything about wider market sentiment. Back with Bitcoin, and JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon - a notable critic of the cryptocurrency - has been commenting again. He told CNBC: US consumer confidence has slipped back compared to last month, partly due to Democrat voters concerned about the effects of the proposed tax changes. The University of Michigan\u2019s initial consumer sentiment reading for December has come in at 96.8, compared to November\u2019s 98.5 and expectations of a rise to 99. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment has remained quite favorable although it continued to slowly recede in early December from its October cyclical peak. Most of the recent decline was concentrated in the long-term prospects for the economy, while consumers thought current economic conditions have continued to improve. Importantly, the largest decline in long-term economic prospects was recorded among Democrats, which reflected their concerns about the impact of the proposed changes in taxes. Perhaps the most important changes in early December were higher income expectations as well as a higher expected inflation rate in 2018. Income gains have been slowly improving during the past year, and the data indicate that trend has continued. In contrast, the rise in inflation expectations in early December was a surprise, and confidence in this finding must await confirmation in the months ahead before any inferences are drawn. Buying plans for durables have improved in early December, largely due to attractive pricing, in contrast to the rise in the expected inflation rate. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.7% in real consumption expenditures in 2018. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is about to begin a round of talks in the US aimed at the debt-stricken country re-accessing markets next year. Helena Smith reports: After eight years of being exiled from international capital markets, Greece hopes to refinance itself for the first time in nearly a decade when its third international bailout programme expires next August. The politics of regaining market access are expected to dominate discussions Tsakalotos is to have in the US, starting today. Auditors representing the European creditors that have kept Greece afloat are also there. The Marxist economist, who has allowed pragmatism to prevail over ideology in his job as finance minister, will be the keynote speaker in the annual Capital Link Invest in Greece Forum on Monday. Interestingly, he has been selected to ring the closing bell at the NYSE on Tuesday. Insiders are interpreting the move as an incipient signal of renewed optimism in the Greek economy. As for that jobs data, it continues its record breaking run: The better than expected jobs data has seen a positive opening on Wall Street, while European markets continue to be buoyed - partly - by the day\u2019s Brexit news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 70 points or 0.29%, with a US rate rise next week now seen as virtually inevitable despite the weaker than expected wages growth. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.37% and the Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.7% Elsewhere the FTSE 100 has climbed 0.87%, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.44%. Over at Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency is now down around 8% at $15,200. Back with Brexit, and S&amp;P Global Ratings says the UK\u2019s credit rating at AA and its negative outlook is not immediately affected by this morning\u2019s deal. It says: The EC has announced that the UK has made \u201csufficient progress\u201d in the first phase of the Brexit talks, which now paves the way for the EC to formally open the next phase in its summit on December 14 and 15. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has signalled that a final agreement will have to be reached by October 2018. This leaves only 10 months for the UK to agree with the EU a framework for their future relationship, including a trade deal, and transitional arrangements. A final agreement will have to be approved by 27 national parliaments ahead of the March 2019 exit date. While sufficient progress has been made during the first phase, many issues are yet to be fully resolved. The situation is further challenged by the UK\u2019s slowing domestic economy, the lack of a parliamentary majority, and by the absence of consensus within the government on the shape of the final relationship with the EU. Indeed, these considerations contributed to the slow progress during the first phase of negotiations. The negative outlook reflects the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU after the country\u2019s departure from the bloc in March 2019. The dollar is dipping after the weaker than expected US wage growth outweighed the stronger jobs figures. But economists believe that wage weakness will not deter the Federal Reserve from raising US interest rates at its meeting next week. James Smith at ING Bank said: For markets, a further disappointment in wage growth will be the key takeaway from today\u2019s data. November\u2019s growth in average hourly earnings came in below consensus at 0.2%, following a downward revision to October\u2019s figure, although it\u2019s still probably worth taking these numbers with a pinch of salt. Back in September, the job losses from the hurricanes were highly concentrated in low-wage sectors, and taking them temporarily out of the sample artificially boosted the average level of pay. November\u2019s disappointment could simply be a further correction to this blip. A similar logic can probably be applied to the payrolls numbers. On the face of it, a 228,000 increase in jobs during November looks good, but at least some of this is probably down to people returning to work after the disruption. Either way though, policymakers are less bothered by jobs growth these days - they know that the rate of employment growth should be expected to slow as the remaining slack in the economy erodes. Given all the noise, the Fed will most likely write off this latest jobs report. Wage growth was disappointing, but given the sheer strength of the jobs market, we would still expect pay to accelerate gradually through next year. More broadly, we agree with the Fed\u2019s assertion that most of this year\u2019s inflation dip was \u2018transitory\u2019. Throw in 3% economic growth next year, as well as the hawkish rotation in regional Fed voters, and we expect a rate hike next week to be followed by three more in 2018. A stronger than expected rise in non-farm payrolls has reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. Paul Ashwell, chief US economist at Capital Economics, gives his view: The slightly bigger than expected 228,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in November all but guarantees another 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Fed next week, particularly with the unemployment rate unchanged at an unusually low 4.1%. The 228,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month was driven by job creation in professional services, manufacturing, and health care, the US Labor Department said. The department gave some context behind its recent revisions, which it said painted a brighter picture overall: The change in total non-farm payroll employment for September was revised up from +18,000 to +38,000, and the change for October was revised down from +261,000 to +244,000. With these revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 3,000 more than previously reported. After revisions, job gains have averaged 170,000 over the last 3 months. Non-farm payrolls rose by 228,000 in November, beating expectations of 200,000. But the figure for October was revised down to 244,000 from an earlier estimate of 261,000. The jobless rate was unchanged at 4.1%, while average earnings increased by 0.2%, following a 0.1% fall in October. It was below expectations of a 0.3% pick-up in pay. The pound is now down against both the dollar and the euro, after rising earlier in the day against both currencies. The relief rally prompted by progress on Brexit talks appears to have faded away. The pound is down 0.5% against the dollar, at $1.3405, and down 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1409. Back to Brexit, and the Institute of Directors says firms are breathing \u201ca huge sigh of relief\u201d after talks progressed. Stephen Martin, director general, adds: The most pressing concern for UK companies has been their EU staff, who have urgently needed certainty about their future in this country. We have grounds to hope now that our members will be able to send their employees off for the Christmas break feeling more comfortable about their status here. We call on the UK and EU to build on this positive momentum going into the new year. It is overwhelmingly in the interests of both sides to begin working on our future economic relationship - particularly in order to fully address the Irish question. And we look forward to further clarity about what the UK\u2019s objectives are for that new relationship as well as a firm commitment on transition in the very near future. The US Commerce Department is due to publish the non-farm payrolls report for November at 1.30pm UK time. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting that the US economy created 200,000 jobs last month, down from 261,000 in October. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.1%. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says: When it comes to the US jobs report, the devil is always in the detail so keep an eye out for revisions to previous reports. The average earnings figures will be closely watched too. On a monthly basis, average earnings are expected to jump to 0.3% from 0.0%, and on year-on-year basis it is anticipated to rise to 2.5% from 2.4%. Wage growth has been lagging behind that of job creation growth, and we will need to see a steady rise in earnings if the US economy wants to have a sustainable recovery. Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in the three months to October, figures published earlier by the ONS show. The UK continues to import more from the EU and the rest of the world than it exports to other countries. Excluding some commodities such as gold shipped in and out of London, which statisticians say can distort the figures, the UK\u2019s trade in goods and deficit widened by \u00a3800m to \u00a36.9bn in the three months to October. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to November. That would be an slight improvement on the 0.4% growth achieved in the third quarter, between July and September. Amit Kara, head of UK forecasting at the think tank, said growth was being driven by the services sector and industrial production, while construction remained under pressure. He added: UK economic activity has picked-up in the second half of this year and GDP growth at 0.5 per cent is somewhat higher than the economy\u2019s speed limit. If, as we expect, the economy continues to expand around this pace and inflation remains elevated, there is a case for the Bank of England to gradually raise the policy rate to stop the economy from overheating. Consistent with that view, our latest forecast for the UK is conditioned on a 25 basis points increase in Bank Rate every six months such that the policy rate reaches 2 per cent in 2021. The pound is still up against the euro at \u20ac1.1463 after this morning\u2019s Brexit breakthrough, but it has failed to hold on to earlier gains against the dollar, because the US currency is also performing well on tax plan hopes. Gold is another victim of the dollar\u2019s strength: UK Finance, the banking industry\u2019s trade body, says most of the hard work on Brexit - the aspects that will determine decisions on jobs - is yet to be done. Stephen Jones, chief executive: Today\u2019s announcement is certainly a positive step, making important progress in the negotiations and bringing a welcome and significant clarity on the rights of EU citizens living and working in the UK. But the agreement on phase one issues is just the start - we now need to see the detail and further action on those issues that will determine the real impact of Brexit on the economy, consumers and jobs. Businesses need to see clear progress in the New Year on the future trading relationship and how we will transition to any new arrangements to ensure we can continue to meet the needs of customers. Kathrin Muehlbronner, lead sovereign analyst for the UK at Moody\u2019s, says Brexit progress is currently panning out as the ratings agency expected, with the toughest challenges ahead: The announcement this morning that the UK and the EU have reached \u201csufficient\u201d progress in the withdrawal negotiations is in line with what we expected. We expect the EU summit on 14-15 December to endorse the Commission\u2019s recommendation, meaning that negotiations will now move on to finding agreements on a transition period and a new trade relationship. Our baseline scenario assumes that the two sides will agree on a two-year transition period beyond March 2019, that will give some additional time to find a reasonably good new free trade arrangement. But it is clear that these negotiations will likely be even more difficult than those just concluded on the principles of the UK\u2019s withdrawal. UK construction output fell 1.7% in October, coming in well below economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.4% rise. The fall was driven by a drop in both new work and in repair and maintenance. The ONS explains: Construction output fell by \u00a3211 million compared with September 2017. As in the three-month on three-month series, the fall stems primarily from a decrease in repair and maintenance, with non-housing repair and maintenance falling by \u00a373 million. Private housing also provided a notable drag on output, also decreasing by \u00a373 million. Elsewhere, private commercial work also fell sharply, decreasing for the second consecutive month, falling by \u00a358 million in October 2017. The only positive contributions to the month-on-month construction output came from infrastructure and private industrial work, which grew by \u00a336 million and \u00a314 million respectively. The City of London has welcomed the breakthrough in Brexit talks, saying \u201cChristmas has come early\u201d for financial firms. Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation: Christmas has come early for financial firms with the news that Brexit negotiations can now move to Phase 2. Government has made a bold but necessary step forward. But the hard work starts now. The UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU will mark one of the most important pieces of legislation in a century \u2013 it is vital we get it right first time. The new trading relationship should be based on a free trade agreement, introducing a joint dispute resolution body and mechanisms for mutual market access. It would be based on regulatory alignment between the UK and EU with both parties working together to implement new global and international standards, replacing existing regulatory frameworks. It is essential that government makes clear its aim to implement a transitional deal, clarifying exact timelines of when the transition phase will begin, what rules will apply to the UK in the interim and we need an indication of when the sector can expect to adopt the new rules. Industrial production should still make a positive contribution to UK growth in the fourth quarter, despite failing to grow month-on-month in October. That\u2019s the view of Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics, based on the sector\u2019s rolling quarterly performance: Industrial production fell short of the stellar pace indicated by some of the surveys. Indeed, output merely held steady in October and manufacturing output posted only a small 0.1% monthly gain. Nonetheless, this was probably always to be expected after September\u2019s strong monthly rise in both manufacturing and overall production. And the three-month industrial production growth rate remained at a still-strong 1.1%, suggesting that the sector is still on track to provide solid support to growth in Q4. The rise and fall of UK industrial production since before the financial crisis: Industrial production was flat in October, following a 0.7% increase in September. The weak performance was the result of a warmer than usual October according to the Office for National Statistics, because it resulted in a 3.3% fall in energy supply. The ONS explains: Within this sector, gas distribution and supply fell by 7.6%, the warmer than average temperature in October 2017 contributed to this fall. The Met Office reported that the provisional UK mean temperature was 11.3 degrees Celsius, which was 1.8 degrees Celsius above the 1981 to 2010 long-term average. Manufacturing output - the biggest contributor to overall production - managed to scrape growth of just 0.1%. Kate Davies, ONS senior statistician, said the longer-term picture was positive. While manufacturing was relatively subdued overall in October despite record production of cars destined for export, the longer-term picture is one of strong growth. Bitcoin dipped below $15,000, having surged ahead on Thursday. It is currently down 10% at $14,951. Piers Morgan is taking guidance on Bitcoin from veteran investor Warren Buffet: The dollar is on track for its biggest weekly rise in nearly six weeks as optimism grows that Trump\u2019s tax bill will pass. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of currencies, is up 0.2% at 93.95. It is up more than 1% over the week, its biggest rise since late October. Reuters explains: US Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill before self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline. Passage of the tax bill and strong data would strengthen the case for more US rate increases in the next year, a possibility which bond markets look unprepared for. The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates next week, but futures markets expect less than two rate hikes over the next year. Britain\u2019s manufacturers echo the BCC\u2019s sentiments, with trade body EEF saying there are trickier negotiations ahead: Stephen Phipson, chief executive of EEF: Companies are relieved there is progress in the negotiations. But this is one step forward in a complex and long process. So we need to pin down the transition arrangements, which will be in place after March 2019, to ensure it\u2019s business as usual for companies for as long as it takes until a final deal is reached. Until we get to that point, many businesses will need to prepare for any and every eventuality. Many employers will be relieved that their EU employees have more certainty going forward, and government must now clarify the rights of EU citizens by Christmas so that they are not concerned about their future. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed this morning\u2019s breakthrough in Brexit talks, but has warned urgent progress must now be made on a trade deal with the EU, to allow UK businesses to plan for future. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC: Businesses will be breathing a sigh of relief that \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 has been achieved. After the noise and political brinksmanship of recent days, news of a breakthrough in the negotiations will be warmly welcomed by companies across the UK. For business, a swift start to trade talks is crucial to upcoming investment and growth decisions. Companies all across the UK want absolute clarity on the long-term deal being sought, and want government to work closely with business experts to ensure that the details are right. Businesses want answers on what leaving the EU will mean for regulation, customs, hiring, standards, tariffs and taxes. The job of the UK government and the European Commission now is to provide those answers \u2013 and do everything in their power to ensure vibrant cross-border trade between the UK and EU countries can continue. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says the pound is benefiting from the Brexit \u201cfudge\u201d in Brussels: The Brussels fudge that May and Juncker have served up this morning has gone down a treat for sterling. The pound is trading up against almost all major partners, and has reached a six month high against the euro. This morning\u2019s deal looks like a classic eurozone can kicking exercise. It\u2019s now clear that Britain is seeking an agreement on regulatory alignment that will mean the overarching UK wide deal will satisfy Northern Ireland\u2019s requirements. But in the plausible scenario where such a deal is not reached, today\u2019s fudge hinges on Britain coming up with unspecified \u201cspecific solutions\u201d that will avoid a hard border in Ireland. Regardless of any future difficulties, for now the news is very positive, and next week\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit will conclude in celebrations, which the pound has already kicked off this morning. The pound climbed above \u20ac1.15 to the highest level in six months after that crucial agreement on the Irish border, which paves the way to the start of trade talks. The FTSE 100 is roughly flat in early trading, lagging behind its counterparts in the rest of Europe which are all firmly higher this morning after that Brexit breakthrough. The UK\u2019s leading index tends to take a knock from a stronger pound as the listed multinationals make a large proportion of earnings abroad. Here are the scores so far: FTSE 100: +0.04% at 7,323 Germany\u2019s DAX: 0.8% at 13,144 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 5,413 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.9% at 22,669 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 10,333 Europe\u2019s STOXX: +0.7% at 389 For all the latest developments on the Brexit negotiations in Brussels, follow our politics live blog: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has received a boost this morning from the news of an overnight breakthrough in Brussels on the Irish border talks. The European Commission said \u201csufficient progress\u201d had been made in the first phase of Brexit talks, paving the way for talks to begin on Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. The pound is up 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1482, and up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3517. So traders are not getting too carried away, and rightly so according to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, who cautioned that phase one was the easy part: We all know that breaking up is hard. But breaking up and building a new relationship is harder. Away from Brexit talks, it\u2019s non-farm payrolls day in the US...

It states that \u201cin the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which... support North-South cooperation\u201d. This would appear to maintain the status quo if a trade deal is not agreed, but we think it would be politically very difficult for the UK government to guarantee regulatory equivalence between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in this event.</p> <p>More broadly, the negotiation process leading up to today\u2019s announcement has strained UK domestic politics, highlighting how June\u2019s general election has weakened policy cohesion, reflecting divisions in parliament and among the UK public regarding the desired post-Brexit relationship with the EU, and meaning the final outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. </p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, today\u2019s announcement does not alter the view we expressed when we affirmed the UK\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating in October, that the complexity of the issues, the magnitude of national interests at stake, the lack of a clear UK position, the EU\u2019s negotiating stance, and the limited timeframe will make it challenging for the UK to secure a favourable trade agreement.

The consultancy\u2019s Andrew Kenningham says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike the bubbles in the tech sector in the late-1990s and in US residential property a few years later, a bursting of the bitcoin bubble should not have systemic, macroeconomic implications. The total value of bitcoin is (still) too small, and it has few links with the wider economy.</p> <p>...As with many start-ups, the \u201ctrue\u201d value of bitcoin is unknown because it is unclear whether it has a long- term future. But we doubt that any cryptocurrency will become a serious rival to the dollar or other major fiat currencies, many of which have centuries of history behind them and the backing of governments and central banks. Also, technological problems, fraud or tighter regulation may undermine bitcoin. And even if cryptocurrencies in general have a future, one of bitcoin\u2019s numerous competitors, or a central bank digital currency, could kill it off just as plenty of early rivals to Facebook and Google were sunk without trace.</p> <p>Given this uncertainty, it makes sense that bitcoin is often compared to the famous Dutch tulip bubble. Like bitcoin, tulips became popular \u201cbecause of their strangeness and rarity\u201d and because they were new, having arrived from the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century. Their prices rose astronomically between 1634 and 1637 and then collapsed. But the crash apparently had little impact on the Dutch economy.</p> <p>There are several channels through which a bursting asset price bubble can, in principle, have macroeconomic consequences, but none are a major risk in the case of bitcoin.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f24157485aad1b3f352967cbbd87973e09b699e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f24157485aad1b3f352967cbbd87973e09b699e5/0_3_700_467/500.jpg\" alt=\"bitcoincap8dec\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>First, there may be a hit to household spending as people who have invested suffer losses. But bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation is too small for this to be a worry. It is currently around $240bn, which is much smaller than the total value of gold outstanding ($8trn) or the value of Apple ($0.9trn). If the price of bitcoin fell to zero today, the paper losses would be equivalent to a 0.6% fall in US equity prices. As most investors have bought bitcoin at much lower prices, the relevant losses would arguably be smaller.</p> <p>While a bursting bubble can affect the economy via the banking sector, this is not much of a risk either, precisely because bitcoin is held and traded outside the banking sector. Also, there is no evidence that people are taking out huge, sub-prime mortgages to finance their speculation in cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>A slump in bitcoin prices should not have much effect on wider investor and business confidence either. As we have pointed out elsewhere, there is no correlation between the prices of bitcoin and other risky assets, so a fall in its price should not affect wider financial conditions. And nor would it tell us anything about wider market sentiment. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a2aafeb32ead406c97141df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T15:31:28.079Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Bitcoin, and JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/bitcoin-fraud-jp-morgan-cryptocurrency-drug-dealers\">a notable critic of the cryptocurrency</a> - has been commenting again.

James Smith at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For markets, a further disappointment in wage growth will be the key takeaway from today\u2019s data. November\u2019s growth in average hourly earnings came in below consensus at 0.2%, following a downward revision to October\u2019s figure, although it\u2019s still probably worth taking these numbers with a pinch of salt. Back in September, the job losses from the hurricanes were highly concentrated in low-wage sectors, and taking them temporarily out of the sample artificially boosted the average level of pay. November\u2019s disappointment could simply be a further correction to this blip.</p> <p>A similar logic can probably be applied to the payrolls numbers. On the face of it, a 228,000 increase in jobs during November looks good, but at least some of this is probably down to people returning to work after the disruption. Either way though, policymakers are less bothered by jobs growth these days - they know that the rate of employment growth should be expected to slow as the remaining slack in the economy erodes.</p> <p>Given all the noise, the Fed will most likely write off this latest jobs report. Wage growth was disappointing, but given the sheer strength of the jobs market, we would still expect pay to accelerate gradually through next year. More broadly, we agree with the Fed\u2019s assertion that most of this year\u2019s inflation dip was \u2018transitory\u2019. Throw in 3% economic growth next year, as well as the hawkish rotation in regional Fed voters, and we expect a rate hike next week to be followed by three more in 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a2a98abeca6e706a5519efa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T14:01:04.980Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US jobs report paves way for Fed rate hike next week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A stronger than expected rise in non-farm payrolls has reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. </p> <p><strong>Paul Ashwell</strong>, chief US economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, gives his view:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The slightly bigger than expected 228,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in November all but guarantees another 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Fed next week, particularly with the unemployment rate unchanged at an unusually low 4.1%.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a2a957d24e47405c4d716cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T13:41:41.418Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The 228,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month was driven by job creation in professional services, manufacturing, and health care, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">US Labor Department </a>said.</p> <p>The department gave some context behind its recent revisions, which it said painted a brighter picture overall:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The change in total non-farm payroll employment for September was revised up from +18,000 to +38,000, and the change for October was revised down from +261,000 to +244,000. </p> <p>With these revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 3,000 more than previously reported.

      "bodyText": "The US job market appears to have bounced back from the devastating storms that struck Florida and Texas in the autumn, adding 228,000 jobs in November as the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1%. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma set off huge swings in job-creation numbers, released each month by the labor department, causing a sharp slowdown in September followed by a strong rebound in October. The news is likely to ensure that the Federal Reserve will vote to raise interest rates when it meets next week. If the Fed acts as expected, it will be the third rate rise this year as the central bank moves away from its policy of keeping rates close to zero that it imposed after the recession. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist for Capital Economics, said the latest jobs numbers \u201call but guarantees\u201d another rate hike by the Fed next week Economists had been expecting the US to add 200,000 new jobs in November. On Wednesday ADP, the largest private payrolls company, said private companies had added 190,000 jobs in November with a strong showing for manufacturers, who hired 40,000 new workers. \u201cThe labor market continues to grow at a solid pace,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice-president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u201cNotably, manufacturing added the most jobs the industry has seen all year. As the labor market continues to tighten and wages increase it will become increasingly difficult for employers to attract and retain skilled talent.\u201d While the US continues to add jobs at a steady pace, issues remain. The unemployment rate for white Americans (3.6%) is half that of African Americans (7.3 %). Unemployment for US teenagers stands at 15.9%. Wage growth has lagged behind the recovery in the jobs market that followed the Great Recession. In November average hourly earnings for private sector employees rose 5\u00a2 to $26.55. Over the year wages have risen just 2.5%, a tepid pace of growth and below economists\u2019 forecasts. Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economics Policy Institute, said the latest report showed that the economy was on the right track but added that problems remained and the Fed should think twice before raising rates. \u201cThe economy needs to get back to full employment for all workers \u2013 young and old, black and white \u2013 to feel the positive effects of a growing economy with better opportunities and faster wage growth,\u201d she said. The impact of last autumn\u2019s hurricanes appears smaller than first anticipated. The storms shut down large parts of Texas and the labor department initially calculated that the US had lost 33,000 jobs over September, the first time in seven years that the US monthly total had recorded a fall. After reassessing the numbers, the US now believes the economy actually added 38,000 new jobs over the month.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s car factories are helping drive the country\u2019s manufacturing production to its longest period of growth in more than 20 years, according to government figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said cars made for export and a bumper month for pharmaceutical firms helped output grow for the sixth month in a row in October \u2013 the longest unbroken period of manufacturing growth since 1994. A growth rate of 0.1% in manufacturing production in October pushed the annual rate of expansion to 3.9% and confirmed the manufacturing sector\u2019s status as one of the brightest areas in the UK economy this year. The last time manufacturers stitched together an unbroken run of five months was from December 2013 to May in the following year, the ONS said. However, some economists warned that October\u2019s growth rate fell short of the expansion seen during the summer, fuelling fears the UK economy is on course to grow at the slowest pace in the G7 next year. Uncertainty about the outcome of talks with Brussels over the country\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU is also expected to dampen investment and consumer confidence, despite a deal to discuss trade as part of a move to a second phase of Brexit talks. Growth in overall industrial production, which includes output from mines, quarries, the oil and gas industry and energy plants, ground to a halt after warmer weather allowed power companies to cut production. Data from the construction industry showed a dramatic drop in activity while official figures covering Britain\u2019s trade with the rest of the world revealed a longstanding deficit widened in October. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said business surveys were consistent with solid growth in manufacturing output in the near-term. \u201cBut past experience suggests that the impetus to growth in manufacturing output from the weaker exchange rate will fade soon, now that 18 months have passed since the biggest decline in sterling.\u201d Economists at Barclays said weak performance in the industry and construction sectors pointed to a 0.1 percentage-point drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter. The Bank of England said last month it expected the economy to grow by 0.4% in the last three months of the year and to expand by 1.6% in 2018, after it raised its key interest rate for the first time since 2007. Business surveys show factories are enjoying demand from a surging European economy, but also face an increase in price pressures because of the weak pound. The ONS senior statistician Kate Davies gave an upbeat assessment of the outlook for manufacturing. She said: \u201cWhile manufacturing was relatively subdued overall in October 2017 despite record production of cars destined for export, the longer-term picture is one of strong growth.\u201d Car manufacturers increased production by 6.3% in October compared with the same month a year ago, driven by an increase in export turnover. Firms recorded the highest ever value of exports last month, worth more than \u00a34bn. The ONS also said Britain benefited from increased production at two oil fields that started pumping in June \u2013 the new Kraken field in the North Sea, as well as the return of the Schiehallion field \u2013 110 miles west of Shetland \u2013 which had been shut for refurbishment since 2013. Britain continues to import more from the EU and the rest of the world than it exports to other countries. Excluding some commodities such as gold shipped in and out of London, which statisticians say can distort the figures, the UK\u2019s trade deficit widened by \u00a3800m to \u00a36.9bn in the three months to October.",

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes Coral\u2019s bosses will try to sound cheerful about the prospect of being taken over by GVC Holdings, the company behind Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo. But, on the long view, this deal would be a corporate humiliation. Ladbrokes is one of the oldest names in British bookmaking and still collects the largest revenues. It traces its roots to 1886 and, under chairman Cyril Stein, boomed after the legalisation of betting shops in 1961. When Stein retired in 1993, the company, with a collection of Hilton hotels at a time, was worth \u00a32bn. Now, a quarter of century later and with Coral on board, it is in discussions to surrender for just \u00a33.1bn, plus a potential \u00a3800m kicker, to an Isle of Man-based company that was worth only \u00a3100m five years ago. David, after bulking up with a few deals, is bidding for Goliath. There\u2019s no point blaming the current crop of Ladbrokes\u2019 managers. It was their predecessors who were late to the starting gate in the digital Derby. Ladbrokes flapped around ineffectually trying to build in-house technology, lost ground online and has only recently picked up the pace. Other failures included loading up with so much debt in the pre-financial crash years that a \u00a3286m rights issue was required when recession arrived in 2009. Were Ladbrokes directors luxuriating in the easy money from their electronic roulette wheels, or were they just poor at executing online? Probably both. Last year\u2019s merger with Coral gave Ladbrokes greater size, but only increased the appeal for the acquisitive GVC. Thursday\u2019s outline deal is the fruit of the third set of talks. From Ladbrokes\u2019 point of view, the best that can be said is that the proposed terms are better than those previously rumoured. The basic price is 161p versus 140p. As importantly, GVC last month agreed a deal to sell its business in Turkey, where online gambling is illegal. That allowed it to present itself to Ladbrokes as more of a regular company with operations in regulated markets. That points to another aspect of the shift in corporate power in the internet era: newcomers were happy to shoulder the risk of operating in so-called \u201cgrey\u201d markets, but the old guard were understandably shy. In the end, the upstarts got the better of the gamble. European countries have generally dealt with the rise of online operators by taxing and regulating. After exiting Turkey, GVC\u2019s regulated and \u201cregulating\u201d revenues will be 75% of its total. Buying Ladbrokes, which is virtually 100% regulated, would make the regulatory risks almost minimal. GVC is accepting a different type of risk by getting into physical betting shops for the first time but it has an odd but neat solution to the government\u2019s review of the machines. Ladbrokes shareholders will get \u201ccontingent value rights\u201d that will pay out between zero and 42.8p depending on how far machine stakes are reduced. Both sets of shareholders seem happy \u2013 Ladbrokes\u2019 shares rose 29%, GVC\u2019s 8% \u2013 so the deal looks to be on. To spare its corporate blushes, Ladbrokes could say that the offer is mostly in shares and its shareholders will end up in a company that will be one of the world\u2019s largest gambling groups. Given past upsets, that\u2019s not the worst outcome. Yet it could have been better. Stein, who died in 2011, built Ladbrokes by opening shops harder and faster than his rivals. Then the internet changed the game. Bitcoin bubble: back to the future Sir Howard Davis is right. As the bitcoin mania becomes truly silly, it would be helpful to hear central bankers and regulators shouting more loudly about risks to investors. If officials have been fearful of coming across as luddites, it\u2019s time to wake up. Citizens also want to know that the back door of the financial system hasn\u2019t been left open for fraudsters and money-launderers. And do regulators really approve of plans by two Chicago exchanges to make it easier to speculate on Bitcoin? It\u2019s hard to believe they do. Regulators pushed to make financial markets more transparent after the banking crisis. The impending launch of Bitcoin futures would seem to run in the opposite direction. An old-fashioned price crash would cool the market faster than anything regulators can say, of course. But the timing of that event is impossible to predict. The bitcoin bubble has become a global phenomenon, and comparisons with past manias may be irrelevant. Keep it together A US hedge fund called Sachem Head has taken a 3.4% stake in Whitbread, provoking muttering that it may lobby to break up the Costa Coffee and Premier Inn group. Sachem hasn\u2019t said a thing, note, but the Whitbread chief executive, Alison Brittain, should be prepared to apply common sense. Starbucks may trade on a fancy stock market rating, but that doesn\u2019t mean an independent Costa would. There are only two moving parts at Whitbread: it shouldn\u2019t be hard for investors to value the company in its current form.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct and its employment agencies Best Connection and Transline have been named and shamed by the government for paying workers less than the legal minimum wage, underpaying them by nearly \u00a31m. The companies make up three of the top four underpayers in the latest list published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). This list names 260 employers which failed to pay a record 16,000 workers a combined total of \u00a31.7m. Primark is the third biggest offender in value terms and the biggest in terms of number of staff, after it underpaid 9,735 workers by \u00a3230,000. The cut-price clothing chain\u2019s underpayment relates to a demand that all staff wear black clothing. HM Revenue &amp; Customs said this policy amounted to a uniform and a deduction from pay to cover the clothing took pay below the legal minimum. Primark has since introduced a more flexible policy and provides some clothing free. A Primark spokesperson said: \u201cThe average amount paid back per employee was \u00a323.75 and relates to a workwear policy that was changed in 2016.\u201d Primark said a small proportion of the underpayment also related to administration costs levied on pay packets linked to a duty to deduct money which the courts had ruled some employees owed, such as child maintenance. The name and shame list also features several football clubs, including Bristol Rovers and Motherwell, and dozens of hairdressers. But it is the hospitality industry which is the worst offender. Upmarket establishments such as the Bedruthan in Cornwall and Ramside Estates, which owns Hardwick Hall and Ramside Hall near Durham \u2013 where a luxury room can cost up to \u00a3149 a night \u2013 are among 45 hotels, bars and restaurants named for underpaying. Scottish specialist windfarm contractor Edward Mackay underpaid four workers an average of \u00a312,850 each \u2013 the biggest underpayment per head. HMRC looked into Sports Direct and its employment agencies after a Guardian investigation exposed how Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal minimum. A spokesperson for Sports Direct said: \u201cThis matter relates to the historical situation in our warehouse that was widely publicised in 2016, for which we apologised at the time. \u201cWe cooperated fully with HMRC to make back payments to Sports Direct staff who were affected. We are committed to treating all our people with dignity and respect, and we pay above the national minimum wage. \u201cThe company is committed to the national minimum wage and has apologised to the employees concerned. It has also reviewed its procedures in order to avoid this situation reoccurring.\u201d The list revealed that Best Connection has repaid \u00a3469,273 to 2,558 workers; Qualitycourse, trading as Transline, has repaid \u00a3310,302 to 1,421 workers; and Sports Direct has repaid \u00a3167,036.24 to 383 workers \u2013 amounting to \u00a3946,611 in total. But it is clear that HMRC did not levy the biggest fine possible on Sports Direct \u2013 which would amount to double the wages owed, nearly \u00a32m. The 260 companies named were forced to pay a total of \u00a31.3m in fines between them. The business minister Margot James said: \u201cThere is no excuse for not paying staff the wages they\u2019re entitled to and the government will come down hard on businesses that break the rules.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cToday\u2019s list should put the frighteners on rogue employers across the country. Pay your staff properly or face hefty fines and get shamed in the papers.\u201d Some companies blamed the complexity of minimum wage rules for their underpayments. Bedruthan and Ramside Estates said they had not intended to underpay. A spokesperson for Bedruthan said it paid hourly pay rates above the national minimum wage for all employees, regardless of age, and its underpayment related to live-in employees asking for services such as meals eaten at the hotel to be deducted automatically from their wages. \u201cHad the employees paid cash for those same services, the legislation would not have been breached,\u201d the company said. Bedruthan said it had put the correct system in place since 2015 and reimbursed everyone affected where possible. Ramside said its underpayment related to chefs working split shifts with a four-hour break in the middle of the day. John Adamson of Ramside Estates said: \u201cIt does seem that the hospitality industry is being particularly targeted and that we are being made a scapegoat in this instance.\u201d",

A spokesperson for Bedruthan said it paid hourly pay rates above the national minimum wage for all employees, regardless of age, and its underpayment related to live-in employees asking for services such as meals eaten at the hotel to be deducted automatically from their wages.</p> <p>\u201cHad the employees paid cash for those same services, the legislation would not have been breached,\u201d the company said. </p> <p>Bedruthan said it had put the correct system in place since 2015 and reimbursed everyone affected where possible.</p> <p>Ramside said its underpayment related to chefs working split shifts with a four-hour break in the middle of the day.</p> <p>John Adamson of Ramside Estates said: \u201cIt does seem that the hospitality industry is being particularly targeted and that we are being made a scapegoat in this instance.\u201d </p>",
