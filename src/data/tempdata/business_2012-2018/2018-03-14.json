      "bodyText": "And finally, Wall Street has closed lower for the third day running. Jitters over the possibility of a trade war with China saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average finish 247 points lower at 24,759.39, a drop of 1%. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.6%, while the Nasdaq dipped by 0.2%. Traders are now pondering the prospect of Larry Kudlow joining the White House; as a critic of tariffs, could he steer Trump away? Here\u2019s our news story about Kudlow\u2019s appointment: That\u2019s all for tonight. GW Three-quarters of the 30 stocks on the Dow Jones industrial average are now in the red, pulling the index down by 253 points, or just over 1%. Chemicals group DowDuPont is now leading the selloff, down 1.95%, followed by airline maker Boeing (-1.8%), consumer goods producer Johnson &amp; Johnson (-1.3%) and pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer. The prospect of an escalating trade war, involving China, is worrying Wall Street. Yesterday, it was reported that Donald Trump was seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60bn of Chinese imports, and could target the technology and telecommunications sectors. Boeing could be a major casualty if China retaliated, explained Richard Aboulafia of consulting firm Teal Group Corporation to the New York Times: The likelihood of retaliation by their biggest single market, China, elevates this from an irritant to potentially disastrous, if not catastrophic. \u201cA trade war is the simplest way to cut off this fantastic growth they have enjoyed.\u201d More here: Trump\u2019s Tariffs Make Boeing a Potential Target in a Trade War Donald Trump appears to have a new economic adviser, less than a week after Gary Cohn resigned, according to reports from America. CNBC is reporting that Larry Kudlow, the Wall Street economist-turned-TV commentator has accepted the post, and will be named on Thursday. Reuters has more info: Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Kudlow, a Republican who served as an economic adviser to former President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and also worked on Wall Street, had \u201ca very good chance\u201d at being selected to replace Cohn. Kudlow, an informal advisor to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, had criticized the president\u2019s decision last week to place steep tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, saying they would harm steel-consuming producers. Cohn also opposed the tariffs. But Trump said on Wednesday that Kudlow had \u201ccome around\u201d to view tariffs as a useful tool for renegotiating trade deals. After a bright start, the FTSE 100 ended the day down 6 points, or 0.1%. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 dipped by 0.15%. Trade war fears are swirling through the markets again, warns David Madden of CMC Markets. Growing fears of a trade war is weighing on US stocks, and indices like the Dow Jones are losing ground quickly. Dealers are fearful that China will react to President Trump\u2019s tariffs by imposing levies on the aerospace industry, and Boeing shares have taken a hit. Update: the markets are turning south, after Donald Trump threw more fuel on investors\u2019 trade war fears. Having opened higher, the Dow is now down almost 300 points in New York. Boeing, the aircraft maker, is driving the sell off. Europe has handed back its earlier gains too. This comes after Trump tweeted a threat to take more action on trade, amid speculation of new tariffs on China. European and US stock markets are mostly higher today. Despite the IFS\u2019s gloomy prognosis on Britain\u2019s finances, the FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip companies has gained 28 points, or 0.4%. Prudential is leading the way, up 6.5%, after announcing plans to split itself in two. Shares are also up across Europe, after ECB president Mario Draghi gave a dovish speech this morning. Draghi insisted that eurozone monetary policy \u2018will remain patient, persistent and prudent\u2019 - which weakened the euro, helping exporters. The US stock market has also opened a little higher, as traders tried to focus on economic fundamentals rather than the chaos in the White House following Rex Tillerson\u2019s sacking yesterday. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 report into the UK\u2019s finances: \u201cThe IFS today confirmed the further bad news working families face after nearly eight years of Tory economic failure. Despite the Chancellor\u2019s spin yesterday, the IFS has revealed that there may be \u00a330 billion of new tax rises and spending cuts to come. \u201cUnder the Tories, it won\u2019t be the richest who are hit by these tax rises and austerity cuts, but the poorest \u2013 largely families and children \u2013 who will bear the brunt of their heartless economic plans. \u201cThe next Labour government will end austerity and build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u201d In other news, American retail sales has fallen for the third month running. It\u2019s a small drop - just 0.1% in February - but also the third decline in a row, for the first time since 2012. Economist had expected a rise of 0.3%, so this may signal that US consumers aren\u2019t quite as optimistic as thought. The report shows that demand for big-ticket items, such as cars, declined. Here\u2019s our news story on the IFS\u2019s spring statement analysis: Breaking away from Britain\u2019s finances, we have bad news from the retail sector. Toys R Us is shutting all 100 of its UK stores after administrators failed to find a buyer for the collapsed retailer - meaning 3,000 jobs are being lost. Moorfields, who took control of Toys R Us late last month, has been unable to find a buyer for Toys R Us. Press Association has more details: It is thought that Moorfields will now begin a six-week \u201cwind down\u201d of the store estate. Moorfields will begin with the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores earmarked late last year, when Toys R Us pushed through a restructuring before its demise. An official announcement is expected later on Wednesday. Over in parliament, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are clashing over NHS spending (and other issues). My colleague Andy Sparrow is covering all the action in his Politics liveblog: The Treasury has responded to the IFS\u2019s analysis, pointing out that the deficit has fallen steadily in recent years. A spokesperson says: \u201cOur balanced approach has reduced the deficit while also cutting taxes for over 30 million people and investing in our vital public services. We are training more doctors, more schools are rated as outstanding and we are funding the second largest defence budget in NATO. Thanks to the hard work of the British people we will now see the first sustained fall in debt in 17 years.\u201d Yesterday, the Office for Budget Responsibility reported that Britain\u2019s current budget (day-to-day spending, rather than investment) will move into surplus in the next financial year. The IFS\u2019s verdict might come as a nasty surprise to readers of the Daily Express, who woke up to the promise of tax cuts today. But as the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg points out, some politicians have been suggesting taxes may have to rise to cover the NHS\u2019s demands : Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that Britain might actually need to raise more than \u00a340bn in extra taxes (\u00a330bn to eliminate the deficit, plus \u00a311bn to address the ageing population). That\u2019s a substantial bill for each adult: So much for Hammond\u2019s promise of light at the end of the tunnel.... Britain could avoid the need to hike taxes by \u00a330bn if it abandoned the aim of eliminating the deficit by the mid-2020s. Recent history shows that deficit reduction targets are more honoured in the breach than in the observance (George Osborne\u2019s original plan was to balance the books two years ago). The IFS\u2019s Carl Emmerson suspects that the government won\u2019t balance the books by 2025. But even if it doesn\u2019t, there are many \u201csignificant and politically difficult\u201d challenges to be addressed, given the rising spending needs, looming welfare cuts, pressure on public services, and Brexit. The IFS\u2019s Carl Emmerson is outlining how Britain\u2019s public sector has faced sustained pressures in recent years, with the health and prison services seeing particular strain. He\u2019s also showing how the ageing population will put more demands on public services, making it even harder to cut the deficit or resist tax rises. The IFS also remind us that three-quarters of the savings from welfare cuts announced since July 2015 have not yet hit (as Resolution pointed out earlier). The IFS\u2019s Paul Johnson ends his presentation by urging us all to focus on the reality of Britain\u2019s financial situation. Don\u2019t be lured by the \u201cspin and bluster of politicians on all sides\u201d who pretend there are easy solutions, that the promised land is just around the corner, or that they can reinvent the laws of economics, Johnson says, concluding: There aren\u2019t. It isn\u2019t. And they can\u2019t. The IFS\u2019s Helen Miller is tweeting some key points from the IFS\u2019s report - none of them are very pleasant reading, alas. The IFS has also warned that it will be difficult for the government to raise taxes, especially if Brexit drives EU citizens away. Director Paul Johnson says: He [Philip Hammond] has been unable to tackle the problems posed by the increasing numbers of self employed and company owner managers, who pay less tax than similarly remunerated employees: the cost of this is forecast to grow from a bit over \u00a310 billion now to around \u00a315 billion or so in five years time. He \u2013 like his predecessor \u2013 looks wholly unable to maintain the real value of fuel duties. By taking huge numbers of people out of the income tax net, while raising tax on those with the highest incomes, we have become very dependent on a very small number of taxpayers to pay a very large fraction of the overall tax bill. That may be desirable on distributional grounds, but it makes tax revenues very sensitive to the incomes and behaviour of a small number of people. If high paid jobs (and EU citizens, who are well represented among high earners in the UK) relocate elsewhere the consequences for the Exchequer will be severe. The IFS also reckons that \u201cdemographic pressures\u201d mean the government needs to find an extra \u00a311bn per year in 2025 to address extra health, pension and social care spending. Boom! The UK government needs to raise \u00a330bn in extra taxes in the years ahead to hit its budget deficit goals without slashing spending further, according to the IFS. Having analysed the spring statement, the thinktank has calculated that Philip Hammond faces a huge fiscal challenge when he draws up the Autumn budget. The IFS has calculated that the government needs to spend around \u00a314bn more just to stand still, and avoid shrinking the state. But, unless it raises \u00a318bn by squeezing spending or raises taxes, it will miss its goal of balancing the books by the middle of the next decade. That adds up to a real fiscal headache for the chancellor. IFS director Paul Johnson says: Just to avoid spending falling as a fraction of national income beyond 2019\u201320 he would need to find an additional \u00a314 billion a year, relative to current plans, by 2022-23. On the other hand if he really wants to eliminate the deficit by the mid 2020s he would need to find an additional \u00a318 billion or so of tax increases or spending cuts by the mid 2020s. Put these two together and on current forecasts, just keeping spending constant as a fraction of national income beyond 2019\u201320 and reaching budget balance by the mid-2020s would require tax rises of \u00a330 billion a year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is now presenting its verdict on the spring statement, at an event in London. Paul Johnson, IFS director, begins with a chilly warning that \u201cThe reality of the economic and fiscal challenges facing us ought to be at the very top of the news agenda\u201d. Johnson then outlines how Britain\u2019s economic future looks rather bleak: We have had the worst decade of growth since at least the last War. The economy is at least \u00a3300 billion smaller than we might have expected based on 2008 forecasts. Yet we are now supposed to be at capacity, with no potential to make up for any of that loss. What\u2019s more, growth projections remain very subdued. At no point in the next five years does the OBR believe that annual growth will exceed 1.5%. To put an even less positive gloss on the numbers, growth in GDP per capita is forecast to be less than 1% in each of the next five years, half the pre-crisis trend. Dismal productivity growth, dismal earnings growth and dismal economic growth are not just part of the history of the last decade, they appear to be the new normal. Amit Kara, Head of UK Macroeconomic Forecasting at the NIESR thinktank, argues that Philip Hammond missed a trick yesterday, by not doing more to protect the UK economy from Brexit. An urgent action point might be to create a range of shovel-ready projects across the country and specifically in regions and sectors that are most vulnerable to an exit from the EU and to simultaneously prepare a strategy for the longer terms consequences of Brexit.\u201d Resolution have also highlighted how Britain\u2019s welfare bill will be squeezed severely in the next few years. That\u2019s partly due to the ongoing benefit freeze, which is now expected to save \u00a34.5bn by 2019-220 (a billion pounds more than expected) due to higher than anticipated inflation. Reductions to Universal Credit (UC) work allowances will also hit families, especially those with children. Resolution say: While no new tax and benefit policies were announced yesterday, existing policies are set to drag on living standards \u2013 especially in the bottom half of the distribution \u2013 for a few more years So, for all the talk of ending austerity, the truth is that more pain is round the corner: Resolution say: Only one-fifth of the \u00a310 billion worth of cuts announced in the Summer Budget of 2015 that directly affect household incomes have so far been delivered. Further cuts in 2018-19 will amount to \u00a32.5 billion, with that figure rising again \u2013 to \u00a32.7 billion \u2013 in 2019-20. These cuts will of course affect different families very differently. By 2022-23, the poorest third of households are expected to be \u00a3745 a year worse off than they would have been had no policy changes been made after March 2015. In contrast, the richest third will be \u00a3140 better off. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s analysis of the spring statement is now online, here. I\u2019ve culled a few charts, showing why Britain isn\u2019t out of the woods yet: The chart above shows that Britain won\u2019t reach a balanced budget - a key government target - until 2027. So to get there sooner, as the government wants, either spending has to be cut deeper to the bone (or through it?), taxes go up, or the economy outperforms expectations (which is Hammond\u2019s plan). Resolution also points out that households face a tough future: Ten years on from the start of the pay squeeze, recovery remains seven years away. And the vast majority of the large working-age welfare cuts announced back in July 2015 are still to bite, with low and middle income households likely to fare especially badly over the next two years. Despite some near-term improvement in yesterday\u2019s forecasts, the UK remains in the midst of a squeeze on incomes that is set to last longer than the one experienced immediately after the financial crisis. Nick Macpherson, the former top civil servant at the Treasury, is also racing to the barricades to save the 1p and 2p piece. Given it was a such a short speech, Philip Hammond will have hoped to avoid gaffes and blunders yesterday. But several of Britain\u2019s newspapers have blasted the chancellor this morning, over the Treasury\u2019s new consultation on whether to abolish 1p and 2p coins, along with \u00a350 notes. The Daily Mirror have splashed on the plan, warning that charity donations would suffer if people can\u2019t drop spare coppers into a collection tin. Shadow Civil Society minister Steve Reed told the Mirror: Cash is the most popular way for people to donate to charities, and much of that comes in small change like 1p and 2p coins. The Sun have dubbed Hammond a \u2018pennies pincher\u2019, urging readers to help \u2018save our coppers\u2019. Hammond has also upset the Daily Mail, which vents: They may be annoying small change to the better off, but others who count every penny will not thank you when traders inevitably round up those 99p prices. This looks to the Mail like a PR disaster in the making. The Resolution Foundation is hot off the blocks this morning, with its full analysis of Philip Hammond\u2019s spring statement. And the verdict isn\u2019t great -- the think tank warns that the Chancellor won\u2019t eliminate the deficit unless the economic forecasts improve, or he raises taxes. Resolution also aren\u2019t impressed with Hammond\u2019s claims of feeling \u2018Tiggerish\u2019. They point out that the economic forecasts are little better than the \u2018bloodbath\u2019 in last November\u2019s Budget (which was packed with weaker growth forecasts and higher borrowing). Britain is still expected to grow slower than the eurozone over the next five years, while real earnings are still not forecast to return to pre-crisis levels until 2025. Hammond\u2019s upbeat performance yesterday sparked some reports that austerity might soon be over. Resolution, though, point out that plenty of government cutbacks are heading out way already -- including a swathe of working age benefit cuts. Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution Foundation, said: With the elimination of the current deficit and debt falling next year, Britain is set to pass two major milestones on its long austerity journey since the financial crisis. But the end of the tunnel is still a decade away, and significant obstacles remain before the final destination is reached. \u201cSteering past these obstacles will require the Chancellor to make some tough choices that he avoided setting out yesterday lest he spoil the upbeat mood. Delivering significant reductions in debt while softening currently planned spending cuts to come will require either tax rises or for Britain to heed the Chancellor\u2019s call to \u2018beat the forecasts\u2019. Planning for the former, while hoping for the latter might be a sensible approach for the years ahead. Here\u2019s the key findings from Resolution\u2019s analysis: Welfare cuts \u2013 Just a fifth of the over \u00a310bn of welfare cuts announced in 2015 have been implemented so far. The coming year (2018-19) is set to be the second biggest single year of welfare cuts since the crisis (after 2012-13) at \u00a32.5bn. The scale of additional cuts will grow in 2019-20 to \u00a32.7bn as more families are moved onto Universal Credit. Inequality and income \u2013 As a result of policies announced since July 2015 the poorest third of households are expected to be an average of \u00a3745 a year worse off. In contrast, the richest third are forecast to record an average gain of \u00a3140 a year. Projected real household incomes are a staggering \u00a31,400 a year lower than forecast back in March 2016. Departmental cuts \u2013 After a short lull in cuts to day to day departmental spending next year, they are set to return from 2019-20 onwards. These include a 12 per cent cut to the Ministry of Justice budget over the next two years, while central government funding of local government is set for a 19 per cent fall. In contrast, DEFRA is set for a 21 per cent \u2018Brexit bonus\u2019 next year. The next spending review \u2013 Choosing not to feed higher inflation through to day-to-day departmental spending in the period beyond the current Spending Review has contributed to the Chancellor\u2019s better borrowing outlook in 2022-23. However, it also means yesterday\u2019s statement marked a further small real-terms spending cut. As a result day to day departmental spending per person in 2022-23 is projected to have fallen by 17 per cent since 2010. Meeting the fiscal objective \u2013 The Chancellor is still forecast to be borrowing 0.9 per cent of GDP in 2022-23. Eliminating it by 2025-26 as originally intended would require a speeding up of departmental spending cuts in the next parliament. The OBR says that even delaying it until 2027-28 would require per capita departmental spending to fall in real terms in each year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be mopping up the reaction to Britain\u2019s first-ever spring statement. Economic experts have been crunching the numbers overnight, working out what the latest forecasts mean for the UK economy. The Institute for Fiscal Studies releases its verdict this morning (10am), and other think tanks, research groups and City firms will be having their say too. Chancellor Philip Hammond did his best to sound upbeat, suggesting that UK could finally be seeing brighter times after years of austerity. Offering a glimmer of hope for the future, Hammond told MPs: \u201cIf, in the autumn, the public finances continue to reflect the improvements that today\u2019s report hints at, then in accordance with our balanced approach ... I would have the capacity to enable further increases in public spending and investment in the years ahead.\u201d. But with long-term growth weak, and the Britain\u2019s deficit still stubbornly refusing to be wiped out, the picture is still troubling. Also coming up today.... European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is speaking in Frankfurt. We also get new US retail sales figures - they\u2019ll be scrutinised for hints about how fast American interest rates will rise this year. The markets are a little subdued, following the latest turmoil at the White House. The surprise sacking of secretary of state Rex Tillerson has spooked investors Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: With Tillerson out the door, the market is assuming that Trump is aiming for a more aggressive foreign policy; enough to send a chill through the markets. The agenda 8am GMT: ECB president Mario Draghi speaks at \u201cThe ECB and Its Watchers XIX\u201d conference 10am GMT: Institute for Fiscal Studies press conference on the spring statement . 12.30pm GMT: US retail sales for February",

Resolution, though, point out that plenty of government cutbacks are heading out way already -- including a swathe of working age benefit cuts.</p> <p><strong>Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution Foundation, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the elimination of the current deficit and debt falling next year, Britain is set to pass two major milestones on its long austerity journey since the financial crisis. But the end of the tunnel is still a decade away, and significant obstacles remain before the final destination is reached.</p> <p>\u201cSteering past these obstacles will require the Chancellor to make some tough choices that he avoided setting out yesterday lest he spoil the upbeat mood. Delivering significant reductions in debt while softening currently planned spending cuts to come will require either tax rises or for Britain to heed the Chancellor\u2019s call to \u2018beat the forecasts\u2019. Planning for the former, while hoping for the latter might be a sensible approach for the years ahead.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Here\u2019s the key findings from Resolution\u2019s analysis:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><em>Welfare cuts \u2013</em></strong> Just a fifth of the over \u00a310bn of welfare cuts announced in 2015 have been implemented so far. The coming year (2018-19) is set to be the second biggest single year of welfare cuts since the crisis (after 2012-13) at \u00a32.5bn. The scale of additional cuts will grow in 2019-20 to \u00a32.7bn as more families are moved onto Universal Credit.</li> <li><strong><em>Inequality and income</em></strong><strong> \u2013 </strong>As a result of policies announced since July 2015 the poorest third of households are expected to be an average of \u00a3745 a year worse off. In contrast, the richest third are forecast to record an average gain of \u00a3140 a year. Projected real household incomes are a staggering \u00a31,400 a year lower than forecast back in March 2016.</li> <li><strong><em>Departmental cuts </em></strong><strong>\u2013</strong> After a short lull in cuts to day to day departmental spending next year, they are set to return from 2019-20 onwards. These include a 12 per cent cut to the Ministry of Justice budget over the next two years, while central government funding of local government is set for a 19 per cent fall. In contrast, DEFRA is set for a 21 per cent \u2018Brexit bonus\u2019 next year.</li> <li><strong><em>The next spending review</em></strong><strong> </strong>\u2013 Choosing not to feed higher inflation through to day-to-day departmental spending in the period beyond the current Spending Review has contributed to the Chancellor\u2019s better borrowing outlook in 2022-23. However, it also means yesterday\u2019s statement marked a further small real-terms spending cut. As a result day to day departmental spending per person in 2022-23 is projected to have fallen by 17 per cent since 2010.</li> <li><strong><em>Meeting the fiscal objective </em></strong>\u2013 The Chancellor is still forecast to be borrowing 0.9 per cent of GDP in 2022-23. Eliminating it by 2025-26 as originally intended would require a speeding up of departmental spending cuts in the next parliament. The OBR says that even delaying it until 2027-28 would require per capita departmental spending to fall in real terms in each year.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-14T08:06:29.425Z\">at 8.06am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5aa8cc66e4b0e01f75aa65eb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-14T07:45:31.444Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The agenda: Spring statement reaction; Draghi speaks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e458c66b2f9105239336631170ace8c69ea1812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e458c66b2f9105239336631170ace8c69ea1812/0_0_1708_1004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond delivering his first spring statement in the House of Commons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond delivering his first spring statement in the House of Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>Today we\u2019ll be mopping up the reaction to Britain\u2019s first-ever spring statement.

      "bodyText": "Unilever, the maker of Dove soap and Marmite, is expected to choose Rotterdam over London for its main headquarters, according to reports. The Anglo-Dutch consumer group currently has joint headquarters in London and Rotterdam. Since it fended off a \u00a3115bn takeover approach from the US food giant Kraft Heinz a year ago, the company has been reviewing its dual corporate structure and which of the two offices would become its main base. According to reports, Rotterdam has beaten London and an announcement could come as soon as Thursday, in a move that will be seen as a symbolic blow for the UK\u2019s attractiveness to international businesses in the wake of the Brexit vote. Unilever, run by its Dutch chief executive, Paul Polman, is expected to announce the decision after a board meeting on Wednesday. The company declined to comment. For nearly a century, Unilever has been headquartered in London and Rotterdam, after the 1929 merger of the British soap maker Lever Brothers and the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie. Since then, the business has grown into a global consumer group that makes a host of well-known brands including Persil washing powder, Magnum ice cream and Knorr soup. Unilever employs 7,500 people in the UK and about 3,000 in the Netherlands. Alongside complications caused by the UK severing links with Brussels, there are a number of other factors that make Rotterdam more attractive than London. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who used to work for Unilever, has pushed through plans to attract more overseas companies. He scrapped a 15% tax on dividends for overseas investors in Dutch businesses and intends to lower corporation tax. Even more importantly for Unilever, the Netherlands offers better protection against hostile corporate takeovers than the UK. The rules allow Netherlands-based firms to combat hostile takeovers with \u201cpoison pill\u201d defences, which make a company\u2019s shares prohibitively expensive to predators. This has reportedly been a major factor in the decision. Though run as one company, the distinct legal entities have different shareholders, separate stock listings and annual meetings, and are subject to different laws and corporate governance requirements. Unilever has said it planned to maintain stock market listings in the Netherlands, UK and US, and continue to apply both UK and Dutch corporate governance codes.",

Unilever employs 7,500 people in the UK and about 3,000 in the Netherlands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside complications caused by the UK severing links with Brussels, there are a number of other factors that make Rotterdam more attractive than London. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who used to work for Unilever, has pushed through plans to attract more overseas companies. He scrapped a 15% tax on dividends for overseas investors in Dutch businesses and intends to lower corporation tax.<br></p> <p>Even more importantly for Unilever, the Netherlands offers better protection against hostile corporate takeovers than the UK. The rules allow Netherlands-based firms to combat hostile takeovers with \u201cpoison pill\u201d defences, which make a company\u2019s shares prohibitively expensive to predators. This has reportedly been a major factor in the decision.<br></p> <p>Though run as one company, the distinct legal entities have different shareholders, separate stock listings and annual meetings, and are subject to different laws and corporate governance requirements. Unilever has said it planned to maintain stock market listings in the Netherlands, UK and US, and continue to apply both UK and Dutch corporate governance codes.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Prudential, Britain\u2019s biggest insurer, has announced plans to split its business into two FTSE 100 companies, with one focused on the UK and Europe and the other on its faster-growing US and Asian operations. After years of speculation, the 170-year-old company will split off its UK business, M&amp;G Prudential, leaving Prudential plc to focus on Asia, its main growth engine, along with the US and burgeoning African markets. In August, Prudential merged its UK life insurance division with its fund management arm, M&amp;G, run by Anne Richards. That move was welcomed by City analysts and investors, with the shares closing up 5% at \u00a319.18. Prudential also reported operating profits of \u00a34.7bn for 2017, up 6%. Both firms will be headquartered in London and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Prudential\u2019s shareholders will hold shares in both companies once the demerger is completed, which analysts expect to happen in 2020. Both companies are expected to be listed in the FTSE 100 index. John Foley, who will continue to run M&amp;G Prudential with 7.2 million customers in the UK and Europe, said the introduction of pension freedom in Britain in 2015 offered big opportunities. The firm will focus on improving its customer service by going digital and is investing \u00a3250m over five years. \u201cAt the moment, we are a largely paper-based organisation. Our communication with customers will be through our digital channels,\u201d Foley said. A spokesman explained that UK customers would eventually be able to invest online and via their smartphones, which is expected to lower costs. Mike Wells, Prudential\u2019s group chief executive, will lead the international business, Prudential plc. \u201cFollowing separation, M&amp;G Prudential will have more control over its business strategy and capital allocation. This will enable it to play a greater role in developing the savings and retirement markets in the UK and Europe,\u201d Wells said. He said the split had \u201cnothing to do with Brexit\u201d and would not result in \u201cmaterial job cuts\u201d. He described it as a strategic move that was not about cutting costs. Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, described the breakup as a \u201cbold move\u201d that would be positive for shareholders. \u201cTen years ago the UK business was the dominant part within the group \u2013 the cash cow that generated the funds to expand in Asia,\u201d Cornes said. \u201cTen years later the UK is having to fight for capital amongst the other businesses now that Asia is self-financing. We therefore see the move as a natural progression.\u201d",

The Treasury paper published on Tuesday announced a consultation on cash and digital payments, and noted that many consumers no longer regularly used 1p and 2p coins, as well as the \u00a350 note. This prompted some newspapers to herald the demise of copper coinage, warning about the associated impact on penny sweets and the cascade machines in seaside amusement arcades. Wednesday\u2019s Daily Mail front page called it \u201ca PR disaster in the making\u201d, the front of the Sun said, \u201cSave our coppers,\u201d and the Daily Mirror lamented: \u201cPennies dropped.\u201d Asked about the plans, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThere are no proposals to scrap 1p or 2p coins in the consultation that HMT [Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury] issued yesterday. The call for evidence is simply intended to enable the government to better understand the role of cash and digital payments in the new economy. \u201cOne thing HMT were seeking views on was whether the current denominational mix of coins meets the public\u2019s needs. From the early reaction, it looks as if it does.\u201d The government would \u201cwelcome all contributions to the debate\u201d and would respond after the consultation closes on 5 June, he added. The charity sector had warned that scrapping the coins would damage smaller organisations that rely on bucket collections for the majority of their funding. The Charity Finance Group said UK charities collected millions of pounds\u2019 worth of coppers every year. \u201cIt is a concern,\u201d said Andrew O\u2019Brien, the director of policy at CFG. \u201cOn the one hand, we don\u2019t want the charity sector to be accused of being luddites. \u201cOn the other hand, fundraising conditions are tight, particularly at the lower end for smaller charities, where people are reliant on bucket collections and spontaneous contributions. Charities are coming up with new, innovative ways to fundraise, but [traditional collections] are still significant.\u201d Mandy Johnson, chief executive of the Small Charities Coalition, which has about 9,200 members across the UK, said scrapping 1p and 2p coins would raise costs for charities. \u201cMost small charities rely on donations from individuals for the majority of their fundraising. That\u2019s volunteers asking people to put in their pennies where they can. At the moment, the alternatives to doing it that way are more costly.\u201d Johnson added that while contactless collection tins were available, they had higher costs. \u201cIf they remove the opportunity for people to give their pennies in the traditional way, they\u2019re raising the cost of fundraising for small charities.\u201d As the Guardian revealed last year, George Osborne came close to abolishing 1p and 2p coins when he was chancellor, but the idea was blocked by the prime minister, David Cameron, who thought the public might disapprove.",

      "bodyText": "A former Equifax executive has been charged with insider trading after he sold nearly $1m of shares in the credit agency before the company announced a huge data breach. Federal prosecutors announced the charges against Jun Ying, the former chief information officer of Equifax\u2019s US Information Solutions, on Wednesday. \u201cAs alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach, and he dumped his stock before the news went public,\u201d said Richard Best, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Atlanta regional office. \u201cCorporate insiders who learn inside information, including information about material cyber intrusions, cannot betray shareholders for their own financial benefit.\u201d Equifax announced on 7 September that it had discovered a months-long data breach that potentially exposed the personal information of 143 million people in the United States as well as some 700,000 in the UK. Its shares were trading at almost $143 before the announcement and fell 18% after the news broke. They are now trading for about $122. The complaint alleges that Ying and other executives were told of a \u201cVERY large breach opportunity\u201d at Equifax in an email on 25 August. According to the lawsuit Ying sold about 6,800 Equifax shares \u201cafter he learned of the breach but before the company had announced it publicly, amounting to an illegal trade based on insider information\u201d. Ying sold those shares on 28 August for about $950,000. According to the SEC, he would have made $117,000 less if he had sold those shares after the breach was made public. The suit also alleges that an hour before Ying sold his shares he \u201cused a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian\u2019s stock price. The search terms used by Ying were: (1) \u201cExperian breach\u201d; (2) \u201cExperian stock price 9/15/2015\u201d; and (3) \u201cExperian breach 2015.\u201d The research revealed that while the Experian breach was far smaller than Equifax\u2019s, the disclosure of the breach negatively affected the share price.",

      "bodyText": "This weekend South Australians go to the polls, and after 16 years in office the ALP is facing a pretty tough task to retain government \u2013 although, with the introduction of Nick Xenophon\u2019s SA Best party into the mix, no one is all that sure of what will happen. But whoever wins government will preside over an economy that has struggled behind the rest of the nation since the early 1990s. As one who grew up in country South Australia and who, despite not having lived in the state for nearly a quarter of a century, still supports the Crows, Adelaide United, and the Adelaide Strikers, and gets very parochial about successful people from the state, looking at its economy is always sad. In January this year South Australia had fewer of its adult population employed than any other state except Tasmania. But that is not new. It was the case at the date of every election, bar one, that the state ALP has won since 2002: And across the state, only one area \u2013 the well-heeled city central and hills areas \u2013 have a higher level of employment than does the rest of the nation: And again, this is nothing new, because the state\u2019s demography and economy is actually rather out of step with the rest of the nation. The big difference is that South Australians are much older than the rest of the country \u2013 it has fewer people aged under 50 but more people aged over 50: Those demographics make for a tough time economically, and it is not helped by the actual make-up of industries within the state. South Australia has long been viewed as a rust belt type state (to borrow the American term applied to places such as Michigan), but it is actually now only slightly more dependent upon manufacturing than is the rest of Australia. The biggest difference in the state\u2019s economy is a much greater dependency upon agriculture, and \u2013 due very much to the ageing population \u2013 healthcare: But the static picture hides the massive disruption that has occurred in the state over the past 20 years. While manufacturing has declined across the nation, in South Australia the decline has been much larger. 20 years ago manufacturing accounted of 15% of all of the state\u2019s value added, compared with 10.5% in the rest of Australia. Now the gap is much smaller \u2013 7.1% to 6.2%: Losing the auto industry slightly altered Australia\u2019s economy, but it massively affected South Australia\u2019s. However, despite the decline, more South Australians are employed in manufacturing than is the case elsewhere, and much more are employed in agriculture and healthcare: But an economy where agriculture and healthcare are the growing industries, and where manufacturing remains important but shrinking, leads to the type of situation South Australia has observed in the past four years since the last election \u2013 much stronger growth in part-time employment: And while that has reversed in the past year \u2013 giving the Weatherill government something to cling to \u2013 that mix of agriculture, healthcare, growing part-time work, and shrinking full-time manufacturing work also adds up to the state having one of the lowest average weekly earnings and the worst growth of earnings over the part four years: Because of the shift from full-time to part-time and from higher-paying manufacturing work to lower-paid agriculture and healthcare work, the average earnings of all employees has not grown at all since May 2014. The big problem is that employment growth has been weak over the past four years. Only Western Australia, coming off the mining boom, has had worse growth since the last state election: And while growth in the rate of people employed full-time in South Australia is not too bad compared with most of the other states, it is still nothing much to write home about. That brings us to the other big problem for the state \u2013 there are a lot of people who no longer call South Australia home. While the level of departures from the state is nothing like that which occurred during the 1990s recession (which included myself), in 2016 it peaked at a 12-year high, while at the same time the level of arrivals to the state is historically low: It all adds up to South Australian\u2019s real household disposable income being flat for nearly nine years: Given this picture, it is something of pride that the residents have not embraced a racist-extremist party but have instead floated towards the centrist SA Best party. But much like One Nation in Queensland having a good deal of parochialism attached to it, so too does Xenophon with many South Australians. Yes, he may have done whacky stunts in the past but he was their whacky stunt guy. And in a state that feels very much ignored, having someone to call \u201cour guy\u201d is important. But there is a difference between having a guy in Canberra and wanting him to lead the state \u2013 and it remains historically astonishingly hard to break the two-party system. Given the ongoing state of the economy, that the Liberal party is not a shoo-in on Saturday says all you need to know about people\u2019s view of the SA Liberal party. So it might just be the case that the ALP gets back in. But whoever does win will face a tough task ahead. Demography and a changing economy are against them, and it will be difficult to change the latter without changing the first.",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond will need to impose tax rises worth at least \u00a330bn to reach his target of balancing the public finances by 2025, undermining hopes that the chancellor will go into his autumn budget with plenty of spare cash to ease austerity, according to a leading economic thinktank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the government could be forced to find up to \u00a341bn in extra taxes by the middle of the next decade once the costs of Britain\u2019s ageing population are taken into account. The gloomy outlook is expected to put a dampener on Hammond\u2019s assessment of the public finances, which he said in his spring statement allowed him to consider increases in spending in the autumn budget. In an upbeat account of the economic outlook by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the chancellor said he felt \u201cTiggerish\u201d in contrast to the Eeyores on the Labour benches and said he would take a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d to planned public spending cuts. Hammond said: \u201cIf in the autumn the public finances continue to reflect the improvements that today\u2019s report hints at, then in accordance with our balanced approach \u2026 I would have the capacity to enable further increases in public spending and investment in the years ahead.\u201d But Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said to reach the deficit target without further cuts to public spending, the government would need to find \u00a314bn from the middle of the parliament and another \u00a318bn in extra taxes from 2023 to 2025. \u201cPut these two together and on current forecasts, just keeping spending constant as a fraction of national income beyond 2019\u201320 and reaching budget balance by the mid-2020s would require tax rises of \u00a330bn a year. \u201cAnd that\u2019s before additional demographic pressures which could add another \u00a311bn a year to the money the government would need to find from somewhere in 2025 if it wants to cover the additional demands for health, pension and social care spending,\u201d he said. Johnson said the pressures on public services were \u201cundeniable\u201d and it was likely that the government would need to address many of them in the short term. \u201cMany of the public services are struggling in a way that they were not two or three years ago. Safety in prisons is being compromised. The NHS is visibly failing to cope as well as it was. Local government, having done a remarkable job of coping with cuts, is showing the strain.\u201d The government could also face a backlash once \u201cfurther substantial cuts in the generosity of working-age benefits\u201d were imposed from April,\u201d he said. More than three-quarters of the scheduled welfare cuts had yet to take effect, the IFS said. Extra taxes on the self-employed, who pay lower national insurance than employed workers, and owner-managed businesses which pay themselves in dividends, were included in Johnson\u2019s list of potential tax raising measures. However, the government had failed to persuade parliament to back extra taxes, leaving Britain more reliant on a small number of high-earning taxpayers to finance public spending. While this may be desirable in terms of distribution between rich and poor, there are risks, Johnson said. \u201cIf high-paid jobs \u2013 and EU citizens, who are well represented among high earners in the UK \u2013 relocate elsewhere, the consequences for the exchequer will be severe,\u201d he said. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said a future Labour government would spare poor families from further cuts by ending austerity. \u201cUnder the Tories, it won\u2019t be the richest who are hit by these tax rises and austerity cuts, but the poorest. The next Labour government will end austerity,\u201d he said. But Johnson had a warning for Labour, saying that it would be dangerous to use extra borrowing to boost public sector spending. \u201cThe reality of the economic and fiscal challenges facing us ought to be at the very top of the news agenda. And I mean the reality, not the spin and bluster of politicians on all sides pretending there are easy solutions, that the promised land is just around the corner, or that they can reinvent the laws of economics. There aren\u2019t. It isn\u2019t. And they can\u2019t,\u201d he said.",

With several of the UK\u2019s biggest tour operators selling holidays for 2019, Which? said customers should be told of the possibility of flight disruption, and what compensation could be paid. No legal framework yet exists to manage flights to Europe once Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, and Ryanair and Lufthansa have cautioned that planes could be temporarily grounded without an aviation deal. Unless a transition deal for aviation is signed, from September 2018 Ryanair will include the warning on its tickets: \u201cThis flight is subject to the regulatory environment allowing the flight to take place.\u201d Which? called on the government to clarify consumer rights and strike an aviation deal as soon as possible. It advised anyone booking a holiday after March 2019 to check cancellation and refund policies \u2013 particularly for any elements such as car hire or villa rental booked outside of a package. The consumer group said that it asked the UK\u2019s five biggest travel companies, which take 13 million holidaymakers abroad each year, how they were keeping customers informed. It said Tui, Jet2 and On the Beach \u201cfailed to provide any reassurance that any information would be communicated upfront\u201d, while Thomas Cook had amended its terms and conditions to class any airspace closure with natural disasters, stating it would not provide compensation or reimburse expenses. Expedia told Which? it believed passengers would be entitled to compensation from airlines, though it is not yet selling post-Brexit holidays. Peter Vicary-Smith, the chief executive of Which?, said: \u201cThis uncertainty for holidaymakers is just one of the many issues affecting people\u2019s everyday lives that need to be resolved as we move closer to the date that the UK leaves the EU.\u201d About 75% of the 70m foreign trips made by UK residents each year go to the other 27 EU member states. A spokeswoman for the travel trade organisation Abta said: \u201cPackage holidays will continue to be covered by regulations which give holidaymakers the right to an alternative holiday, if available, or a refund in the event of changes caused by extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Huw Evans, the director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s critical people planning trips abroad after Brexit are given urgent clarity about what happens in the event of \u2018no deal\u2019.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "ExxonMobil says it doesn't expect to pay any Australian corporate tax until 2021", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ExxonMobil told a Senate inquiry on Wednesday it did not expect to pay any Australian corporate tax until 2021, meaning it would not have paid the tax for eight years, and was again accused of misleading the inquiry over its links to tax havens. The oil and gas giant\u2019s Australian tax affairs have faced close scrutiny since the release of an investigation by the Tax Justice Network (TJN) last year that exposed a complex web of hundreds of foreign subsidiaries designed for tax avoidance. The allegations prompted a fresh hearing of the Senate\u2019s corporate tax inquiry on Wednesday, where unions slammed the company as a \u201cvery, very bad corporate citizen\u201d. ExxonMobil told the inquiry on Wednesday that it did not expect to pay corporate tax in the next three years. It had paid no tax since 2013 because of the \u201cunique\u201d circumstances it was facing, after years of huge capital investment. It expected not to pay any tax until 2021, because it would offset current losses against its future taxable income. Last year\u2019s TJN report exposed the company\u2019s web of hundreds of foreign subsidiaries, and showed its Australian operations were ultimately owned by entities in the Netherlands, a nation increasingly known for tax avoidance, and the Bahamas, a jurisdiction with no corporate tax. The TJN accused the company of using related-party loans between its internal subsidiaries to reduce taxable profits in Australia, an allegation the company strongly denies and describes as \u201cbaseless\u201d. It was one of 732 corporations that paid no corporate tax in the 2015-16 financial year. In fact, the multinational giant has not recorded a taxable income or paid corporate tax in Australia for three years in a row, despite reporting revenue of $9.6bn in 2013-14, $8.5bn in 2014-15 and $6.7bn in 2015-16. Wednesday\u2019s inquiry heard ExxonMobil had not disclosed its links to the Netherlands or Bahamas entities to either the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or to a previous hearing of the Senate inquiry. The Tax Justice Network\u2019s Jason Ward, who led the investigation, said Exxon must be punished for the deception. He said their actions and statements show \u201ccomplete disrespect\u201d for the committee and the Australian people, and mirrored ExxonMobil\u2019s global track record of \u201carrogance and disrespect\u201d. \u201cExxon did mislead this committee in 2015, and there should be consequences,\u201d Ward told the inquiry on Wednesday. \u201cWhy is Exxon continuing to hide the facts?\u201d ExxonMobil\u2019s chairman in Australia, Richard Owen, flatly denied any attempt to mislead the inquiry. \u201cThe accusation by the Tax Justice Network was that we misled this community,\u201d Owen said. \u201cAnd I clearly say that we have not misled this community. That we have answered truthfully all the questions that have been put to us.\u201d \u201cAnd therefore we find the accusation very disappointing.\u201d ExxonMobil released new data on its financial affairs and structure to counter what it described as \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cinnuendo\u201d. Owen said ExxonMobil had \u201cdecades and decades\u201d of paying tax in Australia, including more than $2bn since 2000, averaging $200m a year. In the 1970s and the 1980s, the company was providing 14% of all government tax receipts, the inquiry heard. ExxonMobil said it was now in a unique position due primarily to the cost of $21bn in capital investment in Australia over the past decade, including in its operations in the Bass Strait and Western Australia. Lower prices were driving down income, the company said, and there was a high cost associated with the debt it had taken on to fund its investment. \u201cWe are in a unique period, and expect it to be short-term in our corporate history, with no income tax paid since 2013,\u201d Owen said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s due to the recovery of invested capital, lower prices that are driving down income, and the cost of debt to fund the significant amount of investment ... that we\u2019ve made.\u201d It had received two related-party loans, one from its US parent company, and another from the Bahamas entity worth $1bn. The company said it used about 2% of the loan to partially deduct from its taxable income. The inquiry heard the Australian Tax Office had audited ExxonMobil. After the TJN\u2019s report, ExxonMobile used a submission to the inquiry to accuse Ward of defamation. ExxonMobil has sued outspoken individuals who have criticised it in the United States, the inquiry has heard. The Labor senator Doug Cameron said it was the first time in 10 years he had seen such a threat, and said he would be \u201cvery concerned\u201d if the multinational was trying to intimidate a witness. Owen denied the statement was meant as a threat. But he said the TJN\u2019s allegations were defamatory and misled the inquiry. The company has paid the petroleum resource rent tax for its operations in Australia, the inquiry heard. ExxonMobil said it had paid $440m a year for the past 14 years through the PRRT. But even the PRRT, a royalty scheme, was not achieving fair or adequate returns from companies extracting Australia\u2019s natural resources, the inquiry heard. Both BHP and ExxonMobile operate a joint venture in the Bass Strait, but ExxonMobil had paid far less in PRRT. The inquiry heard a lack of transparency with the royalty scheme made it difficult to understand why there was such a divergence.",
