      "bodyText": "The Financial Services Authority is to summon the management of Britain's biggest banks to a meeting to discuss relaxing rules that are being blamed for holding back economic growth by impeding lending to businesses. The summit is expected to take place this week, coinciding with GDP figures for the second quarter that could deepen the gloom when they are released on Wednesday. It is intended to demonstrate that the FSA is moving quickly to make changes to rules, implemented after the banking crisis, that require banks to hold a \u00a3500bn buffer in government bonds and other financial instruments that can be sold quickly if there is a further bout of systemic upheaval. The FSA's top banking regulator, Andrew Bailey, is holding the crucial meeting just as the major banks prepare to publish their first-half figures and at a time of increased tension in the eurozone. The UK's GDP figures are expected to show that the economy shrank for a consecutive third quarter, declining by 0.2% between April and June, following the 0.3% contraction in the previous three months as the country remained in a double-dip recession. The construction sector, which accounts for 8% of the UK's economic output, is expected to weigh down the figures again. \"Bearing in mind that June's figures will be adversely affected by the weather as well as the diamond jubilee, it is possible that the figures could show construction activity falling by as much as 6%,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, who expects the UK economy to decline by 0.1% this year.

Bailey is expected to discuss how \u00a3160bn in collateral posted at the Bank of England can be released. The goal \u2013 to help push more money into the economy \u2013 was set after recent discussions at the financial policy committee, the new systemic regulator inside the Bank of England. The FPC had considered suspending the liquidity guidelines altogether but concluded that a relaxation was the preferred option. The FSA is acting after the FPC recommended that the regulator \"makes clearer to banks that they are free to use their regulatory liquid asset buffers in the event of a liquidity stress\".

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Gas faces renewed pressure over alleged profiteering amid City predictions that the company will reveal this week that it made \u00a3100m in extra profits in the first six months of the year. William Bain, Labour MP for Glasgow North East and a fuel poverty campaigner, said the forecasts made it \"increasingly clear\" that the big six energy companies acted as a monopoly that must be broken up. The parent of British Gas, Centrica, reports first-half figures on Thursday. The gas and electricity supply arm of Centrica triggered anger last summer when it announced a rise in gas and electricity prices of 18% and 16% respectively, just eight months after it had introduced a 7% hike. Phil Bentley, the British Gas managing director, said it had been forced to put its rates up because \"we are buying in a global energy market and have to pay the market rate\". But City analysts are now expecting the residential energy supply arm of Centrica, which trades as British Gas, to unveil first- half profits up 25% at \u00a3355m as part of a wider Centrica group profit of \u00a31.4bn. Centrica will seek to defend soaring profits by pointing out it reduced its residential electricity prices earlier this year by 5%. The company is also expected to claim that last year's figures were very low due to unusually warm weather that suppressed household energy use. However, conditions this year averaged out at much more normal temperatures, with a consequent increase in profits. But Bain said that those least able to pay bills were bamboozled by complex tariffs and believed that current attempts by the government and industry regulator Ofgem to tackle these problems did not go nearly far enough. \"This [British Gas figures] is going to reopen the debate about a windfall tax or more corporation tax. You cannot have profiteering which comes at the expense of the poor, vulnerable and elderly,\" he said. Consumer Focus, the government-backed consumer watchdog, said households were facing historically high energy bills and had long held suspicions that domestic power pricing was not fair. \"Only weeks ago, British Gas was hinting at further bill increases. With forecasts of rising profits for its domestic supply business, British Gas should at least put its customers' minds at rest by stopping this sort of rhetoric.\" British Gas warned in May that wholesale gas prices for the winter were about 15% higher than last year and non-commodity costs \u2013 such as transport and environment levies \u2013 could add \u00a350 to supply costs for the average household, which would be passed on to bills. Taken together, the two cost increases could lead to bills rising by more than \u00a3100 over the next 12 to 18 months. Meanwhile the City is encouraging investors to buy Centrica shares and believes that the chances of Ofgem taking a tougher stance against the big six is increasingly unlikely. Angelos Anastasiou, utility analyst with Investec Securities, said: \"We believe that the primary cause of this poor performance was fear of political and regulatory interference, in particular, following steep price increases in the residential supply market. We think this now appears to be subsiding.\"",

The parent of British Gas, Centrica, reports first-half figures on Thursday.</p> <p>The gas and electricity supply arm of Centrica triggered anger last summer when it announced a rise in gas and electricity prices of 18% and 16% respectively, just eight months after it had introduced a 7% hike.</p> <p>Phil Bentley, the British Gas managing director, said it had been forced to put its rates up because \"we are buying in a global energy market and have to pay the market&#xa0;rate\".</p> <p>But City analysts are now expecting the residential energy supply arm of Centrica, which trades as British Gas, to unveil first- half profits up 25% at \u00a3355m as part of a wider Centrica group profit of \u00a31.4bn.</p> <p>Centrica will seek to defend soaring profits by pointing out it reduced its residential electricity prices earlier this year by 5%.</p> <p>The company is also expected to claim that last year's figures were very low due to unusually warm weather that suppressed household energy use. However, conditions this year averaged out at much more normal temperatures, with a consequent increase in profits.</p> <p>But Bain said that those least able to pay bills were bamboozled by complex tariffs and believed that current attempts by the government and industry regulator Ofgem to tackle these problems did not go nearly far enough.</p> <p>\"This [British Gas figures] is going to reopen the debate about a windfall tax or more corporation tax. You cannot have profiteering which comes at the expense of the poor, vulnerable and elderly,\" he said.</p> <p>Consumer Focus, the government-backed consumer watchdog, said households were facing historically high energy bills and had long held suspicions that domestic power pricing was not fair.</p> <p>\"Only weeks ago, British Gas was hinting at further bill increases. With forecasts of rising profits for its domestic supply business, British Gas should at least put its customers' minds at rest by stopping this sort of rhetoric.\"</p> <p>British Gas warned in May that wholesale gas prices for the winter were about 15% higher than last year and non-commodity costs \u2013 such as transport and environment levies \u2013 could add \u00a350 to supply costs for the average household, which would be passed on to bills. Taken together, the two cost increases could lead to bills rising by more than \u00a3100 over the next 12 to 18 months.</p> <p>Meanwhile the City is encouraging investors to buy Centrica shares and believes that the chances of Ofgem taking a tougher stance against the big six is increasingly unlikely.</p> <p>Angelos Anastasiou, utility analyst with Investec Securities, said: \"We believe that the primary cause of this poor performance was fear of political and regulatory interference, in particular, following steep price increases in the residential supply market. We think this now appears to be subsiding.\"</p>",
