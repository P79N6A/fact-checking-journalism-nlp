    "webTitle": "Sports Direct: 60% of shareholders approve Mike Ashley bonus scheme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has succeeded in pushing through a controversial multimillion-pound bonus scheme for its founder, Mike Ashley, despite fierce opposition from shareholder lobby groups. More than 60% of votes cast were in favour of the scheme, which will hand 3,000 permanent staff 25m free shares \u2013 worth around \u00a3180m \u2013 if the firm doubles its profits by 2019. The vote was Sports Direct's fourth attempt to push through a big payout for the billionaire Ashley. On previous occasions the company has been defeated or forced to withdraw its plans. The new proposal came just weeks after shareholders threw out a proposed \u00a370m payout for Ashley. Shareholders have not been told how much of the new \u00a3180m pot he will get. Technically Ashley could be assigned all the shares, but a spokesman said this would be against the ethos of the company bonus scheme, which has previously allotted the vast majority of bonus shares outside the boardroom. The shareholder vote did not include Ashley, who owns 58% of Sports Direct, because of the conflict of interest. Just three independent investors turned up at Wednesday's special shareholder meeting at Sports Direct's Shirebrook headquarters, near Mansfield. There were no questions from the floor or challenges to the board at the meeting, which lasted barely five minutes. Sitting at the directors' table, Ashley refused to speak to or even look at reporters attending the meeting. He cupped his chin in his hand and stared into the distance as chairman Keith Hellawell and other colleagues tried to fend off questions. Ashley left by helicopter immediately after the meeting, taking off from the helipad in the carpark adjoining the warehouse and office complex. The company said shareholders had backed the latest scheme over three previous alternatives after it toughened performance targets, extended the period over which performance would be measured from two to four years and wrapped Ashley's incentives into a wider scheme for permanent staff. Hellawell, a former chief constable of West Yorkshire, said: \"The board and remuneration committee responded to the feedback received from shareholders and today's vote in favour of the resolution will ensure that the group continues to retain and motivate hard-working employees. \"The resolution also recognises the substantial contribution made by Mike Ashley over many years and, as demonstrated by the previous schemes, has the potential to create a further significant increase in shareholder value.\" Asked if the company felt it had consulted investors sufficiently, Dave Forsey, the chief executive, said: \"Ask the investors.\" However, the Institute of Directors (IoD) \u2013 which had taken the unusual step before the meeting of publicly criticising the proposed payout \u2013 said Sports Direct should not ignore the voices of the 40% of investors who did not approve the bonus scheme. Oliver Parry, corporate governance adviser at the IoD, said: \"Today's vote is not a ringing endorsement for the governance set-up at Sports Direct. We are not convinced that the board is independently minded enough to exercise sufficient checks on the majority shareholder, in this case Mike Ashley.\" On Tuesday the IoD had warned there was no \"check on Mike Ashley's power\" at Sports Direct. Robert Hingley, of the Investment Management Association, said shareholders had not been properly consulted about the latest bonus scheme and it was clear there was a \"considerable body of concern\" about it. He called on Sports Direct to discuss how the potential bonus shares would now be allotted. \"The middle ground would be to talk to shareholders and agree an appropriate amount,\" he said. \"If you are a premium listed company you get all sorts of benefits including access to the capital markets, but there is a corresponding obligation that you should adhere to, including the highest standards of governance. We are not convinced Sports Direct buys into that.\" Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said Sports Direct's shares were \"only for the brave\". He said that the squabble with shareholders and a dispute with major supplier Adidas over supply of key products made the prospects of an increase in the shareprice unlikely. This week Sports Direct's chief executive, Dave Forsey, ratcheted up the battle with Adidas as he accused the German sports brand of being \"anti-competitive.\". Forsey has said that Adidas is preventing Sports Direct from pursuing a bid for footwear retailer Office because of indications the brand will withdraw supplies of key products. The brand has withdrawn some football and fashion-led products from the Sports Direct and USC chains owned by the retailer. Forsey said on Wednesday: \"It's incredible that Sports Direct doesn't have access to Adidas, being the largest football retailer in the world, to products that players are wearing on the field.\"",

    "webTitle": "Britain is a corporate tax haven \u2013 that's why US firms are keen to uproot", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A country's tax regime has a clear impact on where international companies choose to locate; and not just the main corporation tax rate. Simple inducements, such as enterprise zones and low taxes for top earners can swing the decision in favour of one country over another. Destination Maternity, the US baby clothes business seeking to swallow Mothercare, wants to escape the US's 40% corporation tax rate. The UK is attractive because Mothercare is not only a struggling business and therefore cheap to buy, but also because Britain has worked hard to become one of the lowest tax jurisdictions in the G20. George Osborne has argued that all the Treasury's tax incentives are concerned with creating jobs and \"genuine business investment\", but he has been unable to escape accusations that Britain is now increasingly attractive to foreign companies after becoming one of the world's largest and most sophisticated tax havens. A survey by PwC earlier this year revealed that 63% of the 1,344 chief executives surveyed worldwide put government tax policy high on the agenda when choosing where to operate their business. Decades of tax competition have seen internet retailers like eBay opt for Luxembourg, software firms like Google and Facebook congregate in Ireland, while the major US multinationals like Coca Cola and McDonald's have chosen to operate from Switzerland's many low tax cantons. Successive British governments have tried to compete for some of this business, most obviously by cutting the main rate of corporation tax from 30% in 2007 to 21% today and 20% next year. Chris Morgan, head of tax policy at KPMG, said this move, along with a raft of other measures designed to attract the bigger international players has spurred investment and protected jobs. He cited the patent box, which cuts the effective rate of corporation tax on income from patents to 10%, as another boost to foreign investment. Osborne has made no secret of his mission to develop the most competitive tax system in the G20. His so-called \"corporate tax road map\" also involves simplifying controlled foreign company legislation, which ends the double taxation of profits and at the same time arguably makes it easier to switch profits to low tax jurisdictions. In Paris and Berlin, officials have watched with dismay as Britain has on the one hand talked tough on tax avoidance and on the other sought to compete with low tax countries. Maria Fekter, the Austrian finance minister, spoke for many continental leaders when she attacked the UK for wanting an end to her country's bank secrecy laws while it maintained \"many money-laundering centres and tax havens in its immediate legal remit\". A recent investigation by Reuters appeared to confirm that several firms have moved to the UK, but only to pay less tax. Company filings show that Rowan, a huge operator of drilling rigs valued at $4bn (\u00a32.33bn), cut its effective tax rate to 3.3% in 2013 from 34.6% in 2008 after domiciling in the UK but keeping its HQ and management in the US. Tax campaigner Richard Murphy points to figures from the UN Conference on Trade and Development showing foreign direct investment into Britain fell 19% last year to $37bn despite a 9% rise in global flows. He said: \"Far from attracting more money, less money has come than before. But the cost has been enormous. I have estimated that this policy of tax rate and tax base cuts may cost the UK up to \u00a310bn a year.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's construction industry powered ahead in June as companies hired staff at its fastest ever rate to cope with a sharp rise in house building. A snapshot of the UK's building sector signalled a positive contribution to the wider economy in the second quarter as orders continued to pile up last month. The Markit/CIPS construction PMI rose to a four month high of 62.6 in June from 60 in May, where anything above 50 indicates growth. It matched February's figure, and beat City forecasts of a slight drop to 59.5. The pound rose to a near six-year high against the dollar when the data was published, to $1.718. The biggest driver of growth was house building, which jumped to 66.6 from 62.7 a month earlier, while commercial property building and civil engineering also continued to grow. The survey was published as British housebuilder Persimmon reported a 33% jump in revenue in the first half of the year, to \u00a31.2bn. It legally completed on 6,408 new homes, up 28%. Despite the rise in house building indicated by the June PMI, the UK is still failing to build new houses in sufficient number to meet economic demand, a point which has been repeatedly highlighed by Bank of England governor Mark Carney in recent weeks. A lack of housing supply is considered a key factor behind the sharp rise in UK house prices. The BBC's Newsnight reported on Tuesday that a leaked document produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government showed housing starts are expected to fall by 4% to about 128,000 in 2014-15, figures which could embarrass the government in the run up to the general election in May 2015. Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: \"We inherited a housing market suffering the aftershocks of an unsustainable housing boom, and a planning system that pitted neighbours against developers and built nothing but resentment. \"Since 2010 we've pulled out all the stops to get Britain building \u2026 housing completions are forecast to continue to rise, as is private sector house building.\" Bigger workloads encouraged companies to take on workers at the fastest rate since the survey began more than 17 years ago according to the PMI. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the record job creation represented \"a remarkable yardstick of progress as the sector looks to recover the ground lost over the past seven years\". Economists said the latest figures suggested the economy was on course for stronger growth in the second quarter, following a 0.8% increase in GDP in the first. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the strength of the data would drive up expectations that a first rise in interest rates could come before the end of 2014, after mixed messages from the Bank of England in recent weeks. Rates have been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009.",

This is a marked pick up in the pace of private sector job creation from the May reading of 179,000, and you have to go back to November 2012 to see a similar spike up in the ADP survey.</p> <p>However, back then, the ADP report gave a false signal for non-farm payrolls, which were virtually unchanged from the previous month (actually slightly down at 203,000 (revised) from 225,000). The payrolls series in 2012 actually saw a greater pick up the previous month, when it accelerated at about a 65,000 pace from the previous trend of about 160,000.<br></p> <p>So what can we read into this? The odds have certainly shortened on a decent payrolls number. But with payrolls being released a day early this month, and few other indicators to go on, this is hardly conclusive evidence.<br></p> <p>We are forecasting a payrolls figure of 220,000, slightly above consensus, and we are heartened to be that side of the forecasting pack by these figures. Moreover, we are also slightly more optimistic than consensus in looking for a further 0.1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate, which is more likely if this ADP result is matched by the household survey and labour force participation does not surge.<br></p> <p>As ever, wages will remain a key focus of this report. Any hint that wages are beginning to pick up could seriously change the market\u2019s perceptions about inflation risk and Fed policy. Without this, even a strong payrolls will likely have little impact on the pace of the Fed\u2019s tapering schedule, and market reaction could be relatively modest even for a 250,000+ payrolls number.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53b3fa93e4b0a38a6109df3d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-02T12:33:53.134Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US private sector adds more jobs than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Away from the think-in at Camp Alphaville and ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers on Thursday - a day early thanks to the July 4 holiday on Friday - come the private payroll figures for June.</p> <p>According to private payroll processor ADP, American companies hired 281,000 jobs workers last month, better than the median forecast of 200,000.

Haldane replies that: \"One man's nuttiness is another man's animal spirits.\" I'm happy for that to continue for the next few years On that back of that will come growth, will come invesment. It is better if firms are encouraged to use cash to lay concrete rather than on share buybacks, Haldane concludes. And that's the end of the Is This Nuts session.... Are we creating new risks by forcing so much financial trading, derivatives and the like, though central clearing houses? Some interesting points of view emerge from the Camp Alphaville panel. Charles Goodhart is worried that there will be a \"proliferation\" of Central CounterParty clearing operations - Europe will want one, so will the US, so will Asia. Andy Haldane, though, points out that a single clearing house for all trades would be \"The too big to fail problem from hell\". Away from economics for a moment, and onto booze. Guinness' \"Arthur's Day\" is no longer good for you according to its owners. Henry McDonald, Ireland Correspondent, writes: The \"Arthur's Day\" celebrations have been scrapped it was announced today from the home of the black stuff in Dublin's St.James' Gate. Arthur\u2019s Day [named after the founder of the brewing empire] was established in 2009 to celebrate Guinness\u2019s 250th anniversary but according to Marketing Director of Guinness Stephen O\u2019Kelly the celebration had run its course. He denied that negative press surrounding Arthur\u2019s Day and the issue of binge drinking on Irish and British streets had influenced drinks giant Diageo\u2019s decision to ditch the celebration. \u201cWe view Arthur\u2019s day as a success. There is a bigger issue here and that is alcohol consumption in Ireland. Arthur\u2019s Day was brought into that discussion but that was not the deciding factor in replacing it with Amplify.\u201d Guinness Amplify will see a variety of up-and-coming bands play in 500 pubs over five weekends, beginning on September 11. The scheme will include studio time for bands, and master-classes with industry experts including Snow Patrol\u2019s Johnny Quinn and David Kitt. Q&amp;A time: Why are interest rates still so low, when the economy is growing so much? Andy Haldane replies while it's great news that the economy is growing, there is still an output gap between what Britain is producing and it's full potential. And eliminating that slack is key to ensuring inflationary pressures are controlled hurting the recovery. And real wages are still falling, they are still in negative territory - as they have been for all but six months of the last six years, Haldane points out. Are we getting better at central banking, Dr Haldane? The BoE's chief economist proves he's no fool (not that there was the slightest doubt about that) I think we've learned a lot from the last six years, Andy Haldane replies. But then if we couldn't learn some lessons from the events, I don't know what we'd ever learn, he adds. George Magnus, ex UBS, warns that the financial markets may be nutty -- but they may get nuttier. He suggests central banks could take a laid back view about the amount of borrowing made by big corporations, because they're not as crucial to the financial system as banks. Magnus says: Because it's not systemic, the tolerance levels are much greater. Not that much volatility in the markets today, however. Investors were - in the main - cautiously positive ahead of Thursday's US non-farm payroll numbers, with markets continuing to be buoyed by a run of reasonable economic data and the continuing support of central bank stimulus measures. The closing scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 13.45 points or 0.2% higher at 6816.37 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.09% to 9911.27 \u2022 France's Cac closed down 0.37% at 4444.72 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.53% higher at 21,678.58 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 0.08% to 11,016.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 5 points or 0.03%. Back to Andy Haldane, who explains to the financial pro's in the audience at Camp Alphaville that the \"shape of risk\" is being altered, by the changes in financial regulation. In the past we had periods of time when there was stability, and good availability of capital at reasonable prices, punctuated by the complete reverse - which we call banking crises, Haldane says. No, instead of risks being hidden inside banks, it shows up each week in the \"mark-to-market balance sheets of asset management firms.\" That means there will be, on average, more volatility than in the past, Haldane says. The fear and greed cycles in the financial markets will be more obvious than in the past. But that's the price of avoiding a repeat of 2008. Charles Goodhart jibes back at Haldane, saying the central banks want things both ways. On one hand they want people to take more risks, and on the other they don't want the banks to take any risks at all. You might call it a bit nutty, he points out. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, explains tht central banks have \"grown a new arm, macro-prudential regulation\" to prevent the markets becoming over-egged with risk. He cites the BoE announcing measures to prevent the housing market overheating, last week. So in conclusion, Haldane says, the financial markets today are nutty, but they'd be nuttier if central bankers hadn't acted in the way they did since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Now Andy Haldane speaks at Camp Alphaville. Is the situation in the financial market nuts today? Indeed, Haldane replies. It would be extraordinary if it wasn't nuts. We have had a global ecoomy that has done the most amazing things for 80 years and gone though a phase shift. Have a financial system that has gone through several phase shifts. I would be extraordinary if markets, that are pricing in all those things, are not nuts. Has monetary policy aided and abetted risk-taking? I hope so, Haldane says, that's why we did it. Had we not done it, the UK economy would be 6% smaller, losing at least \u00a380bn to \u00a3100bn. Stock market prices are up, asset prices are up -- and that has turned a headwind into something of tail wind, Haldane says. But yes,\"there is a risk of the economy becoming over egged\", even if the money isn't leveraged, Haldane cautions. More in a moment.... Jonathan Wilmott (formally of Credit Suisse), who is also on the panel, also thinks the current state of the markets is indeed nuts. He warns that people heading for retirement face a situation where real yields (return on investment in safe assets *minus* inflation) are almost zero. That's unprecedented, he warns. Here's a picture of the Is it nuts? panel, with thanks to Pete Spence of City AM. George Magnus agrees that the huge quantitative easing programmes run since the financial crisis have resulted in the markets become rigged, and out of kilter with reality and fair values. Are we in a nutty environment? Charles Goodhart, who used to serve on the Bank of England, says that in his day the BoE's forecasts always talked about the situation being particularly unusual. But yes, the markets are somewhat rigged -- by the central banks. Is it sustainable? No Is it dangerous? maybe. Best possible policy? No, but hard to do what would have been better. And this rigging by the central banks leads to other rigging, Goodhart adds - citing the allegations of FX rate-fixing. He compares it to being told that you have to \"marry the next person of the opposite sex you meet\" (or indeed the same sex, don't forget!). Wouldn't you rig the situation, so they next person you met was quite gorgeous?.... Great panel at Camp Alphaville now -- including Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane, Charles Goodhart of the LSE, and George Magnus, ex-UBS (and another great twitter follow). The title is \"Is this nuts?\" - a Paul Murphy running theme, for stories that are too hard to write about because they're inexplicable and hard to understand -- dubbed \"This is nuts. When's the crash?\". Let's see what comes up... Another example of the perils of twitter -- the European Central Bank's most retweeted tweet ever was sent just after England crashed out of the 2012 European Championships at the hands of Pirlo's Italy. The guy who runs the account explains that he only wanted to congratulate the four European teams that were left -- everyone just assumed it was snarky. Maybe because it really was..... Lorcan Roche Kelly (another Twitter star) points out, though, that tweets aren't private - once you send them, they're completely public. And the place is riddled with journalists looking for an angle or a story, he warns. Spotting me in the audience, he points the finger of warning -- once you're in the Guardian Live blog, there's no going back, Lorcan cautions. We are grateful though.... Some of the brighter lights of finance twitter are explaining why they use the micro-blogging site. Gus Baratta, who trades Italian bonds in Milan, explains that he became active Twitter during the early days of the eurozone crisis because he saw so much inaccuracy being banded around. All of a sudden, my product went from being a quiet, non-volatile backwater to being much more exciting, Gus says. And there were so many \"misconceptions\" and \"bullshit\" being said about my market. And then, Gus picked up followers fast once people realised he was puncturing these errors (and seriously, he's been extremely helpful over the years) But can't people just adapt to the robot revolution by learning new skills? And what about those who simply can't? No at all, we need to adapt new technology to work better for people, argues Erik Brynjolfsson, who wrote The Second Machine Age. Interesting discussion about the disruptive influences of robots on the world economy, including Oxford professor Michael Osborne - who dialled in by robot to warn that the jobs market could be drastically changed by 2034 as many well-paid white-collar jobs are outsourced to technology. Someone not at Camp Alphaville is Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Instead she is giving a speech on monetary policy and financial stability at the IMF in Washington. (No igloos there, I'll bet). Yellen said monetary policy was a limited tool when trying to address risks to financial stability, and regulation should play the main role: Monetary policy faces significant limitations as a tool to promote financial stability: Its effects on financial vulnerabilities, such as excessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood and are less direct than a regulatory or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and employment. As a result, I believe a macroprudential approach to supervision and regulation needs to play the primary role. The full text of the speech is here. And an interpretation: Amusing moment in Lucy Kellaway's Q&amp;A when the wrong microphone is turned on -- treating the audience to a private chat about \"money flowing into the market\". She looks panicky for a moment, at the prospect of a particularly tricky financial poser... But instead, we're onto issues like nasty comments from readers. Does she read them? We're meant to read them, and engage -- editor's orders -- she explains. But often, Lucy admits she feels sad and unloved if there are too many negative comments (no argument there). But a balance between positive and critical is probably best. Another issue from Lucy Kellaway - how do couples cope when the woman earns more than the man? She wrote a column about this on the FT recently (great read as I recall), but admits that her early research was discouraging. I emailed FT staff, and got replies like \"My ex-wife earned more than me\" or \"I earned more than my ex-husband\". Are things changing? Not fast enough, Lucy reckons -- one woman wrote back saying that she wouldn't want to marry a man earning less than her because she didn't fancy a lifetime of propping up his ego.... Lucy Kellaway also touches on another issue -- why can't people make career changes and start again as an intern in middle age, or later.... I'll want to do something new when I grow up, she jokes. You and me both, Ms K.... But until then.... Lucy Kellaway also jokes that she's met a lot of CEOs in her career, and none of them could be described as completely normal. Gerry Robinson, ex boss of Grenada, comes closest, she reckons. He seemed like a really nice guy... Now Lucy Kellaway of the FT is discussing her campaign against the nonsense that companies trot out in their annual reports. Kellaway created a title of \"Chief Obfuscation Champion\", or COC -- to name and shame offenders. Angela Ahrendts, ex-Burberry and now of Apple, won it in 2013. But it didn't do any good -- Ahrendts came out with another dose of of mangled flannel soon afterwards. The problems is that no-one will go up to her and say \"look at this, that nasty cow at the FT is making fun of you\", Kellaway bemoans. A lot of chat about the prospects for the US dollar as the Federal Reserve continues to wind back its stimulus programme over the coming months, here at Camp A. After so many years of ultra-loose policy, and record low rates, the question is whether, and when, the markets start to price in a stronger US dollar. Memories of the Taper Tantrum of 2013, when bond yields soared on the prospect of less looseness from the Fed. Kit Juckes of SocGen predicts that there will be a summer of happiness and calm, and then \"at an imprecise date, when we're not ready\" policymakers will \"wake up\" and decide that they aren't happy with this situation. And then, at some further time down the line, they'll probably change their minds again. I didn't really capture quite how cool the robots at Camp Alphaville are -- not only are they equipped with video screens and microphones, they can be driven around remotely by the person at the other end of the call! This little rascal just shot past me at impressive speed (well above walking pace) More US data, and new orders for factory goods slipped by more than expected in June. According to the Commerce Department they fell by 0.5%, compared to the forecast drop of 0.3%. A fall in demand for military equipment (really?) led to the drop and stripping this out, new orders edged up 0.2%. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 17 points or 0.11% higher. IB Times have written up the Ian Hannam skit (see earlier in the blog): And Anna Stevenson-Yang of J Capital Research also predicts trouble ahead for China. She tells Camp Alphaville that the Chinese economy simply cannot keep mopping up debt as it has been doing for many years (driven by China's huge trade surplus). Stevenson-Yang say that she's travelled widely in China, and now there is nowhere you can go where you don't see empty offices, empty apartments, due to the massive construction boom. \"It is a tragedy of historical proportions, and also indicates that there is nowhere else to put the cash.\" Beijing has turned property into a new asset class to mop up people's savings. So fundamentally, it's become a speculative asset, and some of it will be worthless when the market turns, she says. Stevenson-Yang's stark conclusion is that a lot of the farmland that we've seen developed in recent years will have turned into \"crumbling cement in five years\". But Carston Block, founder of Muddy Waters Research, argues that China is heading for a harder landing. China, Block reckons, cannot escape \"the sins of the past\". Corruption means that too much GDP growth has been squandered, and that much of the huge stimulus measures unleashed since the 2008 financial crisis has been syphoned off, or used wastefully on flawed projects. He argues that corruption in China has a much more \"deleterious effect\" than on other countries So, China can't achieve an 'orderly rebalancing' in which growth merely slows. Block says: I think there will be a cliff. GDP will contract. Back at Camp Alphaville, Michael Pettis, professor of finance at Guanghua school of management at Peking University, is explaining how he believes China's economy will rebalance. Pettis believes that growth will slow sharply as China tries to transform into a more consumer-driven economy. That means, he reckons, that the upper limit of GDP growth between 2013 and 2023 is just 3% to 4% -- just half the current rate. But household income is likely to grow much faster than GDP... so an \"orderly rebalancing\" could take place with growth of not much over 3%, but with household income growing at 5, 6, maybe 7%. And that means that \"the bulk of the burden of rebalancing will fall on the elite\", which will have serious implications for China. Rob Carnell at ING Bank looks at what the US private payroll number may mean for tomorrow's non-farm figures: The US ADP survey for June came in at a very strong 281,000 rise, which will no doubt encourage thoughts of a similarly strong payrolls. This is a marked pick up in the pace of private sector job creation from the May reading of 179,000, and you have to go back to November 2012 to see a similar spike up in the ADP survey. However, back then, the ADP report gave a false signal for non-farm payrolls, which were virtually unchanged from the previous month (actually slightly down at 203,000 (revised) from 225,000). The payrolls series in 2012 actually saw a greater pick up the previous month, when it accelerated at about a 65,000 pace from the previous trend of about 160,000. So what can we read into this? The odds have certainly shortened on a decent payrolls number. But with payrolls being released a day early this month, and few other indicators to go on, this is hardly conclusive evidence. We are forecasting a payrolls figure of 220,000, slightly above consensus, and we are heartened to be that side of the forecasting pack by these figures. Moreover, we are also slightly more optimistic than consensus in looking for a further 0.1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate, which is more likely if this ADP result is matched by the household survey and labour force participation does not surge. As ever, wages will remain a key focus of this report. Any hint that wages are beginning to pick up could seriously change the market\u2019s perceptions about inflation risk and Fed policy. Without this, even a strong payrolls will likely have little impact on the pace of the Fed\u2019s tapering schedule, and market reaction could be relatively modest even for a 250,000+ payrolls number. Away from the think-in at Camp Alphaville and ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers on Thursday - a day early thanks to the July 4 holiday on Friday - come the private payroll figures for June. According to private payroll processor ADP, American companies hired 281,000 jobs workers last month, better than the median forecast of 200,000. That compares to a May figure of 179.000. Since the ADP report has been lower than the non-farms recently, that could mean a better than expected number tomorrow too. But perhaps we should not read too much into the ADP figures. Ahead of the numbers, Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: The latest ADP employment report can sometimes offer clues as to the direction of the official payrolls report later in the week. This hasn\u2019t been true in recent months though, while yesterday\u2019s ISM employment component didn\u2019t offer much in the way of clues in regard to tomorrow's payrolls report either. Expectations are for jobs growth of 205,000, up from the 179,000 seen in May. Ian Hannam is giving some investment advice. He's \"Long Africa, very long technology, especially in the energy side\" (he mentions gas as a growth opportunity). Short anything? Hannam says he's \"short the developed markets\". And he's worried that the long period of low interest rates and cheap credit will end sooner than expected. It feels like a bubble when you walk around London and the price of a property is 5 times higher than a similar one four miles away, he says. Can't help feeling that that we'll wake up and find interest rates are 5% higher than the deputy governor of the Bank of England says today (Charlie Bean suggested on Sunday they might reach 5% in a decade) There's a mystery guest at Camp Alphaville -- Ian Hannam, the City dealmaker who lost his appeal against a conviction for market abuse earlier this year. Hannam, once of JP Morgan, fell foul of the City watchdog by disclosing 'inside' information about clients before it had been released to the market. Hannam says the last four and a half years haven't been great, and \"We've all learned a lot\". And on his case, he says: The definition of what is market abuse is pretty wide...and that has big implications for everyone in the markets. In between correcting Paul Murphy on his precise former title (afraid I missed it), Hannam explains that being accused of market abuse is no fun. At the start, you can't discuss it with anyone, even your colleagues or wife. One reason he fought on, he says, is that he reckons the process wasn't right... I'm not quite sure everyone in the room is convinced, though... Bit of muttering about justifying selling one's own grandmother As Barb Jacobson, of the European Citizen's initiative for a basic income, puts it, a basic income should be high enough for everyone to have a dignified life in society, and to take part in society. But won't people just spend the cash in the pub, and sit around doing nothing? In an era where some countries are running unemployment rates of 10%, or 20%, it's wrong to say that some people shouldn't be doing nothing, another panelist suggests. Just popped my head into a discussion on basic income at Camp Alphaville, chaired by Frances Coppola, the financial blogger and commentator. (this is the idea that you guarantee everyone a minimum level of income, rather than operating a range of welfare payments). Frances is explaining how technological change means we must consider basic income policies. Her own job, for example, didn't exist even 15 years ago. And with research saying half of all job types in America won't exist in 30 years time, policy makers need to adjust. As Frances puts it: How do we deal with people's fears, and how do we deal with the reality of work today? Another attendee argues that the welfare system needs to be redefined -- \"A welfare system that keeps people fit for work is not what we are talking about\"; today, and in the future, it must be more focused on helping the less fortunate through their lives. And a simple basic income payment will be more efficient, as well as fairer.... If the law authorities had \"any balls at all\" they wouldn't allow the European Central Bank to print \u20ac500 notes, says David Birch of Consult Hyperion, at Camp Alphaville. He's explaining how much cash is tied up in criminal activities - another reason for changing the way money works. He suggests that the future of central banks is to become the protector of your identity, rather than of your money. With those protestors out of the way, the crowd at Camp Alphaville are listening to Guy Debelle, assistant governor of the Royal Bank of Australia. He's video-conferencing in remotely, 'by robot' -- proof that technology can cut costs and save you a flight round the world, he says (cue a few hiccups between London and Australia) Debelle's talking about the future of money -- saying 'the death of cash has been foretold many times', and cash keeps showing up at its own funeral. He's arguing that central bankers still have a role, despite tech disruption - saying people will always want money to work as a store of value, and exchange of value, so central banks still have a role. And of course, government will still need money for revenue generation -- we seem able to tax everyone but tech companies, he jokes. Debelle's not too convinced that the punter in the street will embrace crypto-currencies, and argues that cash won't be subsumed by a swath of rivals. Only one would win out as a credible rival. And there's no major impact on macro-economics from these crypto-currencies, he suggests - but there are interesting micro-implications Oh, and he suggests that if Scotland goes for independence it could be used as a test bed for some of these currencies. Back over at the HAC in London, Camp Alphaville is about to begin.... And it starts with a bang - with a couple of attendees interrupting Paul Murphy, Alphaville editor, and apparently trying to rush the stage! They've been escorted out... My colleague Sarah Butler has filed a report from the Sports Direct meeting but here's a flavour: Mike Ashley has succeeded in pushing through his controversial bonus scheme at Sports Direct, despite fierce opposition from shareholder lobby groups. Just over 60% of votes cast were in favour of the scheme, which links a bonus for Ashley to a company-wide scheme that would hand around 3,000 permanent staff 25m free shares \u2013 worth around \u00a3180m at the current share price \u2013 if the firm doubles earnings by 2019. But Sports Direct has angered investors by refusing to spell out how many of the shares Ashley is entitled to. Ashley, who owns 58% of Sports Direct, did not vote at the meeting held at the group's Shirebrook headquarters to approve the scheme. Just three independent investors turned up at the meeting which lasted barely five minutes and during which Ashley refused to comment. He left immediately afterwards in a helicopter. Here's the link to the Sports Direct announcement. And here's the chairman's comments: Speaking at the General Meeting, Keith Hellawell, Non-Executive Chairman of Sports Direct International plc, said: \"On behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank our shareholders for their support and participation in this process. Sports Direct's Employee Bonus Share Scheme is one of the most wide reaching and successful employee reward schemes in the UK. The success of the scheme is demonstrated by the substantial shareholder value created over the last five years. \"The Board and the Remuneration Committee responded to the feedback received from shareholders and today's vote in favour of the resolution will ensure that the Group continues to retain and motivate its hard-working employees. The resolution today also recognises the substantial contribution made by Mike Ashley over many years and, as demonstrated by the previous schemes, has the potential to create a further significant increase in shareholder value.\" (These figures exclude Ashley's stake). Just in - Mike Ashley's bonus is safe. Some 60% of Sports Direct shareholders have voted in favour of the controversial scheme, despite much advice to kick it into touch. Something a little different is happening in London today. Our friends at FT Alphaville are holding a festival of finance -- not unlike Glastonbury, but with more economics and less mud. A clutch of experts are appearing, discussing issues such as the Chinese economy, the Argentinian debt battle, the merits of basic income and the impact of robotics on the world economy. And Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, is speaking (at 5pm) on a panel called \"Is this nuts?\" The full agenda is here. It looks fun: So I'm heading down there now.....My colleague Nick Fletcher will hold the fort at the office.... Blink and you missed it. Sports Direct has held one of the quickest shareholder meetings in the history of the City today - getting the whole business done in barely five minutes. The EGM, in Nottingham, was called to approve, or block, a new incentive scheme that could deliver whopping bonuses for founder Mike Ashley. We don't have the result yet - but Ashley himself hasn't hung around, and is already flying back in his helicoptor. Retail journalists, including my colleague Sarah Butler and Nic Fildes of The Times, captured the events: Alistair Cotton, corporate trader at Currencies Direct, explains that the strength of the pound (to $1.716 today), is a double-edged sword: \"For the man in the street, it means imported goods will be cheaper, buying a place in the sun more realistic, and a holiday abroad cheaper \u2013 someone changing \u00a3500 spending money into dollars will effectively be getting an extra $114 (or saving \u00a367). But for exporters \u2013 the people whose good performance indirectly pushed the pound up \u2013 those trying to sell their goods via eBay or someone trying to sell-up their property overseas, it\u2019s less good news.\" \u201cHowever, manufacturers faced a tougher time before the crash of 2008, when sterling was over $2. Although we don\u2019t expect to see a return to those levels, we do expect the pound to strengthen further in the near term. This week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting and next week\u2019s Bank of England meeting \u2013 and, perhaps more importantly, the minutes released the week afterwards \u2013 could deliver a further boost.\u201d Heads-up: MPs are holding a hearing this afternoon into concerns that financial benchmarks (such as the daily foreign exchange fixes) are being manipulated. It starts at 2.45pm: Now this is interesting.... BBC's Newsnight show is reporting that the UK government is considering emergency measures to kick-start house-building in Britain. It's an Allegra Stratton scoop. She writes: In leaked documents, officials warn the last set of figures before the 2015 general election will reveal house building to have decreased by 4%. House building is likely to loom quite large as an election issue. The government said pressure would be brought to bear on \"slow-coach councils\" to deliver on new build. The decrease is worrying the government after it expended quite considerable political capital on planning reform and other measures to boost house building. Full story: Ministers warned of decrease in house building Today's PMI construction data (online here) doesn't include any indications that builders are worried about this. But perhaps they should be.... Stefan Friedhoff, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, is also cheered by today's construction data: \u201cClearly much of the positive news is coming from the residential sector, with demand for new houses high. However, with the commercial market continuing to recover, there is evidence of ever-improving health across the entire sector. But he also points to concerns over \"rising raw materials prices and reports of bottlenecks in some supply chains.\u201d David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says the \"construction boom\" means the sector should deliver \"sustained growth\" in the months ahead. He's encouraged the builders were confident to take on more staff at such a rapid rate, but is also worried about supply shortages: \u201cWhilst the headline figures this month painted a positive picture, let\u2019s not forget about the underlying pressures on building materials and manpower at supplier levels. Delivery times continued to lengthen a great deal and prices were pushed up. Pressure on suppliers needs to be watched if the sector wants to maintain a steady growth trajectory.\u201d The pound has hit its highest level since October 2008, following the news that the UK construction sector has posted its strongest growth in four months. Sterling jumped 0.3 of a cent against the US dollar to $1.718, a new near-six year high. Output across Britain's building industry has hit a four-month high, as the good UK economic news keeps coming. Markit's monthly PMI index jumped to 62.6 in June from 60.0 in May, the highest reading since February. That shows that growth accelerated across the sector. As Markit put it: Strong rebound in growth momentum across the UK construction sector, driven by faster expansions of housing and commercial building activity. Construction firms also reported that they are taking on staff at the fastest rate since the survey began in 1997. Volumes of new work received by UK construction companies increased sharply in June and at the fastest pace since January. Stronger demand for new construction projects in turn led to a rapid increase in staffing levels, with the rate of job creation accelerating to its sharpest since the survey began over 17 years ago. This is primarily due to a resurgence in housebuilding. While commercial property construction picked up, civil engineering growth slowed - as this chart shows: However.... optimism among construction firms has fallen to its lowest level in six months, with some in the industry noting the increased risk of interest rate rises. Reaction to follow... Over in the European parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage is predicting that Southern Europe's economic troubles will continue through the decade. J\u00fcrgen Baetz, the Associated Press's Brussels correspondent, has the details: If Destination Maternity succeeds in taking Mothercare over, it could benefit from the lower tax rates in the UK compared with America. This was a factor behind another recent takeover battle -- Pfizer's failed chase for AstraZeneca. My colleague Sean Farrell explains. The Philadelphia-based company said the combined business would be incorporated in the UK with its shares listed in the US. Destination Maternity's statement did not mention tax arrangements but its approach follows other takeover proposals by US companies seeking to take advantage of Britain's lower corporation tax. AstraZeneca and Shire, the drugs companies, have both rebuffed approaches proposing a so-called tax inversion into the UK by US competitors. More here: Mothercare rejects \u00a3266m approach from US firm Destination Maternity Baby goods retailer Mothercare is fighting off an unsolicited takeover approach from a US rival. Destination Maternity, the world's largest supplier of maternity clothes, has revealed that it has made two approaches to its UK rival, but both were rejected. The second one valued Mothercare at \u00a3266m, or 300p each. Shares in Mothercare surged 12% after the news broke, up 30p to 262p this morning. Ed Krell, Destination Maternity's chief executive, told the City that the two companies would make an \"undisputed global leader in maternity, baby and young children's apparel and products\". Krell is also trying to lure Mothercare to the negotiating table. \"We believe the combination would create a highly attractive opportunity to accelerate the growth and development of both businesses and generate substantial value for our respective shareholders. Given this, we are seeking to engage with the board of Mothercare on a constructive basis with the goal of completing a recommended transaction.\" Spain's troubled unemployment market has continued to recover. The Labour Ministry reports that the number of people registered as unemployed fell by 122,684 in June, bringing the total down to 4,449,701. In seasonally adjusted terms, unemployment decreased by 16,113 people; which is the biggest drop in the seasonally adjusted unemployment since June 2001. Spanish unemployment has now fallen for eleven months running, on a seasonally adjusted basis (stripping out volatile factors like tourism and agriculture). Secretary of state for employment, Engracia Hidalgo, said such as \"prolonged downward trend\" has not been recorded since 1999. Analysts had actually expected an even bigger fall, of around 150,000. Over the last 12 month, Spain's registered unemployment total has fallen by 313,979 people, as the economy exited recession. But the number of people on temporary contracts jumped by 26.23% over the last year, suggesting maybe people are still in a precarious position, even after finding work. More details here. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, explains how London is skewing the overall house price data: \u201cWhile all regions recorded annual price gains for the fourth quarter in a row, there is still significant variation across the UK, with the South of England continuing to record the strongest rates of growth. In particular, London continued to outperform, with prices up by almost 26% in Q2 compared to the same period of 2013. \u201cThe price of a typical property in London reached the \u00a3400,000 mark for the first time, with prices in the capital now around 30% above their 2007 highs and more than twice the level prevailing in the rest of the UK when London is excluded. In the UK as a whole, prices are less than 1% above their pre-crisis peak. Excluding London they are 0.4% below peak. And here's a couple more Nationwide charts, from ITV's Joel Hills. Here's the headline points from the Nationwide building society's house price report, which shows that the average price has hit a new all time high: This regional data show how London house prices have soared ahead in the last year: Last week, the Bank of England said that lenders should restrict the number of loans that are more then 4.5 times a borrowers income, to just 15% of their total lending. This charts shows that lenders are, on average, below that level. Some early reaction to the news that London house prices have jumped 25% in the last 12 months: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Plenty of economic data coming up this morning, starting with the news that London house prices have surged by a jaw-dropping 25% in the last year. Nationwide's latest figures show that the housing market in the capital is racing along at a pace not seen since 1987 \u2013 which will surely add to fears of a housing bubble in London (although the rest of the country isn't keeping pace) As my colleague Hilary Osborne reports, house prices are showing double-digit growth in all London boroughs. In Lambeth, the south London borough that includes Brixton and parts of Clapham, prices were 37% higher in the second quarter of 2014 than a year previously, while in Camden in north London they were up by 36%. The lowest growth rate in the capital was in Barking &amp; Dagenham, where prices increase by 15% year-on-year. London house prices up 25% in rise unequalled since 1987, data shows Other parts of the country are not experiencing the same surge -- but average prices are still up by 11.8% in the last 12 months. The average house price is above the 2007 peak (it broke through last month). I'll pull together reaction and key charts in a moment What else is coming up? New Spanish labour market figures are due this morning (8am BST I think), and should show a drop in unemployment. Sports Direct will ask its shareholders to approve its latest bid to get founder (and billionaire) Mike Ashley a juicy bonus package, at an AGM this morning. UK construction data, due at 9.30am, will show how Britain's builders performed in May. And stock markets are expected to be calm, after Wall Street hit fresh record highs last night. We'll be tracking the main action through the day...",

      "bodyText": "The first low-cost transatlantic flights since Freddie Laker\u2019s doomed Skytrain enterprise have left Gatwick airport for Los Angeles, a development that Gatwick describes a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the debate over where to build a new runway in London. As well as the twice-weekly service to LA, Norwegian will operate two flights a week to Fort Lauderdale, where the majority of the cabin crew will be based, while a London-New York service has its first flight on Thursday. The new operation from Norwegian Air Shuttle has attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, for taking advantage of differing international legislation to circumvent labour costs and buy aircraft on more favourable terms than competitors. Consumers will also struggle to find a seat at the advertised cheapest fares, on the relatively few long-haul services that Norwegian runs. Only seven of its 95 planes are capable of transatlantic flights. Norwegian will run a service pitched somewhere between the low-cost European model and traditional transatlantic carriers, with seat-back entertainment included but food and luggage incurring extra charges. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Bj\u00f8rn Kos, said: \u201cAt Norwegian, we believe that everyone should be able to afford to fly. In order to compete in the global airline industry you need to adapt to changes and keep a constant focus on cost. \u201cNorwegian has a low-cost model, meaning a lean administration, brand new and fuel-efficient aircraft and efficient operations. We fly direct routes with high passenger demand and choose centrally located airports such at Gatwick that share our mindset.\u201d Kos says costs have been driven down by the fuel efficiency of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane. The airline, which already operates similar services between Thailand, Scandinavia and the US, has come under fire in Norway and elsewhere for employing crew in Bangkok on Singaporean contracts. Unions have accused Norwegian of undermining labour conventions, with the ITF likening its pursuit of operating licences to the shipping practice of registering vessels under flags of convenience. Norwegian said it established its long-haul company in Dublin for its air traffic rights as an EU nation and to maintain export guarantees to finance its fleet orders, and that the airline fully complies with European safety standards. Pilots union Balpa said concerns remained, although a ruling in the US has prevented Norwegian from using pilots from Bangkok on the new Gatwick routes. Balpa said: \u201cThe use of European pilots on this new route will reassure passengers who may otherwise have been concerned about an airline associated with a particular country by name which is in fact cherry-picking another country to oversee its safety standards and yet another to employ its pilots.\u201d For Gatwick, however, the Norwegian long-haul launch is a milestone in its battle for expansion. Its chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: \u201cA low-cost carrier flying to the Big Apple for a small price shows how fast aviation is changing and highlights one of a series of future trends that will have a huge bearing on the UK\u2019s runways debate.\u201d The airport unveiled a new report by independent aviation consultant Chris Tarry, which set out how the latest generation of aircraft could affect London airport expansion, with a fuel economy, size and range that lowers the need for connecting passengers and opens up the development of low-cost long-haul services. Tarry\u2019s report says Gulf expansion would also lower the demand for connections in a London hub, but he believes that traffic will grow due to the strength of the capital as a destination in its own right. Wingate added: \u201cAs this new report outlines, it is the airlines\u2019 fleet plans and order books of today that hold the key to the expansion needs of tomorrow. New generation aircraft and other key trends will lead to a reduction in \u2018hub\u2019 connecting traffic, an increase in point-to-point services and the continued growth of low-cost carriers, all of which are cornerstones of Gatwick\u2019s case for a second runway.\u201d He added: \u201cHeathrow\u2019s plans are yesterday\u2019s solution to tomorrow\u2019s problem and that only expansion of Gatwick can meet the challenges and demands of the future.\u201d",

It extended the length of the performance period from two to four years; the targets were made harder; and Ashley's incentives were wrapped up within a \u00a3200m scheme that will cover all 3,000 or so permanent staff. But the last of these explanations is a nonsense because Sports Direct refuses to say how much of that \u00a3200m has been earmarked for Ashley. Last time around, under the tailor-made plan, he was being offered about \u00a370m, which was deemed far too rich for a public company. The precedent would have been appalling. But the 60% of shareholders voting for the latest plan may now have sanctioned \u00a370m anyway. Shareholders have no way of knowing what Ashley's award will be. If it is \u00a370m, they will have allowed Sports Direct to smuggle in via the back door an award that was kiboshed when the company knocked on the front door.

Ashley has a 58% stake worth about \u00a32.5bn and thus does not lack motivation to put in a decent shift as an executive deputy chairman. Sports Direct's chairman, Keith Hellawell, looks a patsy in his arrogant refusal to set out the terms of Ashley's award.

      "bodyText": "Britain's construction industry powered ahead in June as companies hired staff at its fastest ever rate to cope with a sharp rise in house building. A snapshot of the UK's building sector signalled a positive contribution to the wider economy in the second quarter as new orders continued to pile up last month. The Markit/CIPS construction PMI rose to 62.6 in June from 60 in May, where anything above 50 indicates growth. It matched February's figure, and beat City forecasts of a slight drop to 59.5. The pound rose to a near six-year high against the dollar when the data was published, to $1.718. The biggest driver of growth was housebuilding, which jumped to 66.6 from 62.7 a month earlier, but commercial property building and civil engineering also continued to grow. Bigger workloads encouraged companies to take on workers at the fastest rate since the survey began more than 17 years ago. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the record job creation represented \"a remarkable yardstick of progress as the sector looks to recover the ground lost over the past seven years\". Moore said: \"A key recent development across the construction sector has been the return to pre-recession rates of job creation, following a prolonged period of falling payroll numbers and cuts to operating capacity.\" The equivalent survey for the manufacturing sector published on Tuesday showed workloads in Britain's factories are also rising above expectations, with the fastest growth in output in a generation. Economists said the latest figures suggested the economy was on course for stronger growth in the second quarter. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"It looks increasing probable that GDP growth in the second quarter was even stronger than the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate achieved in the first quarter.\" The first estimate of growth between April and June will be published by the Office for National Statistics on 25 July. Archer added that the strength of the data would drive up expectations that a first rise in interest rates could come before the end of 2014, after mixed messages from the Bank of England in recent weeks. Rates have been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009.",
