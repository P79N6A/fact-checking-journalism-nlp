      "bodyText": "Oh, and here\u2019s a photo of Alexis Tsipras voting tonight (note the now-traditional lack of a tie) Greek government ministers look pleased to have got this confidence vote out of the way. So, Greece\u2019s government has proved that it has the support of a majority in the Athens parliament, and also declared that it will deliver on its electoral promises and renegotiate its debt deal. That sets up a clash with Europe, starting in Brussels on Wednesday night. It\u2019s going to be a big day, as Bloomberg\u2019s Lorcan Roche Kelly explains here: Tomorrow is Going to be Huge for Europe Tomorrow is already today in Athens, and will be in Britain too before too long. So it\u2019s goodnight from us. GW It\u2019s a wrap. Sounds like every member of the Greek government backed it tonight -- just as well, really, given they were only sworn in two weeks ago. Yup, it\u2019s official. Alexis Tsipras has the votes to win tonight\u2019s confidence vote. That is formal confirmation that his government has enough support in the chamber to press on with its legislative programme. But tomorrow night\u2019s eurogroup meeting may show just how high the hurdles will be, The result is coming in too... Helena\u2019s verdict is in: Next, the vote of confidence. This shouldn\u2019t be a problem for the government, as it holds 162 of the 300 seats. That could be tricky to pull off.... The Greek PM is also pledging to meet all his pre-election promises; not leaving much wriggle-room. Tsipras is now urging Greek people to support him, saying Athens can\u2019t be blackmailed by Europe while they are by his side. As we flagged up earlier today, Greece\u2019s government insists it is receiving support from America\u2019s government. Tsipras says that Greece will seek a deal, to allow it to fulfill its debt obligations and allow it to repair its economy and return to growth. Onto specifics, and Tsipras confirms that his government will seek a short-term arrangement, to give them time and space to agree a longer deal. No obvious self-doubt in Tsipras\u2019s speech: Hard to argue with this one: Hard to argue... Tsipras warns that the Europe of democracy and solidarity, values and people, could give way to a Europe of \u201cterror, division &amp; destabilization\u201d, if the wrong decisions are taken. Tsipras is hammering home that Europe has reached a historic point (one of many in the crisis). The decisions taken in the coming days will determine whether Europe can remain united, he says. The election on 25 January marked the end of a political regime, Tsipras says. Tsipras: It won\u2019t simply be Yanis Varoufakis at the eurogroup meeting on Wednesday night, but 10 million Greeks, including poor people and neo-immigrants. Alexis Tsipras tells the Greek parliament that it is essential for all of Europe, not just Greece, that his government succeeds in reshaping its bailout programme. He also declares that his government has made a cracking start: Time for the new PM..... Samaras ends his speech saying: \u201cThere\u2019s something worse than a kolotumba (u-turn) - and that\u2019s taking the country to the rocks [of disaster]\u201d Helena Smith watched former prime minister Antonis Samaras take the stand in countdown to the tonight\u2019s vote in the Greek parliament. He\u2019s in fine form, she Helena Smith, decimating the new government\u2019s economic policies. \u201cYou\u2019ve been told no regarding to renegotiating the debt, no to the international conference [to discuss the debt] no to everything,\u201d he told the chamber as the man who ousted him Alexis Tsipras looked up. \u201cAnd don\u2019t dare endanger our foreign policy that with great effort and toil we worked to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course we are not going to give you a vote of confidence in policies that bear witness to your wrong views \u2026 you will lead the country to the rocks unless you change course, which you will have to do, very soon \u2026 Make sure you don\u2019t give ammunition to enemies of Greece.\u201d The former premier has managed to raise a laugh or two. At one point he actually impersonated the new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis exclaiming \u201cwow, as the finance minister likes to say!.\u201d Not sure that Samaras is winning many votes.... Greece\u2019s previous prime minister, Antonis Samaras, is now addressing the chamber, warning that the crisis could explode: And in a remarkable bare-faced move, Samaras is now lecturing prime minister Tsipras for not (yet) asking for a longer bailout extension -- something *he* turned down in December. Impressive, in its own way. Hello again. The Greek confidence debate is heading towards a vote. While we were offline... the economy minister promise that the ERT station would reopen soon, having been forcibly shut in 2013. And also promised more protection for householders facing eviction PS: The confidence vote result is due after midnight Athens time (after 10pm GMT), so the blog will burst back into life at some point. The debate is continuing in Athens, with the head of the health ministry laying out plans to strengthen the service. Diane has it covered: With several hours to go until the Greek confidence vote (which Tsipras will surely win), I\u2019m going to suspend proceedings. Might pop back later tonight if there are major developments. In the meantime... The Greek stock market has surged 8%, on hopes that the deal being pulled together by the Athens finance ministry will ease the crisis. Bank stocks rallied by almost 20%. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has just told MPs that Greece is entering the post-bailout world. He promised to walk unbowed into the eurogroup meeting tomorrow night, and slammed 30% of the current bailout as \u2018toxic\u2019, saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to even consider a clash, you\u2019re not negotiating.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not seeking a clash. We will do everything to avoid it. But you\u2019re not negotiating if you\u2019ve ruled it out.\u201d But Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has tried to crush hopes of a compromise. He says a deal won\u2019t be agreed at Wednesday night\u2019s eurogroup, and reiterated that Greece must stick to its commitments. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has held a \u2018positive\u2019 call with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee progress.... Some EU officials have also admitted they are \u2018infuriated\u2019 by Greece\u2019s stance, suggesting tomorrow\u2019s meeting could be fiery. Most Greeks support Tsipras, though, according to a new poll. Check out our lunchtime summary for highlights of this morning\u2019s action, including analysis of the compromise plan we expect Varoufakis to outline to his fellow eurozone finance ministers at Wednesday\u2019s eurogroup. Lunchtime summary: Hopes grow of Greek deal Here\u2019s Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis telling the Athens parliament that Greece\u2019s post-bailout era starts tonight. Varoufakis also said that 30% of the austerity programme is \u201ctoxic\u201d, and declared: \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to even consider a clash, you\u2019re not negotiating.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not seeking a clash. We will do everything to avoid it. But you\u2019re not negotiating if you\u2019ve ruled it out.\u201d Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets have published a preview note of Wednesday\u2019s crunch eurogroup meeting, titled \u201cHigh noon in Brussels\u201d. They write this evening: \u201cThe chasm between the positions of Greece and its creditors remains as vast as ever, as illustrated by yesterday\u2019s remark by German finance minister Sch\u00e4uble, who said that if Greece didn\u2019t want help \u201cthat was fine by him\u201d. Meanwhile, pronouncements by various Greek cabinet members in recent days have also done nothing to smooth over the growing rift. In particular, Varoufakis\u2019 latest warning that a Greek exit may precipitate other member states\u2019 departure from the euro area seems both incorrect and counterproductive, having no doubt incensed several other member states. We therefore believe that a considerable amount of diplomatic reconciliation is needed, not least at the heads of state level on Thursday, before a substantial agreement on plugging Greece\u2019s near-term funding gap can be found. At tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting the Commission will reportedly propose a six-month extension of the programme review period in which the ECB could re-admit Greek bonds as collateral in its refinancing operations. But unless there is a credible commitment by Greece to fully implement the programme conditions, we doubt that this proposal will be satisfactory for other member states and the ECB. Meanwhile, the latest Greek proposal for a bridging solution of ECB profit disbursement and higher T-bill issuance is unlikely to be wholly acceptable to creditors and would also seem unlikely to cover Greek redemptions and loan repayments until August. Overall, we believe that the Eurogroup is still not minded to offer anything other than a re-activation of the soon-to-lapse bailout review process, possibly with only minor concessions in terms of policy conditionality. Not sure if this is a good omen, or not, but it\u2019s snowing in Athens tonight. The head of Greece\u2019s KKE communist party, Dimitris Koutsoubas, did not take up the invitation to support the new government. Instead, Koutsoubas bluntly argued that the Greece government\u2019s six-month \u2018bridging programme\u2019 is effectively a bailout extension (something Alexis Tsipras had ruled out on Sunday night). Varoufakis concludes by repeating that he rejects around 30% of the existing austerity programme, and urges opposition MPs to support him in the eurogroup negotiations: But will Greece walk out the same way?... Varoufakis may be an expert in game theory, but he insists he\u2019s not playing games in these negotiations: Yanis Varoufakis rules out accepting any bailout terms that raise Greece\u2019s debt levels: Now finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is addressing the Athens parliament. He declares that Greece is on the brink of the post-bailout era (we\u2019ll see what Germany thinks about that) and also savages the mistakes that caused Greece\u2019s depression. Venizelos is also querying exactly what Yanis Varoufakis means when he says he only rejects 30% of the bailout programme: Back in the Athens parliament, the former deputy prime minister is chiding the new government for not communicating its plans better. Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos (who experienced a few debt crisis meetings in his time) said MPs are being asked to support Alexis Tsipras without knowing what will be offered to the eurogroup. Diane Shugart has the details: Venizelos also cautions Tsipras against expecting too much: Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, sums up the too-ing and fro-ing in recent days: Greek politicians are walking a tightrope of shouting condemnation of the previous bailout package loud enough that their voters can hear but also whispering compromises to EU bureaucrats to try and get a deal done. In the meantime, markets are getting pushed around on every report that indicates a move towards or away from compromise by either side. Greece\u2019s finance ministry has come out with a statement tonight, denying a report that the government intends to go back on its decision to drop the privatisation of Pireaus port. The Wall Street Journal had earlier cited a ministry official as saying the sale of Pireaus Port authority would go ahead. Syriza has made it a cornerstone of its economic programme not to denationalise state assets as Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the country\u2019s energy minister and head of the party\u2019s militant Left Platform, emphasized earlier today (see 10.51am GMT) Lafazanis came out with some hard talk today about privatisations being put on hold. As mentioned earlier, Yanis Varoufakis takes a more moderate stance on the issue and has insisted that any privatisation that has already be embarked on will not be stopped (via Helena Smith). There will also be demonstrations in support of Greece in other cities on Wednesday night, including in Germany, Italy and Portugal. And next weekend, there will be a demo in Edinburgh on Saturday, and in London, Amsterdam and Brussels (among others) on Sunday. There\u2019s a full list here. Heads-up. There will be pro-government demonstrations across Greece tomorrow night, to show the eurogroup that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government has their support. Teneo Intelligence analyst Wolf Piccoli says Sch\u00e4uble has punctured excessive expectations. Reminder: the eurogroup of \u20ac-finance ministers also meets next Monday... Officials close to Alexis Tsipras are saying that the Greek prime minister has had positive telephone contact with EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. That may be further confirmation that a compromise between Greece and its creditors is in the offing (although Wolfgang Schauble says differently) The ten-minute chat apparently took place \u201cin a very good climate\u201d and was initiated by Tsipras, our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Officials were cited as saying that the call was further proof that Athens\u2019 proposed bridging programme was on the table and being discussed. \u201cWhether it is called that or described as an extension so that it is endorsed by other European parliaments, what is important is that the Greek positions are being taken into account,\u201d they said. The Greek premier is likely to refer to the negotiations when he delivers a final speech before the 300-seat House ahead of the midnight vote of confidence in his government. And sources at the Commission have told Reuters that the call was held in a \u201cpositive spirit\u201d. PHONE CALL BETWEEN EU\u2019S JUNCKER, GREEK PM TSIPRAS WAS HELD IN \u201cPOSITIVE SPIRIT OF COOPERATION\u201d-EU COMMISSION - REUTERS The US Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, has fired a verbal warning shot at Europe tonight, saying fiscal policy should be looser. That\u2019s a clear nudge at Germany. Lew also cautioned against idle talk of Greece leaving the eurozone. US TREASURY SECRETARY LEW SAYS EUROPE NEEDS MORE FISCAL POLICY, THERE IS A DEMAND SHORTFALL US TREASURY SECRETARY LEW SAYS THERE SHOULD NOT BE CASUAL TALK ABOUT A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD LEAVE GREECE OR EU IN UNSTABLE POSITIONS Here we go.... Germany\u2019s finance minister has declared that the eurogroup won\u2019t agree a new deal for Greece on Wednesday night. Sounding as uncompromising as ever, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble declared that Greece is solely responsible for its problems, and insisted that Athens needs to deliver a binding, credible programme to its creditors. Hopes of a breakthrough in Brussels tomorrow night have driven the Athens stock market up by 8% tonight, bouncing back from yesterday\u2019s selloff. Bank shares surged by as much as 20%, as investors showed optimism that the compromise plan being devised by finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and colleagues might help ease the crisis. However, the Athens closed just before those reports from Brussels that officials are infuriated with Greece. This story has some way to run yet... Back in the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has wheeled out Greece to defend the government\u2019s record.  Except, of course, that Britain\u2019s debt/GDP ratio was nowhere near Greece\u2019s, and the Bank of England was prepared to swallow up government debt to keep borrowing costs down. It\u2019s early days of course, but Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government does appear to enjoy strong public support for its bailout stance. Even among some supporters of the previous government, according to a new poll tonight. Now this is interesting... Officials in Brussels are apparently \u2018infuriated\u2019 by some of the claims being put around by Greece ahead of tomorrow night\u2019s eurogroup meeting. That\u2019s via MNI: The carefully orchestrated dance between the new Greek government and its European creditors appeared to crack Tuesday, with top Brussels officials infuriated by what they see as wildly misleading claims coming from Athens. Apparent claims from Athens officials to other governments suggesting that the U.S. Treasury supports a plan by the Syriza-led government to alleviate Greece\u2019s debt, and that the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker either backed the plan or had an alternative himself, have enraged senior economy officials in Brussels. A senior European official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described the situation as \u201cberserk\u201d and said, \u201cthere is no plan.\u201d He added that the European Commission and U.S. Treasury were both perturbed at the way they had apparently been represented externally by Greek officials. A team from the U.S. Treasury led by Daleep Singh, deputy assistant secretary for Europe &amp; Eurasia, was in Athens late last week. \u201cThe Greeks are digging their own graves,\u201d the EU official said. #developing.... The US stock market has opened higher, on optimism that Greece and its creditors are moving towards a deal. The Dow Jones index is up by 80 points, or around 0.5%, in early trading. We shouldn\u2019t forget that the European Commission had originally proposed a six-month bailout extension late last year. Instead, former PM Antonis Samaras took a two-month window. That gamble failed after MPs rejected his candidate for the presidency, triggering the election won by Syriza. The German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s lightning visit to Washington yesterday is being seen as playing a big role in getting Berlin to \u201csee sense,\u201d analysts and officials are telling our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens. US president Barack Obama said he was looking forward to hearing how Merkel foresaw kickstarting growth in Greece, after the two leaders held talks on Monday. \u201cI look forward to hearing Angela\u2019s assessment of how Europe and the IMF can work with the new Greek government to find a way that returns Greece to sustainable growth within the euro zone,\u201d he told a news conference underling how critical such growth was to the global economy and the United States. \u201cGeopolitically Greece is very important,\u201d the former foreign minister Dora Bakoyannis told Helena in parliament where she was attending the debate ahead of tonight\u2019s confidence vote. \u201cThe situation in the Ukraine and with ISIS is very very serious \u2026. I don\u2019t think any of our partners in Europe wants to see catastrophe in Greece.\u201d Hopes are rising that Greece and its creditors will hammer out a compromise deal to extend its bailout programme, warding off the immediate threat of a default. The European Commission is rumoured to be proposing a six-month extension to Greece\u2019s existing bailout programme. According to the MNI news service, the EC might also ease up on Greece\u2019s budget surplus targets, from 4.5% of GDP to 1.5%-2%. That\u2019s much closer to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s own targets. Nothing\u2019s official yet. But the reports have driven shares higher in Athens, and pushed the yields on Greek bonds sharply lower. The EC\u2019s move follows last night\u2019s hints from the Greek government that it is also willing to compromise. The Athens finance ministry is expected to ask for a bridge loan to cover its funding needs until September, and also to propose new economic measures to replace around 30% of the existing bailout. It also hopes, in the long run, to execute a debt swap. There\u2019s a full breakdown of the Greek compromise plan, with analysis, here. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has told the Guardian that his team are working day and night to get a deal. He says: Because are committed to finding a solution we will do what we can to achieve a mutually beneficial solution. We will not be dogmatic \u2026 we are prepared to discuss everything except two things: perpetuating and producing this never-ending debt deflationary spiral and disavowing our own critique of this programme. But some MPs appear unwilling to compromise. Panagiotis Lafazanis, a government minister, has warned that Greece will not be blackmailed by Germany, and vowed to block the privatisations agreed under the old bailout progamme. Lafazanis also said the government would \u201clegally\u201d oppose a controversial Canadian gold mine project, suggesting a harder line on deals with foreign investors. Despite that, some financial analysts are hopeful that a deal can be done. Nick Kounis, head of macro and financial markets research at ABN Amro, says the key is for Greece to commit to reforms. \u201cEven on the German side you can see the possible contours of a deal. \u201cFor me, what\u2019s very important is the Greek Finance Ministry saying they are willing to embark on a new program of reforms. You could see a liquidity package on the basis there is enough space and commitment to reform. That would give them a few months to reach a bigger and longer deal.\u201d Richard McGuire, head of European rates strategy at Rabobank International in London, also sees a willingness to compromise. We\u2019re optimistic a resolution of some form will be forthcoming and possibly by the end of this month before the current bailout expires, which could see a marked retracement of the selloff we\u2019ve seen since the elections.\u201d But Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital cautions: It may well be that eurozone leaders view Mr Tsipras\u2019s speech on Sunday as being primarily for domestic purposes and that behind closed doors the Greek government will be prepared to compromise. However it is very unlikely that Ms Merkel will be prepared to allow the Greek government to set the economic policy for the Eurozone as a whole: the probability of her changing course 180 degrees is remote. Janis Emmanouilidis, director of studies at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, is optimistic. Greek officials backing up the growing talk that if it does come, a breakthrough will be found at next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. In parliament this morning, MPs (from both the ranks of the government and opposition) said whatever happened lenders would need time to digest any proposals that Athens made. For his part, the finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, told the Guardian that he and his team are working \u201cday and night\u201d to fine tune the proposal he will put on the table when his eurozone colleagues meet in Brussels tomorrow. Others, including the American economist Jamie Galbraith, have flown in to help. \u201cI\u2019m fully aware that we need face-saving narratives and I will work day and night to produce them and to suggest those narratives to them,\u201d Varoufakis told me, adding that the new government\u2019s programme was fiscally fully responsible. What Athens was going to offer would be a \u201cpretty good plan,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people are helping us. We are staying up to six, seven o\u2019clock in the morning to try to put this together,\u201d he explained, describing Wednesday\u2019s arbitrary deadline set by creditors, following the ECB\u2019s shock decision to no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral for further loans, as a \u201c incredible pressure and a challenge to democracy.\u201d Varoufakis added: Because are committed to finding a solution we will do what we can to achieve a mutually beneficial solution. We will not be dogmatic \u2026 we are prepared to discuss everything except two things: perpetuating and producing this never-ending debt deflationary spiral and disavowing our own critique of this program.\u201d Heads-up: the Greek PM might be chatting to the head of the European commission shortly. Another sign of a deal coming? The Greek stock market is rallying on the back of MNI\u2019s report that the EC will offer Greece a six-month extension. The main index is up almost 3.5%. Bond yields continue to recover too. Things appear to be moving fast for Greece. There are reports coming out of Brussels that the European commission will propose a six-month extension of the existing Greek bailout programme, at tomorrow night\u2019s eurogroup meeting. That\u2019s via the MNI news agency. It\u2019s not clear what terms are involved, but it sounds like the two sides might be edging towards some kind of compromise. A breakthrough between Greece and the rest of the eurozone is more likely to come at next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, rather than tomorrow night\u2019s emergency gathering. Gary Jenkins, City analyst at LNG Capital, reckons Greece\u2019s creditors could support some parts of its compromise plan, but aren\u2019t likely to agree to a debt swap. Here\u2019s his view of the key points \u2013 as laid out by the Kathimerini newspaper. It\u2019s quite long, but worth reading ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. 1) 30% of the memorandum be scrapped and replaced with 10 new reforms, which Greek officials are to agree with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Obviously the devil would be in the detail and it is impossible to comment without that. However, it is possible that some new reforms could be agreed upon and some old ones amended, so it is at least a negotiating point. 2) A reduction in Greece\u2019s primary surplus target of 3% of GDP to 1.49%. To some degree this is linked to (3) below, but considering the economic hardship endured by Greece it is difficult to believe that there would be no movement on this point. It may depend upon exactly what the money would be utilised for of course, but a reduction of this kind is unlikely to be the straw that breaks the eurozone\u2019s back. 3) A reduction of Greek debt through a swap plan. This is likely to be some kind of swap where the debt (or a portion of it) becomes linked to economic growth. Here we have a potential sticking point: Whilst I think that the Greek debt burden is too high, the fact is that the eurozone may regard it as \u2018sustainable\u2019 because of the duration of the debt and the interest rate. Thus they may think that it is \u2018sustainable\u2019 even if they do not think it is \u2018repayable\u2019. Therefore, they may not wish to consider any change to the debt load or any material changes to the terms at this stage. They may well agree to a further extension and / or a lowering of the interest rate (either now or at a later date if Greece sticks to the new deal), but they are unlikely to consider a write-down at this stage. The idea of linking the debt to GDP may be favoured by many economists, but the EZ may believe that the kind of monitoring that would be required would be beyond their relationship with the new government at this stage. However, this is a proposal that the EZ could push back on to demonstrate that they have not just rolled over to all of the Greek government\u2019s demands, and that the Greek government could sell to their people as \u2018work in progress\u2019, whilst pointing out all the concessions that they have won. 4) Greece\u2019s \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d is to be eased using measures set out in the government\u2019s policy program which was unveiled by prime minister Alexis Tsipras on Sunday night. This is linked to the other points and again the devil is in the detail. If the Greek government is allowed to run a lower primary surplus and use that money for \u2018humanitarian\u2019 purposes, it is difficult to see why the EZ would turn them aside. 5) Greece wants to secure the \u20ac1.9bn in profits from the Greek bonds held by the Eurosystem and will seek to issue T-bills, some \u20ac8bn above the \u20ac15bn limit which Greece has exceeded. Authorities are also keen to raise the threshold for emergency liquidity assistance from the European Central Bank. I\u2019m not sure about the \u2018profits\u2019 as to whether they are realised or mark to market. The T\u2013bills may be an acceptable compromise but I would imagine that the ELA would continue to be very tightly monitored. 6) A further portion of a pending \u20ac7.2bn loan tranche could also be drawn if required, essentially reversing the previous insistence by the government that it does not want the money. The EZ may not want the Greek government to draw down additional funds unless they publicly state that they remain in a programme. This is probably more about political face-saving for both parties and it would be surprising if some kind of wording could not be drawn up that was acceptable to both parties. However it could all fall down on the point of being in a programme or not. Greek bond yields are still falling today, on hopes of a compromise deal being agreed. But as this chart shows, they\u2019re still much higher than before the current crisis began. Newsflash from Brussels \u2013 the European commission isn\u2019t confident of a big breakthrough this week: Ed Balls, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, has told the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference in London that eurozone leaders have serious issues to tackle (but he didn\u2019t speak specifically about Greece). A Greek minister has declared that the new government will not be blackmailed by Germany into abandoning its anti-austerity programme. Panagiotis Lafazanis told the Athens parliament that there should be \u201cno doubt\u201d that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government will fully implement its \u201cradical, progressive\u201d programme. Lafazanis, the minister for productive reconstruction, environment and energy, also said that restoring industrial growth will be at the \u201ccore\u201d of the government\u2019s strategy. He also insisted that various planned sales of state assets will be cancelled. Such privatisations were simply nationalisations, to foreign powers, he said. But that may not please Greece\u2019s creditors, as privatisations are a key part of the bailout programme. Diane Shugart, who is doing a phenomenal job live-tweeting the confidence debate, has the details: Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times has written a (typically) excellent Q&amp;A on the Greek crisis. In it, he explains that European officials are worried that Greece could run out of money in March, rather than cling on until the summer. That\u2019s because Greek tax revenues are thought to have fallen sharply amid the political upheaval, leaving it short of cash for an IMF loan repayment. With no way to raise cash on the capital markets, and no bailout financing in place, Athens could literally go bust. A developed country defaulting on an IMF payment would be unprecedented. That\u2019s exactly why Athens wants a bridging loan, but there\u2019s a problem... This would seem an obvious and simple solution, but no such thing exists in the eurozone arsenal. The European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s new \u20ac500bn bailout fund, can fund full-scale bailouts, bank recapitalisation programmes and even purchase sovereign bonds on the open market. But it has no tool to offer a short-term loan. Besides, given demands from Berlin and elsewhere for Athens to stick to its bailout commitments, it is unlikely a bridge loan \u2014 even if it existed \u2014 would come without tough conditions akin to the current bailout. More here: Q&amp;A: Greece and the bridge to nowhere More commentators are waking up to the fact that Greece is likely to compromise at tomorrow night\u2019s eurogroup [as readers of this blog learned yesterday afternoon]. But, as the Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard points out, we don\u2019t know if Greece\u2019s lenders will play ball. Greece\u2019s defence minister has also waded into the bailout crisis, suggesting that Athens could tap \u201canother source\u201d for funding. Panos Kammenos told Mega television that Greece could seek funding from \u201cthe United States at best\u201d or even China or Russia, if a eurozone deal cannot be agreed. Kammenos declared: \u201cWhat we want is a deal.\u201d \u201cBut if there is no deal and if we see that Germany remains unbending and wants to blow Europe apart, then we have the obligation to go to Plan B. Plan B is to get funding from another source.\u201d That sounds alarming, but there are two reasons to be cautious. Kammenos\u2019s remit doesn\u2019t run to the finance ministry, and as the head of the Independent Greeks (the junior coalition partner) he may not be privy to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s inner thoughts. Back at the G20 meeting in Istanbul, Canada\u2019s finance minister has argued that Greece isn\u2019t the same threat to world stability as in 2012. Reuters has the details: Regulatory and financial reforms have helped diminish the risk Greece may pose to the euro zone, Canada\u2019s finance minister said on Tuesday, amidst growing concern about Athens\u2019 determination to ease austerity measures. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers, Joe Oliver also said the mood at the talks was \u2018determined\u2019, but not optimistic. One of the new Greek government\u2019s loudest media critics isn\u2019t too impressed by the compromise plan being drawn up in Athens: So, what is this compromise plan that is calming the Greek crisis this morning? As we wrote in yesterday\u2019s liveblog, it revolves around Wednesday night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance chiefs. Finance ministry sources have told us that Yanis Varoufakis will suggest a bridging loan until September, which Greece\u2019s creditors may well view as an extension of its existing bailout [which runs out in under three weeks]. That will create a window to haggle out a proper long-term deal with creditors. Varoufakis will accept 70% of the existing bailout programme, and offer 10 new measures to cover the 30% gap. Those new measures will be devised with the OECD (whose head, Angel Gurria, is in Athens today) And Greece will also hope to tap some of the \u20ac7bn bailout payment that is being withheld until Athens meets previous bailout targets. It sounds like the framework for a deal. But there\u2019s one major problem \u2013 no eurozone partner has said they\u2019ll back it. And Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble were adamant on Monday that Greece must stick to its bailout programme. So Varoufakis may find he has little room to manoeuvre. Another sign of rising confidence -- Greece\u2019s three-year and five-year bonds are also recovering this morning along with the benchmark 10-year bond. That is pushing down their yields too: GREEK THREE-YEAR BOND YIELDS FALL 165 BASIS POINTS TO 20.20% - TRADEWEB GREEK FIVE-YEAR YIELDS FALL 98 BPS TO 15.59% As flagged in the introduction, this follows yesterday\u2019s reports that Greece will ask for a bridging loan until September, and offer 10 new measures to replace existing austerity measures. Greece\u2019s stock market is rising in early trading, clawing back some of yesterday\u2019s big selloff. The main Athens index has gained more than 3%, with Greece\u2019s banks bouncing back [bank share prices have either jumped or tumbled by 10% on most days since Syriza won the general election last month] Greek bonds are rising, a little, in early trading, suggesting that investors are a little less worried about the crisis. This has pushed down the yield (or interest rate) on Greece 10-year bond to 10.9%, down from 11.3% on Monday night. That\u2019s still a worryingly high yield; anything over 7% means a country is basically locked out of the markets. But it suggests that yesterday\u2019s rumours that Greece might make some concessions at tomorrow night\u2019s eurogroup meeting may be creating some calm. George Osborne\u2019s warning may not reassure the City, where traders are already fretting about the Greek crisis. Investors have been unnerved by Sunday night\u2019s speech by Greece\u2019s prime minister, in which Alexis Tsipras vowed to overturn austerity and pursue Germany for war reparations. Stan Shamu, analyst at IG, says: After a period of relative calm following the ascension of Syriza to power, the type of rhetoric that investors were initially fearing is beginning to flow through. In the City, the FTSE 100 has dipped by 15 points in early trading. John Longworth, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce, sounds less worried than George Osborne about the Greek crisis. He reckons British business wouldn\u2019t actually be severely hurt if Greece left the eurozone. In a TV interview as the BCC\u2019s conference begins, Longworth said the UK exports relatively little to Greece. And with the European financial system stronger than in 2012, a Grexit probably would be containable. However... it would be a very different matter if the crisis then spread to other European countries, Longworth added. I suspect George Osborne\u2019s comments may not go down too well with the rest of Europe. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports that top diplomants in Brussels reacted with bemusement to David Cameron\u2019s emergency Grexit meeting on Monday. Is the UK making too much fuss? Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer has warned that the risks of a \u201cvery bad outcome\u201d from the ongoing Greek debt crisis has risen. Speaking in Istanbul, George Osborne told Bloomberg TV that there is a growing danger that the deadlock over Greece\u2019s bailout programme spirals out of control. And he cautioned that this could , potentially causing serious damage to the European economy, and the UK\u2019s too. Osborne raised the pressure on Athens, and its creditors, hours before tonight\u2019s Greek confidence vote, by declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the risks to the world economy, the risk to the British economy of this standoff between the euro zone and Greece, is growing each day. The risks of a miscalculation or a misstep leading to a very bad outcome are growing as well.\u201d Osborne said the UK had been arguing for both sides in the ongoing Greek crisis to \u201cfind some common ground\u201d, during the G20 meeting of finance ministers in Turkey. This comments come a day after prime minister David Cameron chaired a meeting of senior officials to discuss the impact on the UK of possible Greek exit from the eurozone. Osborne was blunt about the risks that a disorderly Grexit would pose to the global economy. There\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d that the UK economy would be affected by a renewed eurozone crisis, he told Bloomberg. Incidentally, Osborne is flying back to the UK today to appear at the annual conference of the British Chambers of Commerce in London, so we may hear from him again.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis, and other events across the world economy, the financial markets and business. It\u2019s another big day for Greece. The new government must win a vote of confidence late tonight, following another day of debate over Alexis Tsipras\u2019s new anti-austerity programme. The new coalition should win (it\u2019s got the votes), but the vote comes as Greece prepares for a crunch meeting of finance ministers on Wednesday night. As we reported in the blog yesterday, there are signs that Athens may be looking to compromise. Finance ministry sources suggest Greece will ask for a longer bridging loan, until September, and also propose new measures to replace the \u2018unacceptable\u2019 parts of the existing bailout. But there\u2019s no suggestion, yet at least, that European leaders will back it, for all Tsipras\u2019s optimism that he\u2019ll keep Greece in the euro: Last night\u2019s story: Greek banks hit by downgrades as PM vows to strike deal to stay inside euro Angel Gurr\u00eda, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is in town today. He\u2019s likely to support Tsipras\u2019s push for pro-growth reforms, to tackle Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day, as usual....",

In particular, Varoufakis\u2019 latest warning that a Greek exit may precipitate other member states\u2019 departure from the euro area seems both incorrect and counterproductive, having no doubt incensed several other member states. </p> <p>We therefore believe that a considerable amount of diplomatic reconciliation is needed, not least at the heads of state level on Thursday, before a substantial agreement on plugging Greece\u2019s near-term funding gap can be found. At tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting the Commission will reportedly propose a six-month extension of the programme review period in which the ECB could re-admit Greek bonds as collateral in its refinancing operations. But unless there is a credible commitment by Greece to fully implement the programme conditions, we doubt that this proposal will be satisfactory for other member states and the ECB. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the latest Greek proposal for a bridging solution of ECB profit disbursement and higher T-bill issuance is unlikely to be wholly acceptable to creditors and would also seem unlikely to cover Greek redemptions and loan repayments until August.</p> <p>Overall, we believe that the Eurogroup is still not minded to offer anything other than a re-activation of the soon-to-lapse bailout review process, possibly with only minor concessions in terms of policy conditionality.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54da49a8e4b07b1042c84d51\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-10T18:11:48.939Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Not sure if this is a good omen, or not, but it\u2019s snowing in Athens tonight.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/economistmeg/statuses/565210135622995968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Snow in Syntagma!

It\u2019s quite long, but worth reading ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting.</p> <p><strong>1) 30% of the memorandum be scrapped and replaced with 10 new reforms, which Greek officials are to agree with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Obviously the devil would be in the detail and it is impossible to comment without that. However, it is possible that some new reforms could be agreed upon and some old ones amended, so it is at least a negotiating point.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2) A reduction in Greece\u2019s primary surplus target of 3% of GDP to 1.49%.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> To some degree this is linked to (3) below, but considering the economic hardship endured by Greece it is difficult to believe that there would be no movement on this point. It may depend upon exactly what the money would be utilised for of course, but a reduction of this kind is unlikely to be the straw that breaks the eurozone\u2019s back.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3) A reduction of Greek debt through a swap plan.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is likely to be some kind of swap where the debt (or a portion of it) becomes linked to economic growth. Here we have a potential sticking point: Whilst I think that the Greek debt burden is too high, the fact is that the eurozone may regard it as \u2018sustainable\u2019 because of the duration of the debt and the interest rate. Thus they may think that it is \u2018sustainable\u2019 even if they do not think it is \u2018repayable\u2019.</p> <p>Therefore, they may not wish to consider any change to the debt load or any material changes to the terms at this stage. They may well agree to a further extension and / or a lowering of the interest rate (either now or at a later date if Greece sticks to the new deal), but they are unlikely to consider a write-down at this stage. The idea of linking the debt to GDP may be favoured by many economists, but the EZ may believe that the kind of monitoring that would be required would be beyond their relationship with the new government at this stage. </p> <p>However, this is a proposal that the EZ could push back on to demonstrate that they have not just rolled over to all of the Greek government\u2019s demands, and that the Greek government could sell to their people as \u2018work in progress\u2019, whilst pointing out all the concessions that they have won.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4) Greece\u2019s \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d is to be eased using measures set out in the government\u2019s policy program which was unveiled by prime minister Alexis Tsipras on Sunday night.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> This is linked to the other points and again the devil is in the detail. If the Greek government is allowed to run a lower primary surplus and use that money for \u2018humanitarian\u2019 purposes, it is difficult to see why the EZ would turn them aside. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5) Greece wants to secure the \u20ac1.9bn in profits from the Greek bonds held by the Eurosystem and will seek to issue T-bills, some \u20ac8bn above the \u20ac15bn limit which Greece has exceeded. Authorities are also keen to raise the threshold for emergency liquidity assistance from the European Central Bank.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not sure about the \u2018profits\u2019 as to whether they are realised or mark to market. The T\u2013bills may be an acceptable compromise but I would imagine that the ELA would continue to be very tightly monitored.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>6) </strong><strong>A further portion of a pending \u20ac7.2bn loan tranche could also be drawn if required, essentially reversing the previous insistence by the government that it does not want the money.<br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The EZ may not want the Greek government to draw down additional funds unless they publicly state that they remain in a programme. This is probably more about political face-saving for both parties and it would be surprising if some kind of wording could not be drawn up that was acceptable to both parties. However it could all fall down on the point of being in a programme or not.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-02-10T12:57:26.559Z\">at 12.57pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54d9e3bce4b08345573110d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-10T11:34:27.580Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greek bond yields are still falling today, on hopes of a compromise deal being agreed.</strong></p> <p>But as this chart shows, they\u2019re still much higher than before the current crisis began.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/565100763245215744\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> - New Deal?

However, they have not yet convinced the public that they are serious. Tax dodging is costing governments \u2013 both in the UK and in developing countries \u2013 billions. This is money which is vital for tackling poverty. But despite the positive rhetoric from politicians, our polling shows that only one in five people believe political parties have gone far enough in their promises to tackle tax avoidance by large companies. All parties are going to have to work hard to win back public confidence.</p> <p>The problems are multi-faceted and complex. A critical part of the solution is dealing with the secrecy of UK tax havens \u2013 as David Cameron promised to do as G8 chair in 2013, a pledge Ed Miliband attempted to trump on Saturday \u2013 but more is needed. Only a commitment to a full package of reforms will send the message that the problem is being taken seriously. This is why we, along with over 60 economists and academics, a range of faith leaders, responsible companies and more than 40,000 members of the public, have called for a commitment from all parties to bringing forward a tax-dodging bill in the first 100 days of the new government. Only this can convince the public that rhetoric will be turned into effective action.<br><strong>Jenny Ricks</strong> <em>Head of campaigns, ActionAid,</em> <strong>Christine Allen</strong> <em>Director of policy and public affairs, Christian Aid,</em> <strong>Duncan Exley</strong> <em>Director, Equality Trust, </em><strong>Martin Drewry </strong><em>Director, Health Poverty Action, </em><strong>Toni Pearce</strong> <em>President, NUS,</em> <strong>Nick Bryer</strong> <em>Head of UK policy and campaigns, Oxfam,</em> <strong>Stephen Brown</strong> <em>Director of Europe, The Global Poverty Project</em></p> <p>\u2022 Yet again a big company has been shown to be behaving improperly in relation to taxes. Recently it was suggested that Boots should be stopped from handling NHS prescriptions because of its abysmal record on paying its UK taxes. This excellent proposal should be extended to many other companies that similarly fall short.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>People caught fiddling more than the living wage should have their tax returns published</p> <footer> <cite>David Nowell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our country is fit to live in because of its essential infrastructure of transport, fire services, the police, education, the health service, the military and so on, all paid for with our taxes. So the next time a branch of Starbucks is burgled, let them sort it out themselves. When Amazon sends books to customers, using the public roads, it should pay a surcharge for every mile travelled. British American Tobacco pays no tax here, so how about doubling the duty on its cigarettes? I could go on. Only when direct action is taken against these immoral tax dodgers will they face up to their moral responsibilities.<br><strong>Neil Holmes</strong><br><em>Bromsgrove, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Clearly the UK authorities are treating tax evaders with kid gloves (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/08/hsbc-files-catalogue-malpractice-bankers-tax\" title=\"\">Catalogue of malpractice endorsed by bankers</a>, 9 February). In addition to criminal prosecutions, people caught fiddling more than the living wage should have their tax returns published in full, with only their most personal details redacted. Further sanctions as part of restorative justice could include having to sign on every fortnight to visit hard-pressed public services and explain to their staff and users how their fines and future taxes would benefit them.</p> <p>As with MPs\u2019 expenses, for far too long secrecy has allowed top-rate income tax payers to claim tax reliefs that they would be hard pressed to justify in public. Non-domiciled tax status must be abolished: it is farcical that Boris Johnson, with dual citizenship, has to pay US taxes, and yet British citizens can opt out altogether. As for those tax exiles and their families living in place like Monaco who have accepted public honours, there should be no hiding place: either they pay back the taxes they should have been paying like everybody else, or, like Fred Goodwin, their honours can be publicly withdrawn in a special issue of the London Gazette.<br><strong>David Nowell</strong><br><em>New Barnet, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your front-page article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/09/hsbc-files-hmrc-data-misconduct-stephen-green-trade-minister\" title=\"\">HMRC knew of wrongdoing, but did not prosecute bank</a>, 10 February) highlights the most shocking aspect of this whole sorry affair. We all accept some companies will commit fraud and that the economic system has been absurdly weighted in favour of the extremely rich. (If we don\u2019t then why aren\u2019t the streets full of angry protests?) But for the very people whom we employ and task with prosecuting such behaviour to collude in \u201csweetheart\u201d deals that let perpetrators walk away with a 10% bill and guaranteed anonymity, while neatly paving their way for a post-HMRC career with the facilitators of the crime, is a sign that the system is no longer fit for purpose. Will any party offer a genuine alternative?<br><strong>Colin Reed</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s all fine and well to investigate HSBC and its former CEO Stephen Green for tax fraud at its Swiss arm, but the pursuit of truth and justice must not end there. This is a huge story. It implicates HMRC, the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Conduct Authority, who have clearly failed to act against HSBC. It involves the Treasury, which must explain what it knew and whether it approved the action (not) taken. Then there are the thousands of individuals, whose unethical \u2013 and perhaps criminal \u2013 behaviour has lost us huge sums in tax revenue. A key target for investigation must be HMRC\u2019s former head of tax Dave Hartnett (a familiar name to readers of Private Eye), who negotiated not only the infamous tax deals with Vodafone and Goldman Sachs but also the coalition government\u2019s tax amnesty for HSBC account holders.

      "bodyText": "In response to yet more revelations (HSBC files show how Swiss bank helped clients dodge taxes and hide millions, 9 February), politicians are talking tough on tax avoidance, tax evasion and unjustified tax breaks. However, they have not yet convinced the public that they are serious. Tax dodging is costing governments \u2013 both in the UK and in developing countries \u2013 billions. This is money which is vital for tackling poverty. But despite the positive rhetoric from politicians, our polling shows that only one in five people believe political parties have gone far enough in their promises to tackle tax avoidance by large companies. All parties are going to have to work hard to win back public confidence. The problems are multi-faceted and complex. A critical part of the solution is dealing with the secrecy of UK tax havens \u2013 as David Cameron promised to do as G8 chair in 2013, a pledge Ed Miliband attempted to trump on Saturday \u2013 but more is needed. Only a commitment to a full package of reforms will send the message that the problem is being taken seriously. This is why we, along with over 60 economists and academics, a range of faith leaders, responsible companies and more than 40,000 members of the public, have called for a commitment from all parties to bringing forward a tax-dodging bill in the first 100 days of the new government. Only this can convince the public that rhetoric will be turned into effective action. Jenny Ricks Head of campaigns, ActionAid, Christine Allen Director of policy and public affairs, Christian Aid, Duncan Exley Director, Equality Trust, Martin Drewry Director, Health Poverty Action, Toni Pearce President, NUS, Nick Bryer Head of UK policy and campaigns, Oxfam, Stephen Brown Director of Europe, The Global Poverty Project \u2022 Yet again a big company has been shown to be behaving improperly in relation to taxes. Recently it was suggested that Boots should be stopped from handling NHS prescriptions because of its abysmal record on paying its UK taxes. This excellent proposal should be extended to many other companies that similarly fall short. Our country is fit to live in because of its essential infrastructure of transport, fire services, the police, education, the health service, the military and so on, all paid for with our taxes. So the next time a branch of Starbucks is burgled, let them sort it out themselves. When Amazon sends books to customers, using the public roads, it should pay a surcharge for every mile travelled. British American Tobacco pays no tax here, so how about doubling the duty on its cigarettes? I could go on. Only when direct action is taken against these immoral tax dodgers will they face up to their moral responsibilities. Neil Holmes Bromsgrove, Worcestershire \u2022 Clearly the UK authorities are treating tax evaders with kid gloves (Catalogue of malpractice endorsed by bankers, 9 February). In addition to criminal prosecutions, people caught fiddling more than the living wage should have their tax returns published in full, with only their most personal details redacted. Further sanctions as part of restorative justice could include having to sign on every fortnight to visit hard-pressed public services and explain to their staff and users how their fines and future taxes would benefit them. As with MPs\u2019 expenses, for far too long secrecy has allowed top-rate income tax payers to claim tax reliefs that they would be hard pressed to justify in public. Non-domiciled tax status must be abolished: it is farcical that Boris Johnson, with dual citizenship, has to pay US taxes, and yet British citizens can opt out altogether. As for those tax exiles and their families living in place like Monaco who have accepted public honours, there should be no hiding place: either they pay back the taxes they should have been paying like everybody else, or, like Fred Goodwin, their honours can be publicly withdrawn in a special issue of the London Gazette. David Nowell New Barnet, Hertfordshire \u2022 Your front-page article (HMRC knew of wrongdoing, but did not prosecute bank, 10 February) highlights the most shocking aspect of this whole sorry affair. We all accept some companies will commit fraud and that the economic system has been absurdly weighted in favour of the extremely rich. (If we don\u2019t then why aren\u2019t the streets full of angry protests?) But for the very people whom we employ and task with prosecuting such behaviour to collude in \u201csweetheart\u201d deals that let perpetrators walk away with a 10% bill and guaranteed anonymity, while neatly paving their way for a post-HMRC career with the facilitators of the crime, is a sign that the system is no longer fit for purpose. Will any party offer a genuine alternative? Colin Reed Glasgow \u2022 It\u2019s all fine and well to investigate HSBC and its former CEO Stephen Green for tax fraud at its Swiss arm, but the pursuit of truth and justice must not end there. This is a huge story. It implicates HMRC, the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Conduct Authority, who have clearly failed to act against HSBC. It involves the Treasury, which must explain what it knew and whether it approved the action (not) taken. Then there are the thousands of individuals, whose unethical \u2013 and perhaps criminal \u2013 behaviour has lost us huge sums in tax revenue. A key target for investigation must be HMRC\u2019s former head of tax Dave Hartnett (a familiar name to readers of Private Eye), who negotiated not only the infamous tax deals with Vodafone and Goldman Sachs but also the coalition government\u2019s tax amnesty for HSBC account holders. Following retirement, he went on to advise HSBC on financial crime governance \u2013 along with the former DG of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, Bill Hughes. Who can we trust to get to the bottom of this monumental scandal? Mary Braithwaite Wye, Kent \u2022 HSBC needs to get its priorities right in questioning whether large cash transfers are for money laundering or tax evasion.

In view of the latest revelations, perhaps they had never come across someone paying their tax before. Ros Campbell Leeds \u2022 I note that HSBC says \u201cMajor regulatory reform is under way\u201d (to reduce tax evasion) and that \u201cHSBC fully welcomes and supports these reforms\u201d (9 February).

      "bodyText": "The renewable energy company Ecotricity is giving \u00a3250,000 to the Labour party, and has accused the government of being deceitful on climate and energy policy. Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, said he felt compelled to act because there was \u201can existential threat from a second-term Tory government\u201d. He said it was a myth that Labour was anti-business and praised the party\u2019s leader, Ed Miliband, for standing up for renewables and taking a \u201cpro-people\u201d approach to banking and energy markets reform. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched the coalition government systematically undermine not just the renewable energy industry in Britain but the whole green economy and, by default, efforts to combat climate change. We feel compelled to act and to speak out,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the biggest deceits of this government was the claim that green energy support was at the root of high and rising energy bills \u2013 the claim behind David Cameron\u2019s infamous \u2018cut the green crap\u2019 quote.\u201d This phrase was attributed to Cameron by a senior Tory source in 2013 and triggered a furious reaction from campaigners, who accused the prime minister of ditching his promise to run the greenest government ever. Downing Street said at the time it did not recognise the phrase, but never explicitly denied it. Vince accused Cameron of abandoning his green policies to placate Ukip and said the prime minister was also putting party politics ahead of the country on the UK\u2019s EU membership. \u201cIt would be a disaster for Britain to leave Europe. We face not just that possibility but the consequential break up of the UK. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario.\u201d He said the next election was the most important of his lifetime. \u201cIt was really the starkness of the choice,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe were all filled with hope when Cameron promised the greenest government ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he [Cameron] has done great harm to renewable energy and the fight against climate change.\u201d Ecotricity is also giving \u00a320,000 to the re-election campaign of the UK\u2019s only Green MP, Caroline Lucas, and is considering giving money to other Green candidates in constituencies where the party is likely to have a chance of winning. Ecotricity has given the Greens \u00a350,000 in recent years, but until now has not money to Labour. It has never made a donation to the Conservatives. The company shares are owned by Vince, who launched the wind turbine business in 1996. Ecotricity has 155,000 customers, almost double the number it had a year ago, as consumers abandoned the big six providers amid a political storm over energy prices. According to the Sunday Times rich list, Vince is worth about \u00a3100m. But he said all the wealth was in the company and claimed he did not know how much it was worth. \u201cTo me it is priceless and I would never consider selling it,\u201d he said. The \u00a3250,000 will be a welcome boost to the cash-strapped Labour party, which has faced accusations of being anti-business, after Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire who is the acting boss of Boots pharmacy chain, said it would be \u201ca catastrophe\u201d if Labour got into government. Vince said: \u201cI don\u2019t know where they [critics] are coming from. The Boots guy didn\u2019t mention anything, it was just a sweeping attack.\u201d The decision to give money to Labour provoked some criticism on social media. One Twitter user said: \u201cAs Ecotricity have billed me extra to foolishly fund the Labour party, I shall now be needing a new energy supplier \u2013 recommendations?\u201d At an event in Manchester on Tuesday night the Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, was expected to attack Labour for not supporting a blanket ban on fracking. \u201cWe see a Labour party which says they want to protect our environment, yet fail to stand up to a law which allows fracking firms to drill beneath our homes without permission. They say they worry about climate change, yet they abstain on a proposed ban on fracking.\u201d Labour wants to strengthen regulation of the controversial drilling method but has not proposed a total ban.",

Oil companies have responded to the price collapse by cutting investment Sechin warned that lower oil production could start to cause supply shortages by the end of the year. The price fall deepened after November when Opec, a group of oil-exporting countries which Russia is not a member of, chose not to cut its output. \u201cOpec has lost its teeth,\u201d the Rosneft boss said through an official translator at London\u2019s IP Week, an annual industry event.

The International Energy Agency on Tuesday issued a medium-term outlook that predicted that the US oil sector would largely ride out the drop in prices, while Russia would likely be the industry\u2019s main loser. It said oil prices were likely to stay at $60 a barrel or lower for the next two years as US shale extraction continues to suppress prices. \u201cDespite expectations of tightening balances by end-2015, downward market pressures may not have run their course just yet,\u201d the IEA said in a monthly report. Brent crude fell 66 cents to $57.68 a barrel on Tuesday, ending three straight days of gains. The IEA \u2013 which advises mainly developed economies on the oil market \u2013 predicted an average price of $55 this year with prices rising to $60 in 2016.",

    "webTitle": "HSBC files: Swiss bank aggressively pushed way for clients to avoid new tax", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s Swiss bankers aggressively marketed a device that would allow its clients to avoid a new tax introduced under a treaty Switzerland signed with the European Union, the HSBC files reveal. The documents show for the first time that rather than acting as a passive party to the tax schemes of its clients, HSBC Suisse proactively contacted clients to market techniques that would have effectively sabotaged the tax treaty deal. The bank\u2019s activities around the treaty, which related to the EU-wide European savings directive (ESD), form the core of the criminal investigations into HSBC\u2019s activities in France and Belgium, both launched due to the leaked documents. The treaty, signed in 2003, allowed EU citizens to carry on hiding billions in anonymous Swiss accounts. But in return, Swiss banks such as HSBC\u2019s would be obliged to collect some tax from each of their secret customers. This \u201cwithholding tax\u201d on the income from savings interest, initially 15%, would then be handed over in bulk to Britain and other EU states, to compensate them for losses caused by anonymous tax dodgers. But HSBC came up with a \u201cvehicle\u201d that enabled customers to avoid the tax by exploiting a key loophole in the treaty: ESD only applied to individuals\u2019 savings, not companies. So the bank offered to transfer all of a customer\u2019s secret cash into a corporate account with no genuine trading activity. This would technically belong to a shell company, set up in such secretive offshore havens as Panama or the British Virgin Islands. To be doubly sure, the company itself in turn could, for a further price, even be registered as technically owned by an offshore trust or foundation, generally in the tiny principality of Liechtenstein, where details of the trust deed could be kept completely secret. The customer would be written in as the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of the trust, but not the legal owner of the company. In return for paying several thousand pounds in annual fees to the bank, the rich clients could carry on enjoying the secret fruits of their cash, tax-free. One such BVI sham entity was even wittily named Alter Ego Ltd. According to the notes in the HSBC files, the Swiss bank\u2019s staff were remarkably explicit about the purpose of the scheme. Recording a conversation with a client, one banker noted: \u201cESD, for now will pay the 15%. We discussed the possibilities for not paying. She will think about it.\u201d Scores of these \u201csolutions\u201d were marketed by Swiss bank managers throughout 2005, the files show. In one case, a British businessman from Deal in Kent and his financial adviser turned up in Geneva in October 2005, two among many such visitors. The English family had the equivalent of more than \u00a31m hidden in FLAMINGO 22, a numbered Swiss account. The bank now needed their signatures on a card, in order to purchase HSBC\u2019s latest tax-avoidance plan. The family signed up to the device in October 2005: \u201cHe \u2026 asked us to transfer the \u2026 current account balance to Future Investments and Development SA \u2026 a Panamanian Company that he, and his co-account holders, have arranged to be created in the context of ESD.\u201d Another typical entry concerned a diamond dealer from Stoke Newington, north London. The client \u201cwill come to ZH [Zurich] on 15.06.2005 to establish a new company with Audina Treuhand and will sign new docs for a new a/c \u2026 new B.V.I to be opened by Audina Treuhand as ESD solution\u201d, the bank noted. The Liechtenstein agency, Audina, eventually set up a company called Derbe Ltd for him, not in the BVI but in Samoa, an even more obscure offshore jurisdiction. His personal account, codenamed 35666 ZZ, was emptied while Derbe Ltd by the following year held the equivalent of \u00a3770,000. The terse leaked notes show HSBC clients passively accepting to be party to the new structures after bankers proposed them: \u201cExplained in details how ESD works; client accepted to establish a new off-shore company for this purpose and signed all necessary documentation,\u201d one records for a Hatton Garden jeweller with \u00a315m. Another example explains the structure the bank proposed for a British client: \u201cA new Liberian Company that we shall open for ESD reasons, as the client is Greek and UK resident \u2026 transfer all assets from the named accounts to the Corp. account\u201d it notes for a retail heiress with \u00a38m. Other UK clients did much the same. \u201cWe discussed the ESD and they have decided to establish a \u2026 Panamanian company, to establish an account and to receive these assets, and on which they will have individual signing power,\u201d one notes. \u201cLong ESD discussion\u2026 Client has signed a letter, to transfer assets from account to BVI company,\u201d states another. Former tax inspector Richard Brooks said the files show that the bank \u201cwas actively encouraging them not to pay their tax bill \u2026 finding ways to get round new rules introduced in 2005 to tackle tax evasion. It was saying, \u2018OK you don\u2019t have to play along with those, we\u2019ve got another product for you that will allow you to carry on evading tax.\u2019\u201d Other notes from the dozens of examples within the files show that clients from Greece, Spain and Israel were offered the same loophole, with companies incorporated in Liberia, Panama, the British Virgin Islands and other jurisdictions. HSBC is now facing criminal charges in Belgium and criminal investigation in France on the allegation that it \u201cknowingly promoted serious and organised tax fraud\u201d in connection with its ESD schemes. The bank would not comment directly on the Guardian\u2019s evidence, but in a statement it has admitted various forms of wrongdoing occurred in its Swiss subsidiary. It said regulatory expectations have nowadays \u201cdramatically shifted\u201d. Banks are now expected not to facilitate \u201cany form of non-compliance with tax obligations\u201d. HSBC current leadership, the bank said, \u201cfully welcome and support these reforms\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s tax authority failed to tell Downing Street about evidence of serious misconduct at HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm despite being asked to vet Stephen Green, the executive chairman of its parent bank, over his suitability to join the House of Lords as a government minister in 2010. The Guardian has established that Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs confirmed only Green\u2019s personal compliance with UK tax laws while clearing him for the peerage. It did not inform the government that it was in possession of thousands of secret account files from the Swiss bank, which implicated HSBC in major tax evasion and other potential criminal offences. Asked why he took no steps to pass on the allegations contained on the so-called \u201cSwiss disc\u201d, Dave Hartnett, HMRC\u2019s then head of tax, said: \u201cHMRC is asked to provide an indication of reputational risk for appointments of peers in relation to their tax compliance history only.\u201d Hartnett played a key role in shaping HMRC\u2019s handling of the Swiss data, which had been passed to the UK by the French tax authorities. He went on to work for HSBC as a consultant when he retired in 2012. The revelation will intensify the pressure on both HMRC and the government to explain why the bank has faced no criminal investigation in the UK, where it is headquartered. While the agency found more than 1,000 tax evaders among the almost 7,000 UK clients of the Swiss bank, only one individual has been prosecuted. Around \u00a3135m has been recovered in tax repayments, a lower figure than in other European countries. The agency\u2019s current chief executive, Lin Homer, is due to face the Commons public accounts committee, chaired by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge. One of the key questions HMRC is likely to face from committee members is whether there was a decision, as Hodge put it on Monday, to \u201cgo easy\u201d on HSBC. In February 2010, Hartnett, as head of tax, paid an as yet unexplained visit to HSBC. He officially registered that he ate a sandwich lunch there, but has not disclosed what he talked about. As the French authorities told HMRC about the Swiss disc in early February, this raises the question as to what the purpose of the lunch was, and who instigated it. Following the publication of the leaked HSBC internal files by the Guardian and international news outlets this week, the UK tax agency now appears to have changed tack and is reviewing the decision not to pursue the bank. \u201cThe French authorities have today confirmed that they will provide all assistance necessary to allow HMRC to exploit the data to its fullest,\u201d Homer said in a statement to the Guardian on Monday night. She added that HMRC would ask the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which worked with the Guardian, for access to all available files. \u201cWe are examining whether we have all the same data as the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and are asking the ICIJ for any data that we have not already been given.\u201d Homer\u2019s statement reveals that officials originally believed they were obliged to keep the contents of the Swiss disc secret not only from Treasury ministers and the prime minister, but from all other British agencies and regulators, such as the Serious Fraud Office or the Financial Conduct Authority. \u201cHMRC received the HSBC data under very strict conditions, which limited our use of it to pursuing offshore tax evasion and prevented us from sharing the data with other law enforcement authorities. Under these restrictions, we have not been able to seek prosecution for other potential offences, such as money laundering,\u201d the statement said. Yet Herv\u00e9 Falciani, the original source of the HSBC leaks, has previously said that he and the French authorities had always been willing to cooperate fully with other national tax agencies, but that the British had never approached them for help. Prosecutors in the US, Spain and Belgium have been working closely with French investigating judges and police officers for several years. Documents obtained by the French daily Le Monde illustrate just how cooperative French magistrates have been with prosecutors abroad. They show that in 2014, Belgian judiciary police used depositions gathered by French magistrates from HSBC customers and employees to question David Garrido, the head of legal at HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA. Both France and Belgium have been preparing criminal cases of money-laundering against HSBC and its bankers, without any apparent legal restrictions. HMRC sources said that the decision by unnamed officials not to pursue the bank was based on an \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the double taxation treaty between the UK and France. Homer\u2019s statement also disclosed that only three individuals had ever been proposed for prosecution by HMRC, out of the 1,100 HSBC tax evaders their research eventually identified. \u201cHMRC passed evidence on three individuals on the HSBC list to the Crown Prosecution Service, and the CPS considered that there was sufficient evidence to mount a successful prosecution in only one of the three cases. \u201cAs far as we are aware, only a handful of cases from the HSBC list have been brought by other countries for tax evasion and none have yet been brought for money laundering, so the UK is not out of step with our international partners.\u201d She said that \u00a3135m had been recovered from HSBC clients based in the UK: \u201cIn a small number of cases, HMRC will institute criminal investigations into serial tax evaders and those who deliberately conceal information from us. But in most cases, disclosure and civil fines are the most appropriate and effective intervention, and that is how we have approached the receipt of data from leaks and whistleblowers, including the Swiss HSBC data that was shared with HMRC in May 2010.\u201d In a subsequent overarching tax deal with Switzerland, Hartnett went on record saying it was unlikely any bankers would be prosecuted, due to lack of evidence.",

How about the wise words set forth in 2009\u2019s Good Value: Reflections on Money, Morality and an Uncertain World, by none other than author Stephen Green? Full of soul-searching and wisdom, Good Value may not be a bestseller, (total worldwide book sales of 6,000, according to Nielsen BookScan) but as Management Today pointed out in its review, Good Value is nonetheless \u201ca stunning tour de force analysis of the state of the world\u201d. To save him some time \u2013 and \u00a36.99 in case he needs to buy a new copy of his own book \u2013 here\u2019s a reminder of some of the most enlightening lessons. Pay what you owe \u201cThere will always be those who have not merely more than others\u201d, Green tells us in Chapter 6: Why Should I Do Anything for Posterity?. Some people will have \u201cmore than they could conceivably need.\u201d How can we deal with this, morally? Well, Green says, we can simply \u201cshrug our shoulders\u201d or \u201cwe can hear the still, small voice of conscience\u201d which \u201creminds us \u2013 if we listen \u2013 that something is owed by the affluent. And a debt not paid is a debtor who is guilty.\u201d Take responsibility As the HSBC scandal unfolds nobody wants to take responsibility. Labour is blaming the Tories, the Tories blame Labour, HSBC says it has changed, and everyone is asking who knew what when. Will anyone take responsibility? Over to you, Mr Green. \u201cAs individuals, we do not govern our behaviour simply by what is allowed by law or regulation. We have our own codes of conduct, and hold ourselves accountable. We take responsibility for our actions,\u201d he points out in Chapter 5: From Tulips to Sub-Prime to \u2026 In big companies, where does this responsibility begin? As HSBC\u2019s former chairman, Green knows: \u201cWith their boards, of course. There is no other task they have which is more important. It is their job.\u201d Be honest (everyone knows that) \u201cEveryone knows about the importance of trust and honesty for sustainable business\u201d, Green opines in Chapter 7: Faust and the Rich Young Man. An uncharitable sort might suspect that this would prohibit a subsidiary fooling the tax authorities on your watch \u2026 \u201cEveryone knows that, though you can fool some people all of the time and most people some of the time, you can\u2019t fool most people most of the time.\u201d Don\u2019t be shy of the big moral questions From Chapter 5: From Tulips to Sub-Prime to \u2026 again: \u201cIf we are to restore trust and confidence in the markets, we must therefore address what is at its root a moral question. Trust and confidence cannot be restored overnight, and they cannot be restored by the fiat: the process of renewal has to begin with a recognition of the moral dimension of what has happened.\u201d Don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s always redemption What happens, for example, \u201cwhen a young trader in a bank dealing room covers up his losses with fictitious transactions until they spiral out of control and into the limelight?\u201d, asks Green in Chapter 7: Faust and the Rich Young Man. Or a politician is \u201cbrought down by a financial impropriety or a sexual misdemeanour?\u201d The answer: fear not. \u201cThere\u2019s always another way: there is always the possibility of redemption. What does it take to follow up such a path? Coming to terms with yourself and what you have done, for a start; then sensing that you owe something.\u201d",

The deflation figure reflects a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/06/asda-supermarket-price-war-resurgence-tesco\">wave of price cuts unleashed in January</a> by the major supermarket groups as they attempt to fight back against the rise of the discounters.</p> <p>Last month Asda said it would plough \u00a3300m into lowering the price of 2,500 essentials, including fruit and vegetables, milk and eggs, in the first three months of the year.

The revival, which comes as Morrisons\u2019 chief executive Dalton Philips serves his last few weeks at the business after being sacked last month, sent shares in the Bradford-based chain up 3.4% to 184p. \u201cBritain\u2019s largest retailer is bouncing back from a tough year, with Dave Lewis\u2019s efforts to overhaul the supermarket attracting an additional 236,000 shoppers into its stores in the last 12 weeks,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. But he noted that Tesco\u2019s share of the market had continued to slip, falling to 29% against 29.2% a year ago, as strong growth by Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose lifted overall sales in UK grocers by 1.1%. McKevitt said lower fuel prices and a 1.2% fall in grocery prices, the deepest since Kantar began its records in 2006, meant shoppers had the cash to buy more items. The deflation figure reflects a wave of price cuts unleashed in January by the major supermarket groups as they attempt to fight back against the rise of the discounters. Last month Asda said it would plough \u00a3300m into lowering the price of 2,500 essentials, including fruit and vegetables, milk and eggs, in the first three months of the year. The same day, Sainsbury\u2019s announced hundreds of price cuts as part of a \u00a3150m investment this year while Tesco has cut prices on dozens of popular branded items as part of its turnaround plan. Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 21.2% and Lidl\u2019s by 14.2%, continuing a gradual slowdown in pace from more than 30% growth seen by both last spring, but still well ahead of the market and lifting their combined share to 8.4%, compared with 7.2% a year ago. Asda and the Co-op were the biggest losers in the face of that competition, with sales down 1.7% and 2.7% respectively. But Sainsbury\u2019s sales fell by 1% against a 0.7% decline in the month before, meaning it relinquished its spot as the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket to Asda after a brief takeover at Christmas, traditionally the London-based business\u2019s best time of year. Sainsbury\u2019s controls 16.7% of the UK grocery market against Asda\u2019s 16.9% share and Morrisons\u2019 11.1%.",

The thinktank has revised up its outlook for the UK economy this year and now sees GDP growing 2.9%, compared with a previous estimate of 2.5% last November. \u201cThis is almost entirely due to the sharp fall in the oil price. Not only does this boost consumer spending \u2026 it also improves the UK\u2019s trade balance,\u201d the institute said in its latest forecast. But as fears intensified about the fallout from a tense standoff over Greece\u2019s debt repayments, the thinktank added a note of caution. \u201cThe weakness of the global economy \u2013 and in particular the euro area, by far the UK\u2019s largest trading partner \u2013 remains a hindrance to a significant improvement.\u201d Oil prices have halved, with benchmark Brent crude falling from a peak of $115 last summer to around $58 a barrel now. But looking further ahead beyond 2015, the thinktank predicted the fillip to the economy would wear off. \u201cWe expect growth to moderate in 2016 and beyond, as the positive impact of the oil price shock dissipates and domestic demand growth softens. Offsetting this is a strengthening global economy that should support the recovery in the growth of exports,\u201d it said. The thinktank expects inflation to remain below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% for some time and does not expect policymakers to raise interest rates before the beginning of next year. It also expects a real-terms boost to wages thanks to low inflation but warns the longer-term picture for Britain\u2019s workers may not be so bright. Productivity growth, which in the UK has lagged other advanced economies, remains \u201cthe most significant domestic risk to the UK\u2019s economic outlook\u201d, the institute said. \u201cIf the recent poor productivity performance is a structural rather than a cyclical phenomenon, as assumed, then this would have serious implications for future standards of living as well as economic policy,\u201d it added. A separate report from the British Retail Consortium has highlighted that widespread discounting continued to drive high street sales last month. The industry group said sales increased by an annual 0.2% on a like-for-like basis after having fallen an annual 0.4% in the crucial Christmas month. BRC director general Helen Dickinson said: \u201cCustomers were offered attractive bargains on winter ranges but it remains to be seen at what cost to the retailers\u2019 margins.\u201d Less volatile figures covering the last three months showed sales were also up an annual 0.2%, the fastest underlying growth since the start of last summer.",
