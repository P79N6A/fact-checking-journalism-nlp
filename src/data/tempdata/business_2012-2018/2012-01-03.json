      "bodyText": "The price of oil jumped by $4 a barrel on Tuesday as tension between Iran and the US fuelled fears of disruptions to supply. Brent crude spot prices rose from $107 to $111 after Iran threatened to take action if the US navy moves an aircraft carrier into the Gulf. US light crude, which dropped below $100 a barrel before Christmas, hit $102.23 a barrel \u2013 a rise of $3.40 on the day. Analysts said the jump in prices was likely to continue as long as Tehran appeared ready to use force against US warships patrolling the strategically vital strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf. Iran's army chief, General Ataollah Salehi, warned a US aircraft carrier not to return to the Gulf or risk attack by new surface-to-sea missiles tested by the military in recent days. Tehran's latest tough rhetoric over the waterway is part of a feud with the US over new sanctions designed to discourage the Iranian state from developing nuclear weapons. Salehi spoke as a 10-day Iranian naval exercise ended near the strait of Hormuz. Iranian officials have said the drill aimed to show that Iran could close the shipping route, as it has threatened to do if the US brings into force strong new sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme. The strait, leading into the Gulf of Oman and Arabian Sea, is the only possible route for tankers transporting crude from the oil-rich states of the Gulf to western markets. A sixth of the world's oil exports passes through it every day. John Kilduff, a partner at the hedge fund Again Capital in New York, said better-than-expected manufacturing output by US firms, which is likely to boost the demand for oil, was also a factor in the oil price rise. \"The supportive economic data and the geopolitical concerns are furthering the crude oil rally,\" he said. \"The temperature is going up every day now on the Iran situation \u2013 new sanctions, new missile launches and sabre-rattling are all contributing,\" he added. Oil prices have been trending downwards since last May, when it became apparent the recovery in Europe and the US was running out of steam.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Greece: we could exit euro in three months", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Greek government has stepped up the pressure on its eurozone paymasters by warning that unless a new bailout for the recession-hit country is agreed within the next three months it will be forced out of the single currency. Pantelis Kapsis, a spokesman for the new coalition government led by former central bank chief Lucas Papademos, said negotiations with the \"troika\" of the International Monetary Fund, Brussels and the European Central Bank over the coming weeks would \"determine everything\". Greece was promised a second emergency bailout worth \u20ac130bn (\u00a3108bn) in October after it became clear that the first rescue package, agreed in May 2010, was not enough to stabilise its debts. But talks about this second deal, including a writedown for Greece's private-sector lenders, are still continuing. Kapsis told Greek television: \"This famous loan agreement must be signed, otherwise we are outside the markets, out of the euro and things will become much worse.\" Reports have emerged since the weekend that the troika could demand fresh austerity measures from Athens in exchange for a new loan to ensure that it meets its targets for reducing the deficit. But Kapsis also said imposing more cuts on a recession-hit nation could be very difficult. \"We will see what the shortfall is and it is very likely that measures will be required,\" he said. \"I also don't believe it is easy to impose new taxes, but what does cutting spending mean? To close down the public sector? There is no easy solution.\" Papademos's technocratic government took power after the resignation of George Papandreou, who had sent world financial markets into a tailspin in November by suggesting he could hold a referendum on whether the Greek people were prepared to accept more austerity as the price of staying in the eurozone. The latest intervention from Athens came as eurozone leaders prepare for a punishing schedule of political summits in coming weeks. They are working towards a new \"fiscal compact\" to tighten tax and spending rules for the single currency and boost the firepower of their bailout fund from the International Monetary Fund. Official figures released yesterday revealed the sharp contrast in fortunes between Germany, which remains the powerhouse of the eurozone, and crisis-hit Spain, whose government is battling to keep it out of bond investors' crosshairs. German unemployment declined by a much larger than expected 22,000 to 2.89 million last month, taking the jobless rate to 6.8%. Anthony Cheung, of market analysts RANsquawk, said: \"After a year which saw many eurozone economies stall, the German economic engine is purring on as smoothly as ever. In 2011 Germany created nearly half a million jobs, even while unemployment soared in the eurozone's periphery.\" The continued strength of the Germany economy contrasted with the deteriorating situation in Spain, where unemployment rose for a fifth successive month in December, according to official figures, to hit a 15-year high of 4.42 million. On another measure, compiled by the National Statistics Institute, Spanish unemployment is now close to 5m, or 21.5% of the workforce, the highest of any major industrialised economy. Spain's new government has already announced a series of austerity measures after revealing the budget deficit would be much worse than predicted, at 8%. Madrid is drawing up labour market reforms which it hopes will boost job creation. However, there were signs yesterday that strains in Europe's banking sector may be easing slightly after the ECB poured \u20ac500bn into cash-strapped banks before Christmas. At the ECB's first one-week lending operation of the new year, banks reduced the amount they borrowed by \u20ac15bn, to \u20ac130.6bn. The ECB also announced a shakeup in responsibilities on its board yesterday, as two new members arrived to replace J\u00fcrgen Stark, the German member who resigned amid controversy about the bank's role in the spiralling sovereign debt crisis, and Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi of Italy. Peter Praet, a Belgian technocrat who was already a member of the ECB governing council, has been handed the role of chief economist previously held by the hawkish Axel Weber, who left last year after expressing scepticism about the ECB's bond-buying programme, which has helped to drive down Spanish and Italian borrowing costs. Praet was given the job ahead of ECB newcomers J\u00f6rg Asmussen, from Germany, and Frenchman Bernard Coeure. That decision avoids a potential controversy about whether a German or French number-cruncher should have the role, at a time when Paris and Berlin have different views about the ECB's responsibilities in tackling the sovereign debt crisis. French president Nicolas Sarkozy has made clear he would like to see the ECB acting as a lender of last resort, a view shared by Britain; but German chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly rejected the idea, fearful it could unleash inflation.",

      "body": "<p>The Greek government has stepped up the pressure on its eurozone paymasters by warning that unless a new bailout for the recession-hit country is agreed within the next three months it will be forced out of the single currency.</p> <p>Pantelis Kapsis, a spokesman for the new coalition government led by former central bank chief Lucas Papademos, said negotiations with the \"troika\" of the International Monetary Fund, Brussels and the European Central Bank over the coming weeks would \"determine everything\".</p> <p>Greece was promised a second emergency bailout worth \u20ac130bn (\u00a3108bn) in October after it became clear that the first rescue package, agreed in May 2010, was not enough to stabilise its debts.</p> <p>But talks about this second deal, including a writedown for Greece's private-sector lenders, are still continuing. Kapsis told Greek television: \"This famous loan agreement must be signed, otherwise we are outside the markets, out of the euro and things will become much worse.\"</p> <p>Reports have emerged since the weekend that the troika could demand fresh austerity measures from Athens in exchange for a new loan to ensure that it meets its targets for reducing the deficit. But Kapsis also said imposing more cuts on a recession-hit nation could be very difficult.</p> <p>\"We will see what the shortfall is and it is very likely that measures will be required,\" he said. \"I also don't believe it is easy to impose new taxes, but what does cutting spending mean? To close down the public sector? There is no easy solution.\"</p> <p>Papademos's technocratic government took power after the resignation of George Papandreou, who had sent world financial markets into a tailspin in November by suggesting he could hold a referendum on whether the Greek people were prepared to accept more austerity as the price of staying in the eurozone.</p> <p>The latest intervention from Athens came as eurozone leaders prepare for a punishing schedule of political summits in coming weeks. They are working towards a new \"fiscal compact\" to tighten tax and spending rules for the single currency and boost the firepower of their bailout fund from the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Official figures released yesterday revealed the sharp contrast in fortunes between Germany, which remains the powerhouse of the eurozone, and crisis-hit Spain, whose government is battling to keep it out of bond investors' crosshairs.</p> <p>German unemployment declined by a much larger than expected 22,000 to 2.89 million last month, taking the jobless rate to 6.8%. Anthony Cheung, of market analysts RANsquawk, said: \"After a year which saw many eurozone economies stall, the German economic engine is purring on as smoothly as ever. In 2011 Germany created nearly half a million jobs, even while unemployment soared in the eurozone's periphery.\"</p> <p>The continued strength of the Germany economy contrasted with the deteriorating situation in Spain, where unemployment rose for a fifth successive month in December, according to official figures, to hit a 15-year high of 4.42 million. On another measure, compiled by the National Statistics Institute, Spanish unemployment is now close to 5m, or 21.5% of the workforce, the highest of any major industrialised economy.</p> <p>Spain's new government has already announced a series of austerity measures after revealing the budget deficit would be much worse than predicted, at 8%. Madrid is drawing up labour market reforms which it hopes will boost job creation.</p> <p>However, there were signs yesterday that strains in Europe's banking sector may be easing slightly after the ECB poured \u20ac500bn into cash-strapped banks before Christmas. At the ECB's first one-week lending operation of the new year, banks reduced the amount they borrowed by \u20ac15bn, to \u20ac130.6bn.</p> <p>The ECB also announced a shakeup in responsibilities on its board yesterday, as two new members arrived to replace J\u00fcrgen Stark, the German member who resigned amid controversy about the bank's role in the spiralling sovereign debt crisis, and Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi of Italy.</p> <p>Peter Praet, a Belgian technocrat who was already a member of the ECB governing council, has been handed the role of chief economist previously held by the hawkish Axel Weber, who left last year after expressing scepticism about the ECB's bond-buying programme, which has helped to drive down Spanish and Italian borrowing costs.</p> <p>Praet was given the job ahead of ECB newcomers J\u00f6rg Asmussen, from Germany, and Frenchman Bernard Coeure.</p> <p>That decision avoids a potential controversy about whether a German or French number-cruncher should have the role, at a time when Paris and Berlin have different views about the ECB's responsibilities in tackling the sovereign debt crisis.</p> <p>French president Nicolas Sarkozy has made clear he would like to see the ECB acting as a lender of last resort, a view shared by Britain; but German chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly rejected the idea, fearful it could unleash inflation.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Ireland reels from yet another austere budget and a year of economic pain, a group of young activists have begun to take over empty properties spawned by the boomand abandoned by banks and property developers across the country. The squatters, linked to Ireland's Occupy movement, say they plan a mass occupation of houses and flats owned by the Irish government's \"bad bank\", National Asset Management Agency (Nama), which took over thousands of properties that speculators handed back after the crash. Led by a 27-year-old Irish-language speaker and graduate from Galway, the group has already squatted a house on Dublin's northside that was worth \u20ac550,000 in the boom but is now put at under \u20ac200,000. Since the property has been empty for several years, Liam Mac an Bh\u00e1ird and his friends occupied it in the autumn to highlight homelessness, as well as the way builders and banks were bailed out by the taxpayer. There are up to 400,000 properties lying empty in the Republic, with the country's National Institute of Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA) warning that the number of vacant properties could keep house prices low for years. Mac an Bh\u00e1ird concedes that his group are breaking the law but argues that they are making an important political point. \"There are thousands homeless in this country with about 2,000 on the streets of Dublin alone tonight. Yet across the city there are thousands of flats, apartments, homes lying empty \u2013 some could be fit for human habitation. \"Our occupation is a way of making a point about the system we are living under. These properties could lie vacant for up to 10 years or more \u2013 so why not put homeless people into them?\" He reveals that the nascent movement has targeted a range of properties including an empty electronics factory in north Dublin's Smithfield district. \"I have been arguing in the Occupy movement that we need to take over Nama-owned properties in Dublin to highlight the injustice of a system where billions were pumped into banks that lent property speculators so much money,\" he said. \"Ultimately we should be talking about moving a large number of people into one of our 'ghost estates', which otherwise will lie and rot.\" The 600 or so \"ghost estates\" built in the Celtic Tiger years have come to symbolise the Irish recession. The cost of bailing out the banks that loaned billions to builders and property speculators during the boom has been huge. Economists put the Irish bank losses at about \u20ac106bn. Anger is mounting towards the institutions the majority of Irish people blame for the economic collapse: the bailed-out banks and property speculators. That anger is compounded with nationwide misery as Ireland remains mired in recession. The most recent figures from the Republic's Central Office of Statistics prior to Christmas found that Irish GDP had contracted by 1.9% in the third quarter of 2011. In the Occupy camp at the Central Bank of Ireland, a focal point for opposition to the banks and the bailout, Mac an Bh\u00e1ird stressed that their movement would impose rules on Ireland's squatters. \"There are no drugs or drink tolerated in these places during our occupations because we are making a political stand. It is also wholly non-violent, like the Occupy movement. And we do not take anything that doesn't belong to us in the properties we squat in.\" He explained that they survive by \"skip diving\" \u2013 reclaiming the uneaten, unused food discarded every day by major supermarket chains. With the Irish government imposing a further \u20ac2.2bn of cuts in the December budget, targeting Ireland's debt, Mac an Bh\u00e1ird says their campaign is going to gain support from normally conservative quarters. \"Even at the Occupy camp at the Central Bank, there are middle-class people coming up and telling us they agree with our stance. It is the middle classes who are now paying for the greed of the bankers and the builders, and this corrupt system. They can see the logic behind taking over buildings that otherwise would be left to rot for years.\" The campaigners aim to soon target a major Nama-owned building in Dublin and test the attitude of the authorities. \"It will be interesting to see if they are prepared to put homeless people out of the building, given that it is owned by the state and hence the people, and given that will be likely to lie empty for years,\" he adds.",

    "webTitle": "Bentley leads convoy for mini-recovery in UK car production", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The luxury carmaker Bentleyhas defied the economic gloom with a 37% surge in global sales, while European stock markets rallied after fresh data showed manufacturing is doing slightly better than expected. Investors were heartened by figures showing global manufacturing activity had not collapsed, as some feared. In Britain, the sector contracted less in December than in recent months, according to the purchasing managers' index (PMI), while a keenly watched survey in China showed an increase in manufacturing activity, sending share prices higher around the world. But Bentley took analysts by surprise on Tuesday with a sparkling set of figures for 2011, powered by rising sales to China and the United States. It has forecast strong growth this year. British-based car firms such as Bentley have provided glimmers of light for hard-pressed manufacturers. Toyota said in November that it planned to create 1,500 UK jobs as part of a \u00a3100m investment to build a new family car at its factory in Derbyshire. And Jaguar Landrover is planning to double the size of its Merseyside plant, adding more than 1,000 positions. Bentley's boss, Wolfgang D\u00fcrheimer, said his firm's performance was down to the growing allure of its models, particularly the new Continental GT, priced from \u00a3136,000, which accounted for more than a third of sales. He acknowledged this year would be tough, but said he still expected sales growth to be in double figures. The recent launch of Bentley's new soft-top Continental GTC has been a big hit, and boosted December sales by 69% on the same month in 2010. The Bentley Mulsanne, described as the company's \"flagship\" model, which costs nearly \u00a3226,000, is also selling well, said D\u00fcrheimer. Bentley, owned by the German car group Volkswagen (VW), is based in Britain where it employs 4,000 people in Crewe and is viewed as one of the most successful Anglo-German business ventures. One analyst said: \"It's a partnership and it works fantastically well \u2013 very different from the disastrous association between Rover and BMW.\" D\u00fcrheimer said: \"The dramatic sales growth reflects the global strength of the brand, and a recognition of the quality, craftsmanship and engineering excellence of our cars.\" Bentley employs about 800 British engineers and has launched a campaign in British schools to attract more people to auto engineering at a time when there are international skills shortages. Sales at the group bounced back to pre-recession levels during 2011, with strong growth in leading markets. The 37% global rise equates to more than 7,000 vehicle sales. The US continues to be Bentley's biggest market with 2,021 cars sold last year, an increase of 32%. China took second spot with sales doubling to 1,839 and surpassing the previous year's record before the end of July. \"This achievement is even more remarkable considering Bentley has been present in China for less than ten years,\" said D\u00fcrheimer. One of the weakest spots for Bentley has been the UK, which was described as \"extremely challenging\" \u2013 but even here the company managed a 5% increase, selling 1,031 cars. D\u00fcrheimer is hopeful of continuing success in 2102, saying the new Continental V8 should attract new customers: \"[We have] realistic plans which reflect global economic conditions.\" But Bentley's sales figures are still a third down on the peak in 2007 when it sold more than 10,000 vehicles; and no one is predicting they will return to those levels anytime soon. Elsewhere, Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said he welcomed the improvements disclosed in the PMI survey, which asks manufacturers about their output and order books. The December reading of 49.6 was up from the 47.7 recorded in November, but still below the 50 mark that signals expansion. Shaw said the data was good news but added: \"It seems to be due to firms eating into backlogs of work to keep output up, in which case the sector remains vulnerable to a sharper downturn over the coming months. Our central view is that the economy as a whole will experience a short recession.\" Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"December brought some brighter news for UK manufacturers\", noting that export orders were up, output appeared to have stabilised, and fewer layoffs were being reported than in November. \"However, over the fourth quarter as a whole, producers reported their worst performance since the second quarter of 2009. Manufacturing will therefore likely be a drag on the economy in the closing months of the year.\" With the eurozone crisis far from over, and manufacturers still heavily dependent on Britain's traditional markets across the Channel, many firms will be watching closely to assess whether the downturn in Europe is hitting orders. David Cameron used his new year message to warn that the UK economy cannot be isolated from events in the eurozone. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the Engineering Employers' Federation, which represents manufacturers, described the survey as \"a mixed bag\". \"The overall indicator may suggest another month of contraction across the sector, but there are some positive points to take away,\" she said. \"Some sectors within manufacturing are still growing relatively strongly, confirming the dual-speed recovery seen in the official statistics in recent months. \"This growth in orders and production has been bolstered by an improvement in export demand, which we'll need to see continue in the coming months to prop up growth across the wider economy.\"",

      "bodyText": "Property prices in Ireland are in freefall, according to housing analysts, whose latest figures show that prices in Dublin have collapsed by 65% in five years and by 60% across the country. A house price index released by the largest residential sales group \u2013 the Sherry FitzGerald Group \u2013 found that the pace of deflation has sped up in Dublin, while prices across the country are now at levels last seen 11 years ago. The group, which has been surveying a weighted basket of 1,500 properties since 1999, said residential property in Dublin was now worth 64.2% less than at the 2006 peak, with a national fall of 58.8%. Separate surveys by two property websites also found large declines in 2011's asking prices: myhome.ie said sale prices were down 50% since 2006, while its rival website daft.ie reported an 8% drop in the last quarter alone, calling it the largest ever quarterly fall in house prices in Ireland. \"There is no doubt the market is over-correcting,\" said Marian Finnegan, chief economist at the Sherry FitzGerald Group, with house prices now making it cheaper to buy than to rent. \"The pace of deflation picked up in the last 12 months, which illustrates a market that is in over-correction or in freefall,\" said Finnegan. She said the biggest reason for the freefall was the lack of mortgage finance available from Ireland's bailed-out banks. In 2011, just \u20ac2.3bn (\u00a31.9bn) was available in mortgage finance, according to the Irish Banking Federation, compared with \u20ac40bn at the peak of the property market in 2006. With no signs of mortgage credit returning to the market soon, and unemployment expected to rise in 2012, there are fears that property prices will continue to decline this year. Finnegan said the biggest shock was the level of deflation in Dublin, which \"defied logic to a certain extent\". The new homes market was now \"completely non-functional\", she said. The woeful state of the market is in stark contrast to the frenzied buying and selling of the mid-2000s when property in Dublin was achieving higher prices per square metre than Manhattan. One 550 sq metre house called Walford, in the embassy belt of Ballsbridge in Dublin 4, was sold in 2005 for a record price of \u20ac58m \u2013 \u20ac23m more than the asking price. If Sherry FitzGerald's figures are borne out by other data and the decline continues this year, the crash will exceed the worst-case scenario outlined by the US asset management firm BlackRock Solutions, which conducted the stress tests for the Central Bank of Ireland that led to the fifth bailout of Irish banks in April 2011. BlackRock's tests were the most severe ever applied to banks, and were the first to price in the cost of a new toxic wave of mortgage debt from the residential and buy-to-let markets. It predicted that, at best, house prices in Ireland would drop 55% before recovering and at worst 60%. Ronan Lyons, daft.ie economist, said the crash was no surprise, as just 13,000 mortgages were issued in 2011 compared with 200,000 in 2006. \"Given that the property market in any developed economy is inextricably linked to the mortgage market, it's no surprise that prices are down 50% or more, if lending is down by over 90%.\" He is one of the few who thinks there is a positive aspect to the latest figures: \"If you think of the fall in house prices as a necessary correction, whose size is determined by fundamental factors, then it is better for the prices to race to the finishing line than to crawl there.\"",
