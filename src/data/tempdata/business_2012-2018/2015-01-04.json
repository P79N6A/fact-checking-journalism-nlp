      "bodyText": "There is a warning buried in the economic figures that appeared last week. While most of the focus was on the steady decline in house buying and numbers showing Britain\u2019s national income grew more slowly last year than previously estimated; the latest borrowing figures set alarm bells ringing. Consumer credit figures from the Bank of England revealed Britons ended the year slapping their credit cards on shop counters as if the financial crisis was a distant memory. Borrowing on credit cards and unsecured loans grew in November at its strongest pace since 2008. We knew that retail sales had surged that month and now we knew why. Mortgage borrowing added to the credit boom, piling another \u00a32.1bn on the debt mountain in November. The increase was higher than expected and came despite a fall in the number of mortgage approvals. At the same time the central bank was publishing its credit figures, a survey of factory managers could only be described as depressing. Yet again, just as the sector appeared to be finally recovering from the great crash, the momentum has tailed off. The survey of manufacturers found expansion eased back in December after picking up in October and November. And that little period of early winter joy was shortlived, coming after a September that represented a 17-month low. Output and new orders growth moderated in December, and most importantly exports remained lacklustre. Those economists who found reasons to be cheerful from the figures suggested that the UK\u2019s strong domestic demand would keep the sector growing. The same economists look at the borrowing figures and discern a more benign outlook from the total UK household debt burden, which is continuing a trend since the crash and still coming down. What was once a household debt to income ratio of 175% is now nearer 130%. Yet the overall figure depends on the over-50s paying off their mortgages at an accelerated rate. By contrast, the under-40s take on bigger mortgages to buy a home with an inflated price and borrow on credit cards to fund a lifestyle ravaged by six years of below inflation pay rises. This rise in unsecured borrowing appears to be based on two things. There is the sense that the job market is so buoyant that redundancy is an unlikely prospect and second, there are the signals from the Bank of England that interest rates will remain low for another year. It may seem uninteresting to economists who just watch the debt total decline that a large minority of poorer and younger households are ramping up their debt-to-income ratio, but it is the key for the economy\u2019s survival in the next crisis. As countless studies have shown, the stability of the country is not based on the large number of people and businesses who either own assets outright or have low borrowings, but on people who borrow up to the hilt and go bust at the merest hint of impending crisis, hitting consumer spending and dragging down house prices. The Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank, has estimated that almost 1.6m households are forced to spend more than half of their disposable income on mortgage payments or rent and more than 1m of those with mortgages will be at risk of defaulting and losing their properties in the wake of even a small rise in interest rates. These are families who cannot cope with financial shocks and will need either large dollops of government benefits to survive or debt forgiveness by their bank and mortgage lender. The UK is not just storing up problems for a future crash. There are short term problems associated with a recovery based on spending using borrowed cash, especially when it is aligned to a weak manufacturing sector that has barely regained its pre-2008 level of output. Britain\u2019s trade balance represents more than a third of GDP. A surplus in services exports over imports is undermined by a huge deficit in goods. For many years this deficit was closed by a combination of North Sea oil and income from overseas investments. Since 2003 oil imports have exceeded exports and in recent years investment income has slumped. In the third quarter of last year the trade deficit swelled to \u00a311.2bn from \u00a38.9bn in the second. The trend has been for exports to fall and imports rise. While not the only factor, the rise in borrowing to buy electronic goods made overseas is a large part of the story. In the days of fixed currencies, a large trade deficit spelt disaster and forced governments to engineer pride-sapping devaluations. Now the currency adjusts on a daily basis in accordance with international buying and selling . The UK has seen the pound rise in the last three years in response to global instability. In short, its status as a safe haven has overridden qualms about its deteriorating trade position. Next year looks like it will be much the same. The threat of a Greek exit from the euro, a slowdown in China and political crises in Ukraine and the Middle East will sustain the fear factor. This situation could reverse at any time, especially when the eurozone situation settles down. Then the UK\u2019s poor export figures will come under closer scrutiny. A failure to compete in world markets will be obvious. A reliance on debt-fuelled spending to maintain domestic demand will further undermine confidence. The currency will fall. The cost of imported goods will rise, further hitting living standards. A lower currency will make exports cheaper and aid exporters but the British experience is that exporters outside the confines of the car industry do little to exploit this situation. Most importantly they bank the extra profit and refuse to increase investment. This was disappointingly shown by the pharmaceutical industry, which cut back on investment despite a fall in the value of the pound by a quarter in 2009. Worse could be to come should consumer borrowing continue to spur growth in 2015. As James Knightley, UK economist at ING Financial Markets, said: \u201cWith the economy looking set to expand by 3% this year and debt levels creeping higher once again we suspect that the BoE will be looking to tighten monetary policy from the third quarter of 2015 onwards.\u201d A rise in interest rates will compound a difficult financial situation for many households. If they restrain spending, manufacturers will find reliance on domestic demand restricts their ability to grow. Wage increases could come to the rescue. Some forecasters have bet on a 3% average jump in earnings this year against about 1% in 2014. A further decline in inflation, largely as a result of falling oil prices, could also raise disposable incomes without the need to borrow. However, 5 million public sector workers will continue to suffer wage freezes. And for the legions of low paid workers, a 3% rise in the minimum wage in October will likely be eaten up by higher rents and coping with cuts in benefits. Can the rest of the private sector workforce keep the tills ringing and by virtue of buoyant demand, manufacturers in rude health? Unlikely.",

      "bodyText": "The decision by president Barack Obama to open the door to US oil exports seeped out of Washington in a low-key manner last week, but the impact could be as explosive as a New Year\u2019s Eve firework display. The ban \u2013 imposed after the Middle East oil embargoes in the 1970s \u2013 has made it close to impossible to ship abroad the fruits of America\u2019s shale bonanza. It also long looked wrong-headed in the home of free trade. The US department of commerce quietly overturned the four-decade-old policy by saying it had started to approve a backlog of requests to sell processed light oil to foreign buyers. The issue is tremendously sensitive, which is possibly why the announcement came out at a time of year when most policymakers were still at home enjoying the Christmas holidays with their families. Many manufacturers and many domestic consumers are totally opposed to domestic oil or gas production being exported, on the grounds that it could bring an end to cheaper local energy supplies and competitive advantages. But prospectors from the shales in Eagle Ford, Texas and Marcellus, Pennsylvania have been campaigning in Washington for a change in the law for some time, their calls growing more urgent now that some face potential financial trouble as the price of oil plunges from $115 per barrel down to $56. Meanwhile American oil sometimes sells at $15 per barrel less on the local market as supply exceeds demand: not good for the frackers already burdened by their relatively high-cost operations. But by opening the door to exports \u2013 of slightly refined products \u2013 Washington has struck a more serious blow to its export rivals in Saudi Arabia, Russia and elsewhere. Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup bank, had no trouble predicting that the move would \u201copen up the floodgates to substantial increases in [US] exports by end 2015\u201d. The enormous growth in American production \u2013 alongside lower-than-expected world economic activity \u2013 has been a key trigger for the international crude price collapse. The planned issue of new US export licences is seen by many as another stake in the heart of the Opec organisation, which has been struggling to find a consensus among its members about what to do. The cartel has watched with concern as the value of oil has fallen over the last six months, but has so far refused to cut its own production targets in a bid to force an upturn. Supplies of the US\u2019s light, \u201csweet\u201d crude will be a particular threat to Opec members such as Nigeria, which pumps a similar variety of oil. And although the changes from the department of commerce are couched in complex language and with plenty of caveats, many experts believe it could hasten the path to full crude oil exports from the US. The introduction of the US to international markets can only be good for oil users, in that it broadens the supply sector and makes the commodity less vulnerable to geopolitical upheaval. A very small number of savvy energy analysts had predicted the current price slump \u2013 they had long argued that the price of oil has been overvalued by at least $20 due to traders and speculators overemphasising the threats to global supplies due to events such as an upsurge in Iraqi violence or Russian political posturing. The question now is whether Opec will be able to respond with a production cut in the spring. Some cartel members are facing real financial problems and are desperate to see more output constraint, but no one knows whether it\u2019s the Saudi sheikhs or the Eagle Ford frackers who hold the winning hand. Last week\u2019s development threatens the balance of power in the oil world, but anything that heralds a more stable crude price is good news for consumers globally. Britain, beware Greeks bearing snap general elections It is not hard to imagine leaders in Madrid, Lisbon and Rome fearing the bitter general election that is due to shape Greece\u2019s future and play a key role in setting the continent\u2019s economic course this year. The snap poll, called following parliament\u2019s failure to elect a new president, will bring added instability to a eurozone already mired in economic stagnation and internal wrangling. Yet last week, even as the anti-euro party Syriza scented victory and made clear it was preparing for a fight with Brussels, the financial markets remained calm. The Italian government refinanced \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.3bn) of sovereign debt at an average interest rate of 1.89%, its lowest on record. It seems the spreadsheets that control market thinking have already priced in the prospect of Greece being cut adrift by its brothers and sisters. If the results of the election on 25 January show that Greeks are prepared to quit the euro unless they can extract major concessions, then the message seems to be: let them walk. But while Brussels has succeeded in persuading fund managers there is a financial firewall sufficient to protect them from the consequences of Syriza\u2019s ascendancy, the situation cannot be seen just in terms of money. A victory for Syriza will be viewed as a triumph for people power and, in the short term at least, a successful rebellion against the intellectually bankrupt pursuit of neverending austerity. There will be many in Europe who will cheer. At the very least, another period of uncertainty will begin, delaying the much prayed-for recovery in the eurozone\u2019s economic fortunes. It may prompt the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut the cost of credit with a first round of quantitative easing. ECB president Mario Draghi has hinted as much in his latest press conferences and interviews. But this belated move might keep Italian debt-servicing costs at all-time lows, it will do little to resolve the austerity argument. The first impact could be felt by the UK, which will hold its general election soon after the Greeks have their turn. A wounded and weakened Europe will take centre stage, bolstering Eurosceptic parties and harming Britain\u2019s prospects as a trading nation. Some economists are more equal than others Rock stars, those bastions of counterculture, are often co-opted by the powers they claim to undermine: Sir Mick Jagger being a case in point. So it is refreshing that Thomas Piketty, France\u2019s economic rock star, has done the decent thing and turned down his country\u2019s highest distinction \u2013 the Legion of Honour. The 43-year-old stoked the global debate over equality last year with his best-selling tome, Capital, so it is appropriate that Piketty slammed the award\u2019s hegemonic symbolism. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the role of the government to decide who is honourable,\u201d he said. More importantly, Piketty\u2019s message was: you cannot atone for social injustice by conferring gongs on those who draw attention to it. And, as he indicated, his message to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande should not just be restricted to the Elys\u00e9e. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off concentrating on boosting growth in France and Europe.\u201d",

A wounded and weakened Europe will take centre stage, bolstering Eurosceptic parties and harming Britain\u2019s prospects as a trading nation.</p> <h2>Some economists are more equal than others</h2> <p>Rock stars, those bastions of counterculture, are often co-opted by the powers they claim to undermine: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/12/netnotes.simonjeffery\" title=\"\">Sir Mick Jagger</a> being a case in point. So it is refreshing that Thomas Piketty, France\u2019s economic rock star, has done the decent thing and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/01/france-thomas-piketty-legion-of-honour\" title=\"\">turned down his country\u2019s highest distinction</a> \u2013 the Legion of Honour. The 43-year-old stoked the global debate over equality last year with his best-selling tome, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/capital-in-the-twenty-first-century.html\" title=\"\"><em>Capital</em></a>, so it is appropriate that Piketty slammed the award\u2019s hegemonic symbolism. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the role of the government to decide who is honourable,\u201d he said. More importantly, Piketty\u2019s message was: you cannot atone for social injustice by conferring gongs on those who draw attention to it. And, as he indicated, his message to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande should not just be restricted to the Elys\u00e9e. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off concentrating on boosting growth in France and Europe.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Outside the more mysteriously funded rightwing thinktanks, everyone agrees that we have become too unequal a society. Even those who think morality is for softies have come to recognise the economic case for greater equality. Inequality drove the 2008 crash. Its roots were in the banks\u2019 belief that they could remove the risk from lending to people whose stagnating wages meant they could not afford the repayments. And inequality lies behind the chancellor\u2019s failure to meet his deficit target. His problem is not a lack of deep cuts, but new jobs that are mostly low-paid and generate little tax. And with the Office for Budget Responsibility saying that even the subdued growth it expects will be based on increased household borrowing, it is looking like deja vu all over again. We can even put numbers on this. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that rising inequality between 1990 and 2010 cost the UK nine percentage points of economic growth. Across OECD members the richest 10% earn 9.5 times more than the poorest, up from seven times in the 1980s. Top UK directors now earn 120 times the average wage, up from 45 times in 1998. Britain\u2019s highest-paid director earned a year\u2019s worth of the living wage in less than an hour. But there is little agreement about what to do. When those who stand to lose the most have the tightest grip on power, it will not be easy. \u201cWhat is it about owning a big house in London that makes you so opposed to the mansion tax?\u201d as every celebrity opponent should be asked. We should start with pay. We should be more ambitious about the minimum wage, and in sectors of the economy where employers can afford more, there should be a higher floor. We can use the power of government procurement, responsible investment and consumer action to make not being a living-wage employer the difficult and controversial choice. That would save the taxpayer a good slice of the billions spent on in-work benefits that subsidise low pay. But even with higher wages we would still need redistribution through in-work support for those on lower incomes. The wage on which a fit single person can live will never be enough for a single parent caring for a disabled child. The chancellor knows many voters replay Benefits Street stereotypes when they hear the word welfare. But as benefits for the unemployed take just 2% of welfare, and protected pensioner spending takes 55%, he can only make his cuts by hitting low-paid workers hard. In his libertarian vision, the working poor will neither pay income tax nor get state top-ups as we return to a 1930s, pre-NHS, pre-welfare state country. Higher wages and redistribution through using tax and benefits to take from the rich and give to the rest work together. Better pay has a twofold effect: reducing the need for in-work support and generating the tax to pay for more redistribution. At the top end, we should cut excess executive pay, not simply slow its increase. We should end the cosy closed shop of remuneration committees by compelling employee representation. By taxing excess pay and bonuses as if they were profits, you do not just raise the corporation tax take, but make shareholders think harder about executive pay. But what about the vast bulk of the workforce who are neither rich nor on poverty pay? The average full-time wage is now worth \u00a32,500 less than it was in 2010. The first step is an economic policy that supports good jobs and growth. Yet George Osborne wants the opposite. His rapid post-election cuts would not just rip our social fabric but slow the economy. Taking that much demand out of a peacetime economy year after year has not happened since the 1920s \u201cGeddes axe\u201d, which not only failed to cut the deficit, but drove the Great Depression. We need more demand targeted at good jobs through industrial policy, decarbonisation, investment in skills and regional devolution of spending \u2013 not cuts. Yet even this will not guarantee fair wages within companies. This is why the International Monetary Fund says that we need to extend collective bargaining. Interestingly the author of the key IMF paper, Michael Kumhof, has been brought to the Bank of England by Mark Carney. The chancellor disagrees on this too. The Conservative party manifesto will pledge restrictions on trade union ballots that are so draconian they would effectively make legal strikes impossible and could criminalise pickets. Shifting the balance of power will weaken every worker\u2019s hand \u2013 whether or not they are in a union \u2013 as collective bargaining plays a key role in setting wage rates across many sectors. In the 1980s the right won the intellectual debate with its small-state, let-the-markets-rip ethos. That model broke in 2008. But the surprisingly extreme autumn statement offers economic self-harm \u2013 cuts that will depress growth, keep wages down, reduce the tax take and thus increase the deficit, which in turn will require more cuts and start the whole miserable process all over again. Our task is to reset the objectives of economic policy. A real recovery should mean rising living standards, decent work and reduced inequality. That does not just give us a popular and moral purpose, but offers a virtuous circle that will heal public finances and deal with the deficit \u2013 not as a fiscal straitjacket but as the healthy product of a fairer economy that works for all.

Her appointment as retail boss in 2013 had turned heads in both the technology and fashion industries, but it was only last year that her presence began to be felt. Apple has long been as much about lifestyle as technology, but the elaborate and glossy marketing for its first smartwatch is part of a carefully constructed shift towards painting Apple as a luxury brand. Ahrendts is working on the company\u2019s retail strategy for China \u2013 part of the reason it launched two larger smartphones \u2013 and will be pushing the use of the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint ID feature as part of its mobile payment tools. Flanked by several key appointments from fashion and luxury retail, Ahrendts will open 25 more stores in 2015, most of which will be overseas. The Apple Watch is Ahrendts\u2019s chance to shine at the centre of fashion and technology. She is admired in the industry and has won over Apple\u2019s retail staff but, if Apple is to convince its shareholders that it can keep innovating and successfully transform itself into a luxury retailer, Tim Cook should invite her on stage in 2015. If the future of Apple is secured by its talent, then Ahrendts holds the key. Jemima Kiss IAIN CONN Chief executive, Centrica He is neither a household name nor a man with household retail experience, but three days ago, on 1 January, that began to change, when the former BP lifer became the new boss of Britain\u2019s largest energy supplier: Centrica. The parent company of British Gas brought in Edinburgh-born Conn on a pay-and-shares package estimated at around \u00a33.7m a year. It is less than his predecessor, Sam Laidlaw, was paid, but still enough to cause a storm if household bills continue to rise. There was plenty more waiting in his in-tray. Customer trust in the energy supply sector remains at rock bottom, while the City sees few opportunities for power utilities making major financial gains in the current environment. The competition regulator is investigating the industry for alleged profiteering and could demand the break-up of companies such as Centrica, which have power-generating capacity as well as a supply business. What\u2019s more, the whole energy sector is already in the middle of wider reforms as the government tries to reduce carbon emissions while keeping the lights on. Conn is smart and can be tough and charming in equal measure. But this year will determine whether he has the wider skills to cope with this highly political and public post. Terry Macalister DAVE LEWIS Group chief executive, Tesco Dave Lewis\u2019s first three months as boss of Tesco were a baptism of fire, with his original brief to reinvent the UK\u2019s biggest grocer derailed by the accounting scandal that unearthed a \u00a3260m hole in its profits. With so many fires to fight \u2013 the grocer fired off its fifth profit warning of the year at the start of December \u2013 Lewis has yet to make any of the big strategic calls that will shape the embattled supermarket\u2019s future. But he cannot put it off any longer, with 2015 promising to be a crucial year for the once-lauded British company after the annus horribilis that was 2014. \u201cDrastic Dave\u201d, to give him the nickname earned in his time at Unilever, is due to deliver the first instalment of his strategy this week, when he will reveal how Tesco intends to win back British shoppers, alongside the management team\u2019s ideas on how to shore up a balance sheet creaking under more than \u00a37bn of debt. On the home front, analysts say Lewis must tackle food prices which are out of kilter with mainstream rivals, not least the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. He also needs a plan for the sprawling Extra stores which are dragging the group down in an increasingly digital age of shopping. He will also have to decide whether Tesco\u2019s days of empire building are over: selling its successful Asian hypermarket chains would solve its financial problems but choke off a major avenue of growth. Drastic Dave will be called on to take some of the biggest decisions in Tesco\u2019s history this year, if not this week. As market leader, the hand he plays will have ramifications for the whole UK grocery industry. Zoe Wood SIR HOWARD DAVIES Chairman, Airports Commission Barring a shock decision by a new chancellor to scrap HS2, the single biggest question on the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure this year will be where to build a new runway: Heathrow or Gatwick. No politician has been reckless enough to pledge they will endorse the recommendation of Sir Howard Davies\u2019s Airports Commission, due this summer. But it would be strange indeed to overturn the biggest body of weighted research on the question that anyone is ever likely to produce, painstakingly compiled over three years in the politically expedient long grass. Davies has, in the words of Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins, \u201cperformed a classic establishment minuet\u201d in keeping the debate open as instructed. But he was tough enough to face down the attacks of Boris Johnson when he dismissed the London mayor\u2019s Thames estuary scheme. He also made one important call in stating categorically that a new runway was needed. However independent the commission is, Davies may indeed bow to political reality. He is frank that the ability to deliver is a key consideration \u2013 and that criterion surely includes whether any government has ruled out a particular option \u2013 as the coalition did with Heathrow, even if it regretted it later. The eyes of airlines, businesses, environmentalists, residents threatened by noise and the wealthy foreign investors wanting to see even greater returns from their cash-cow airports will all be on Davies. He is shrewd enough to know that many commissions\u2019 reports end up as curios on the dusty shelves of history. But he may just shape Britain\u2019s geography for decades to come. Gwyn Topham JOHN MCFARLANE Chairman-in-waiting, Barclays John McFarlane has already earned a reputation in the City for taking on big challenges. When insurance company Aviva parted company with its boss, Andrew Moss, during the height of the shareholder spring in 2012, it was non-executive director McFarlane who stepped up to the role of executive chairman. He gave the impression of a man enjoying his time at the top. So when he becomes chairman of Barclays at the annual general meeting in the spring, his actions will be closely watched, particularly by his chief executive, Antony Jenkins, who was promoted in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging scandal. Barclays will by then most likely have agreed a multimillion-pound fine with UK and US regulators over rigging foreign exchange markets. It failed to sign up to last November\u2019s agreement, in which six of its rivals were hit with record-breaking fines. Jenkins will also have been through another bonus round, after last year\u2019s disaster when he was roundly criticised for explaining his decision to increase bonuses at a time of falling profits by warning the bank would be sent into a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d if top bankers left. Since then, Jenkins has embarked on a plan to scale down the investment bank, the source of the huge pay deals of the past. Jenkins has said he and McFarlane have discussed the strategy and it has the support of the chairman-designate. The two have known each other since the 1980s, although McFarlane \u2013 a Scot by birth \u2013 spent the latter part of his career in Australia, where he ran ANZ bank for a decade. McFarlane had only just begun to put his firefighting skills to use in the 2008 banking crisis when he was appointed a non-executive director of Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 just before it was bailed out by the taxpayer. He has said he believes bankers take too much of the spoils at the expense of shareholders. Barclays investors may want to hold him to his word. Jill Treanor HARRIET GREEN Former chief executive, Thomas Cook Harriet Green was booted out as boss of Thomas Cook, the 173-year-old travel agent, in November. Expect her to bounce back. Thomas Cook shareholders rated Green \u2013 her shock departure wiped \u00a3400m off the value of the tour operator and there are many others in the City who are dedicated fans of the 53-year-old turnaround specialist. Green joined the crisis-stricken holiday firm in 2012 when she emailed chairman Frank Meysman suggesting modestly that the solution to his problems would be to hire her. The shares were languishing at just 14p. She instigated a savage cost-cutting plan to save \u00a3440m by axing 2,500 jobs and 400 high street branches. The day before Green\u2019s departure was announced, the shares were changing hands at about 137p each. But she came under attack at a secret Sunday night dinner of Thomas Cook directors over fears that she had run out of cost-cutting tricks and concern that she didn\u2019t actually know very much about travel. She was also, by many accounts, a demanding boss. One former colleague talked about Green\u2019s colleagues living \u201cin fear of her public humiliations\u201d. Green describes herself as a \u201clanda\u201d, which she defines as a cross between a cuddly panda and a ferocious lion, although some former colleagues at Thomas Cook suggest that she was more of the latter. However, Green says these anonymous observations do not reflect the more positive reality of her leadership at Thomas Cook, and many in the City reckon its loss will be another company\u2019s gain. One Square Mile associate and Green fan said: \u201cShe has a following who will invest in whatever business she is running, which is extremely rare. And it really was a quite extraordinary thing to turn around a group like Thomas Cook.\u201d Rupert Neate SHARON WHITE Chief executive, Ofcom The first woman and the first person from an ethnic minority to lead the communications watchdog Ofcom, Sharon White is a keen runner but will soon be adding football to her interests. After 25 years as a civil servant, at the Downing Street policy unit under Tony Blair and most recently as the second permanent secretary to the Treasury under George Osborne, and with a stint at the World Bank under her belt, White will sprint onto the pitch at Ofcom in late March. By then, the result of the eagerly anticipated Premier League television rights auction will be known. Sky is bidding to retain its 75% share of live football match screenings in the face of an ambitious and deep-pocketed BT. Top of White\u2019s in-tray will be ruling on two inquiries opened by her predecessor, Ed Richards. The first will decide whether Sky should remain obliged to resell its sports channels to rival pay-TV groups; the second, whether more Premier League matches should be made available to television viewers. Ofcom, which has a budget of \u00a3117m and nearly 800 staff, recently added postal services to its remit and White will come under pressure to deal with doubts over Royal Mail\u2019s costly universal service obligation. There is broadband, too, where countryside campaigners will be pushing for Ofcom to designate the internet as an essential service and so ensure the most remote areas are not left offline. One half of a power couple known as Mr and Mrs Treasury (her husband, Robert Chote, is chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility), White will need nerves of steel to take on the Murdochs. But as Osborne\u2019s chief cuts enforcer, she is no stranger to tackling powerful vested interests. Juliette Garside GAVIN PATTERSON Chief executive, BT While his Glaswegian predecessor Sir Ian Livingston was happy to conform to the stereotype of the parsimonious Scot, returning BT to financial strength with successive rounds of cost cuts, Gavin Patterson is on a spending spree. Some \u00a32.5bn has been committed to football rights and sports broadcasting. Now Patterson is negotiating a \u00a312.5bn takeover of mobile network EE. All bets are off as to BT\u2019s strategy in the forthcoming Premier League rights auction. The telecoms group swooped in 2012 and won a 25% share of the rights, while its bid for more led to massively inflated costs for Sky\u2019s remaining 75%. This time BT could secure a bigger share, or simply force prices even higher for Sky. Patterson\u2019s first challenge in 2015 will be finance. A \u00a32bn share placing has been mooted, as has raising an extra \u00a33bn in debt. A veteran of cable company Telewest, which later merged with NTL to become Virgin Media, Patterson knows a thing or two about pay TV and is no stranger to taking on Sky. But his deals are quickly transforming BT from a challenger in pay TV to the dominant force in the UK\u2019s converging communications market, and Patterson will this year find himself on the receiving end of intensive industry lobbying. Vodafone, which is also hoping to make the transition from only offering mobile to selling customers fibre broadband and pay-TV, has made it clear the price of renting fibre cables from BT must come down. If this doesn\u2019t happen, there may be calls to split off Openreach, the division which builds and maintains the BT network. Juliette Garside MARIO DRAGHI President, European Central Bank Mario Draghi has a way with words. The head of the European Central Bank saved the eurozone from the worst phase of crisis in 2012 simply by saying he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. As it turned out, he did not have to do much more because his words proved sufficiently powerful to soothe the worst of investor fears. But 2015 could be different. Despite announcing a raft of measures in 2014 \u2013 such as charging banks to park cash with the ECB in a bid to encourage them to lend \u2013 investors have been left wanting more. The battle against deflation is not over, with annual inflation currently at just 0.3%. And the impact of measures taken have yet to be felt in the wider economy, with growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter. As Draghi ponders what 2015 might hold, it is clear he is facing one of his biggest challenges yet. The good news is he still has a major monetary weapon up his sleeve \u2013 full-blown quantitative easing (QE), or the purchase of troubled nations\u2019 sovereign debt with ECB cash. Draghi persistently hinted in 2014 that he stood ready and willing to unleash QE should it prove necessary but, amid strong opposition from Germany, it failed to materialise. He left markets guessing again as he signed off for 2014, announcing in his final press conference for the year that the ECB would reassess how effective its existing measures had been \u201cearly next year\u201d. But the pressure is on and the spotlight will be back on Draghi at the next meeting of the ECB\u2019s governing council in January. If the data remains weak, a failure to take the plunge with QE could spark market panic and worsen the eurozone\u2019s lot. This might be the year that the eloquent Italian needs more than just words to see him through. Angela Monaghan",

She instigated a savage cost-cutting plan to save \u00a3440m by axing 2,500 jobs and 400 high street branches. The day before Green\u2019s departure was announced, the shares were changing hands at about 137p each.</p> <p>But she came under attack at a secret Sunday night dinner of Thomas Cook directors over fears that she had run out of cost-cutting tricks and concern that she didn\u2019t actually know very much about travel.</p> <p>She was also, by many accounts, a demanding boss. One former colleague talked about Green\u2019s colleagues living <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/26/harriet-green-thomas-cook-turnaround\">\u201cin fear of her public humiliations\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Green describes herself as a \u201clanda\u201d, which she defines as a cross between a cuddly panda and a ferocious lion, although some former colleagues at Thomas Cook suggest that she was more of the latter. However, Green says these anonymous observations do not reflect the more positive reality of her leadership at Thomas Cook, and many in the City reckon its loss will be another company\u2019s gain. One Square Mile associate and Green fan said: \u201cShe has a following who will invest in whatever business she is running, which is extremely rare.

The telecoms group swooped in 2012 and won a 25% share of the rights, while its bid for more led to massively inflated costs for Sky\u2019s remaining 75%.

      "bodyText": "If 2014 was the year of the discounter, 2015 is set to be the year of Dave. All eyes are on the new boss of Tesco, Dave Lewis, as he tries to reboot the UK\u2019s biggest retailer after an annus horribilis marked by falling sales, five profit warnings and an accounting scandal. In the past year, Tesco\u2019s bungling has given free rein to discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have both seen rapid growth by offering a cheap and more convenient alternative to spending hours wheeling a trolley around a huge out-of-town store. If Lewis can muster a fightback, that will not only make life tougher for the German chains but also for Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s, who are already under considerable pressure. Thanks to an ongoing price war, you may have enjoyed a cheaper Christmas dinner. But all four of the major chains are expected to have seen sales tumble, while Aldi and Lidl enjoyed double-digit growth and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer also benefited. Morrisons boss Dalton Philips is the most likely to fear the festive hangover. After two miserable Christmas performances, many believe his head will be on the block if Morrisons finds itself to have been the worst performer of the big four during December. Former Tesco man Andy Higginson has been lined up to take over as chairman from Sir Ian Gibson and many believe he will do so before his scheduled start date in June. \u201cAnother bad Christmas is likely to mean the chairman comes in early, and a new management team,\u201d says Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research. Morrisons has been losing ground even while Tesco has been in meltdown. The Bradford-based chain, like rivals Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, will be under extra pressure if Lewis can make swift improvements at Tesco. Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at HSBC, reckons the rapid growth of the discounters may be slowing and Tesco could soon be on the mend: \u201cWe believe discounters\u2019 growth has peaked, and while they will remain an important feature, we do not believe they will be the defining feature of the grocery sector in 2015 \u2013 that will be Tesco\u2019s recovery.\u201d There are signs that Lewis has already reined in the pace of falling sales at Tesco: the retailer put in its strongest performance since June in the three months to 7 December, according to figures from Kantar Worldpanel. However, sales were still down 2.7%, a performance which puts Tesco well behind Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda and only ahead of Morrisons among its major competitors. An insight into Lewis\u2019s plans is expected when he updates the City on Christmas trading on Thursday. Traditionally, the major supermarkets use the first month of the year, when shoppers are feeling hard-pressed after the Christmas binge, to talk about price cuts. Will Lewis begin the year with a shock-and-awe pricing strategy? Most analysts believe that is unlikely, as the former Unilever boss has already told the City to watch out for changes as they appear in store, rather than wait for grand announcements of strategy, as he believes this kind of public statement could benefit his rivals. Before Christmas, he produced the first evidence of his tactics to put Tesco on the front foot. As shoppers prepared for Christmas, Tesco slashed the price of the \u201cfestive five\u201d \u2013 bags of vegetables including carrots, potatoes, Brussels, cauliflower and parsnips \u2013 to 49p. The promotion was simple and widely advertised and made Tesco 65% cheaper than 2013 for those items \u2013 and at least 20% cheaper than all of its rivals, including Aldi, according to analyst Bernstein Research. \u201cThis year is going to be great for the consumer,\u201d says Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, as he predicts ongoing heavy price competition will mean deflation will continue in 2015. The impact of strong harvests, thanks to this year\u2019s warm weather, and relatively low oil prices, together with some big commitments from the grocers, will keep prices down. Sainsbury\u2019s has said it will slash costs by \u00a3500m over the next three years and save \u00a3150m in the year ahead, by cutting better deals with suppliers as it tries to improve products and lower prices. Morrisons is to invest about \u00a3300m in price and product improvements, while Asda has pledged to spend more than \u00a3200m a year on price cuts up until 2018. Tesco spent more than \u00a3200m in 2014 and the 49p festive-five promotion signals that it is prepared to invest more. Tesco\u2019s festive promotion is not just about a stronger focus on price. It can be seen as part of a wider trend towards simpler, pared-down grocery retailing as the chain saves cash to cut prices. \u201cThere is no call to offer 45 colas. It can\u2019t offer two like Aldi, but it can reduce,\u201d says independent retail analyst Steve Dresser. While Waitrose has set out to make itself radically different from discounters, installing service counters and an array of ways to taste-test or dine in stores, its mainstream rivals will have a laser-like focus on ways to save cash. The chief executive of one of the big grocers is privately warning that shoppers are going to have to get used to stores that are less than pristine. After many years of expanding workforces, jobs are also likely to be lost. This week\u2019s update from Tesco is likely to include details of cutting head-office overheads, with jobs expected to be axed. Lewis might try, for instance, to bring together the grocer\u2019s huge offices in Welwyn Garden City and Cheshunt. Analysts also expect Lewis to give some indications of businesses which could be sold \u2013 such as movie-streaming offshoot Blinkbox or market research operation Dunnhumby. There could also be a partial flotation of Tesco\u2019s Asian business or Tesco\u2019s bank, as Lewis sets about stabilising the group\u2019s balance sheet. The credit-rating agencies have made it clear they have concerns about Tesco. Less than four months into the job, Lewis has already been forced to warn that profits will be a massive \u00a3500m less than hoped for this year, after he put more staff in stores and resettled agreements with suppliers. Lewis may also give more details about what he plans to do with Tesco\u2019s largest stores, now that shoppers have a clear preference for smaller shops. Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe supermarket bosses need to take drastic action, shutting one in five of their stores if the financial health of the mainstream grocery chains is to recover from the damage being inflicted by the rapid change in shopping habits. They predicted that sales will fall by about 3% a year in major supermarkets\u2019 largest stores between now and 2020. Because the fixed costs of running a big store \u2013 lighting, heating, rates, minimum staffing levels, etc \u2013 are high, such declines in sales would hit profits seriously if action is not taken. Goldman Sachs argues that Tesco\u2019s biggest problem is not price, but over-expansion, which has left it with 56% of its stores more than 40,000 sq ft in size. While the mass closure of existing stores may not be on the cards this year, Lewis has already pulled out of one major development and mothballed two stores. Others have been trimmed by giving space to other retailers, such as Sports Direct, or services, such as gyms and play centres. But space for building food stores is far more valuable than space used to house gyms, soft play centres or even to build houses \u2013 and Tesco and its rivals are now expected to have to write down the value of their property significantly. Tesco alone is expected to write down the value of its UK stores by at least \u00a31bn, as property industry sources said capital values had fallen by 20% or more for supermarket space. The discounters, by contrast, are hunting for new locations. Lidl wants to open at least 30 shops in 2015, and Aldi 65, while Sainsbury\u2019s will decide the future of its Netto discount chain by the summer. Asda is also keen to open more mid-sized stores and so all of them will be competing for the same locations. If Netto proves a success, Sainsbury\u2019s could use its existing property portfolio \u2013 either under-utilised space in existing stores or spots in shopping developments that it controls \u2013 to roll out the chain, which currently has just five outlets. But reviving the Netto brand, which exited the UK in 2010, isn\u2019t a guaranteed success. Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s new chief executive, has distanced himself from the Netto project so far, and analysts are bitterly divided over whether the idea makes sense. For all the discounters, finding new space will dictate the scale of their continuing impact this year. While both Aldi and Lidl continue to persuade more shoppers to put more items in their basket on each visit \u2013 and are likely to continue to gain market share in 2015 \u2013 some of their stores are now becoming overwhelmed. Aldi\u2019s growth has also been partially driven by expanding the number of items it stocks and introducing more premium-priced goods, and analysts believe both those strategies could be running out of steam. \u201cAs it adds more bells and whistles, from range extensions to self-checkouts, to accepting credit cards, it risks heaping too many costs on a business model founded on simplicity,\u201d says Natalie Berg, global research director at Planet Retail. But the economic realities that have driven the trend for discount shopping may also be changing. Rising incomes and employment may mean customers could again want greater choice and services, such as online shopping or click and collect, which the major retailers can offer. These factors will be more attractive still if the big chains can bring prices down to near discounter levels. \u201cThe gloves are off. Tesco is no longer the chubby kid getting outmanoeuvred... all the big four have gone to the gym and will fight back,\u201d says Black.",

The impact of strong harvests, thanks to this year\u2019s warm weather, and relatively low oil prices, together with some big commitments from the grocers, will keep prices down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5de37899ff195744aeea71fc82814b650fead6a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/2/1420211796040/8ebe9be9-a772-4635-95a9-b3900ecd897e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has said it will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/sainsburys-150m-price-cuts-slumps-first-half-loss-profits\" title=\"\">slash costs by \u00a3500m over the next three years</a> and save \u00a3150m in the year ahead, by cutting better deals with suppliers as it tries to improve products and lower prices. Morrisons is to invest about \u00a3300m in price and product improvements, while Asda has pledged to spend more than \u00a3200m a year on price cuts up until 2018. Tesco spent more than \u00a3200m in 2014 and the 49p festive-five promotion signals that it is prepared to invest more.</p> <p>Tesco\u2019s festive promotion is not just about a stronger focus on price. It can be seen as part of a wider trend towards simpler, pared-down grocery retailing as the chain saves cash to cut prices. \u201cThere is no call to offer 45 colas. It can\u2019t offer two like Aldi, but it can reduce,\u201d says independent retail analyst Steve Dresser.</p> <p>While Waitrose has set out to make itself radically different from discounters, installing service counters and an array of ways to taste-test or dine in stores, its mainstream rivals will have a laser-like focus on ways to save cash. The chief executive of one of the big grocers is privately warning that shoppers are going to have to get used to stores that are less than pristine.</p> <p>After many years of expanding workforces, jobs are also likely to be lost. This week\u2019s update from Tesco is likely to include details of cutting head-office overheads, with jobs expected to be axed. Lewis might try, for instance, to bring together the grocer\u2019s huge offices in Welwyn Garden City and Cheshunt.</p> <p>Analysts also expect Lewis to give some indications of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/10/tesco-sell-financial-footing-blinkbox-dobbies-dunnhumby\" title=\"\">businesses which could be sold</a> \u2013 such as movie-streaming offshoot <a href=\"http://www.blinkbox.com/?ppc=1&amp;gclid=CKGjs4i09cICFcPMtAodt2wAjA&amp;dclid=CNPBuIi09cICFcNefAodDRkAyA\" title=\"\">Blinkbox</a> or market research operation Dunnhumby. There could also be a partial flotation of Tesco\u2019s Asian business or Tesco\u2019s bank, as Lewis sets about stabilising the group\u2019s balance sheet. The credit-rating agencies have made it clear <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/10/tesco-sales-slump-continue-standard-poors\" title=\"\">they have concerns about Tesco</a>. Less than four months into the job, Lewis has already been forced to warn that profits will be a massive \u00a3500m less than hoped for this year, after he put more staff in stores and resettled agreements with suppliers.</p> <p>Lewis may also give more details about what he plans to do with Tesco\u2019s largest stores, now that shoppers have a clear preference for smaller shops.</p> <p>Analysts at <a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/?cid=PS_01_05_07_00_00_00_02\" title=\"\">Goldman Sachs </a>believe supermarket bosses need to take drastic action, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/17/tesco-uk-supermarkets-closure-industry-profit-growth-goldman-sachs\" title=\"\">shutting one in five of their stores</a> if the financial health of the mainstream grocery chains is to recover from the damage being inflicted by the rapid change in shopping habits. They predicted that sales will fall by about 3% a year in major supermarkets\u2019 largest stores between now and 2020. Because the fixed costs of running a big store \u2013 lighting, heating, rates, minimum staffing levels, etc \u2013 are high, such declines in sales would hit profits seriously if action is not taken.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs argues that Tesco\u2019s biggest problem is not price, but over-expansion, which has left it with 56% of its stores more than 40,000 sq ft in size. While the mass closure of existing stores may not be on the cards this year, Lewis has already pulled out of one major development and mothballed two stores. Others have been trimmed by giving space to other retailers, such as Sports Direct, or services, such as gyms and play centres. But space for building food stores is far more valuable than space used to house gyms, soft play centres or even to build houses \u2013 and Tesco and its rivals are now expected to have to write down the value of their property significantly. Tesco alone is expected to write down the value of its UK stores by at least \u00a31bn, as property industry sources said capital values had fallen by 20% or more for supermarket space.</p> <p>The discounters, by contrast, are hunting for new locations. Lidl wants to open at least 30 shops in 2015, and Aldi 65, while Sainsbury\u2019s will decide the future of its Netto discount chain by the summer. Asda is also keen to open more mid-sized stores and so all of them will be competing for the same locations. If Netto proves a success, Sainsbury\u2019s could use its existing property portfolio \u2013 either under-utilised space in existing stores or spots in shopping developments that it controls \u2013 to roll out the chain, which currently has just five outlets.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/06/sainsbury-netto-discount-grocery-store-chain\" title=\"\">reviving the Netto brand</a>, which exited the UK in 2010, isn\u2019t a guaranteed success. Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s new chief executive, has distanced himself from the Netto project so far, and analysts are bitterly divided over whether the idea makes sense.</p> <p>For all the discounters, finding new space will dictate the scale of their continuing impact this year. While both Aldi and Lidl continue to persuade more shoppers to put more items in their basket on each visit \u2013 and are likely to continue to gain market share in 2015 \u2013 some of their stores are now becoming overwhelmed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/29/how-aldi-price-plan-shook-up-tesco-morrisons-asda-sainsburys\" title=\"\">Aldi\u2019s growth</a> has also been partially driven by expanding the number of items it stocks and introducing more premium-priced goods, and analysts believe both those strategies could be running out of steam. \u201cAs it adds more bells and whistles, from range extensions to self-checkouts, to accepting credit cards, it risks heaping too many costs on a business model founded on simplicity,\u201d says Natalie Berg, global research director at Planet Retail.</p> <p>But the economic realities that have driven the trend for discount shopping may also be changing. Rising incomes and employment may mean customers could again want greater choice and services, such as online shopping or click and collect, which the major retailers can offer. These factors will be more attractive still if the big chains can bring prices down to near discounter levels.</p> <p>\u201cThe gloves are off. Tesco is no longer the chubby kid getting outmanoeuvred... all the big four have gone to the gym and will fight back,\u201d says Black.</p>",
