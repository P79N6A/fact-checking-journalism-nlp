Those hopeful that the battery would be used to immediately incorporate solar power into local grids got some unpleasant news: SolarCity, a company of which Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk is chairman, isn\u2019t interested in the Tesla Powerpack or the larger Powerwall, Bloomberg reported earlier today. In a call with reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Musk did not contradict the report, saying the battery wasn\u2019t economical in the US yet.

It seems to have gone super viral.\u201d Asked what kinds of margins investors could expect from the company\u2019s gigantic new battery investment, Musk stalled briefly, but gave the analyst quizzing him a very high prediction: \u201cOnce we get the Gigafactory up and running and get the economies of scale working, this is just a guess right now, but maybe it\u2019s something like 20%.\u201d The electric goods company reported raking in $1.10bn in revenue this quarter, $1.06bn of it from car sales, but it is the batteries that dominated the discussion on Tesla\u2019s results call. \u201cThe stationary storage demand is just nutty,\u201d Musk said.",

    "webTitle": "GSK is on the mend but still lacks vital ingredient for growth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Those with long memories will remember when GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s shares traded at \u00a320. It was 2000, when the company was formed through a mega-merger. Hopes were high that a golden age of pharmaceutical discovery was about to dawn. A decade and a half later, with the share price stuck at about the \u00a315 mark, there\u2019s a plan to return to the old heights via a harder route. It is not, however, the action-packed strategy that chief executive Sir Andrew Witty had indicated six months ago. Viiv, the 80%-owned HIV business, will no longer be spun off to join the ranks of FTSE 100 companies. GSK says the unit is performing splendidly and it would rather not be a seller; indeed, it may even be a buyer of the other 20% if the partners exercise their right to sell. As a result, GSK\u2019s half-promised \u00a34bn share buy-back has been cancelled, to be replaced by a \u00a31bn special dividend. Often such news would produce groans of disappointment among fund managers who expect their jam today, not tomorrow. But Witty has made the right call: if Viiv\u2019s current form (sales up 42% in the quarter) is a medium-term guide, there is no reason to get out. The question was whether GSK could simultaneously hold its dividend. Witty reckons that, too, can be done. He\u2019s made a three-year commitment to keep paying 80p a share. He\u2019s also stuck his neck out on earnings. This year\u2019s whack, partly a result of the asset shuffle with Novartis, will be double-digit painful but then the clouds clear \u2013 earnings per share will grow at compound rate of \u201cmid to high single digits\u201d all the way to 2020 even if asthma treatment Advair, GSK\u2019s biggest product, is hit by generic competition. The confidence on earnings should be reassuring, even if it bears little resemblance to the 2000 vision for GSK. That vision became redundant at least a decade ago, when governments got tougher on pricing and generic manufacturers became smarter. Witty\u2019s plan B for GSK for the past seven years has been a de-risking exercise. Thus there was the sale of the oncology unit to Novartis last year, the purchase of the Swiss firm\u2019s vaccine business and the pooling of resources in consumer products such as toothpastes and nicotine gum. The result is a duller but safer company with a 5.3% dividend yield. The tale still lacks the vital ingredient of growth, but GSK is on the right track. Life looks a grind for Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders A first statutory loss for a decade, a 15% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3681m and a cut of almost a quarter in the dividend is nobody\u2019s definition of success. Relative to shrunken expectations, however, last year counts as a decent result for Sainsbury\u2019s. The business did not suffer a catastrophe in the style of Morrisons or Tesco. That\u2019s the good (ish) news. The worry for shareholders is that life looks a grind as far as the eye can see. Chief executive Mike Coupe is trying to fine-tune his \u201cinvestment\u201d in lower prices, which is an investment investors would prefer he didn\u2019t have to make. Sales densities declined from \u00a318.93 to \u00a318.24 per sq ft per week last year. Online orders, obliging the supermarket to do the hard work of packing and delivering the goods, continues to grow in popularity. And, one of these days, the assumed recovery at Tesco may bite. If Sainsbury\u2019s can continue to conjure a 3% profit margin from that unpromising mix, shareholders would probably accept their lot. The new mechanical formula for dividends \u2013 half of earnings are paid out \u2013 produced 13.2p last year, a yield of 5% at the current share price. Not bad if it could be relied upon. Unfortunately it can\u2019t. Any of the various headaches could intensify. On a sales base of \u00a326bn, the difference between a 3% margin and, say, 2% is huge. \u201cWe will remain competitive on price in the market,\u201d says Sainsbury\u2019s, an acknowledgement that some factors are simply beyond its control. A case of good management and a tough market that may get tougher yet. Beware Greenspan\u2019s \u2018irrational exuberance\u2019 Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, says share prices are \u201cquite high\u201d. It\u2019s a view held widely. Pin chief executives against a wall and many confess they fear what will happen to stock markets when interest rates rise. Do not, however, attempt to guess the moment of the turn. Instead, recall that Alan Greenspan, Yellen\u2019s predecessor but one, made his famous speech about \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d in financial markets in December 1996. Within the next 18 months, there was an Asian currency crisis, a Russian debt default and a giant hedge fund blow-up. But Greenspan kept the cheap money flowing. It wasn\u2019t until 1999-2000 that the stock market bubble finally burst.",

      "body": "<p>Those with long memories will remember when GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s shares traded at \u00a320. It was 2000, when the company was formed through a mega-merger. Hopes were high that a golden age of pharmaceutical discovery was about to dawn. A decade and a half later, with the share price stuck at about the \u00a315 mark, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/06/glaxosmithkline-scraps-float-plans-hiv-business\">there\u2019s a plan to return to the old heights via a harder route</a>.</p> <p>It is not, however, the action-packed strategy that chief executive Sir Andrew Witty had indicated six months ago. Viiv, the 80%-owned HIV business, will no longer be spun off to join the ranks of FTSE 100 companies. GSK says the unit is performing splendidly and it would rather not be a seller; indeed, it may even be a buyer of the other 20% if the partners exercise their right to sell. As a result, GSK\u2019s half-promised \u00a34bn share buy-back has been cancelled, to be replaced by a \u00a31bn special dividend.</p> <p>Often such news would produce groans of disappointment among fund managers who expect their jam today, not tomorrow. But Witty has made the right call: if Viiv\u2019s current form (sales up 42% in the quarter) is a medium-term guide, there is no reason to get out.</p> <p>The question was whether GSK could simultaneously hold its dividend. Witty reckons that, too, can be done. He\u2019s made a three-year commitment to keep paying 80p a share. He\u2019s also stuck his neck out on earnings. This year\u2019s whack, partly a result of the asset shuffle with Novartis, will be double-digit painful but then the clouds clear \u2013 earnings per share will grow at compound rate of \u201cmid to high single digits\u201d all the way to 2020 even if asthma treatment Advair, GSK\u2019s biggest product, is hit by generic competition.</p> <p>The confidence on earnings should be reassuring, even if it bears little resemblance to the 2000 vision for GSK. That vision became redundant at least a decade ago, when governments got tougher on pricing and generic manufacturers became smarter.</p> <p>Witty\u2019s plan B for GSK for the past seven years has been a de-risking exercise. Thus there was the sale of the oncology unit to Novartis last year, the purchase of the Swiss firm\u2019s vaccine business and the pooling of resources in consumer products such as toothpastes and nicotine gum. The result is a duller but safer company with a 5.3% dividend yield. The tale still lacks the vital ingredient of growth, but GSK is on the right track.</p> <h2>Life looks a grind for Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19fc00c01e33fc88e7f8d9897cad17311a696955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19fc00c01e33fc88e7f8d9897cad17311a696955/0_0_2227_1336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sainsbury's shopping basket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year counts as a decent result for Sainsbury\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A first statutory loss for a decade, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/06/sainsburys-makes-72m-full-year-loss-on-property-writedowns\">a 15% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3681m</a> and a cut of almost a quarter in the dividend is nobody\u2019s definition of success.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of Standard Chartered has said the bank will review its involvement in a controversial Australian coal mine that critics say threatens the Great Barrier Reef and will blow a hole in the global carbon budget. The London-listed bank, which does most of of its business outside the UK, said it would go \u201cno further\u201d with the Carmichael mine until it had looked at the project\u2019s environmental credentials. The bank has been advising the Indian conglomerate Adani on building the Carmichael mine and expanding a port on Abbot Point on the Great Barrier Reef. Standard Chartered\u2019s advisory role gives it an influential voice in the project, which opponents say will deplete the world\u2019s carbon budget, which is the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted while limiting the global temperature rise to an agreed target of 2\u00b0C. Critics have also claimed that the project will damage the Unesco-protected Great Barrier Reef and hoover up government subsidies. While attending the bank\u2019s annual general meeting in London, chairman Sir John Peace said: \u201cWe will go no further with this project until we are fully satisfied with all the environmental aspects.\u201d He said the bank was in \u201cactive discussion\u201d with the Australian government and ready to meet green campaigners. But Peace declined to answer questions on Standard Chartered\u2019s ties with Adani. A senior executive at Adani\u2019s Australian mining subsidiary told a Queensland court last month that Standard Chartered had lent it $680m (\u00a3448m) for the project \u2013 calling into question the bank\u2019s official statements that it is not a lender. Sebastian Bock, investment campaigner at Greenpeace, said it was clear the bank was not ready to answer questions at the shareholder meeting, but welcomed its readiness to look again at the project. \u201cIt is quite encouraging to see that the bank has started an internal discussion on this project. We will really have to see what they will put on the table. Policies are great, but in the end it all comes down to how they are implemented.\u201d At the meeting, one shareholder, who identified himself as a Methodist minister, called on Standard Chartered to drop all fossil fuel investment. \u201cMany church bodies are beginning to divest in coal and tar sands and I would urge you to do the same.\u201d Last week the Church of England announced it was moving its money out of the most-polluting fossil fuels, while the Methodists have ruled out future investments in coal and tar sands. The bank also used the meeting to confirm the appointment of Bill Winters as chief executive from 10 June. He replaces Peter Sands, who has overseen a 30% fall in profits and a $300m fine from US authorities for breaches of money-laundering rules. Mike Rees, head of Standard Chartered\u2019s wholesale banking division, and one of the highest-paid bankers in the industry, was denied almost a quarter of available votes \u2013 a large revolt by the standards of shareholder meetings. The vote is thought to have been cast by Temasek, the Singapore investment company. Winters is a former JP Morgan executive, who once criticised \u201cgreedy\u201d bankers and served on the government\u2019s commission on banking. He attended the AGM, but did not take public questions from shareholders or journalists.",

      "bodyText": "Some late news: The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has ended its deliberations. And the word from Frankfurt is that Greece\u2019s banks will be given an extra 2 billion euros emergency liquidity, taking the ELA total up to 78.9bn euros. But that\u2019s not all. After \u201cintense\u201d discussions, the ECB had decided not to change the \u2018haircut\u2019 applied to the assets Greek banks hand over as collateral for the ELA. But they will reconsider it next week, after Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting..... With talks between Greece and its creditors continuing - and the Brussels group of the ECB, IMF and EU maintaining they are working hard together to find a solution - shares have edged higher, even as bonds across the eurozone continue to slip. Stock markets were also unsettled by comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen that equity values were \u201cquite high\u201d and potentially dangerous. However Wall Street reacted more than European markets to this warning. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 is up 6.16 points at 6933.74 Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.2% to 11,350.15 France\u2019s Cac has closed up 0.15% at 4981.59 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.37% at 22,659.85 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.43% higher at 11,163.6 The Athens market jumped 2.86% to 816.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 85 points or 0.48%. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. And there is even some optimism around about Greece now: Speculation on the ECB\u2019s decision on liquidity for Greek banks: Some speculation on the timing of the European Central Bank\u2019s decision on whether to keep supplying emergency liquidity assistance to Greece\u2019s banking sector, following today\u2019s meeting: Back with Greece and former prime minister George Papandreou has added his voice to the current debate: Earlier Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen caused some tremors in the markets by warning about high valuations. Speaking at a Finance and Society conference in Washington, she said: I would highlight that equity market valuations at this point generally are quite high. There are potential dangers there. \u201cConcrete progress\u201d is now the aim for Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, according to a joint statement from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund: The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund share the same objective of helping Greece achieve financial stability and growth. The institutions continue to work closely together toward that goal. All three institutions are working hard to achieve concrete progress on 11 May. This appears to be a reply to Greece\u2019s accusations that divisions between the creditor group are causing problems with resolving its financial difficulties. The European Central Bank has issued a list of 8 banks which will face stress tests and balance sheet reviews, while Portugal\u2019s Banco Novo will face a stress test only. The moves because of their increased systemic significance since the ECB\u2019s last health check last year. The banks are: Belgium Banque Degroof S.A. France Agence Franc\u0327aise de De\u0301veloppement* Luxembourg J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A.* Malta Mediterranean Bank plc* Austria Sberbank Europe AG VTB Bank (Austria) AG Portugal Novo Banco, SA (only for the stress test) Slovenia Unicredit Banka Slovenija d.d. Finland Kuntarahoitus Oyj (Municipality Finance plc)* Oil prices have climbed further after US crude stocks fell last week for the first time since January. Brent crude is now up around 2.4% at $69.14 as the US energy information administration said inventories dropped by 3.9m barrels compared to expectations of a 1.5m increase. But crude is still well down from its highs: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said next week\u2019s eurogroup meeting could serve as a \u201cplatform\u201d for a deal. Hopes of a real breakthrough at Monday\u2019s meeting have pretty much faded but as Varoufakis continued his meetings with EU minister, he held out the hope that it could at least be another step on the road to an agreement. Varoufakis was speaking after a meeting with Italian economy minister Pier Carlo Padoan and said their discussion had given him confidence that an agreement could be reached. He told reporters (quote from Reuters): We had a very fruitful and intense exchange of views on the best ways to make the eurogroup next Monday a platform to enter into the kind of agreement between Greece and our partners which not only resolves the current negotiations but will lead to a period after June that will allow the Greek economy to recover and grow again. Update: EC President Jean-Claude Juncker and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras have just issued a joint statement following their phone call: It shows that they discussed the key points of difference between Greece and her creditors, and agreed that Greece needs a better pay bargaining mechanism. President Juncker and Prime Minister Tsipras spoke on the phone today. They took stock of progress made in the talks between Greece and its partners over the last days on a comprehensive set of reforms to achieve a successful completion of the review. They notably discussed the importance of reforms to modernise the pension system so that it is fair, fiscally sustainable and effective in averting old-age poverty. They also discussed the need for wage developments and labour market institutions to be supportive of job creation, competitiveness and social cohesion. In this context, they concurred on the role of a modern and effective collective bargaining system, which should be developed through broad consultation and meet the highest European standards. Constructive talks should continue within the Brussels Group. Another flurry of newsflashes -- revealing that the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has spoken with the Greek prime minister today: 14:48:23 - EU\u2019S JUNCKER SPOKE BY PHONE TO GREEK PM TSIPRAS, DISCUSSED NEED FOR WAGE AND LABOUR MARKET REFORM-COMMISSION SAYS 14:50:04 - JUNCKER, TSIPRAS DISCUSSED PENSION REFORM TO MAKE IT FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE-COMMISSION Have you wondered how Greece keeps meeting its debt repayments and other bills, despite being on the brink of bankruptcy? Well, the secret is that Athens reverted to the tried and tested route of cutting back on spending, and squeezing as much taxation out as possible. Silvia Merler, analyst at the Bruegel thinktank, has crunched the numbers to shows how Greece appears to be growing its primary budget surplus, creating the cash needed to keep afloat: Peter Spiegel of the FT has just launched a blogpost on it. Here\u2019s a flavour: Not only have tax receipts crept back up to where they\u2019re almost at last year\u2019s levels (and pre-crisis estimates) for the first quarter of the year, but spending has been slashed to where the government has paid out \u20ac1.5bn less than anticipated. That has produced a primary surplus of \u20ac1.7bn, which is \u20ac1.6bn ahead of expectations. And that\u2019s all cash the government can use to keep itself running while it\u2019s trying to hammer out a deal to get the final \u20ac7.2bn remaining it its current bailout. And this chart shows how Greece has spent less than estimated so far this year (the second red box): So is all well? Certainly not. The spending cuts include bills that have simply been deferred, such as on healthcare - doctors have warned that some payments are months behind. But it indicates that Athens could keep running for longer than some had thought. Greece\u2019s cash has arrived safely at the International Monetary Fund: There\u2019s no chance of a big breakthrough at next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance ministers. That\u2019s according to Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, a few minutes ago. He warned that there are still \u201clots of issues to resolve\u201d. He also declined to confirm Greece\u2019s claim of disagreements between the three \u2018Institutions\u201d (IMF, EU and ECB). Newsflashes from Paris... where French finance minister Michel Sapin says the Greek bailout crisis will be resolved, but not soon.... 06-May-2015 13:39:16 - FRANCE\u2019S SAPIN SAYS SURE DEAL CAN BE FOUND ON GREECE 06-May-2015 13:40:01 - SAPIN SAYS DEAL WITH GREECE WILL NOT BE FOUND IN COMING DAYS Germany finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, meanwhile, has warned that Germany and Greece will suffer together without a deal. As I was saying... Greek media are reporting that the bailout negotiations are making progress on some important issues: However, that suggests little progress over two key point - pensions, and labour market reform. Just in.. US companies created fewer new jobs than expected in April, adding to concerns over its economy. The ADP Institute reports that 169,000 new private sector positions were created in April, versus forecasts of around 200,000. March\u2019s ADP was also revised lower to 175,000 from 189,000. That suggests that Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll (the wider measure of the US labour market) could be disappointing. March\u2019s NFP was surprisingly weak, so economists had been hoping for a big bounce-back. Perhaps not.... Greece had been hoping that the European Central Bank might grant Athens permission to issue more short-term debt, but will probably be disappointed today. Currently, Greece is capped from issuing more than \u20ac15bn of short-dated Treasury bills. It has pushed for this to be increased to \u20ac25bn, creating headroom to cover funding demands over the next few months. Bruno Waterfield of The Times has heard that the ECB won\u2019t raise the cap until Greeece and its creditors have a \u201cfirm\u201d deal. Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister has been forced to deny newspaper reports that he transferred an estimated \u20ac80,000 to a bank in Luxembourg in recent months. The story, hotly refuted by the government, has been making waves this morning. Helena Smith explains: Put on the back foot as the government official identified to have transferred a large chunk of money abroad - in an another article carried by Bild this morning - Dimitris Mardas came clean saying he had indeed transferred some \u20ac40,000 abroad to cover university tuition fees for his daughter who is currently studying in Belgium. Mardas, who rather embarrassingly is the finance minister in charge of revenues, however hotly denied that he had made any transactions in the three months since the Syriza-led government assumed power. His \u201couting\u201d sparked vivid debate amongst politicians on Greece\u2019s popular morning TV shows. The former finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis, no less, was also accused of transferring thousands of euros abroad within days of the previous administration being defeated by Syriza. Hardouvelis vehemently rejected accusations that the money had not been taxed. Andreas Loverdos, a former education minister with the socialist Pasok party, told Mega TV this morning that \u201cany politician who has money abroad has to bring it back to set an example for our compatriots and to prove that this money has been taxed.\u201d Government officials are describing today\u2019s report as a \u201cvulgar calumny\u201d of the deputy finance minister, saying Mardas had properly declared his assets in parliament. Reminder: the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has been discussing Greece this morning, at a regular non-monetary policy meeting. The ECB must decide whether to extend more emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks (it probably will), and whether to get tough by imposing a more severe haircut on the assets the banks hand over in return (it probably won\u2019t). So analysts are watching Frankfurt closely.... \u201cConstructive\u201d is the word of the week: Back in London, the British financial trader accused of contributing to a multi-billion dollar stock market crash from his parents\u2019 home, has appeared in court again. Nav Sarao failed to persuade a judge to change his bail conditions, saying he cannot meet the \u00a35m security set last month because his funds have been frozen by US authorities. The Press Association adds: As he was being led away from the dock he turned to the public gallery, held his arms out wide and declared: \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything wrong apart from being good at my job. \u201cHow is this allowed to go on, man?\u201d Yanis Varoufakis continues to make waves \u2013 not least in Greece, where the finance minister is now being seen as a very saleable asset. Helena Smith reports from Athens: As Yanis Varoufakis continues his European tour \u2013 holding talks in Rome today before moving onto Madrid at the end of the week \u2013 diehard supporters here in Athens have devised a new way of expressing their affection for the controversial politician. In Kypseli, the Athenian surburb that is home to prime minister Alexis Tsipras \u2013 shopkeepers trying to make the most of sale time in the country are, literally, cashing in on Varoufakis\u2019 legendary \u201cwow\u201d factor. An athletics store in area this morning was spotted attempting to draw consumers by plastering its fa\u00e7ade with a poster emblazoned with a sketch of the finance minister under the words: \u201cWow prices!!! Until the end of negotiations.\u201d Thanks to Newsit.gr, we have a photo: Few politicians have been as divisive as the vocal anti-austerian. Since his reported sidelining last week \u2013 hotly denied by Varoufakis himself and most of Tsipras\u2019 left-dominated government \u2013 debate over the economist\u2019s role (and qualities) has reached fever pitch. Varoufakis\u2019 90-year-old father felt fit to step into the fray over the weekend, telling Ethnos newspaper: \u201cYanis is talented, that is why they are attacking him. He s decent and tells the truth and will fight until he wins at least something.\u201d Varoufakis senior, a leftist who spent years in exile persecuted by the right, said the Greek prime minister was \u201cvery close\u201d to his son and would never relinquish him. \u201cMy son is a an excellent person. He is honest and what he says, he does. He fights for what he wants to achieve and it was always he who gave the line [defined policy] to the prime minister who, for that reason, loves him a lot. He won\u2019t sell him out.\u201d Tsipras is not the only one to adore his son, according to Varoufakis senior. \u201cEveryone loves him\u201d.... [IMF chief Christine] Lagarde likes him very much along with every woman in Greece and Europe.\u201d Feel free to disagree below the line.... The thinktank, National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has released its latest forecasts for the UK and world economies today, and it is a mixed bag of news for the eurozone. NIESR sees brighter prospects for the region as a whole, but big question marks over Greece\u2019s chances of staying in the the single currency bloc and what an exit might mean for its neighbours. In the UK, NIESR says growth will be slower than it had pencilled in three months ago. The forecast for UK GDP growth has been cut to 2.5% from 2.9%, after official figures showed a much slower start to 2015 than expected. The thinktank\u2019s outlook for the global economy is for growth of 3.2% this year following growth of 3.4% each year in 2012\u201314. It had pencilled in 3.3% growth for 2015 back in February. \u201cGrowth has been slightly weaker than expected so far in 2015 and inflation remains well below target in almost all developed countries,\u201d NIESR comments. On the Euro area, it continues: \u201cProspects in the Euro Area have improved; the ECB\u2019s monetary policy, the euro\u2019s depreciation, and lower oil prices are all expected to support demand and activity in the period ahead, while fiscal policies are expected to be broadly neutral, and the risks of deflation have lessened. \u201cNevertheless, economic conditions remain very weak in much of the area, with unemployment extremely high and expected to decline only slowly. \u201cGreece has undertaken an extraordinary adjustment since the crisis: between 2009 and 2014, the government\u2019s primary fiscal balance was tightened by 11.7 percentage points of GDP. Output collapsed by 25% and unemployment rose to 27.5%; hence, the debt burden rose. Sustainable economic recovery is impossible without further international financial support and further reform of the economy. If an agreement is not reached in the next few weeks, there is a significant risk of a Greek default and a disorderly exit from the monetary union. Greece accounts for only about 2% of euro area GDP, but there would be risks of contagion to the rest of the area and to the euro itself.\u201d At a press briefing to unveil the latest forecasts, Simon Kirby, principal research fellow at NIESR said the thinktank\u2019s central case was that there would not be a Greek exit from the eurozone. But were it to leave, the risks to other countries were by no means negligible. Kirby said: \u201cWhen you look at data from the Bank of International Settlements it is clear that the exposure of most European banking systems is significantly less than it was in 2011, the start of 2012. Dramatically less, in particular for France and Portugal... However, just because the banking sectors of these countries are significantly less exposed... it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there is no contagion effect there. Much of this is very opaque, it relies to a large extent on the sentiment of investors in a number of countries and if the view is taken of those countries that are still by and large classified as peripheral Europe, or crisis economies, or whatever phrase you want to use, there clearly is a risk that there will be a negative spillover to these economies. Now, it\u2019s significantly less than is was at the end of 2011, in 2012, but the risk is there. So the question then becomes: \u2018Why go down the path that actually pushes us into the position where we actually give this risk a chance of materialising?\u2019\u201d Asked if the thinktank was calling for a debt writedown or other relief measures, NIESR\u2019s researchers said one thing that might be considered is extending the maturity of Greece\u2019s debt. NIESR director Jonathan Portes explained: \u201cThe IMF have said very explicitly ... Greece\u2019s debt burden is unsustainable ... so it has to be written off. Now you can write it off... by extending maturities and pretending you are not really writing it down because you are not changing the face value but we all know what\u2019s really happening in economic terms.\u201d He feels the warning from the IMF, reported in Tuesday\u2019s FT, that Greece\u2019s debt mountain has become unsustainable again was overdue. Portes continues: \u201cEven the Commission\u2019s optimistic forecast which was published today [Tuesday, as covered in the live blog here] still shows Greece with a debt burden of about 180% next year. The IMF\u2019s message here is, I think, long overdue... Essentially European policymakers ... either want to force Greece out of the euro and take the risk, which, as Simon says, we really cannot quantify very sensibly .... or they are going to have to recognise economic reality, if they want Greece to stay in the euro, an economic reality that is saying significant write-off in some form or other [will be needed].\u201d Investors still believe there is a high risk that Greece will default on its debts within the next five years: Associated Press has also confirmed that Greece is making its \u20ac200m repayment to the IMF today (as flagged up early this morning). Next week\u2019s bill will be harder, though. AP explains: Greece is making a 200 million euro ($222 million) repayment to the International Monetary Fund, though another, larger one looms next week that it will struggle to manage. A Greek finance ministry official said Wednesday: \u201cThe payment is proceeding normally.\u201d The official spoke only on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations. Greece is struggling to agree on a deal with its creditors to get more rescue loans and is gradually running out of cash. The sides hope to make progress by May 11, when they will hold a eurozone meeting. On May 12, Greece is due to repay \u20ac750m to the IMF, money it will have to scrape together from local reserves, such as those of local governments and hospitals. Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan on the jump in UK service sector growth last month: Back in the City, shares in Sainsbury\u2019s have slid by 3% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after it posted its first loss in a decade. Sarah Butler explains why, here: Here\u2019s that story about new possible taxes on Greek super-rich that we mentioned earlier... Greece\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen, but still remains alarmingly high. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in February 2015 fell to 25.4%, down from 25.6% in January, according to Elstat. A year ago it was 27.2%. The data shows that the number of unemployed people fell by over 15,000 during February. But they didn\u2019t all find work. While the employment total rose by 7,662, the number of \u2018inactive people\u2019 picked up by 3,797. Back to Greece, and a new poll has shown that a majority of German executives now believe the eurozone would be better off without Greece. Mike Bird of Business Insider has the story: According to Germany\u2019s premier business newspaper, Handelsblatt, 44% of the 673 executive-level German managers surveyed think that Greece should leave the eurozone of its own accord. A further 13% think Greece should be actively ejected from the monetary union. 79% believe if Greece left the euro it wouldn\u2019t have contagion effects with other countries, and less than a fifth are concerned about that financial knock-on impact. Fears that Britain\u2019s recovery is faltering have been allayed by the latest survey of UK services firms. Growth across the sector jumped to an an eight-month high in April, according to Markit. Its service sector PMI hit 59.5, up from 58.9 in March, showing faster growth (anything over 50 points shows growth). Service sector firms, from IT companies to hotels, reported that demand rose last month, despite worries about the general election. It suggests that the UK economy could grow by as much as 0.8% in the second quarter of 2015, having growth slipped to just 0.3% in January-March. David Noble, group CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, reckons services firms are performing well: \u201cThe services sector offered a more upbeat level of performance than the other sectors this month and demonstrated a continued assurance in the growth of the UK economy. New business was the primary driver of activity, even amidst increased competition, more marketing activity, the scrabble for good staff and the availability of raw materials.\u201d A pre-election boost to the Conservatives?.... European stock markets have bounced back from yesterday\u2019s selloff. FTSE 100: up 29 points at 6956, + 0.4% German DAX: up 99 points at 11426, +0.9% French CAC: up 25 points at 4999, +0.5% Tony Cross, marrket analyst at Trustnet Direct, sees turbulence ahead, though, given events in Britain and Greece. Until now, there may have been a degree of willingness to look beyond the bigger political issues \u2013 both in terms of the UK election and what\u2019s happening with regard to the Greek debt talks \u2013 but it\u2019s easy to see how this could mark the start of several downbeat sessions as the market attempts to predict how matters will evolve between now and the start of next week. The news that Greece is meeting its \u20ac200m repayment to the IMF is welcome, but it\u2019s only a small hillock in the mountain of debt repayments that Athens faces this summer: This morning\u2019s flurry of data shows that eurozone businesses reported pretty solid growth in April as the region\u2019s recovery continues. Strong growth in Spain, and a pick-up in Italy, made up for France\u2019s ongoing weakness, according to data provider Markit. Markit\u2019s Composite Output Index came in at 53.9 in April, little-changed from 54.0 in March, showing steady growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says: \u201cThe survey is signalling a rate of economic growth of approximately 0.4% at the start of the second quarter, similar to that indicated by the PMI in the first quarter. \u201cThe fact that the rate of growth failed to gain further momentum is a disappointment, but the national growth variations will give policymakers some real encouragement that the economic health of the region is improving.\u201d Not in Greece, though - data on Monday showed that its manufacturing sector continues to contract. Growth across Germany\u2019s service sector also slowed... with its PMI coming in at 54.0, down from 55.4 in March. That\u2019s also weaker than the \u2018flash estimate\u2019 of 54.4 published two weeks ago; suggesting growth slowed in late April. Disappointing news from France, though - growth across its private sector has slowed. The French service sector PMI fell to 51.4 last month, from 52.4 in March. And with its manufacturing shrinking, the overall French Composite PMI fell back to 50.6. More good news for the eurozone -- Italy\u2019s service sector has reported its fastest growth in 10 months. The Italian service sector PMI jumped to 53.1 last month, up from 51.6 -- on a scale where any reading over 50 shows growth. Back in the bond markets, Britain\u2019s headline borrowing costs have hit their highest level of 2015. The deficit just got a little more expensive to service.... Here comes the first Purchasing Managers Index report from the eurozone....and it\u2019s good news for Spain. The Spanish service sector PMI has surged to 60.3 last month, up from 57.3 in March, a really strong reading that shows growth is accelerating. Activity, new business and employment are all increasing at rates not seen since prior to the economic crisis, as Spain\u2019s recovery continues. A major readjustment appears to be underway in the bond market. Prices of eurozone sovereign debt are falling this morning, pushing up yields, continuing a trend that began late last month: Traders aren\u2019t certain exactly what\u2019s caused it. Greek worries are one factor, but another theory is that investors have realised that they should perhaps demand a little more interest in return for lending to governments. Even after recent losses, Italy\u2019s 10-year bond is yielding just under 1.9% -- which feels a more \u2018normal\u2019 level than the 1.1% reached in March. Of course, anyone who bought the bonds recently is nursing losses..... Jens Nordvig of Nomura warns that these \u2018big moves\u2019 could have serious implications, and makes three important points: How is credit going to cope with this type of weakness in rates space? How will fixed income flows from the Eurozone (a key driver of many moves over the last 6-9 months) be impacted? Could risk aversion support the Euro? (if the Euro is the new yen, it will). Interesting times ahead... Curious.....Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper claims that Athens is planning a special tax on the country\u2019s 500 richest families. Bild says the measure is included on the Greek finance ministry\u2019s list of reforms, whcih also includes a luxury tax on items such as expensive cars and trips to Greek islands, and higher taxes on workers earning over \u20ac30,000 per year. It\u2019s not clear what levy Athens is thinking of imposing on its wealthiest families. On assets, or income? And what about those who keep their funds offshore? (locked up in Zurich, for example...) If true (and we\u2019re on the case now.....), it\u2019s the latest in a series of innovative measures from the Greek government. Yesterday, we learned that Greece was considering a surcharge on cash withdrawals as a way of raising revenue (and deterring a bank run). One down, lots more to go.... A Greek official has confirmed to Reuters that the \u20ac200m interest payment is winging its way to the International Monetary Fund. \u201cIt\u2019s done, the money is on its way,\u201d the official said, on condition of anonymity. Cash-strapped Athens is quickly running out of money while it tries to persuade euro zone partners and the IMF to extend further aid. The payment on Wednesday was not expected to be a problem for the country, but a \u20ac750m payment to the IMF that falls due on May 12 is expected to be a bigger struggle. Newsflash from Athens: Greek officials have just announced that they\u2019ve met the \u20ac200m repayment to the IMF due today - lifting the immediate threat of a default. Via Reuters: GREECE MAKES 200 MLN EURO REPAYMENT TO IMF - GREEK OFFICIAL Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With relations with its lenders deteriorating, Greece must pull together \u20ac200m to meet an repayment to the International Monetary Fund today. It\u2019s a fitting way to mark the fifth anniversary since Greek MP voted to accept deep austerity cuts in return for the country\u2019s first bailout programme. Insiders say Athens has got the cash, but the payment will intensify the remorseless squeeze on its finances as it struggles to get a deal with its creditors over pensions, labour reforms and the minimum wage. As we reported last night, Greece officials are now blaming \u201cserious disagreements and contradictions\u201d between the IMF and the European Union for the continued failure to agreed a package of economic reforms that all sides are happy with. Greek health minister, Panagiotis Kouroumblis, told my colleague Helena Smith that Greece\u2019s creditors are making impossible demands on Athens: \u201cThey are not only implacable, the feeling that they give us is that they are impossible to satisfy.\u201d \u201cThey ask for 10 things to be done and then come back the next day and ask for another 10 more. As much as we would like, that\u2019s not going to lead to compromise.\u201d But if someone doesn\u2019t compromise soon, Greece risks running out of funds altogether with another \u20ac800m due to the IMF later this month. The third of Greece\u2019s creditors, the European Central Bank, will decide today whether to keep supplying emergency liquidity assistance to its banking sector. Analysts expect that the ECB will offer a little more help, to allow banks to keep operating despite the drip-drip-drip of deposit withdrawals as savers hoard cash. Looks like we\u2019re rattling towards another showdown on May 11, when eurozone finance minister meet again to assess the situation. The Greek crisis is expected to weigh on sentiment in the markets today, after helping to trigger a chunky selloff yesterday. Investors will also be watching the latest PMI surveys from Markit this morning, which will show whether the eurozone private sector kept growing last month. And in the City, Sainsbury\u2019s has reported its first loss in a decade. The supermarket chain made a pre-tax loss of \u00a372m, dragged down by \u00a3628m of one-off charges. Sainsbury have a conference call shortly, so we\u2019ll catch up on them later, along with other developments through the day.....",

The forecast for UK GDP growth has been cut to 2.5% from 2.9%, after official figures showed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/28/uk-economic-growth-slows-ahead-of-general-election\">much slower start to 2015 than expected</a>.</p> <p>The thinktank\u2019s outlook for the global economy is for growth of 3.2% this year following growth of 3.4% each year in 2012\u201314.

Output collapsed by 25% and unemployment rose to 27.5%; hence, the debt burden rose. Sustainable economic recovery is impossible without further international financial support and further reform of the economy.<strong> If an agreement is not reached in the next few weeks, there is a significant risk of a Greek default and a disorderly exit from the monetary union.</strong> Greece accounts for only about 2% of euro area GDP, but there would be risks of contagion to the rest of the area and to the euro itself.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>At a press briefing to unveil the latest forecasts, <strong>Simon Kirby</strong>, principal research fellow at NIESR said the thinktank\u2019s central case was that there would not be a Greek exit from the eurozone. But were it to leave, the risks to other countries were by no means negligible. Kirby said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWhen you look at data from the Bank of International Settlements it is clear that the exposure of most European banking systems is significantly less than it was in 2011, the start of 2012. Dramatically less, in particular for France and Portugal... However, just because the banking sectors of these countries are significantly less exposed... it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there is no contagion effect there. Much of this is very opaque, it relies to a large extent on the sentiment of investors in a number of countries and if the view is taken of those countries that are still by and large classified as peripheral Europe, or crisis economies, or whatever phrase you want to use, there clearly is a risk that there will be a negative spillover to these economies. Now, it\u2019s significantly less than is was at the end of 2011, in 2012, but the risk is there. So the question then becomes: \u2018Why go down the path that actually pushes us into the position where we actually give this risk a chance of materialising?\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if the thinktank was calling for a debt writedown or other relief measures, NIESR\u2019s researchers said one thing that might be considered is extending the maturity of Greece\u2019s debt.</p> <p>NIESR director<strong> Jonathan Portes </strong>explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe IMF have said very explicitly ... Greece\u2019s debt burden is unsustainable ... so it has to be written off.

      "bodyText": "Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, has highlighted the risks of ultra-low interest rates for financial stability, warning investors that share valuations are \u201cquite high\u201d. At a seminar in Washington, Yellen was asked by International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Christine Lagarde about fears that near-zero borrowing costs distort markets and create bubbles. The Fed chair said that while risks to financial stability in general were \u201cnot elevated\u201d, she did have some specific concerns, including the fact that share prices have been unusually buoyant. \u201cThere are potential dangers there,\u201d she said, in remarks reminiscent of her predecessor Alan Greenspan\u2019s infamous 1996 warning that some investors were showing, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. Yellen added that interest rates look artificially low, as investors \u201creach for yield\u201d, or buying up risky bonds and pushing down the yields, which move in the opposite direction. She said there could be a \u201cjump\u201d in long-term rates when the Fed decides to start tightening policy. US borrowing costs have been set at zero to 0.25% since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Yellen and her colleagues are expected to start raising interest rates later in 2015, if the US economy continues to improve. When the Fed started to phase out, or \u201ctaper\u201d its massive quantitative easing scheme in spring 2013, world markets were rocked by what became known as the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d, with several emerging market currencies plunging, and interest rates on some bonds shooting upwards. Lagarde used her own remarks to the Institute of New Economic Thinking seminar on markets and ethics to call for a renewed crackdown on bankers\u2019 bonuses, to tackle the \u201cdistorted\u201d incentives that led to the global financial crisis. Lagarde said despite a battery of regulatory reforms, \u201cfinancial stability is still not well-entrenched\u201d, more than seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. US, UK and EU regulators have all urged banks to exercise pay restraint since the crisis. A series of rules have been introduced, including the EU\u2019s contentious cap on bonuses, which restricts the payouts to 200% of base pay, even with shareholder approval. But Lagarde insisted there was more to be done. \u201cIncentives related to compensation practices need to change, so that rewards are no longer so much tied to myopic actions and excessive risk-taking,\u201dshe said. Lagarde added that the IMF\u2019s research suggests bonuses should be tied to longer-term, rather than short-term gains; and that banks should use \u201cclawback\u201d, to force staff who have hit their firm\u2019s performance to pay back part of their bonuses.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has reported its first annual loss in a decade after being forced to cut prices and write down the value of its stores and property assets. The company fell \u00a372m into the red in the year to 14 March, before tax, after \u00a3628m of impairment and onerous contract charges relating to sites where it no longer plans to build supermarkets. Total sales declined by 0.7%, excluding fuel, to \u00a323.8bn. The group admitted that sales at its main stores had fallen by over 2% over the year, offset by a rise of more than 16% at its convenience stores, to \u00a32.1bn. Online sales rose over 7% to \u00a31.1bn and sales of non-food including clothing rose 9%. Mike Coupe, chief executive, said: \u201cThe UK marketplace is changing faster than at any time in the past 30 years which has impacted our profits, like-for-like sales and market share. However, we are making good progress with our strategy, and our investment in price and quality is showing encouraging early signs of volume and transaction growth.\u201d Coupe said that Sainsbury\u2019s had increased the volume of items it was selling and attracted new shoppers after spending \u00a350m on cutting prices in the second half of its financial year. Volumes rose an average 6% on the 1,100 items where prices were cut. Coupe said shoppers now had an average \u00a316 a week more to spend and were buying more products even where Sainsbury\u2019s had not cut prices. Sainsbury\u2019s has pledged to spend \u00a3150m more on price cuts over its current financial year, taking its total investment to \u00a3200m, \u00a350m more than previously pledged. But the company said that up-lifts in volume were completely off-setting the additional cost to the business. Coupe insisted the company had the financial capacity to match any moves by its rivals \u201ctoe-to-toe\u201d.. Some analysts believe the retailer is vulnerable to a revival at Tesco which has been cutting prices and improving service under new chief executive Dave Lewis. Coupe said that grocery industry price deflation was likely to continue throughout this year and possibly into next, but suggested widespread price cuts by all the major supermarkets were beginning to impact discount chains, such as Aldi and Lidl. Like all its major competitors, Sainsbury\u2019s has been suffering from the rise of the low-price German chains, falling food commodity prices and shoppers\u2019 ongoing caution about spending. \u201cWe are beginning to see some uptick of volume in the market and that is undoubtedly good for the whole market, not just ourselves. But it is a little early to call the turn at this moment in time. I\u2019m not going to get carried away. Being overly optimistic is the wrong thing to do,\u201d Coupe said. \u201cThe market will remain extremely challenging for the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s has already axed jobs at its head office and stores in a bid to save \u00a3500m in order to invest more in price and quality of its products. The retailer has also reined in capital spending from \u00a3947m last year to no more than \u00a3550m in the year ahead as it slows the pace of new store openings. The company has also slashed its full year dividend by almost a quarter, to 13.2p a share. Its decision to pull out of building 40 planned stores, as well as poorer trading in 40 of its existing stores, led to the massive property write down that pushed Sainsbury\u2019s into the red. It also spent \u00a353m on transition costs in relation to Sainsbury\u2019s Bank after taking full ownership of its joint venture with Lloyds Banking Group. The company admitted that \u201ctransition costs\u201d at the bank would rise to between \u00a380m and \u00a3120m, more than expected. Excluding one-off charges, Sainsbury\u2019s delivered pre-tax profits of \u00a3681m, nearly 15% down on a year before but well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations of about \u00a3660m. However its shares fell 2.6% to 267.9p, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. \u201cThe underlying profitability of the business is remarkably robust in an extremely challenging environment,\u201d Coupe told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. Last week it emerged that had Coupe has been sentenced to two years in jail in Egypt for embezzlement. The company is appealing against the legal action which relates to the supermarket\u2019s attempt to open stores in the country in 1999. An appeal hearing is expected within the next fortnight. Coupe, who was forced to fly to Egypt last month as part of the appeal process, insisted that it was business as usual as Sainsbury\u2019s legal team handled the process. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t affected the day job,\u201d he said.",

Markets are likely to suffer the sharpest reaction to the announcement of an EU referendum. We expect the uncertainty and slower economic growth associated with such an announcement to result in a marked drop in UK equities, centred around concerns over the financial sector and other eurozone exporters. The Tory-Lib Dem majority scenario associated with this outcome would also likely pursue an ongoing tight fiscal stance which would likely add pressure on healthcare and support services sectors. </p> </blockquote> <p>Page also sees big moves for the pound and UK government bonds on the back of an EU referendum being announced. He expects a \u201csharp decline in sterling\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> This would reflect both the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future international role and a softer interest rate outlook (in turn reflecting softer GDP growth). A softer monetary policy outlook would also likely dominate the outlook for gilts.

He comments:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A Labour-led government will mean trouble for banks, utilities, property developers, betting companies and outsourcing companies. What is more, if the SNP get enough seats to enable them to pull the strings, then there is the further risk of an unstable government and possibly another Scottish referendum. A lack of adequate polling data in the UK means that it is not possible to rule out such an outcome at this stage, so caution on UK stocks \u2013 and sterling-denominated assets more generally \u2013 is warranted.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>But any turbulence in stock markets caused by political anxiety could be short-term, says Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown. <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Around two-thirds to three quarters of FTSE 100 revenues are estimated to come from overseas.

Stocks would probably sell off too.</p> <p>Commenting on the prospect of a Brexit referendum, Kathleen Brooks at trading platform <strong>FOREX.com</strong> says:</p> <p>\u201cThis could be the biggest concern for the foreign exchange market in the aftermath of the election. Since a referendum is unlikely to be scheduled for a few years, it could lead to a protracted period of weakness for sterling.</p> <p>Our concerns for the pound that may arise from the uncertainty around the UK\u2019s EU membership are:</p> <ol> <li>Its large UK current account leaves it vulnerable to a shift in international sentiment towards the pound and UK debt. Right now the international market is happy to fund the UK\u2019s deficit, but this may not be the case if it looks like it is going to leave the EU.<br></li> <li>The FTSE 100 is also a major hub for international companies to list. Part of the UK\u2019s attractiveness is its proximity to Europe and membership of the EU. If it leaves the EU this could reduce the desire of foreign firms to list in the UK and others could try and move to a different index, which could weigh on UK stock markets.\u201d<br></li> </ol> <p>Steven Bell, chief economist at <strong>F&amp;C Investments </strong>points out that with a majority for either main party, there would be an impact on the likely path for interest rates. A strong single-party government would be more likely to continue to tighten fiscal policy at a solid pace, reducing the likely need for tighter monetary policy, or in other words, higher interest rates. Bell comments: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A strong government, be it Labour- or Conservative-led would probably tighten fiscal policy by around 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first two years of the new parliament. This would give the members of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considerable pause for thought. Take that away and the chances of an early base rate rise increase. The market is just beginning to appreciate this risk.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Labour majority</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c2857c27b20b5c0e27b65670c35a69c11444c06\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430837804853/c71620bd-d61f-4ee1-8928-89f72b393254-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Under an outright victory for Ed Miliband's party, shares in banking, bookmaking and energy firms could come under pressure, analysts say.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under an outright victory for Ed Miliband\u2019s party, shares in banking, bookmaking and energy firms could come under pressure, analysts say.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian./Christopher Thomond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Labour majority government is seen as more likely to intervene in business and also expected to cut the deficit at a slower pace than the Conservatives.</p> <p>Few analysts and polling experts see any chance of a Labour majority on Friday.

While George Osborne has warned of \u201cfall out\u201d Friday if Labour wins, the overriding feeling among traders appears to be that \u201cgridlock is good\u201d \u2013 in other words, if Britain wakes up to no strong majority for any party , there will be no big policy changes to fear. There are a host of potential scenarios, from a Conservative-led government that paves the way to a referendum on EU membership to a Labour government that freezes energy prices. In the meantime, the market backdrop is relatively buoyant. The FTSE 100 is close to its all-time high and yields on government bonds are stable \u2013 in March foreign buyers bought around \u00a328bn of gilts, the highest on record. The pound has been more affected by pre-election jitters but some of its weakness against the euro and dollar is just as much down to signs that economic growth has lost steam in recent months. When the first exit polls are published at 10pm on 7 May, the UK stock market will be long closed and traders of US stocks will have gone home. But the currency markets \u2013 where \u00a33.5tn changes hands every day \u2013 never really close. Trading bounces through Asian time zones before resuming full swing in the early hours in London. The UK stock market opens at 8am. Reaction may not be instant, or so history suggests: The stock market crash of 1987 happened on Margaret Thatcher\u2019s watch, the low under the Labour government for the FTSE 100 (3,287) was when Tony Blair was prime minister in 2003 while the high in the leading index \u2013 recorded last week \u2013 took place while the current prime minister, David Cameron, was out on the campaign trail. Here we analyse the political scenarios and their likely potential impact on the UK economy and financial markets. No overall control With polls tight, and minority parties on the rise, forming a new government is expected to take longer than the five days of talks back in 2010. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: \u201cThe result is the non event. It is the horse-trading that will matter.\u201d The economic and market impact of such political limbo, would depend on how long the horse-trading takes, experts say. The pound will be key a indicator. Pound back at 2010 level Andrew McHattie, an investment adviser at The McHattie Group said: It is quite likely that any dip in confidence from either a political vacuum or an undesirable alliance of political parties could lead to capital outflows and a fall in the value of the pound ... It may be the case that the more uncertainty that arises over the result, and the more horse-trading is required to form a government, the more the pound will weaken. But when a government is formed, it is probably not a simple case of \u2018buy a Conservative win; sell a Labour victory\u2019 as far as the pound is concerned. There is a question of confidence in the future management of the economy that certainly favours a \u2018better the devil you know\u2019 approach \u2013 and on that basis a new Labour administration might cause some investors to be spooked. Muddying the waters here though is the potential for an EU referendum.\u201d But the stock markets are unlikely to be affected so much \u2013 at least not in the longer-term, explains Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. We could see some turbulence in the stock market in the next few weeks, particularly in the aftermath of the election if there is a hung parliament. However, the political machinations in Westminster have little bearing on the earnings potential of UK companies, which ultimately drives stock prices in the long term.\u201d Minority government Under this scenario, policies would have to be decided in votes on a case-by-case basis. There are obvious reasons why financial markets would not like this outcome, say economists at Morgan Stanley. Such a government would probably bring additional uncertainty for businesses and investors, who will wonder how such a government will work in practice, and how long it will last. Such a government may struggle to find sufficient support for taking tough decisions, including continuing with or stepping up fiscal austerity.\u201d But the thinktank Capital Economics is more upbeat: We do not think that a minority or coalition government would be bad for the economy per se ... The UK\u2019s strong economic fundamentals should ensure it fares well under all but the most divisive governments. That said, bond yields and the pound could move sharply as the next government is formed and the outlook for gilt issuance and official interest rates is clarified.\u201d Little election impact in the past Economists at Citi say there is good reason markets appear relaxed about political uncertainty in the UK. Tina Fordham and Michael Saunders at Citi comment in an election preview note: There is less to fear from a minority government than in the past: given limited fiscal policy divergence between the main parties, our economic forecasts are unlikely to change ... Markets may be pricing in the risk of comparatively weaker UK governments the way that Wall Street looks at the US instance of divided government, assuming \u201cgridlock is good\u201d: the notion that constrained governments are less likely to do much of anything, including pass legislation perceived as anti-business.\u201d Conservative-led coalition Instant reaction could come if one party does end up with a majority. A government led by the Conservative party would be expected to stick to its pledge to hold an in-out referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union. James Dowey, chief economist at Neptune Investment Management comments: The continuation of a Conservative-led government would open the door to Brexit risk, which would likely negatively impact certain UK assets further down the road.\u201d Economists have highlighted financial services and the automotive industry as two sectors that stand to lose out particularly badly in the event of a Brexit. Fears over lost trade after Brexit David Page at AXA Invesment Managers views the prospect of a Brexit referendum as having the biggest impact on financial markets after the election, with pressure on certain stocks. He comments: We expect markets to respond very differently to different electoral outcomes. Markets are likely to suffer the sharpest reaction to the announcement of an EU referendum. We expect the uncertainty and slower economic growth associated with such an announcement to result in a marked drop in UK equities, centred around concerns over the financial sector and other eurozone exporters. The Tory-Lib Dem majority scenario associated with this outcome would also likely pursue an ongoing tight fiscal stance which would likely add pressure on healthcare and support services sectors. Page also sees big moves for the pound and UK government bonds on the back of an EU referendum being announced. He expects a \u201csharp decline in sterling\u201d. This would reflect both the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future international role and a softer interest rate outlook (in turn reflecting softer GDP growth). A softer monetary policy outlook would also likely dominate the outlook for gilts. We consider it likely that gilt yields would fall in this scenario \u2013 although concede this may follow an initial, reflexive rise as some gilt holders fear a sell-off in international gilt holdings.\u201d Labour-led coalition A strong Labour government would be expected to intervene in sectors such as banking, property, bookmaking and energy. Dowey at Neptune Investment Management is also concerned about the prospect of a new referendum on Scottish independence if the Scottish National party end up with a strong showing. He comments: A Labour-led government will mean trouble for banks, utilities, property developers, betting companies and outsourcing companies. What is more, if the SNP get enough seats to enable them to pull the strings, then there is the further risk of an unstable government and possibly another Scottish referendum. A lack of adequate polling data in the UK means that it is not possible to rule out such an outcome at this stage, so caution on UK stocks \u2013 and sterling-denominated assets more generally \u2013 is warranted.\u201d But any turbulence in stock markets caused by political anxiety could be short-term, says Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown. Around two-thirds to three quarters of FTSE 100 revenues are estimated to come from overseas. For a global FTSE 100 company like BHP Billiton, the UK election is a rather parochial event.\u201d Even Labour\u2019s pledge to freeze energy prices might not have an impact on the overall stock market. The main two UK companies to be affected by this would be Centrica and SSE, who together make up less than 1.5% of the FTSE All Share,\u201d said Khalaf. Deficit plans and the pound Page at AXA Investment Managers says there are important implications for the pound and government bonds from the fiscal relaxation associated with Labour-led majorities. Looser fiscal policy would imply tighter monetary policy. Page comments: We expect relatively tighter monetary policy to drive bond yields higher, although would envisage some of the yield increase to reflect a perceived rise in credit risk, particularly under the greater expected public spending in the SNP scenario. Sterling would likely gain in the short run, both reflecting referendum-relief and the rising rate outlook. Faster GDP growth would also likely underpin domestic equities, although rising yields and sterling would neutralise much of this boost.\u201d Conservative majority This scenario would have the biggest impact on financial markets, for the simple reason that David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership. If Britain wakes up to a Conservative majority on Friday, the prospect of a referendum moves from risk to reality and analysts say the pound will come under immediate pressure. Stocks would probably sell off too. Commenting on the prospect of a Brexit referendum, Kathleen Brooks at trading platform FOREX.com says: \u201cThis could be the biggest concern for the foreign exchange market in the aftermath of the election. Since a referendum is unlikely to be scheduled for a few years, it could lead to a protracted period of weakness for sterling. Our concerns for the pound that may arise from the uncertainty around the UK\u2019s EU membership are: Its large UK current account leaves it vulnerable to a shift in international sentiment towards the pound and UK debt. Right now the international market is happy to fund the UK\u2019s deficit, but this may not be the case if it looks like it is going to leave the EU. The FTSE 100 is also a major hub for international companies to list. Part of the UK\u2019s attractiveness is its proximity to Europe and membership of the EU. If it leaves the EU this could reduce the desire of foreign firms to list in the UK and others could try and move to a different index, which could weigh on UK stock markets.\u201d Steven Bell, chief economist at F&amp;C Investments points out that with a majority for either main party, there would be an impact on the likely path for interest rates. A strong single-party government would be more likely to continue to tighten fiscal policy at a solid pace, reducing the likely need for tighter monetary policy, or in other words, higher interest rates. Bell comments: A strong government, be it Labour- or Conservative-led would probably tighten fiscal policy by around 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first two years of the new parliament. This would give the members of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considerable pause for thought. Take that away and the chances of an early base rate rise increase. The market is just beginning to appreciate this risk.\u201d Labour majority A Labour majority government is seen as more likely to intervene in business and also expected to cut the deficit at a slower pace than the Conservatives. Few analysts and polling experts see any chance of a Labour majority on Friday. But were this to happen, shares in the banking, energy and bookmaking sectors may come under pressure. Sterling is harder to call. There could be a relief rally for the pound given the prospect of an EU referendum evaporates. On the other hand, the prospect of slower deficit reduction may undermine confidence in the UK economy and therefore in sterling.",
