Instead, chief executive David Atkins &amp; co breezed on as if nothing had happened. Hammerson is a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d and \u201cdynamic\u201d property company, apparently, and is now adopting a \u201cdecisive\u201d strategy of flogging all its out-of-town retail parks. The flattering self-assessment overlooks a few points about the new approach. First, it would have been better to flee from retail parks several years ago, before the likes of Toys R Us and Maplin went bust. Second, liquidating assets worth \u00a31.1bn by the end of next year cannot be described as a game-changer for a group with a property portfolio worth \u00a310.6bn. Third, the other half of the new strategy isn\u2019t really new. Shrinking the presence of department stores within the shopping centres by 25% sounds like a case of following retailing trends that are happening anyway. Meanwhile, a planned extension to the Brent Cross centre in north London is being put on hold, which is presumably an example of the board sitting decisively on its hands, or being encouraged to do so by development partner Aberdeen Standard Investments. The supposed prize for shareholders is the release of \u00a3300m to be spent buying back shares that currently trade at 529p. That is clearly a good use of cash if you believe the assets are worth 776p a share, which is the official valuation. The trouble is, outsiders\u2019 faith in Hammerson\u2019s ability to close the gap quickly is not high. Despite Hammerson\u2019s protestations about its powers to create \u201cexperience led destinations\u201d, investors just worry that the next round or rental renewals will arrive at lower levels in the current soggy retail market. Kl\u00e9pierre of France is free to return with another takeover offer once the six-month cooling-off period expires in September. Hammerson\u2019s board rebuffed the last approach at 635p a share and made itself doubly unpopular with some shareholders. One fancies Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s chances if were to come back at, say, 650p. Loyal investors are thin on the ground at Hammerson. How to make a (Superdry) clean break Some founders hang around, never fully letting go of their creations. Others make a clean break and head for the hills. Julian Dunkerton of Superdry is in the latter camp. He announced his plan to quit in March, actually did so a few days later, and has now sold a quarter of his shareholding for \u00a371m. Dunkerton got \u00a312.85 a share, or 6% below Monday\u2019s closing price, or 17% less than the price on the day he left. Is that a judgment on Superdry\u2019s valuation? It\u2019s impossible to say since Dunkerton is not obliged to say a thing. It could be simple portfolio diversification. Or maybe he wants to invest in his other ventures, including a cider business and a Cotswold-based chain of hotels and pubs. Whatever the explanation, the market should not be taken by surprise again. Dunkerton\u2019s lock-up agreement lasts only 90 days, meaning he is free to sell any portion of his remaining 18.5% stake any time from late October. He could do nothing, of course, but his pursuit of a clean break is clear enough. It\u2019s also admirable in a way: he\u2019s not the main player any more, a point other founders too often fail to admit. Just the tonic for Aim See, investment miracles do happen on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim), the often-derided junior stock market. Tonic firm Fever-Tree is now worth \u00a34.5bn.

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have closed higher tonight, swept up by Google\u2019s strong performance and optimism over China. Mining stocks led the rally in London, on hopes that Beijing\u2019s new stimulus package will protect China\u2019s economy from a crash. BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore all surged over 5% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard, as commodity prices were lifted. Tech stocks also gained ground in Europe, as traders watched the Nasdaq hit today\u2019s record high. Here\u2019s the closing prices: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100: Up 53 points or 0.7% at 7709 German DAX: Up 120 points or 1.1% at 12,689 French CAC: Up 55 points or 1% at 5,434 Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says China\u2019s new stimulus package has calmed some anxiety over the trade dispute with America, boostings sentiment across the globe. A package of tax cuts, research spending, special bonds, infrastructure spending and a pledge to use tax policy to stimulate growth shows that the authorities in China are concerned over the impact that the developing trade war will have on growth and are taking measures to counteract a weakening economy. Traders are also hopeful about the Q2 earnings season, which is getting into full swing; Earning season is off to a strong start, of the 21% of S&amp;P firms that have reported, 80.6% has beaten expectations for Q2 earnings, whilst 74% have surpassed expectations on earnings. These are the fundamental figures which are going to keep the equity rally alive given they offer the perfect distraction to trade war headlines. Until those trade war headlines are reflected in the data, these strong fundamentals will keep the bulls in charge. Over in New York, the Nasdaq remains at record levels. It\u2019s up 45 points at 7412. Alphabet is the second-top riser, up 4%, behind biotechnology company Biogen whcih also smashed profit forecasts today. PayPal (+2.1%) and Facebook (+1.3) are also among the top risers. That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash from Lancashire: Shale gas firm Cuadrilla has been given the green light by government to start fracking at a well between Blackpool and Preston. This is the first permit granted under the government\u2019s new regulatory regime, and comes despite protests from local residents and anti-fracking campaigners. Energy minister Claire Perry said shale gas was an important potential new energy source, and she was satisfied Cuadrilla had met the government\u2019s conditions for granting a hydraulic fracturing permit. \u201cOur world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities.\u201d Some in the local community, though, fear that injecting liquid at high pressures into the rock to split it and release hydrocarbons could cause earthquakes and pollute the water supply. The IMF\u2019s cure for the global economy\u2019s imbalances includes cutting pensions in countries who are borrowing too much. On the other wide of the coin, it wants saver countries to keep older citizens in the jobs market for longer. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy is being destabilised by current account imbalances. In a new report, the IMF flags up that some countries are simply saving too much (such as Germany), while others are running persistent deficits (Britain and America). And over time, this is creating dangerous instability. The Fun warns: From a global perspective, excess surpluses have been especially large and persistent in a small group of countries, most prominently in Germany and China, and to a lesser extent, in Korea, Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore Excess deficits remain mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, some euro area debtor countries, and a few vulnerable emerging market and developing economies (e.g. Argentina, Turkey). Donald Trump would surely agree, having made \u2018fair trade\u2019 a key plank of his administration. But the IMF aren\u2019t endorsing the White House\u2019s trade war. Instead, it warns that protectionist measures will back fire. Chief economist Maurice Obstfeld says: The persistence of global imbalances and mounting perceptions of an uneven playing field for trade are fueling protectionist sentiment. These impulses are misguided. An escalation of protectionist policies would mainly hurt domestic and global growth, without much of an effect on current account imbalances, as this year\u2019s report also finds. The Fund also warns that Trump\u2019s tax cuts could make the things worse: The fiscal easing currently underway in the United States is leading to a tightening in monetary conditions, a stronger US dollar, and a larger US current account deficit. In the near term, these trends risk aggravating trade tensions, and the resulting faster tightening of global financing conditions, which could prove even more disruptive for emerging market economies, especially those with weak external positions Most of the famous FAANG stocks are bursting ahead today. Google/Alphabet is leading the way (+4%), followed by Facebook (+2%), Amazon (+1.7%) and Apple (+0.9%). Investors are wagering that Alphabet\u2019s strong results bode well for the current results season (Facebook reports tomorrow, followed by Amazon on Thursday and Apple early next week). Netflix, which missed Wall Street forecasts last week, is lagging behind though. Breaking: The Nasdaq stock index has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading in New York. Tech giant Alphabet is driving the rally, up 4%, after smashing Wall Street forecasts last night. This helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index up 70 points, or, 0.9%, to 7,912 in early trading. Traders are cheered by the strong earnings from its Google operations (see opening post), which delivered earnings per share of $11.75, compared to forecasts of $9.59 per share. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.75%, while the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average is 0.6% higher. Investors in Europe are also putting their worries about trade wars behind them, pushing shares up in London, Frankfurt and Paris: Traders are also cheering China\u2019s new stimulus measures. Beijing\u2019s plan to cut R&amp;D taxes and spur local investment is bolstering optimism in the markets. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: European stock markets are higher in the wake of Beijing\u2019s plans to stimulate the economy. The Chinese government unveiled plans to boost domestic demand in the face of heightened trade tensions. The second-largest economy in the world has been slowing down in recent years, and the tariffs imposed by the US are making matters worse. The proactive move by the Chinese authorities has lifted investor confidence around the global. Bitcoin is also on a tear this morning, as cryptocurrencies rally sharply. The Bitcoin price has jumped by 6% this morning to $8,175 on the Luxembourg Bitstamp exchange, extending its recent rally. The digital currency has now surged by a third in the last 10 days, having fallen sharply from around $20,000 at the start of the year. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, suggests that the Bitcoin bulls have been lured out of hibernation, and could push bitcoin towards $10,000 An inflow of positive news over the past few weeks regarding cryptocurrencies has revived investor appetite for Bitcoin and this can be reflected in the bullish price action. Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have expressed interest in the cryptocurrency markets while the Financial Services Board declared that they do not pose a threat to the global financial system. With this renewed sense of optimism over cryptocurrencies attracting investors from all directions, further upside could be on the cards in the near term. Alphabet shares are expected to jump around 4% when Wall Street trading begin in 45 minutes, after the tech giant beat revenue and earnings targets last night. In the old days, world leaders would prepare for a visiting politician by getting the red carpet swept, and perhaps organising a banquet. Times change, though (and not always for the better). So president Trump has limbered up for his meeting with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker tomorrow with another blast about trade. Tomorrow\u2019s meeting between Juncker and Trump could be heated. The EC would like to dial down the trade tensions with the US, which has already threatened to impose tariffs on European car imports. But Juncker may struggle to persuade his host that tariffs are counter-productive, and will hurt US consumers and cost jobs. The two sides have already fired shots in the trade wars; America hit Europe with 25% tariffs on steel imports, prompting new levies on US goods such as jeans and orange juice. But despite all the noise, the two sides actually have fairly low trade barriers. As Chris Giles wrote in the Financial Times today: Even though some trade is deterred by specific high tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic, the average weighted tariffs applied by the EU on US goods were 3 per cent in 2015, a little lower than the US equivalent of 3.3 per cent in the same year. City economist Timothy Ash thinks the Turkish central bank blundered today by not hiking interest rates: Yikes! The Turkish lira is tumbling after the country\u2019s central bank surprisingly left interest rates on hold. The financial markets had widely expected a rate hike today, of at least one percentage point. Instead, the Turkish central bank left borrowing costs unchanged at 17.75%, despite concerns over high inflation and the weak currency. The move dealt the lira another blow, wiping 3% off its value against the US dollar. The decision will fuel concerns that president Erdogan is undermining central bank independence, as he pushes for lower interest rates. He has just promoted his son-in-law to a top role overseeing the Turkish economy. London\u2019s taxi drivers have been pushing back against ride-hail app Uber for years, holding protests and demanding for tighter regulation. But now, they are taking their fight to a higher level - considering suing Uber for more than a billion pounds of lost earnings. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has the details: London\u2019s army of black cab drivers are drawing up a stunning plot to sue Uber for more than \u00a31bn weeks after the ride-hailing app won a 15-month extension to its licence to operate in the capital. Sky News has learnt that the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association (LTDA), which has 11,000 members in London, has engaged the leading law firm Mishcon de Reya to explore the potential for a massive legal claim against Uber. Sources said on Tuesday that if the case proceeded, the LTDA was expected to argue that all 25,000 black cab drivers in London had suffered lost earnings averaging around \u00a310,000 for at least five years as a consequence of failings in the way Uber had operated. At that level, the overall compensation bill could total \u00a31.25bn. Last September, Uber learned it was losing its licence after Transport for London concluded it wasn\u2019t a \u201cfit and proper\u2019 operator. That forced the firm to tighten up its practices, including the reporting of criminal offences and carrying out background checks on drivers. TfL then granted Uber a new probationary licence last month, after the firm passed several inspections. Back in the markets, and Chinese stocks have surged after Beijing announced new fiscal measures to stimulate its economy. Overnight, China\u2019s government rolled out a mixture of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to tackle the \u201cuncertainty\u201d hurting its economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China also acted, pumping $74bn into China\u2019s banking system to prevent credit drying up. Premier Li Keqiang said it was important to \u201cpreserve economic activity within a reasonable range\u201d, as the cabinet agreed tax cuts for company research and development projects. China\u2019s government will also accelerate the issuance of new bonds to finance local government building projects, and promote privately funded transport, oil and gas, and telecommunications projects. ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Betty Wang said in a note. \u201cThe government is sending a clear signal that it is preparing to defend growth, ... Premier Li may be concerned about the negative impact of deleveraging on growth,\u201d The move comes just days after China\u2019s growth rate dipped. It follows rising trade tensions with America, and Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. After months of losses, investors hailed the news. Shares jumped in Shanghai, sending the benchmark index up 1.5% - making its best three-day run in two years. Just in: Britain\u2019s factories kept growing last month, but bosses are slashing some investment plans as trade war and Brexit fears grow. The CBI has reported that UK manufacturing output rose in the last quarter. Around 35% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 20% reported a decrease, giving a balance of +15%. Firms reported that new orders continued to expand \u201cat a brisk pace\u201d, with stronger demand from domestic customers making up for a slowdown in exports. However, firms are cautious; 18% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 21% were less optimistic, giving a balance of -3%. Tom Crotty, Group Director of Ineos and Chair of CBI Manufacturing Council, says: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the manufacturing sector firing on all cylinders, with production revving up again after the slowdown earlier this year. \u201cBut rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty over our future trade and customs arrangements are clearly taking their toll on manufacturers\u2019 confidence and investment.\u201d With Donald Trump hiking tariffs, and Britain possibly heading for a \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit from the EU, firms are axing their spending on \u201cintangible\u201d assets, such as product &amp; process innovation and training and re-training. Investment in this area is expected to fall at a pace unseen since the global financial crisis, the CBI warns. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office has launched a new attempt to prosecute Barclays bank over its emergency fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. The SFO has applied to the High Court to get charges against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank (which holds its banking licence to operate in different countries) reinstated. Barclays says it will defend the application brought by the SFO. Two months ago, the Crown Court dismissed charges that Barclays had conspired to commit fraud by false representations, and provided \u201cunlawful financial assistance\u201d to Qatar over the fund-raising. Here\u2019s some reaction to this month\u2019s eurozone slowdown, from Oxford Economics\u2019 Angel Talavera: ...and from Piet Christiansen of Danske Bank: Trader Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern points out how Germany is outperforming the rest of the eurozone this month: Growth across Europe\u2019s private sector is slowing this month, according to a new survey of purchasing managers across the region. Data firm Markit\u2019s \u2018composite output\u2019 index has fallen to 54.3, from 54.9 in June, due to a slowdown in growth at service sector companies. Its manufacturing PMI index held steady at 54.2, but factory bosses reported the slowest growth in export orders in almost two years. Markit\u2019s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, says Europe\u2019s economy has entered July on a \u201csoft footing\u201d - amid worries about trade disputes. \u201cGiven the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated, notably in manufacturing, where the surveys saw worries about trade wars intensify markedly in July. \u201cWhile there are signs that improving domestic demand in many countries is helping drive robust service sector expansion and support manufacturing, a worsening picture for export growth is clearly having an increasingly detrimental effect on manufacturing. Much of the growth came from Europe\u2019s largest two members. Markit adds. Growth in the periphery hit its lowest level since autumn 2016, though. By country, faster growth in Germany contrasted with a slight slowing in France. Elsewhere, growth was the weakest for 21 months, slipping lower in both manufacturing and services. The rate of growth of Germany\u2019s private sector economy rebounded from a 20-month low in May to a five-month high, driven by a stronger increase in manufacturing output. But France saw the second- weakest expansion in 18 months, stymied in particular by near-stagnant manufacturing. European stock markets have all opened higher, as Alphabet gives the technology sector a boost. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4%, with the mining sector up 1% and tech gaining 0.5%. Britain\u2019s love for a (properly mixed) gin and tonic has swept mixer maker Fever-Tree\u2019s shares to a fresh record high. They surged to \u00a339.87 in early trading, up from $34.60 last night, after Fever-Tree posted a 45% jump in revenues this year. The company has also landed a deal with America\u2019s largest wine and spirits distribution company, leaving it optimistic about the future. CEO Tim Warrillow declared: Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, the Board anticipates that the outcome for the full year will be comfortably ahead of its expectations.\u201d Anyone who had the foresight to buy Fever-Tree\u2019s shares in 2014, when they were worth below \u00a32, can afford a cheeky double G&amp;T tonight. Back in the UK, supermarkets are rubbing their hands after enjoying a boost from England\u2019s World Cup run. Data firm Kantar reports that sales of alcohol at supermarkets surged to \u00a3287 million during the week that the England football team played (and beat!) Colombia and Sweden. That\u2019s a record, if you exclude Christmas and Easter. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, explains: \u201cEngland may not have won the World Cup \u2013 but its journey to the semi-finals not only helped to kickstart the summer, but supermarket sales to boot. \u201cOver the past month, football-frenzied customers visited supermarkets an extra 13 million times as they hurried to stock up on World Cup-viewing essentials, with alcohol in particular the stand-out winner. Supermarkets also saw strong demand for BBQ products and sun cream: McKevitt adds: With the hot and sunny weather showing no signs of letting up, al fresco dining has continued to tempt shoppers. Over the past month, sales of firelighters and fresh burgers rocketed by 47% and 30% as customers honed their barbecuing skills. Meanwhile, sun care products and painkillers were both in demand: sales of sun creams jumped by 38%, while nearly a third of all households picked up pain-killing tablets over the past month. [Those pain killers might have something to do with those alcohol sales....] Financial analysts are impressed by the ability of Google\u2019s parent company to keep growing fast, even with an EU antitrust case hanging over it. As Richard Kramer of Arete Research puts it: \u201cThere was never a question about Google\u2019s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market\u201d JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey agrees that Google\u2019s core revenue stream, web adverts, remains strong: \u201cFirst and foremost, Google Sites revenue has continued to grow, it\u2019s the fourth quarter in a row of accelerating growth rates. The company\u2019s continued ability to reinvent or launch new ad products that have been adopted by advertisers, and that drives return on investment.\u201d Forrester Research\u2019s Collin Colburn said the $5bn fine imposed by commissioner Margrethe Vestager last week was \u201cpretty big\u201d for most companies, but only a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d to Google. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets argues that Google must avoid further financial penalties, for the sake of its reputation: Today, it is all about Alphabet; Google is the king of the advertisement and its ad business is in full throttle. The message is clear for its investors that the company is a monster in this arena and the EU regulatory backlash hasn\u2019t been able to damage its number in any significant way. The internet giant reported its earning number last night and it smashed all the estimates. The crown jewel, its ads business experienced growth of 24% and its second most important lucrative business; cloud services also added a strong number. The growth in the cloud services was 37%. When we look at the Alphabet\u2019s earning, it makes us comfortable that there is a moderate slowdown in spending. This means that the user acquisition cost is going down. This creates a more efficient environment for revenue growth. Having said this, the company cannot afford to have reputation damage and it still needs to bring fines under-control because eventually this would add go against Google\u2019s values. Last night, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reported that the company\u2019s self-driving car division is making progress. He told investors: Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets. Pichai also revealed that Google Translate got a boost during the World Cup. Pichai told investors he was: \u201c...extremely proud to see the positive feedback on how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia\u201d In these simple moments, when you\u2019re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u2019t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European investors are in cheerier mood today, after Google\u2019s parent company smashed expectations last night. Alphabet shrugged off the impact of its penalty for breaking European competition rules, by posting revenues of $26.24bn in just the last three months, beating expectations of $25.5bn. That\u2019s up from $20.9bn a year earlier. Profits dipped to $2.8bn from $4.1bn, but they would have been a sparkling $7.8bn but for the $5bn fine imposed by the EU last week. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat declared the company had delivered \u201canother quarter of very strong performance\u201d. Wall Street agreed - Google\u2019s shares jumped by 4% in after-hours trading following the results. This is feeding through to Europe this morning, with shares rising in London: The results showed that Google\u2019s grip on Web advertising remains extremely strong, with 58% more \u2018clicks\u2019 on its mobile and YouTube adverts than a year ago. Non-advertising revenues (such as mobile apps, cloud computing and Google Home speakers) jumped to $4.4bn, up from around $3bn a year ago. Tech shares are expected to be in demand today after Alphabet\u2019s \u2018impressive set of results\u2019, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: It wasn\u2019t just the headline figures impressing traders, but also a surprise drop in costs reported by Alphabet. Costs had been increasing at a concerning rate over previous quarters as Alphabet played catch up in areas such as developing its cloud business and consumer business. These higher costs had been squeezing margins causing concern particularly among short term traders. Unexpectedly lower costs have eased these fears, boosting demand for the stock in the process. Here\u2019s our news story on the results: Also coming up today There\u2019s a flurry of corporate news today, as companies clear the decks before the summer holidays. Swiss Bank UBS posted a 12% rise in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, thanks to its investment banking arm. European carmaker PSA has reported record earnings, after the takeover of Opel-Vauxhall last year. But UK energy producer Drax\u2019s profits fell 15% in the first half of the year, following various outages. And among the the smaller companies, tonic and mixer-maker Fevertree has posted another big jump in profits - adjusted earnings rose 35% in the last six months, to \u00a334m.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s unquenchable thirst for gin proved the tonic for upmarket mixer maker Fever-Tree, as it reached a record value of \u00a34.5bn on Tuesday after smashing profit forecasts. A surge in its share price meant that the 13-year-old drinks company was worth nearly as much as Royal Mail and outstripped the combined stock market value of WH Smith, Debenhams, the AA and Saga. Fever-Tree, which produces tonic water and other carbonated mixers, has grown rapidly, thanks in large part to the soaring popularity of premium gin. UK gin sales have doubled over the past six years to hit \u00a31.2bn in the year to the end of September 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, while a YouGov poll found gin was the most beloved spirit in the UK, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favourite. Riding the crest of the gin wave has transformed Fever-Tree into one of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing major companies, making multi-millionaires of co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow in the process. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005, naming it after the colloquial term for the cinchona tree, the bark of which produces quinine \u2013 a key ingredient in tonic water. Rolls has banked more than \u00a3150m through share sales since the company\u2019s stock market float in 2014, while Warrilow has sold stock worth \u00a341m. They still own 14% of the company between them, a stake worth nearly \u00a3600m, and pocketed payouts of more than \u00a3630,000 on Tuesday after the group lifted its dividend by 40%. Fever-Tree\u2019s shares jumped by as much as 15% to an all-time high of \u00a339.87, after profits in the first six months of the year rose by a third to \u00a334m, on sales up 45% higher to \u00a3104m. The shares settled back before the end of the day to give the company a stock market value of \u00a34.2bn, still more than 30 times what it was worth when it floated four years ago. Fever-Tree said its performance in the UK over the Christmas period was particularly notable, with an \u201cimpressive rate of sales growth\u201d, but insisted it still had room to expand. Warrilow said: \u201cWhilst this is a notable achievement, there remains a significant opportunity in front of us across all our regions as Fever-Tree continues to drive the evolution of the mixer category.\u201d Fever-Tree also said it signed two new distribution arrangements \u2013 one in the US with wine and spirits distributor Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits, and the other with Spain\u2019s Grupo Damm, the maker of Barcelona\u2019s popular beer Estrella Damm.",

John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, said queues were increasing, citing a recent queue of close to three hours for non-EU passengers at the airport\u2019s Terminal 4. He said allowing low-risk passengers to use e-gates was an easy solution. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we should treat a passenger from the US any differently from one from Lithuania.

The Home Office, which is deploying 200 additional Border Force staff at the airport this summer, said more than 95% of the 40 million annual arrivals at Heathrow passed immigration within an agreed time of 25 minutes for EEA nationals and 45 minutes for others. A spokesperson said: \u201cEvery effort is made to keep delays at the border to a minimum, but we also have a duty to maintain the security of the UK border \u2013 which means checking 100% of scheduled arriving passengers.\u201d Holland-Kaye also called on the government to \u201cwin some ground back from the terrorists\u201d by lifting the ban on packing liquids, following tests of new airport security scanners. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the trial we\u2019ve seen so far. We need the Home Office to give us the approvals and then we are ready to go. There is no reason why the technology can\u2019t be used here.\u201d Since 2006 passengers have been able to take liquids or toiletries of up to 100ml on to a plane in hand luggage, and have been asked to display them in transparent plastic bags to pass security. Heathrow announced record passenger numbers for the first half of 2018, with 38.1 million people travelling through the airport until 30 June. Pretax profits dipped slightly to \u00a395m, and the airport paid \u00a3228m in dividends to its shareholders, led by Ferrovial and the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, China and Singapore. Questions have been raised about the airport\u2019s ability to fund its expansion plans, but Holland-Kaye said the investors were \u201cincredibly well-funded and committed\u201d and the airport had raised another \u00a31bn in the bond market already in 2018. He said the expansion question had been settled since the Commons vote in June, and the airport would invest \u00a3160m this year in the planning process for a third runway. \u201cThe argument was always that it was politically impossible but it\u2019s now the overwhelming will of parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the alternative in a world outside the EU to keep Britain a thriving economy?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pound slides to reach 10-month low Renewed Brexit turmoil for the government and weaker readings from the economy have pushed the pound to its lowest levels for 10 months, as City traders bet on the increasing likelihood of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Sterling dropped after Boris Johnson and David Davis quit the government over the Brexit vision outlined by Theresa May at Chequers. Economists also said weaker-than-expected economic data over the course of the past month could deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August. Sterling remains more than 10% below its value on the eve of the EU referendum. FTSE 100 buoyed by weaker pound The FTSE 100 has experienced a rollercoaster month, buffeted by the prospect of an all-out trade war between the US and the rest of the world as Donald Trump slapped import tariffs on China. Although the president raised the prospect of a US-UK trade deal should May stage a hard Brexit, the US is still imposing higher taxes on EU steel and aluminium, including metal made in the UK. Despite the concerns over trade, the FTSE has found support from the weak pound, because many of the large firms in the index derive much of their profit from overseas. Better than expected Inflation unexpectedly stays at one-year low UK inflation unexpectedly remained at 2.4% in June, despite petrol prices rising to the highest level in four years, heaping pressure on the Bank of England to delay an interest rate rise in August. The Office for National Statistics said the falling price of clothing in the summer sales was one of the main factors offsetting the rise in petrol. Computer game prices also fell, while air fares rose in June, but less than they did a year ago. Worse than expected Trump tariffs threaten British metal exports The UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the gap between what the country imports and sells overseas \u2013 narrowed slightly overall in May from the previous month, despite weak growth in exports for manufactured products. The trade in goods deficit remained unchanged at \u00a312.4bn \u2013 despite economists\u2019 forecasts for a smaller gap \u2013 due to weaker sales of base metals and electrical items, which economists said could be down to the tariffs being imposed by Trump on EU steel and aluminium. Official data shows the UK imported 55% of all goods from the EU and exported 51% to countries outside the bloc in the year to May. Better than expected Business activity shows stronger growth ahead There were stronger readings for the British economy from closely watched surveys of business activity, showing a better-than-forecast rebound for the UK\u2019s services industry, which accounts for about 80% of GDP. The IHS Markit/Cips service sector purchasing managers\u2019 index rose from 54.0 in May to 55.1 in June, with reports of a robust and accelerated pick-up in activity. Any reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. Taken together with stronger readings for the construction and manufacturing industries, economists said the barometers of growth monitored by the Bank of England pointed towards GDP growth of 0.4% in the second quarter. Meets expectations Wage growth falls despite record employment levels The rate of pay growth for British workers dropped to the lowest level in six months in the three months to May, despite record numbers of people in work across the country. The ONS said average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% on the year in the three months to May, down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.6%. Pay growth excluding bonuses slowed to 2.7%. Although in line with expectations, observers expressed disappointment that the lowest level of unemployment since May 1975 was failing to lift the bargaining power of workers to demand higher pay. The jobless rate was unchanged at 4.2%. Worse than expected World Cup and hot weather hurt retail sales The World Cup and the summer heatwave kept British shoppers away from the high street last month, fuelling a surprise drop in consumer spending, despite helping to lift sales of food, drink and barbecues across the country. Clothing stores and other non-food retailers suffered from fewer shoppers amid the hot weather and England playing at the tournament in Russia. The volume of goods sold across the whole of the retail industry dropped by 0.5% last month compared with May, missing City expectations for a rise of 0.2%. Worse than expected Weak UK growth puts the squeeze on Hammond Weak economic growth and sluggish tax revenues prevented the government from reducing its spending deficit in June by as much as anticipated. Coming after May promised to increase spending on the NHS by \u00a320bn over the next few years, the latest figures are likely to frustrate the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he considers ways to raise taxes in the autumn budget to pay for the pledge. The deficit \u2013 measuring the gap between public spending and revenue \u2013 fell by \u00a3800m from the figure in June a year ago to stand at \u00a35.4bn last month, against economists\u2019 forecasts for a deficit of \u00a35bn. Better than expected UK housing market remains in the doldrums British house prices remained flat last month, with activity indicators suggesting the subdued picture would persist for longer still. According to the latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, more properties are being put up for sale, although the improvement could be short-lived. The Rics house price index, measuring the balance of surveyors expecting price rises against those forecasting a fall, rose to +2 in June from -2 a month ago, beating economists\u2019 expectations. Official figures from the ONS showed house price growth slowing to the weakest rate in five years, dragged down by falling prices in London. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month ... lower immigration could add to NHS debt headache Ultra long-term forecasts published this month by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, suggest falling levels of immigration to the UK after Brexit could add to pressures facing the public purse from an ageing population. After May pledged an additional \u00a320bn for the NHS, the economic forecaster said government debt could rise to 280% of GDP due to a more rapidly ageing society than previously forecast by 2067. Migrants usually come for work and tend to be younger, which could have supported greater growth in the economy to help pay for the rise in spending. The warning came after official data from the ONS showed net migration from the EU fell to its lowest level for four years in 2017.",

Despite the concerns over trade, the FTSE has found support from the weak pound, because many of the large firms in the index derive much of their profit from overseas.</p> \n<h2>Better than expected</h2> \n<h2>Inflation unexpectedly stays at one-year low</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"cpi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>UK inflation unexpectedly remained at 2.4% in June, despite petrol prices rising to the highest level in four years, heaping pressure on the Bank of England to delay an interest rate rise in August.

The trade in goods deficit remained unchanged at \u00a312.4bn \u2013 despite economists\u2019 forecasts for a smaller gap \u2013 due to weaker sales of base metals and electrical items, which economists said could be down to the tariffs being imposed by Trump on EU steel and aluminium. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/may2018\">Official data</a> shows the UK imported 55% of all goods from the EU and exported 51% to countries outside the bloc in the year to May.</p> \n<h2>Better than expected</h2> \n<h2>Business activity shows stronger growth ahead</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There were stronger readings for the British economy from closely watched surveys of business activity, showing a better-than-forecast rebound for the UK\u2019s services industry, which accounts for about 80% of GDP.

In the first quarter of the year, bad weather was a significant dampening effect. More recently, however, warm weather and the World Cup appear to have provided a consumer spending boost. While retail salesfigures disappointed in July, across the April to June quarter they were strong. The quarterly rise in the volume of retail spending \u2013 2.1% \u2013 was the strongest recorded for over three years. The quantities of goods purchased on the high street, in petrol stations and on the internet was 2.8% up on a year ago, the biggest annual increase since early last year. The GDP tracker published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research points to 0.4% quarterly growth in the second quarter of this year, after 0.2% in the first two quarters. PwC\u2019s latest projection for economic growth in 2018 as a whole is now 1.3%, which would mark the weakest year of calendar growth since the financial crisis. If this forecast is realised, 2018 would be the weakest year for GDP growth since 1962, outside of periods of recession. That is despite favourable economic conditions in our major trading partners in Europe and the US, and around the world more generally. Economic growth should pick up to around 1.6% in 2019, but next year is likely to be the seventh year of UK GDP growth below 2% this decade. Brexit has combined with the financial crisis and sluggish productivity to produce the weakest two decades of economic growth, the 2000s and 2010s, that we have seen since the second world war. The unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%, but reductions in unemployment have slowed sharply over the past couple of years. Meanwhile, inflation remains above the Bank of England\u2019s target at 2.4%, only just above wage growth. So we will continue to be in an uncomfortable position in the UK economy for a while yet as uncertainty about the Brexit outcome persists, and possibly intensifies. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, US, and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from 2006 to 2009 I have been in Canada in the last few days and people are astonished at Brexit and kept asking me whether the British government has any clue what it is doing. The answer to that question seems to be a resounding \u201cno\u201d. The Brexit shenanigans continue to increase market uncertainty. The pound, which is 10% below its pre-referendum level, hit a 10-month low after Boris Johnson and David Davis quit the government over the Brexit vision outlined by Theresa May at Chequers. Brexit is the biggest downside risk to the UK economy, bar none. But it also doesn\u2019t help that there is a potential global trade war on the horizon which will also potentially lower GDP. Neither inflation nor wages show any sign of taking off. Inflation unexpectedly remained at 2.4% in June, despite petrol prices rising to the highest level in four years, heaping pressure on the Bank of England to delay an interest rate rise in August. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the falling price of clothing as shops staged their summer sales was among the main factors offsetting the rise in petrol prices. The rate of pay growth for British workers dropped to the lowest level in six months in the three months to May, despite figures showing record numbers of people in work across the country. The ONS said average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% on the year in the three months to May, slowing down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.6%. With Brexit and new tariffs pushing down on growth it has hardly been surprising that economic data over the course of the past month has been weakening. That means there is no basis once again for the MPC to raise rates at its next meeting, as in none, but they still might. That would be a major error they would likely have to quickly reverse so they need to keep their powder dry. I\u2019m still looking for lots of good news; I don\u2019t see any this month.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is considering raising interest rates even though the UK economy is showing signs of weakening, and there are mounting signs of danger from a hard Brexit, according to a Guardian analysis of economic developments over the past month. The Bank\u2019s interest rate setting committee meets next week to consider lifting the cost of borrowing above the level set since the financial crisis. But Threadneedle Street is being warned to consider the risks from a surprise slowdown in consumer spending, weak wage growth across the country and fading inflationary pressures. There are also developing problems from Donald Trump\u2019s import tariffs affecting industrial production and the prospect of an acrimonious withdrawal from the EU harming business investment and jobs in the UK. While warning that Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal would inflict economic pain across Europe, the International Monetary Fund said last week that the UK would be hardest hit. Ministers are stepping up preparations for a hard Brexit, with plans to publish more than 70 documents setting out the plans businesses will need to make in case the UK leaves the EU in March next year without a deal. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup may have handed the economy a boost, although economists warn deep fragilities remain. To gauge the impact of the referendum outcome on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was worse than expected. The latest dashboard shows bad news for Britain\u2019s struggling retailers from a drop in sales last month, as the warm weather and the World Cup kept shoppers away from the high street. Despite stronger sales of food, drink and barbecues amid the heatwave, overall sales dropped by 0.5% in June compared with a month earlier, against expectations among economists of a rise of 0.2%. Despite coming after two stronger months for sales in April and May, the latest figures could suggest the economy is losing steam, with hard-pressed Britons facing weak wage growth and high levels of inflation triggered by the Brexit vote two years ago. The rate of pay growth for British workers dropped to the lowest level in six months in the three months to May, according to the latest figures, despite record numbers of people in work across the country. Although this was in line with forecasts, the Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% on the year in the three months to May, slowing down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.6%. There was better news from closely-watched barometers of business activity showing a stronger-than-forecast rebound for the UK\u2019s services sector, which accounts for about 80% of GDP. Households also benefited from the summer sales triggering a drop in clothing prices, offsetting the rising cost of petrol to hold inflation at the lowest level for a year. Against forecasts for a rise, the consumer price index held steady at 2.4% last month, according to the ONS. Flatlining inflation could, however, deter the Bank from raising interest rates as it could suggest the measure for the cost of living could drift back towards its 2% target without the need for higher borrowing costs.",

But Threadneedle Street is being warned to consider the risks from a surprise slowdown in consumer spending, weak wage growth across the country and fading inflationary pressures. There are also developing problems from Donald Trump\u2019s import tariffs affecting industrial production and the prospect of an acrimonious withdrawal from the EU harming business investment and jobs in the UK.<br></p> <p>While warning that Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal would inflict economic pain across Europe, the International Monetary Fund said last week that the UK would be hardest hit.

The latest snapshot of industry from the Confederation of British Industry found that despite mounting skills shortages and capacity constraints, companies were cutting back on product development and training at a rate not seen since the economy was in recession in 2009. The employers\u2019 organisation said the number of firms reporting higher output in the three months to July exceeded those reporting a fall by 27 percentage points \u2013 up from +13 points in April. It added that the strength of order books \u2013 particularly for domestic customers \u2013 meant the short-term outlook for manufacturers was bright, although the pace of output growth was likely to abate over the coming three months. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said it was worrying that companies were cutting back on training budgets at a time when skills shortages were affecting the ability of firms to respond to growing demand. The survey found that the proportion of firms working below capacity had dropped close to the record-low seen at the turn of the year, while the share of firms citing the availability of skilled labour as a likely constraint on activity increased well above the long-run average. Tom Crotty, group director of Ineos and chair of the CBI manufacturing council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the manufacturing sector firing on all cylinders, with production revving up again after the slowdown earlier this year. \u201cBut rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty over our future trade and customs arrangements are clearly taking their toll on manufacturers\u2019 confidence and investment.\u201d Meanwhile, the latest health check on the eurozone economy from the research company Markit found weaker activity amid signs of mounting global trade tensions and a waning impact from the stimulus provided by the European Central Bank. Markit\u2019s flash composite index \u2013 which pulls together evidence from both manufacturers and service sector companies \u2013 slipped back from 54.9 in June to 54.3 in July.",

Charges that Barclays conspired to commit fraud were dismissed at Southwark crown court in May in a blow for the SFO, which had conducted a five-year investigation into the deal. But the SFO said on Tuesday it had applied to the high court to reinstate the charges. In a statement to the stock market, Barclays said it \u201cintends to defend the application brought by the SFO\u201d. The SFO charged Barclays and four former directors with conspiracy to commit fraud in 2017. It also charged the bank in relation to a $3bn (\u00a32bn) loan provided by Barclays to the State of Qatar in the same year, which the SFO said was \u201cunlawful financial assistance\u201d, alleging it was used, directly or indirectly, to buy shares in the bank. The charges against the four men \u2013 former chief executive John Varley, investment banking chief Roger Jenkins, Barclays Wealth boss Thomas Kalaris and European financial institutions head Richard Boath \u2013 remain open. Barclays secured an \u00a311.8bn investment from Qatar in 2008, as the banking crisis spread around the world, helping it avoid following RBS and HBOS in accepting a bailout from the UK government. In its statement to the stock market, Barclays said: \u201cOn 21 May 2018 Barclays announced that the crown court had dismissed all of the charges that had been brought by the Serious Fraud Office against Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc regarding matters which arose in the context of Barclays\u2019 capital raisings in 2008. \u201cBarclays noted at the time its expectation that the SFO was likely to seek to reinstate those charges by application to a high court judge to recommence proceedings via a new indictment of the same charges. \u201cOn 23 July 2018 the SFO made an application to the high court seeking to reinstate against Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc all of the charges dismissed by the crown court.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hammerson, the UK shopping centre operator, plans to sell all of its out-of-town retail parks and reduce its exposure to department stores in a bid to appease disgruntled investors. The owner of London\u2019s Brent Cross and Birmingham\u2019s Bullring aims to offload \u00a31.1bn of properties by the end of 2019 as it exits the retail park sector and focuses on \u201cflagship retail destinations\u201d. Hammerson now owns 13 retail parks across the UK, after announcing on Monday that it had agreed to sell its Imperial retail park in Bristol and Fife Central retail park in Kirkcaldy for a total of \u00a3164m to the property investment firm Capreon. Shareholder pressure has been mounting on Hammerson since April when it abandoned a \u00a33.4bn buyout of its smaller rival Intu, the company behind Manchester\u2019s Trafford centre, and rejected a \u00a35bn takeover approach from the French shopping centres group, Kl\u00e9pierre. David Atkins, the Hammerson chief executive, said on Tuesday it was changing its strategy to address the shift in the wider retail market. \u201cThrough increasing the level of disposals, including exiting the retail parks sector, we will now focus solely on winning destinations of the highest quality: flagship retail destinations and premium outlets,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the venues we believe will maintain relevance and outperform against the shifting retail backdrop.\u201d Hammerson said it would cut by a quarter the amount of space given over to department stores, while high street fashion space would be reduced by a fifth, replaced by \u201caspirational fashion, leisure, events and lifestyle spaces\u201d. It comes as Britain\u2019s department store chains and other high street retailers struggle against a backdrop of higher costs, waning consumer confidence, and competition from online-only retailers. Debenhams has issued three profit warnings since Christmas and came under fresh pressure last week when it emerged that credit insurers had reduced cover for suppliers to the company. House of Fraser announced last month that it would close 31 of its 59 stores in the UK, including its flagship shop on London\u2019s Oxford Street, with the loss of about 6,000 jobs. Hammerson also announced that it would buy back up to \u00a3300m of shares, and that it was shrinking its board, reducing the number of executive directors from four to two. Peter Cole, its chief investment officer, will step down from the board at the end of 2018, after 29 years with the property company. Jean-Philippe Mouton will also step down from the board at the end of the year, but he will remain in his role as managing director of the company\u2019s French business and will continue to be responsible for marketing. Hammerson reported a 0.5% increase in adjusted profits to \u00a3120m in the first half of 2018 and net rental income fell 3% to \u00a3178.5m compared with the same six months last year. Shares rose 1.6% to 534p.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Millions of superfast and ultrafast broadband users could benefit from significant price cuts after BT said it would cut almost \u00a3100m from what it charges rivals to use its network. Openreach, the BT-owned subsidiary that controls the UK\u2019s broadband network, is to dramatically reduce what it charges providers such as Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone to offer superfast and ultrafast broadband. For example, the amount Openreach charges rivals for its 80Mbps product will be slashed by 40% from \u00a39.95 to \u00a35.99. Openreach said the price reductions could help more than 17.5m homes and businesses move to a faster internet service. So far, 10m British households and businesses have upgraded to superfast broadband on the Openreach network, but such services are potentially available to almost 28m premises. \u201cThis offer is a win-win,\u201d said the Openreach chief executive, Clive Selley. \u201cIt will help Britain\u2019s homes and businesses to experience the benefits of faster and more reliable broadband. And it will incentivise our wholesale customers to participate in our long-term investment in digital infrastructure by upgrading more of their customers to superfast and ultrafast services.\u201d Openreach believes the discounts should see the vast majority of Britain\u2019s homes and businesses upgraded to superfast and ultrafast broadband within five years. BT said the price cuts would hit Openreach\u2019s revenue and profits \u201cin the order of high tens of millions of pounds\u201d this year. The move is also designed to stop the UK lagging behind other countries in shifting consumers to faster \u201cfull-fibre\u201d networks. Full-fibre networks are capable of delivering download speeds of 1Gbps \u2013 a level seen as necessary to support future digital communications. They are more than 20 times faster than the current UK average speed of 46.2Mbps. On Monday, the government unveiled plans to drive the rollout of ultrafast broadband networks nationwide within 15 years. Only 4% of homes in the UK have a full-fibre broadband connection, compared with 89% in Portugal and 71% in Spain. In the UK, Openreach has made full-fibre speed broadband available to fewer than 1m homes, but has pledged to extend it to 3m by 2020 and 10m by the middle of the next decade. Rivals including TalkTalk and Vodafone have struck deals with providers including CityFibre to also roll out full-fibre networks, focused on larger cities. \u201cOpenreach\u2019s decision to lower wholesale fibre pricing is good news for customers,\u201d said Tristia Harrison, chief executive of TalkTalk. \u201cWe have long argued that lower wholesale prices are essential to driving higher fibre take-up, which leads to happier, more loyal customers.\u201d However, Openreach\u2019s price cuts will only result in lower prices for consumers if providers pass on their savings. Last year, media regulator Ofcom forced Openreach to slash a third off what it charges rivals for the most popular 40Mb superfast broadband package \u2013 from \u00a388.80 a year to \u00a359.04 by 2020-21 \u2013 to try to stimulate consumer uptake. Since then, providers\u2019 savings have not been passed on to consumers, prompting Margot James, the digital minister, to call for price cuts to make faster broadband services more attractive and affordable.",

    "webTitle": "Global trade system under WTO 'has failed', Australian treasurer says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, has said the global trading system has failed and ought to be subject to a broad review, according to reports. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) system was \u201cbuilt for a different time\u201d and the current trade war between the US, Europe and China could provide the opportunity to take a closer look at \u201chow those rules work and how they\u2019re operating\u201d, he was quoted as saying. Morrison\u2019s comments, reported by the Australian Financial Review, will likely be welcomed by US president Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised the WTO\u2019s trade rules. Earlier this month, Trump said the WTO had treated the US \u201cvery badly for many, many years\u201d, putting the US at a trade disadvantage, and in recent days he flagged his preparedness to expand his roster of tariffs on Beijing to US$500bn (A$674bn), covering almost every product imported to the US from China. The International Monetary Fund warned last week that rising trade tensions between the US and the rest of the world could cost the global economy US$430bn, with America \u201cespecially vulnerable\u201d to an escalating tariff war. Australian stocks suffered their biggest fall in four months on Monday, when the ASX 200 lost 0.9% of its value thanks to concerns about the impact of a trade war. Morrison attended the 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit over the weekend, where the global trade war was much discussed. Afterwards, he told Fairfax it may be difficult to reduce the tensions contributing to the current trade impasse without considering the chronic problems that have plagued the global trading system for years. \u201cIt needs to be looked at in the broader context of how the system has failed to deal with these long-standing issues, and that\u2019s something we discussed with the Americans,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t spell out what changes he thought were necessary, but global trade experts have increasingly been critical of the WTO\u2019s inability to resolve trade disputes within a reasonable time frame. They say the break-down in the WTO\u2019s processes has coincided with an increase in bilateral and preferential trade agreements between smaller numbers of nations, leaving the WTO on the sidelines. Trump has also been pushing his G7 allies \u2013 the UK, Germany, France, Canada, Japan, and Italy \u2013 to abolish tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and subsidies. Morrison said French officials had also been lobbying countries at the G20 summit at the weekend to review the WTO\u2019s processes and rules. Before the G20 meeting last week, Morrison said he would be raising with his foreign counterparts the current problems with global trade. \u201cEconomic integration from open trade and investment has benefited Australia greatly,\u201d he said. \u201cI will use the meeting to stress to my colleagues the importance of keeping markets open. History is clear: when trade barriers go up, growth and jobs go down.\u201d Morrison met with the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, Canada\u2019s finance minister, Bill Morneau, the Netherlands finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. He also used the forum\u2019s tax session to remind his counterparts that the G20 needed to keep working together to crackdown on multinational tax avoidance.",

      "bodyText": "Dewayne Johnson said that if he had known what he knew now about Roundup weedkiller, \u201cI would\u2019ve never sprayed that product on school grounds \u2026 if I knew it would cause harm \u2026 It\u2019s unethical.\u201d Johnson, a former school groundskeeper in northern California who is terminally ill, was testifying on Monday in his landmark suit against Monsanto about the cancer risks of the company\u2019s popular weedkiller. He is the first person to take the agrochemical company to trial over allegations that the chemical sold under the Roundup brand is linked to cancer. He spoke for the first time during the trial in San Francisco, detailing his use of Monsanto\u2019s products, his extensive exposure to herbicides, and his belief that the chemicals caused non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a blood cell cancer. He also described the suffering he endured as skin lesions took over his body. \u201cI\u2019ve been going through a lot of pain,\u201d said Johnson, a father of three who goes by the name Lee. \u201cIt really takes everything out of you \u2026 I\u2019m not getting any better.\u201d His doctors have said he may have just months to live. Johnson\u2019s lawyers have argued in court that Monsanto has \u201cfought science\u201d over the years and worked to \u201cbully\u201d researchers who have raised concerns about potential health risks of its herbicide product. At the start of the trial, the attorneys presented internal Monsanto emails that they said revealed the corporation\u2019s repeated efforts to ignore expert\u2019s warnings while seeking favorable scientific analyses and helping to \u201cghostwrite\u201d positive papers. Thousands have brought similar legal claims across the US, and a federal judge in California ruled this month that hundreds of cancer survivors or those who lost loved ones can also proceed to trial. Johnson\u2019s case has attracted international attention, with the judge allowing his team to present scientific arguments about glyphosate, the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide. Monsanto has continued to assert that Roundup, which is registered in 130 countries and approved for use on more than 100 crops, is safe and not linked to cancer, despite studies suggesting the contrary. Notably, the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d in 2015, a decision that has been central at the trial. Johnson, 46, took the stand in a crowded courtroom and said he was excited when he first got a job as a groundskeeper and pest manager for the school district in Benicia, a suburb north of San Francisco. Part of the work, which began in 2012, involved spraying herbicide to control weeds on school grounds \u2013 sometimes for several hours a day. Although he wore extensive protective gear while spraying, he was often exposed to the Roundup and Ranger Pro chemicals, both glyphosate-based Monsanto products, due to \u201cdrift\u201d, he testified. \u201cYou were getting it on your face everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of unavoidable.\u201d Johnson described two incidents in which he said he was badly exposed to the chemicals due to mishaps and leaking while spraying, including a hose breaking. \u201cIt got on my clothes, got on everything,\u201d he said of one incident, noting that before his cancer, he had \u201cperfect skin\u201d, but after he started spraying and suffered exposures, he got sick and began seeing rashes, lesions and sores all over his body. \u201cI\u2019ve had it bad everywhere.\u201d He was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. \u201cIt was a very scary, confusing time, and I didn\u2019t know what was happening,\u201d said Johnson, who also recounted his calls to Monsanto seeking information about possible risks, and the lack of responses or cancer warnings from the company. \u201cIt\u2019s so tough when you can\u2019t work, you can\u2019t provide for your family,\u201d added Johnson, who said he would be doing another round of chemotherapy in less than a month. Araceli Johnson, Dewayne\u2019s wife, also offered emotional testimony in court on Monday, saying she now has two jobs at a local school district and a nursing home, sometimes working 14-hour days. \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful. It\u2019s just too much for me to explain how I really feel,\u201d she said, recounting the cancer diagnosis and aftermath. \u201cMy world just shut down. I couldn\u2019t think. I couldn\u2019t clean. I couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d His wife recalled the worst moments of chemotherapy when her husband struggled to get out of bed and make it to his uncle\u2019s funeral: \u201cHe just starts crying \u2026 and saying, \u2018I just wanna die.\u2019 And that broke my heart.\u201d Araceli also talked about their two sons, ages 10 and 13, and said she has had a hard time explaining their father\u2019s cancer. Her message to them, she said, has been: \u201cHe\u2019s just very sick \u2026 Spend time with him. Get to know your dad.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Monsanto noted studies that have found Roundup is safe, adding: \u201cWe have empathy for anyone suffering from cancer, but the scientific evidence clearly shows that glyphosate was not the cause.\u201d",
