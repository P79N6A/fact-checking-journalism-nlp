      "bodyText": "WH Smith has been rated the UK\u2019s worst high street retailer as shoppers panned its customer service and store standards. The books to paperclips store came bottom of a survey of Which? readers, reclaiming its unwanted crown as the UK\u2019s most unloved retailer from the supermarket Morrisons, which came bottom last year. WH Smith has come bottom of the survey, which asked 10,000 shoppers to rate their experience in buying non-grocery items at 100 major retailers, for five of the past eight years \u2013 and second worst for the other three. One customer told Which?: \u201cI find WH Smith very expensive and its stores need updating.\u201d Another shopper summed up the retailer\u2019s troubles, branding it \u201chugely inferior to what it was in the past\u201d. The anonymous WH Smith watcher who \u2013 as @WHS_Carpet \u2013 regularly tweets pictures of messy aisles, dodgy price promotions and worn flooring says: \u201cThe problem with WH Smith is that in order to flourish financially, it has entered a downward spiral of cutting costs on the high street to counteract falling sales, which becomes a vicious circle. It has slashed staff numbers, which leads to poor standards and service\u201d. The company has recently been criticised for accidentally pricing toothpaste at \u00a37.99 in one of its hospital outlets and been accused of feeding Britain\u2019s obesity problems by offering bargain chocolate at the till. It also had to change its policy to provide VAT refunds for shoppers travelling outside the EU from British airports after criticism for failing to pass on savings. Bryan Roberts, the insights director for TCC Global, said WH Smith\u2019s tactic of incentivising staff to sell shoppers extra chocolate bars, take coupons for McDonald\u2019s or encourage them to use automated tills is not shopper-friendly. \u201cIf you are an investor then WH Smith is one of the best retailers in the country; its share price performance and profitability are a huge success,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of its practices don\u2019t sit well with customer service.\u201d A WH Smith spokesperson said: \u201cOnly 184 people commented on WH Smith as part of this survey. We serve 12 million customers each week and despite a challenging retail environment we continue to open new shops, and to maintain our presence on the UK high street.\u201d In recent years the company has spent millions of pounds on refurbishing its stores, including about half the high street estate. Even WHS_Carpet has acknowledged that it is getting harder to find examples of grimy or damaged flooring, although they say more staff are needed to help care for stores and customers. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of affection for the brand \u2013 it just needs to live up to it,\u201d they added. This year, the organic beauty specialist Lush, the cut-price health and beauty chain Savers and the toy chain Smyths shared equal billing as the nation\u2019s best retailer. They knocked last year\u2019s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds, down to fourth and sixth place respectively. John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place \u2013 its worst ranking since the annual survey launched in 2010. Ben Clissitt, the Which? magazine editor, said: \u201cIt is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark. \u201cOur findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High street landlords are gearing up for war with retailers, whom they accuse of railroading them into agreeing to rent cuts via increasingly controversial company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). Struggling businesses including the department store chain House of Fraser, the children\u2019s retailer Mothercare and the Carluccio\u2019s Italian restaurant chain are all seeking CVAs, where property owners accept lower rents to help a tenant avoid financial collapse. But they are meeting with growing resistance from major property companies, alarmed by the growing list of CVAs sought this year by chains including Prezzo, Jamie\u2019s Italian, Byron, New Look and Carpetright. Property companies Legal &amp; General and Westfield are among about a dozen landlords plotting opposition to the imminent CVA by House of Fraser, owned by China\u2019s Sanpower. They are weighing up plans to make demands in return for their approval, such as detailed financial forecasts, an equity stake in the 169-year old department store chain or a cut of its future profits. Restructuring experts from consultancies Begbies Traynor and JLL are advising the property companies, who can block the CVA and demand improved terms if more than a quarter of landlords rebel against the company\u2019s proposed terms. Begbies Traynor partner Mark Fry said: \u201cLandlords represent pension funds, investment funds \u2013 they\u2019re spending the ordinary man in the street\u2019s money. So when rents aren\u2019t paid, that affects the performance of these funds. It\u2019s not just about rich property owners.\u201d The move by House of Fraser\u2019s landlords is part of a broader seam of discontent in the property industry about the burden placed on landlords by CVAs. Martin Greenslade, the chief financial officer of Land Securities, the UK\u2019s largest commercial property owner, said CVAs should only be used an emergency option to prevent collapse. \u201cWhere a business has genuine trading difficulties, a CVA can help provide the necessary breathing space to restructure and raise new funds to avoid administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, we are happy to support these agreements. Where the operating performance of a business is fine but its ownership structure has excessive debt or management simply wants to improve its operating profits by reducing rents, we do not believe that the CVA process is fair or appropriate. \u201cFor some smaller landlords, the financial impact of a CVA-imposed rent reduction can be very significant. The CVA should not become a management tool to improve profitability at their expense.\u201d Some retailers have also become frustrated with the CVA system after watching rivals with weaker finances secure lower rents than them. Fashion chain Next is to insert a \u201cCVA clause\u201d into its lease agreements under which its own rents must also be reduced if any of its landlords\u2019 other tenants agree a CVA. Dan Simms, the head of retail agency at real estate business Colliers, said landlords were often railroaded into agreeing rent cuts because, in many cases, CVAs are voted on not just by landlords but by other creditors who won\u2019t share the pain of rent cuts. \u201cIf you\u2019re all lined up and they say they\u2019re only going to shoot the two on the end, the rest will say \u2018fine thank you\u2019,\u201d said Simms. \u201cThe more it happens, the more other retailers think they should do it and dump 20% of property liabilities for little cost. It\u2019s an opportunistic bandwagon.\u201d Simms said rent reductions should be accompanied by other measures to repair a company\u2019s finances, such as debt restructuring and cost cuts, adding that the government would come under pressure to reform the system via legislation. \u201cSome landlords are grouping together to start to say this is not right and not equitable,\u201d he said. \u201cResistance and pressure will really be ramping up over the next few weeks.\u201d Revo, which represents retail property companies, has written to the Commons housing, communities and local government select committee warning of a trend for CVAs. In a letter to committee chair Clive Betts, Revo blamed financial advisers for recommending that retailers seek CVAs, warning of \u201cgrave concerns about the advice being given to parties seeking to enter into such arrangements\u201d. Betts responded with a promise to look into anything that \u201ccould lead to a proliferation of empty shops and a general look of dereliction on high streets up and down the country\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The gambling company that owns Ladbrokes Coral and Foxy Bingo faces a bruising shareholder rebellion over the \u201cexcessively disproportionate\u201d \u00a367m paid to two of its bosses. GVC, a FTSE 250 company with its headquarters on the Isle of Man but mainly operating from Gibraltar, has awarded its chief executive, Kenny Alexander, \u00a345m in share options since 2016. The chairman, Larry Feldman, has picked up share options worth another \u00a322.5m, thanks to a scheme linked to the firm\u2019s share price, which hit an all-time high of \u00a310.26 last week. The shareholder advice bodies Pirc and Glass Lewis are advising investors to vote against the pay report at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Gibraltar next week. Glass Lewis said Alexander\u2019s pay \u2013 which is about 550 times that paid to average employees \u2013 was \u201cexcessively disproportionate\u201d. Luke Hildyard, a director of the remuneration thinktank the High Pay Centre, said it was outrageous that GVC had continued to award huge pay packets after more than 45% of investors failed to support the company\u2019s pay policy at its AGM last year. The protest vote came in response to Alexander\u2019s total pay hitting \u00a319.4m for 2016, slightly more than the \u00a318m he received in the company\u2019s most recent remuneration report. \u201cClearly they\u2019ve completely disregarded the strong vote against last year and are continuing with a similar approach to pay,\u201d Hildyard said. \u201cYou\u2019d hope that there will be an even stronger vote against this year.\u201d However, Hildyard pointed out that such votes are only advisory in nature, with investors only entitled to a vote on company pay policies once every three years. \u201cThis case demonstrates that even when shareholders do oppose egregious awards, which doesn\u2019t happen often enough, the company doesn\u2019t have to do anything about it.\u201d GVC shareholders notionally waved through the payouts because they were included in the terms of its \u00a33.2bn takeover of Ladbrokes Coral last year, which won overwhelming support from investors. Similar huge pay deals have sparked shareholder and political anger in recent months. Jeff Fairburn, the chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon, gave back more than \u00a325m of his \u00a3100m-plus bonus after widespread anger and protest. Shareholders also rebelled against the \u00a342m given to the four directors of Melrose, the buyout firm that snapped up the historic engineering company GKN. While investor discontent about lavish pay awards is yet to reach the heights of the so-called Shareholder Spring of 2012, investors have also lodged sizeable protests at Unilever, Direct Line and Inmarsat. The GVC annual meeting on 6 June offers a fresh opportunity for disgruntled investors to register their disapproval of the company\u2019s decision to continue awarding uncapped pay deals. The firm is thought to have stressed to shareholders that they have seen the value of their shares grow hugely under the stewardship of Alexander and Feldman, reaching a record high of \u00a310.15 last week. GVC declined to comment on the pay deals.",

      "bodyText": "When Rochdale is in the news it tends to be for the wrong reasons, such as associations with child sex exploitation and urban decay. Yet, in its heyday, Rochdale was one of the most prosperous places on earth. The town hall \u2013 a magnificent example of Victorian gothic \u2013 exudes civic pride. But it was built a long time ago, when Britain was the workshop of the world, cotton was king and the north of England was more prosperous than the south. Over the past century or more, the economy\u2019s centre of gravity has shifted and Rochdale faces problems familiar to many places on the wrong side of the geographical divide: how to replace old industries with new ones; how to break out of a low-wage, low-skill pattern of employment; how to persuade the young people leaving for university to come back when they have finished their studies. The policy response is fairly generic also: improving the transport links; a targeted reduction in business rates to reduce vacancy rates; work on a combined retail and leisure complex; the marketing of the town\u2019s history to attract tourists. Rochdale is different in one respect, however. Having been at its zenith during one machine age, it is now using another technological advance \u2013 machine learning \u2013 to measure local wellbeing. Traditionally, if a local authority wanted to gauge public opinion it would commission an opinion poll, an expensive way of capturing a snapshot of sentiment on any one day. The Rochdale feelgood factor does away with interviews and harnesses the power of social media instead. Thousands of tweets sent from the town are studied on daily, with algorithms learning which words have a positive or negative context. Whereas the public don\u2019t always respond entirely honestly to opinion pollsters, machine learning detects their true emotional state. The Bank of England is thinking along the same lines. In a recent speech about the possible uses of big data, Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief economist, said researchers were already studying music choices from Spotify to test consumer confidence. Rochdale\u2019s experiment is being conducted by the economist Paul Ormerod \u2013 born and raised in the borough \u2013 and his colleague Rickard Nyman, who have used machine learning to compile a London feelgood factor and to study the 2017 general election. \u201cRecent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning enable wellbeing to be measured directly from social media,\u201d Ormerod says. \u201cThis is not only considerably less expensive than traditional approaches \u2013 the algorithms do much of the work \u2013 but the results can be generated in real time.\u201d While the Rochdale feelgood index has only been charted since last Christmas, Ormerod and Rickard have been looking at how people feel in London since 15 June 2016, a week before the EU referendum. The study of tweets showed there was a sharp fall in the feelgood factor in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, as might have been expected, given that London voted strongly for remain. There was another big drop in November that year when Donald Trump won the US presidential race. However, on both occasions, sentiment quickly returned to its previous levels, suggesting that most people are not all that bothered by politics and, once the excitement is over, simply get on with their lives. This is consistent with the way in which consumer spending held up much better in the months after the referendum than predicted by most forecasters, including the Bank of England. Had the London feelgood index been available to the Bank in 2016, it might have thought twice about the need for an emergency cut in interest rates. Ormerod and Rickard used the same real-time Twitter analysis for clients during last year\u2019s general election. They found a strong correlation until just a few days before the poll between the proportion of tweets that mentioned Brexit as a topic and the Conservative lead in the polls. Theresa May called the election to strengthen her Brexit negotiating hand and it looked as if the Conservatives were heading for a landslide for the first couple of weeks when Brexit was the dominant issue. However, voters decided the election was not only about Brexit and other issues \u2013 such as social care \u2013 started to show up more regularly in the analysis of tweets. \u201cThe project was not designed to be predictive,\u201d Ormerod says. \u201cBut it did nevertheless indicate that the Conservative lead on the day \u2013 which was in fact 2% \u2013 would be much lower than almost all opinion polls were suggesting.\u201d Rochdale\u2019s destiny will not be determined by a feelgood factor, even one generated by smart machines, because its problems are deep and of longstanding. Thus far, the only conclusions that can be drawn from it are ones that most people could work out for themselves: Rochdale is happier on a Friday than a Monday, happier at Christmas than in January \u2013 when the credit card bills come rolling in \u2013 and permanently less happy than London. It is early days, however. There was a rise in the feelgood factor when the borough was included in the Tour de Manc charity bike ride and the council wants to use the index to work out when it should hold events, how it carries out its services, how the public responds to its regeneration efforts and whether deprived parts of the borough register lower wellbeing. At a bare minimum, the machine learning experiment will help the council make better-informed judgements about how it spends money. The idea may well catch on. It\u2019s been a while since where Rochdale led others followed.",

      "bodyText": "Half of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies have all-male boards, sparking calls by industry watchers for quotas to bring more women into the boardroom. While only eight of the FTSE 100 companies have no women on their boards, 40 of the 80 largest energy firms have no women at all, according to analysis by Powerful Women, a female executive lobbying group. The privately owned petrochemicals firm Ineos, whose founder Jim Ratcliffe was recently named the UK\u2019s richest person, is among the companies with an all-male board. Others include the fracking company IGas and the North Sea oil producer Hurricane Energy. The list of laggards is dominated by oil and gas companies, with the exception of the Anglo-Dutch firm Shell, which has six women on its 12-member board. Power supply companies such as E.ON and National Grid top the table for having the highest number of women on their boards. However, the energy industry still lags behind other sectors, with one-fifth of the 80 biggest companies having only one woman on their board. Juliet Davenport, the chief executive of the renewable energy supplier Good Energy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that half the companies don\u2019t have women on their boards. By doing this, these companies are missing half of the UK population and therefore show a lack of diversity and the potential for groupthink is exacerbated. \u201cInvestors should consider the risks of investing in companies with male-only boards very carefully.\u201d Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, which is building the Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset, agreed: \u201cWe still don\u2019t have enough women in senior positions.\u201d One leading academic said the numbers showed why quotas were needed. Catherine Mitchell, professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, added: \u201cVoluntary quotas are insufficient. Quotas for women on boards are necessary.\u201d \u201cI do not believe for an instant that all men on boards get there on merit alone and therefore quotas are a sensible solution to righting that wrong.\u201d Last week, five of the big six energy suppliers \u2013 EDF Energy, Scottish Power and SSE \u2013 committed along with National Grid and Shell to improve gender diversity, although they stopped short of setting hard targets. \u2022This story was amended on 29 May 2018 to remove an incorrect reference to Cavendish Nuclear Ltd",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Like many things considered quintessentially English, the humble strawberry is an immigrant. The first garden variety was grown in France in the 18th century, the result of cross-pollinating strawberries from North and South America. Those luscious fruits you buy today in the supermarket? A marriage of European and A merican strains. It was only thanks to the penchant of Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII\u2019s Lord Chancellor, for serving wild strawberries with cream, that the fruit assumed totemic importance in the English psyche, never more so than during Wimbledon fortnight when tennis fans consume more than 34,000 kilos of the stuff. The good news is that, despite the terrible spring weather, there should be a bumper harvest this summer. A nation breathes a collective sigh of relief. \u201cThe crop\u2019s looking very good,\u201d said Nicholas Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits. \u201cIt\u2019s a little later than last year, which, seeing that Wimbledon is a little late, is not a bad thing.\u201d But the bigger picture in the strawberry fields of Britain this year is far from rosy. Whether growers will have anyone to pick the ripe berries is now a critical issue, one that has profound implications for the UK\u2019s food security, the health of its population and the sustainability of its countryside economy. \u201cNormally we have 10 people being interviewed by our agency for every job,\u201d said Stephanie Maurel, the chief executive of Concordia which supplies around 10,000 foreign workers to 200 farms in the UK each year. \u201cAs of a month ago we are putting three or four job offers in front of each seasonal worker from Bulgaria and Romania. They are picking and choosing the ones they will come to. There has been a total switch around in 12 months. We\u2019ve never had this before.\u201d Maurel said some regions would be affected more than others by the shortfall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hit all farms equally. Scotland suffers a little bit more. There\u2019s a perception that the season is shorter and wetter and it\u2019s therefore more difficult to earn larger amounts of money.\u201d The temptation is to link the shortage of workers to Brexit. And, certainly, the UK\u2019s decision to leave has not helped matters. \u201cThe morning after the vote, we had a pretty depressed workforce,\u201d said Alastair Brooks who grows strawberries and raspberries near Faversham in Kent for supermarkets and employs around 200 Bulgarian and Romanian workers. \u201cThere were a few nasty incidents in town. People saying \u2018you\u2019ll have to go home now\u2019. It brought out the worst in being British.\u201d But other factors are at play. \u201cThe big problem isn\u2019t so much the referendum as the fact that unemployment in countries like Romania is falling very rapidly,\u201d Marston said. \u201cClearly, a full-time job in your own country is more attractive than a seasonal job in another country, so the whole pool of seasonal labour within the European Union is reducing annually.\u201d So, just how acute is the problem? Evidence submitted by English Apples and Pears Limited to the Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) select committee suggests that almost a third of its members are scaling back as a result of the shortage. Some said they would be removing orchards, a troubling scenario given that more than 60% of the country\u2019s traditional orchards are estimated to have disappeared since the 1950s. \u201cUrgent action is needed now to avoid crops being left unpicked, food wastage, food inflation and displacement by imported foods,\u201d the submission stated. The Association of Labour Providers was equally gloomy. It said 49% of labour providers do not expect to be able to source and supply sufficient seasonal agricultural workers this year and added: \u201cCurrently an average of 60% of agriculture and horticulture businesses are experiencing shortages in low and unskilled roles, with one in eight in crisis.\u201d The problem is not confined to fruit picking. The British Meat Processors Association said 71% of labour providers have indicated they will struggle to meet the labour demands of the food manufacturing sector this year. No one knows just how bad things may become. September, when the soft fruit season ends and the apples and pears season begins, is when demand for labour is at its most acute. In September 2016 the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) said there was a 17% shortfall; in 2017 this had increased to nearly 30%. The early signs are not reassuring. Data for the first three months of the year suggests the declining trend in labour supply is continuing but it will not be until the crucial May and June figures are published that the true picture will emerge. By then, though, it will be too late. \u201cPeople have got plants in the ground now that they don\u2019t know if they can pick,\u201d Maurel said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a grower go into administration already this year; another has shrunk from nine sites to seven. Farmers are saying they are not going to plant because they don\u2019t know if they can pick. People are writing off fields.\u201d Last year, Alison Capper, a fruit grower in Worcestershire and chair of the NFU\u2019s horticulture board, had 100 bins of Gala apples that \u201cwe just didn\u2019t get to pick in time\u201d due to labour shortages. \u201cWith a Gala, the skin goes greasy if it\u2019s not picked in time so we can no longer sell it to supermarkets,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they went to an apple juice maker and it cost us \u00a330,000.\u201d The labour shortage saw labour costs rise by between 9 and 12% last year. A similar rise is predicted this year. \u201cIf this continues we will see businesses start to disinvest,\u201d Capper said. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad news because fruit and veg is the success story of British agriculture. If we can produce it here it\u2019s going to be of better, nutritional value. Why would we want to diminish our investment in our food chain that delivers the greatest benefit in health terms?\u201d The roots of the crisis can be traced back to the government\u2019s decision in 2013 to end the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme. Set up after the second world war to help Czech and Polish soldiers who had fought for Britain find work in the country, it has mutated down the years to allow workers from countries such as Belarus, Ukraine and Russia to come to the UK on seasonal visas. At its end, it was confined to Romanian and Bulgarian workers. Taking the decision to scrap it, the government argued that with Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU there would be no shortage of migrant labour to work on the UK\u2019s farms. Indeed, figures released last week show that there are 2.3 million EU nationals now working in the UK, 2.4% more than there were in the immediate pre-referendum period. More than 400,000 of these are Romanian. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t forsee that the whole of Europe would now be short of people to do this work,\u201d said Brooks whose employees earn in one week what they earn in four back home. Many of the young, educated, English-speaking workers from eastern Europe have moved on to jobs in other sectors which offer full-time work or to countries such as Germany which are closer to home. In Britain\u2019s fields today seasonal workers from eastern Europe are now more likely to be in their forties, to speak little English and to find picking physically tougher than their younger predecessors. The situation has become so bad that Concordia is currently recruiting workers from Moldova where a third of the population have Romanian or Bulgarian passports. Other European countries are bringing in workers from outside the EU. Brooks said Poland was using workers from North Korea while Portugal was relying on migrant labour from Thailand. \u201cHere\u2019s the irony,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe are the only country in Europe that has a European worker only policy. Everywhere else is recruiting from outside the EU.\u201d Sunder Katwala, director of the thinktank British Future, said the majority of people accepted that Britain needed to bring in migrant labour if its food supply was to be maintained. \u201cThe public recognises that we need to find people to do these jobs if we want our strawberries to be picked,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme helped fill these vacancies until it was scrapped in 2013. It did the job well and we may need something similar again \u2013 a well-managed scheme that brings in the workers we need and makes employers take responsibility for the local impacts of migration, such as on housing.\u201d But the government appears to be in denial over the issue. In early 2017 it told the Defra committee that foreign labour shortage reports were anecdotal. Then, this February, Defra secretary Michael Gove seemed to signal a volte face, telling an NFU conference a scheme would be announced \u201cshortly\u201d. The previous home secretary, Amber Rudd, dropped a similar hint, but No 10 is said to be against the plan, perhaps fearing the headlines if it starts issuing visas to non-EU nationals. The fact that prime minister Theresa May was home secretary when the original scheme was scrapped may also be a reason, some growers believe. Few in the horticultural sector now expect anything to happen before the autumn when a government-commissioned report is published and the potential to offer temporary visas to overseas workers can be used as a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations. A Home Office spokesman defended its position. \u201cThe government places great value on the UK\u2019s food and farming industries, both as crucial components of the UK economy and of the fabric of rural Britain. Up until the end of the implementation period in December 2020, employers in these sectors will be free to recruit EU citizens to fill vacancies and those arriving to work will be able to stay in the UK afterwards.\u201d Capper accused the government of allowing the issue of seasonal workers \u201cto get tied up in the politics of immigration\u201d. \u201cA scheme that brings workers in to pick and pack fruit and veg and them sends them home again has got nothing to do with immigration,\u201d she said. Maurel said her organisation had been contacted twice last week by Border Force officials asking questions about the workers it was bringing into the UK \u2013 \u201cthe first time this had happened\u201d. Brooks said similar questions had been asked of his employees. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had this sort of thing in 20 years. You do feel uneasy now as to where we are heading as a nation. We were all deeply shocked and embarrassed by the Windrush scandal but maybe that\u2019s indicative of where the Home Office is. \u201cIf that\u2019s truly the case then that\u2019s a big problem for the UK economy.\u201d And this is before the UK actually leaves Europe. Some 90,000 workers are needed this summer on UK farms. Of these, 35,000 are on seasonal contracts. \u201cAs we get closer to a cliff edge the government say we\u2019re going to have a transition deal but we don\u2019t know that,\u201d Capper said. \u201cIf we do crash out of Europe next year I won\u2019t have access to EU workers.\u201d \u201cThat would be a calamity,\u201d said Brooks who is proud of the fact that, during the summer, 99% of Britain\u2019s strawberries and raspberries come from within its shores. Could UK workers plug the gap? Unlikely. Attempts to recruit them have been \u201can unmitigated disaster\u201d, Maurel suggested. \u201cThere is no appetite. We ring a bell in the office when a UK worker applies. We put jobs on Jobcentre Plus. Absolutely nothing happens. We\u2019ve had two applications this year in five months.\u201d| Frustrated by the government\u2019s foot-dragging, some of the big growers have already diversified. One of Britain\u2019s largest berry farmers, Haygrove farm in Herefordshire, announced earlier this year that it was cutting back on its seasonal workforce and expanding in China. Others are investing in South Africa and Tasmania. For now these growers are outliers. Whether they become the norm will depend on Britain\u2019s ability to secure foreign labour. Last Friday evening, as she finished her shift picking strawberries at Brooks\u2019s farm in Kent, 27-year-old Afize Yuseinova, was one Bulgarian worker who pledged to continue working here. \u201cI like England,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no jobs for me back home.\u201d But in the fields of Britain, Yuseinova is becoming an endangered species. Too many countries and industries now want her. Brooks inspected a strawberry plant and found an ant. He explained that the insect was looking for aphids to milk for their honeydew. But the ant was out of luck as there were no aphids to be found. \u201cI love Bulgarian workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s only five million of them.\u201d",

At its end, it was confined to Romanian and Bulgarian workers.</p> <p>Taking the decision to scrap it, the government argued that with Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU there would be no shortage of migrant labour to work on the UK\u2019s farms. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/24/romanian-second-most-common-non-british-nationality-uk\">figures released last week</a> show that there are 2.3 million EU nationals now working in the UK, 2.4% more than there were in the immediate pre-referendum period. More than 400,000 of these are Romanian.</p> <p>\u201cBut we didn\u2019t forsee that the whole of Europe would now be short of people to do this work,\u201d said Brooks whose employees earn in one week what they earn in four back home.</p> <p>Many of the young, educated, English-speaking workers from eastern Europe have moved on to jobs in other sectors which offer full-time work or to countries such as Germany which are closer to home. In Britain\u2019s fields today seasonal workers from eastern Europe are now more likely to be in their forties, to speak little English and to find picking physically tougher than their younger predecessors.</p> <p>The situation has become so bad that Concordia is currently recruiting workers from Moldova where a third of the population have Romanian or Bulgarian passports.</p> <p>Other European countries are bringing in workers from outside the EU. Brooks said Poland was using workers from North Korea while Portugal was relying on migrant labour from Thailand. \u201cHere\u2019s the irony,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe are the only country in Europe that has a European worker only policy. Everywhere else is recruiting from outside the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Sunder Katwala, director of the thinktank British Future, said the majority of people accepted that Britain needed to bring in migrant labour if its food supply was to be maintained. \u201cThe public recognises that we need to find people to do these jobs if we want our strawberries to be picked,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme helped fill these vacancies until it was scrapped in 2013. It did the job well and we may need something similar again \u2013 a well-managed scheme that brings in the workers we need and makes employers take responsibility for the local impacts of migration, such as on housing.\u201d</p> <p>But the government appears to be in denial over the issue. In early 2017 it told the Defra committee that foreign labour shortage reports were anecdotal. Then, this February, Defra secretary Michael Gove seemed to signal a volte face, telling an NFU conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/20/farmers-tell-gove-lack-of-migrant-workers-now-mission-critical\">a scheme would be announced \u201cshortly\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The previous home secretary, Amber Rudd, dropped a similar hint, but No 10 is said to be against the plan, perhaps fearing the headlines if it starts issuing visas to non-EU nationals. The fact that prime minister Theresa May was home secretary when the original scheme was scrapped may also be a reason, some growers believe. Few in the horticultural sector now expect anything to happen before the autumn when a government-commissioned report is published and the potential to offer temporary visas to overseas workers can be used as a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67f6c4559cb171527fb5428ed4c2b53e821875d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f6c4559cb171527fb5428ed4c2b53e821875d1/0_119_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soft fruit farmer Alistair Brooks, owner of Langdon Manor farm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soft fruit farmer Alistair Brooks, owner of Langdon Manor farm, fears the shortage of workers could be \u2018catastrophic\u2019 for his industry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Home Office spokesman defended its position. \u201cThe government places great value on the UK\u2019s food and farming industries, both as crucial components of the UK economy and of the fabric of rural Britain. Up until the end of the implementation period in December 2020, employers in these sectors will be free to recruit EU citizens to fill vacancies and those arriving to work will be able to stay in the UK afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>Capper accused the government of allowing the issue of seasonal workers \u201cto get tied up in the politics of immigration\u201d. \u201cA scheme that brings workers in to pick and pack fruit and veg and them sends them home again has got nothing to do with immigration,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Maurel said her organisation had been contacted twice last week by Border Force officials asking questions about the workers it was bringing into the UK \u2013 \u201cthe first time this had happened\u201d.</p> <p>Brooks said similar questions had been asked of his employees. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had this sort of thing in 20 years. You do feel uneasy now as to where we are heading as a nation. We were all deeply shocked and embarrassed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commonwealth-immigration\">the Windrush scandal</a> but maybe that\u2019s indicative of where the Home Office is.</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s truly the case then that\u2019s a big problem for the UK economy.\u201d</p> <p>And this is before the UK actually leaves Europe. Some 90,000 workers are needed this summer on UK farms. Of these, 35,000 are on seasonal contracts. \u201cAs we get closer to a cliff edge the government say we\u2019re going to have a transition deal but we don\u2019t know that,\u201d Capper said. \u201cIf we do crash out of Europe next year I won\u2019t have access to EU workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would be a calamity,\u201d said Brooks who is proud of the fact that, during the summer, 99% of Britain\u2019s strawberries and raspberries come from within its shores.</p> <p>Could UK workers plug the gap? Unlikely. Attempts to recruit them have been \u201can unmitigated disaster\u201d, Maurel suggested.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no appetite. We ring a bell in the office when a UK worker applies. We put jobs on Jobcentre Plus. Absolutely nothing happens. We\u2019ve had two applications this year in five months.\u201d|</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/from-royal-table-to-empty-fields-asparagus-farmer-faces-bust-over-brexit\">From royal table to bust: asparagus farmer could close over Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frustrated by the government\u2019s foot-dragging, some of the big growers have already diversified.

      "bodyText": "It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders\u2019 Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the \u00a345.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday\u2019s meeting \u2013 the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a \u00a33.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell \u00a315bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in \u00a33bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about \u00a326bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the \u201cdisgraceful\u201d treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed \u201cwidespread inappropriate treatment\u201d of small businesses by the bank\u2019s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report\u2019s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered \u201cmaterial financial distress\u201d due to its treatment of them. While RBS \u201cdid not set out to engineer\u201d financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called \u201cupside instruments\u201d to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday\u2019s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank\u2019s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.",

      "bodyText": "When they meet it is discreetly, in a small windowless room at the back of a Mayfair cafe in London. But it\u2019s not a clandestine affair. The men, Richer Sounds founder Julian Richer and Marks &amp; Spencer boss Steve Rowe, are debating ways to reinvigorate M&amp;S, which, in a dramatic admission, said last week that it had become \u201ctoo corporate\u201d and lost touch with its shoppers. \u201cI wanted us to meet outside the office so we could talk without distractions and we have very intense discussions,\u201d explains Richer. \u201cI\u2019m an ideas man. I\u2019m all about the people.\u201d The entrepreneur has been drafted in by M&amp;S chairman Archie Norman to assist with a major restructuring that involves \u201cfracturing\u201d a dysfunctional business culture in which decisions are made by committee, accountability is blurred and customers are abandoning its shops. Richer successfully assisted Norman with the turnaround of no-frills grocer Asda in the 1990s and at M&amp;S is acting as an \u201cindependent adviser on culture change\u201d. This time around it is Rowe, not Norman, heeding Richer\u2019s counsel, and they are unlikely bedfellows. Richer, with his long hair and sideline as the drummer in funk band Ten Millennia, is lauded for the success of his Richer Sounds chain, which he founded in 1978 at the age of 19. Rowe, by comparison, is an M&amp;S lifer who supports Millwall. But the men appear to have built a rapport; after a recent t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate Richer persuaded Rowe to abandon his driver and hire a bike to pedal across the capital together to visit a store. \u201cI think we have connected very well,\u201d says Richer. In fact Rowe, after a punishing week in which M&amp;S reported a collapse in pretax profits linked to its large store-closure plan, pitched up on Thursday morning, along with a handful of other M&amp;S directors, to attend a lecture on Richer\u2019s new book, The Ethical Capitalist, in a Salvation Army hall in the West End. Profits might be going backwards at M&amp;S but Richer is the first to admit his hi-fi and TV empire is a \u201cminnow\u201d alongside the might of the UK\u2019s largest fashion retailer, with just 53 stores to M&amp;S\u2019s 1,035. Last year, Richer Sounds rang up sales of \u00a3187m while M&amp;S recorded \u00a310.7bn. But M&amp;S is in decline: its clothing market share, for example, has almost halved from a peak of 13.5% in 1997 to 7.6%. By comparison Richer Sounds has kept the mighty Amazon at bay and regularly comes top \u2013 including this year \u2013 in the annual retail poll by consumer group Which?. It is fair to say M&amp;S would like to sprinkle some of that stardust on its shop floor. At the end of Richer\u2019s talk, Rowe said a few words, confessing that, after a meeting with \u201cJools\u201d, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had 17,000 volts put through me.\u201d When Norman took the M&amp;S chair last year he certainly electrified the boardroom. He forced Rowe, who had already been running the business for a year, to kick the tyres \u2013 and, judging by last week\u2019s investor update, the company failed its MOT spectacularly. Serious faults include a \u201ctop heavy\u201d head-office culture, a clunky website and a food business that needs a complete overhaul. \u201cArchie gave me a pass and I turned up at the Pudsey store at the crack of dawn,\u201d says Richer of his experience at Asda. He would spend a day a week for the next two-and-a-half years at the grocer, sending Norman regular reports. Now he has an M&amp;S pass. Some of Richer\u2019s culture-change ideas are simple, such as a suggestion scheme for staff. He introduced one at Asda and recently at M&amp;S. It\u2019s \u201cnot very sexy\u201d, he admits, but they empower staff and the ideas they generate, he says, are \u201cakin to having a oil well in your back garden\u201d. The Yorkshire-based entrepreneur has plenty of big ideas too. Among his new pet projects is funding a new non-profit organisation, Taxwatch, where journalists and tax professionals will work together to expose abuse of the tax system by multinationals and individuals in a bid to galvanise public opinion. Given the entrepreneur is worth an estimated \u00a3160m, one might expect his loyalties to be elsewhere, but he says: \u201cI\u2019m outraged by the status quo. We pay our taxes but these people are laughing at us.\u201d As 134-year-old M&amp;S faces the potential shame of dropping out of the FTSE 100 in this week\u2019s reshuffle, the stakes are high for Rowe \u2013 and for Richer to replicate his Midas touch. \u201cI\u2019ve nailed my colours to the mast,\u201d says Richer of the challenge ahead. \u201cM&amp;S has to change, and is changing, fast.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When they meet it is discreetly, in a small windowless room at the back of a Mayfair cafe in London. But it\u2019s not a clandestine affair. The men, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/nov/05/11\" title=\"\">Richer Sounds</a> founder Julian Richer and Marks &amp; Spencer boss Steve Rowe, are debating ways to reinvigorate M&amp;S, which, in a dramatic admission, said last week that it had become \u201ctoo corporate\u201d and lost touch with its shoppers.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted us to meet outside the office so we could talk without distractions and we have very intense discussions,\u201d explains Richer. \u201cI\u2019m an ideas man. I\u2019m all about the people.\u201d</p> <p>The entrepreneur has been drafted in by M&amp;S chairman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/m-and-s-archie-norman-chairman-marks-spencer\" title=\"\">Archie Norman</a> to assist with a major restructuring that involves \u201cfracturing\u201d a dysfunctional business culture in which decisions are made by committee, accountability is blurred and customers are abandoning its shops.</p> <p>Richer successfully assisted Norman with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/nov/10/9\" title=\"\">turnaround of no-frills grocer Asda</a> in the 1990s and at M&amp;S is acting as an \u201cindependent adviser on culture change\u201d. This time around it is Rowe, not Norman, heeding Richer\u2019s counsel, and they are unlikely bedfellows.</p> <p>Richer, with his long hair and sideline as the drummer in funk band Ten Millennia, is lauded for the success of his Richer Sounds chain, which he founded in 1978 at the age of 19. Rowe, by comparison, is an M&amp;S lifer who supports Millwall. But the men appear to have built a rapport; after a recent <em>t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate</em> Richer persuaded Rowe to abandon his driver and hire a bike to pedal across the capital together to visit a store.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have connected very well,\u201d says Richer. In fact Rowe, after a punishing week in which M&amp;S reported a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/marks-and-spencer-reports-sharp-drop-in-annual-profits\" title=\"\">collapse in pretax profits</a> linked to its large store-closure plan, pitched up on Thursday morning, along with a handful of other M&amp;S directors, to attend a lecture on Richer\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1115429/the-ethical-capitalist-how-to-make-business-work-better-for-society/\" title=\"\"><em>The Ethical Capitalist,</em></a> in a Salvation Army hall in the West End.</p> <p>Profits might be going backwards at M&amp;S but Richer is the first to admit his hi-fi and TV empire is a \u201cminnow\u201d alongside the might of the UK\u2019s largest fashion retailer, with just 53 stores to M&amp;S\u2019s 1,035. Last year, Richer Sounds rang up sales of \u00a3187m while M&amp;S recorded \u00a310.7bn. But M&amp;S is in decline: its clothing market share, for example, has almost halved from a peak of 13.5% in 1997 to 7.6%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's akin to having a oil well in your back garden</p> <footer> <cite>Julian Richer on staff suggestion schemes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By comparison Richer Sounds has kept the mighty Amazon at bay and regularly comes top \u2013 including this year \u2013 in the annual retail poll by consumer group Which?. It is fair to say M&amp;S would like to sprinkle some of that stardust on its shop floor. At the end of Richer\u2019s talk, Rowe said a few words, confessing that, after a meeting with \u201cJools\u201d, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had 17,000 volts put through me.\u201d</p> <p>When Norman took the M&amp;S chair last year he certainly electrified the boardroom. He forced Rowe, who had already been running the business for a year, to kick the tyres \u2013 and, judging by last week\u2019s investor update, the company failed its MOT spectacularly. Serious faults include a \u201ctop heavy\u201d head-office culture, a clunky website and a food business that needs a complete overhaul.</p> <p>\u201cArchie gave me a pass and I turned up at the Pudsey store at the crack of dawn,\u201d says Richer of his experience at Asda. He would spend a day a week for the next two-and-a-half years at the grocer, sending Norman regular reports. Now he has an M&amp;S pass.</p> <p>Some of Richer\u2019s culture-change ideas are simple, such as a suggestion scheme for staff. He introduced one at Asda and recently at M&amp;S. It\u2019s \u201cnot very sexy\u201d, he admits, but they empower staff and the ideas they generate, he says, are \u201cakin to having a oil well in your back garden\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/27/julian-richer-crusade-expose-tax-avoiders-richer-sounds\">Richer Sounds boss launches crusade to expose tax avoiders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Yorkshire-based entrepreneur has plenty of big ideas too.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Two years after the Brexit vote, Project Fear may be coming true", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the features of the Brexit vote is that it shows economics doesn\u2019t matter very much. At least not to the 52% who voted to leave the European Union, and who the pollsters tell us still largely feel as they did on 23 June 2016. That seems strange when the debate about Scottish independence focused for much of the time on the possible economic gains and losses. But there was no doubting, when the Brexit votes were counted, that George Osborne\u2019s Project Fear had been smashed on the rocks of public indifference. Osborne warned that the Treasury\u2019s best minds had reached a terrible conclusion: that leaving the European Union would knock 6% off economic growth by 2030, costing each household \u00a34,300 a year. Last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the UK was already following the trajectory mapped out by the Treasury. He said the UK had already lost almost 2% of predicted growth and 4% from household incomes. This translates into a \u00a3900 loss per household. Most of the damage, he said, was Brexit-related. The result is that the economy is \u00a340bn smaller than it would have been without Brexit; it\u2019s possible to show that this amounts to a \u00a315bn loss of tax revenue, or \u00a3300m a week. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable was appalled by this confirmation of all his worst fears. Labour MP and arch-Remainer Chuka Umunna was equally indignant that the experts had been proved right. He tweeted: \u201cBrexit is already costing every person in this country hundreds of pounds in lower income, and we haven\u2019t even left yet.\u201d The public, on the other hand, appeared to be nonplussed. This is partly because the loss is a notional one, based on economic forecasts that the Treasury and Bank of England have become notorious for getting wrong over the last 10 years. More importantly, the Brexit vote was born of several factors unrelated to economics, such as reclaiming power from the European court of justice, or ending EU rules that block attempts to control the country\u2019s borders. This is an unfortunate situation, because what Carney has to say is important. It\u2019s true, as the Brexiters say, that much of the loss to households flows from a one-off inflationary reaction to the lower pound, which pushed the cost of imported goods higher. Yet a cliff-edge Brexit featuring only a basic trade deal \u2013 something that remains a possibility \u2013 could trigger another fall in the pound, ushering in a second dose of import-led inflation. Carney made this warning explicit in a speech last week that revealed the Bank is prepared to withdraw its plans for raising interest rates if this happens. Inflation, he said, had cut household spending power and accounted for around a third of the \u00a3900 loss. The remaining two-thirds was due to lost productivity \u2013 and that was largely due to a collapse in investment. Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development documenting foreign direct investment show a 90% collapse in flows to the UK in 2017 compared with the previous year. Granted, the previous year was characterised by a strong recovery from a miserable 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, a 90% fall in funds coming to the UK shows how fragile Britain\u2019s reputation among corporate investors has become, and how positive sentiment can evaporate almost overnight. Large domestic companies are of the same mind. They are the main losers from the Brexit vote and the costly trade and customs arrangements it could usher in. They are the most averse to making investment decisions until the situation is clearer. And even then, if it becomes obvious that a hard Brexit is the most likely result, with a customs deal no better than Canada\u2019s, they might ditch their investment plans altogether. This scenario is possible, and it\u2019s right that Carney makes the cost explicit to the public. One day, they might want to pay attention. Disney faces battle for fairtale ending at Sky Comcast is threatening to scupper Rupert Murdoch\u2019s fairytale ending with Disney. The cable and media group is plotting to make a knockout bid for 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets, which Murdoch has agreed to sell to Disney. Murdoch\u2019s Fox is a lucrative business, with assets spanning the X-Men and Deadpool franchises to a 39% stake in Sky and a 30% stake in US streaming service Hulu. Disney\u2019s $52bn all-stock deal appealed to Murdoch more than Comcast\u2019s original cash offer last year, which was 16% higher but raised questions over regulatory and tax hurdles. But Comcast is not so easily deterred. It already has a \u00a322bn offer tabled for Sky itself that would make it the world\u2019s largest pay-TV company. Like Disney, however, Comcast has its eyes on global expansion and the rise of Netflix \u2013 which means taking a tilt at the wider Fox group. Disney, meanwhile, needs Fox to supercharge its belated entry into the world of streaming, having already pulled its immense film catalogue \u2013 from Star Wars to Toy Story \u2013 off Netflix in the US in preparation for its own streaming service. Because Disney already owns 30% of Hulu, Fox\u2019s stake would give it control of two outlets over which to spread its vast entertainment fare. However, Comcast also owns major assets including the maker of Downton Abbey and Made in Chelsea as well as Pixar rival DreamWorks, creator of Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, and Universal Studios. It is well aware of the need for lots of content in a world dominated by streaming. Comcast spies global reach: only 9% of its revenues come outside the US, and pay-TV in its home market is hitting saturation and facing decline. Taking over Sky would make that 25% overnight. The strategic rationales for Comcast or Disney buying Fox are both strong. Both will have to dig deeper in order to win. FTSE 100 is no guide to UK economy\u2019s health How bad can things be? The FTSE 100 index is on a great run. The barometer of the nation\u2019s biggest companies last week recorded new highs around the 7900 level. The round number of 8000 is in sight. Then prepare for the big one \u2013 10,000. So banish your Brexit blues, and enjoy the vote of confidence in the UK. Unfortunately, the above paragraph is complete rubbish. It is correct that the FTSE 100 is currently buoyant, but prepare instead to tear your hair out when a headline-seeking politician (and there will be one) claims the achievement of 8000 is some form of triumph for the UK economy. He or she will be spouting nonsense. \u201cThe characteristics of the FTSE 100 index make me marvel at people who use the index as a product or guide to enable them to \u2018invest in the UK,\u2019\u201d wrote Terry Smith in this year\u2019s letter to investors in his Fundsmith fund. He\u2019s right. As he pointed out, four of the top 10 constituents gave a break-down of the UK contribution to their total sales last year and the numbers were: 1% at Rio Tinto, 3.8% at GlaxoSmithKline, 8% at AstraZeneca and 14.5% at Vodafone. Therein lies the clue to one factor behind last week\u2019s uptick: the pound has been weak, thereby inflating the value of dollars and euros earned overseas when translated into sterling, the currency in which share prices are quoted in London. Expressed in dollars, the Footsie is still well below its highs. The idiosyncratic make-up of the FTSE 100 doesn\u2019t matter in the sense that everyone knows what they\u2019re getting, or should. Even the London Stock Exchange calls it \u201cLondon\u2019s global benchmark\u201d. Is it even a good global index, though? As Smith also wrote, only 1.8% of the FTSE 100 was in information technology at the end of last year, versus 23.9% for the main US index, the S&amp;P 500. So, if you believe the IT sector is best placed to reflect global growth in the decades ahead, ignore the Footsie.",

      "body": "<p>One of the features of the Brexit vote is that it shows economics doesn\u2019t matter very much. At&#xa0;least not to the 52% who voted to leave the European Union, and who the pollsters tell us still largely feel as they did on 23&#xa0;June 2016.</p> <p>That seems strange when the debate about Scottish independence focused for much of the time on the possible economic gains and losses. But there was no doubting, when the Brexit votes were counted, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/18/eu-referendum-reality-check-uk-households-worse-off-brexit\" title=\"\">George Osborne\u2019s Project Fear</a> had been smashed on the rocks of public&#xa0;indifference.</p> <p>Osborne warned that the Treasury\u2019s best minds had reached a terrible conclusion: that leaving the European Union would knock 6% off economic growth by 2030, costing each household \u00a34,300 a year.</p> <p>Last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the UK was already following the trajectory mapped out by the Treasury.</p> <p>He said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/brexit-vote-cost-uk-mark-carney-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">the UK had already lost almost 2% of predicted growth and 4% from household incomes.</a> This translates into a \u00a3900 loss per household. Most of the damage, he said, was Brexit-related. The result is that the economy is \u00a340bn smaller than it would have been without <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Brexit\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>; it\u2019s possible to show that this amounts to a \u00a315bn loss of tax revenue, or \u00a3300m a week.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat leader Vince&#xa0;Cable was appalled by this confirmation of all his worst fears. Labour MP and arch-Remainer Chuka Umunna was equally indignant that the experts had been proved right. He tweeted: \u201cBrexit is already costing every person in this country hundreds of pounds in lower income, and we haven\u2019t even left&#xa0;yet.\u201d</p> <p>The public, on the other hand, appeared to be nonplussed. This is partly because the loss is a notional one, based on economic forecasts that the Treasury and Bank of England have become notorious for getting wrong over the last 10 years.</p> <p>More importantly, the Brexit vote was born of several factors unrelated to economics, such as reclaiming power from the European court of justice, or ending EU rules that block attempts to control the country\u2019s borders.</p> <p>This is an unfortunate situation, because what Carney has to say is important. It\u2019s true, as the Brexiters say, that much of the loss to households flows from a one-off inflationary reaction to the lower pound, which pushed the cost of imported goods higher. Yet a cliff-edge Brexit featuring only a basic trade deal \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/hard-brexit-tories-pressure-may-customs-union\" title=\"\"> something that remains a possibility</a> \u2013 could trigger another fall in the pound, ushering in a second dose of import-led inflation.</p> <p>Carney made this warning explicit in a speech last week that revealed the Bank is prepared to withdraw its plans for raising interest rates if this&#xa0;happens. Inflation, he said, had cut household spending power and accounted for around a third of the \u00a3900 loss. The remaining two-thirds was due to lost productivity \u2013 and that was largely due to a collapse in&#xa0;investment.</p> <p>Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development documenting foreign direct investment show a 90% collapse in flows to the UK in 2017 compared with the previous year. Granted, the previous year was characterised by a strong recovery from a miserable 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, a 90% fall in funds coming to the UK shows how fragile Britain\u2019s reputation among corporate investors has become, and how positive sentiment can evaporate almost overnight.</p> <p>Large domestic companies are of the same mind. They are the main losers from the Brexit vote and the costly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/23/brexiters-customs-model-could-cost-20bn-for-uk-business\" title=\"\">trade and customs arrangements</a> it could usher in. They are the most averse to making investment decisions until the situation is clearer. And even then, if it becomes obvious that a hard Brexit is the most likely result, with a customs deal no better than Canada\u2019s, they might ditch their investment plans altogether.</p> <p>This scenario is possible, and it\u2019s right that Carney makes the cost explicit to the public. One day, they might want to pay attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e4cfb2394e23968a4497b2f813f41b335d6ed71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e4cfb2394e23968a4497b2f813f41b335d6ed71/0_38_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch\u2019s strategy seems to have been threatened by Comcast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch\u2019s strategy seems to have been threatened by Comcast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sanchez-Gonzalez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Disney faces battle for fairtale ending at Sky</h2> <p>Comcast is threatening to scupper Rupert Murdoch\u2019s fairytale ending with Disney. The cable and media group is plotting to make a knockout bid for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/23/comcast-prepares-to-top-disney-52bn-bid-for-21st-century-fox\" title=\"\">21st Century Fox\u2019s</a> entertainment assets, which Murdoch has agreed to sell to Disney. Murdoch\u2019s Fox is a lucrative business, with assets spanning the <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Deadpool</em> franchises to a 39% stake in Sky and a 30% stake in US streaming service Hulu. Disney\u2019s $52bn all-stock deal appealed to Murdoch more than Comcast\u2019s original cash offer last year, which was 16% higher but raised questions over regulatory and tax hurdles.</p> <p>But Comcast is not so easily deterred. It already has a \u00a322bn offer tabled for Sky itself that would make it the world\u2019s largest pay-TV company. Like Disney, however, Comcast has its eyes on global expansion and the rise of Netflix \u2013 which means taking a tilt at the wider Fox group.</p> <p>Disney, meanwhile, needs Fox to supercharge its belated entry into the world of streaming, having already pulled its immense film catalogue \u2013 from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Toy Story</em> \u2013 off Netflix in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/08/netflix-amazon-nerves-disney-streaming-service\" title=\"\">in preparation for its own streaming service</a>. Because Disney already owns 30% of Hulu, Fox\u2019s stake would give it control of two outlets over which to spread its vast entertainment fare.</p> <p>However, Comcast also owns major assets including the maker of <em>Downton</em> <em>Abbey</em> and <em>Made in Chelsea </em>as well as Pixar rival DreamWorks, creator of <em>Shrek</em> and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>, and Universal Studios. It is well aware of the need for lots of content in a world dominated by streaming. Comcast spies global reach: only 9% of its revenues come outside the US, and pay-TV in its home market is hitting saturation and facing decline. Taking over Sky would make that 25% overnight.</p> <p>The strategic rationales for Comcast or Disney buying Fox are both strong. Both will have to dig deeper in order to win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b28d9c04ab43db376b5c1e362f07ff75faa65b2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b28d9c04ab43db376b5c1e362f07ff75faa65b2b/66_67_2987_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Smith: sceptical about the index\u2019s value.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Smith: sceptical about the index\u2019s value.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FTSE 100 is no guide to UK economy\u2019s health</h2> <p>How bad can things be?
