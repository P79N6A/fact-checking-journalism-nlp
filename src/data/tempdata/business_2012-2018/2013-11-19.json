      "body": "<p><strong>Let\u2019s talk about JP Morgan!</strong></p> <p>Again!</p> <p><strong>Exactly. First <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/easy-street/jp-morgans-loss-explainer\">the London Whale</a>, now this. I hear about JP Morgan scandals more often than I talk to my mom. What\u2019s happening with JP Morgan today?</strong></p> <p>First, your priorities seem screwed up. You really need to call your mom more often, because there is really just no excuse.</p> <p>Second, this is a whale-free development. This all comes down to JP Morgan paying penalties for everything it did wrong with mortgages during the financial crisis. Some of that was at JP Morgan itself, and most of it was at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two banks that JP Morgan bought in 2008.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/19/jp-morgan-record-fine-settlement-mortgages\">JP Morgan is paying, in total, penalties of $13bn</a>, which is the biggest fine a bank has ever paid.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m not easily impressed, but $13bn sounds like all the money in the world.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a lot, even in terms of a big bank, but there are two reasons that JP Morgan would pay so much. The first is that the bank is getting a bargain compared to what dozens of lawsuits would cost if they kept dragging on, not to mention <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303796404579097503061835742\">the damage that would be inflicted on its stock price if the Justice Department decided to sue</a>.</p> <p>The second reason is that JP Morgan can afford it. The bank has revenues of $21bn a year, and over $2tn of assets. In fact, during the three months of negotiations, JP Morgan was initially going to pay $9bn, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=229599073\">then that was upgraded to $11bn</a>, and now it\u2019s $13bn. That can only happen because JP Morgan has such deep pockets.</p> <p><strong>Is all that $13bn going to the same place? All for the same thing?</strong></p> <p>No, it\u2019s going to be broken up into buckets. JP Morgan is in trouble with so many different investors and regulators that it was more convenient to lump them together into one \u201cglobal\u201d settlement. But the profits will be split differently.</p> <p><strong>Discuss.</strong></p> <p>Well, here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/November/13-ag-1237.html\">how the Justice Department divvies it up</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOf the record-breaking $13 billion resolution, $9 billion will be paid to settle federal and state civil claims by various entities related to RMBS. Of that $9 billion, JPMorgan will pay $2 billion as a civil penalty to settle the Justice Department claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), $1.4 billion to settle federal and state securities claims by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), $515.4 million to settle federal and state securities claims by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), $4 billion to settle federal and state claims by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), $298.9 million to settle claims by the State of California, $19.7 million to settle claims by the State of Delaware, $100 million to settle claims by the State of Illinois, $34.4 million to settle claims by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and $613.8 million to settle claims by the State of New York.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4ef6c2dd-2a33-4923-9202-38c0ffe89f5d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384895092625/65b30434-f337-4877-8905-8c4fdce02909-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, looking rather pleased with himself.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

Why so much to them?</strong></p> <p>The FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> <p><strong>I hear about Fannie and Freddie but I\u2019m not quite sure what they do. How did they fall in with JP Morgan?</strong></p> <p>They do a lot of different things, but the most important is this: Fannie and Freddie are the middlemen between regular consumers who sign up for mortgages and banks. Fannie and Freddie\u2019s main jobs are to keep mortgages affordable for regular people, and they do that by guaranteeing some of the risk that banks take on when they buy mortgages. If you\u2019re interested in the full history \u2013 complete with FDR and the New Deal \u2013 you <a href=\"http://hnn.us/article/1849\">can see here</a>.</p> <p>Ever since the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie are wards of the government. The FHFA is their godfather. The FHFA said that JP Morgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual dumped $33bn of bad mortgages on Fannie and Freddie without being clear about how bad the mortgages were. JP Morgan didn\u2019t admit that it misled Fannie and Freddie. It is paying the fine <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303615304579157931846055864\">to wrap the whole thing up</a>.</p> <p><strong>Paying a $5.1bn fine to get rid of $33bn of bad mortgages is a pretty sweet deal, though. I mean, why aren\u2019t they responsible for the whole $33 billion?</strong></p> <p>You\u2019re right in one respect: JP Morgan could have been on the hook for even more. Overall it is paying just about 6.2% of its losses, according to <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/18/breaking-down-j-p-morgans-latest-settlement/\">this smart WSJ analysis</a>.</p> <p>But, but, but: the key concept here is that JP Morgan didn\u2019t admit wrongdoing. So it\u2019s $33bn worth of&#xa0;allegedly&#xa0;misleading Fannie and Freddie. It\u2019s a kind of official-guilt discount.</p> <p><strong>Hmmph.</strong></p> <p>Welcome to the world of government settlements. Still, it\u2019s a pretty good score for the FHFA. Usually banks don\u2019t pay fines that big for something they can get out of, legally.</p> <p><strong>So you said there were other buckets. Is any of this money going to, I don\u2019t know, real people who were hurt in the mortgage crisis?</strong></p> <p>Yes, about $4bn is going to homeowners. <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/justice-department-poised-to-announce-mortgage-deal-with-jpmorgan/?ref=business&amp;_r=0\">Half of that is going to people who were hurt </a>when they were unfairly foreclosed on.</p> <p>The other half, per the New York Times, \u201cJPMorgan has agreed to reduce interest rates on existing loans, offer new loans to low-income home buyers and keep those loans on its books. The bank will also receive credit for demolishing abandoned homes and other efforts focused on curbing urban blight.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-56ef2810-f8f3-410a-b049-e0731036395e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384895202093/adcbd7c7-c3e6-4bb7-9b84-5beb542de0b5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"People pass a sign for JP Morgan's Manhattan headquarters.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People pass JPMorgan's Manhattan headquarters, worried they might be asked to pitch in on the settlement. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Okay, that makes me feel better. Will that money actually go to homeowners, however? I mean, I know they said it would, but what kind of impact will that really have?</strong></p> <p>The sad part is that, if history is any indication, the impact will be 1) hard to measure and 2) falling short of expectations. Remember the $25bn national settlement with five banks last year? The banks settled charges that they used bad paperwork. So far, those banks have \u201cfulfilled only 80% of their obligations,\u201d to homeowners, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/business/fewer-homeowners-than-expected-helped-by-mortgage-settlement.html\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Now, that\u2019s not dire \u2013 it means that they\u2019re $15.5bn of the way through on the $19bn they owe homeowners. But the other part of the settlement that was meant for states to distribute to homeowners <a href=\"http://community-wealth.org/content/states-fall-short-help-housing-six-months-after-mortgage-settlement-less-half-states-25\">did not go that way</a>.</p> <p><strong>Okay, so that\u2019s $5.1bn and another $4bn of today\u2019s settlement accounted for, so $9bn. What\u2019s the last $4bn going towards?</strong></p> <p>Well, one report says $2bn is going to \u201cprosecutors in Sacramento\u201d, according to one account, and another roughly $2bn is going to credit unions in a few states as well as the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman, and the attorney general of California, Kamala Harris <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/justice-department-poised-to-announce-mortgage-deal-with-jpmorgan/?ref=business&amp;_r=0\">as well as a few others here and there</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m sorry, Sacramento is getting $2bn? Just Sacramento? What on earth?</strong></p> <p>Fun fact: it\u2019s actually Sacramento that started all this. The prosecutors in Sacramento were the first to make the case against JP Morgan in August, and then the Justice Department in Washington got wind of it, and then the other regulators piled on.</p> <p>And yes, that\u2019s quite a chunk of change: <a href=\"http://www.cityofsacramento.org/finance/budget/approved-budget-2013-14/FY2013-14.cfm\">Sacramento\u2019s entire operating budget this year is just $838.6 million</a>, which makes the settlement money huge.&#xa0;But that money is really going to the Justice Department, which will likely deposit it with the US Treasury.</p> <p><strong>Poor Sacramento. All that work and then the money goes to Washington.</strong></p> <p>Yeah. But you know, their salaries come from Washington ultimately, so.</p> <p><strong>Right. And August. Jeez. I was practically teething when these settlement talks started. Now I\u2019m growing a silvery beard. Listen, while we\u2019re chatting, can you explain how this whole bundling-mortgages thing works?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s pretty easy to understand, actually, even though it has a pompous name: securitization.</p> <p>It\u2019s easiest if you think of apples. When you sign up for a mortgage, it\u2019s like signing up to give your bank a whole apple. It used to be that one bank \u2013 the one you signed up for a mortgage from \u2013 would hold on to the apple until you paid it off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7e10ae60-fc22-4b93-8617-649b880a3390\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/24/1382621261314/Gardens-apples-008.jpg\" alt=\"Gardens: apples\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It's a metaphor. Photograph: gardenworldimages.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if you miss your payments, what happens? That shiny mortgage apple starts rotting. Banks didn\u2019t want rotten apples filling up their vaults, which would create slime and leave no room for fresh, clean apples.</p> <p>So all the banks started bundling the mortgage apples, by throwing them in a barrel together. Then they ran the mortgage apples through a giant slicer and selling buckets of the apple slices to other banks.</p> <p><strong>Mmm, I didn\u2019t have lunch. Apples sound tasty. But mortgages aren\u2019t tasty. Why would the banks go to all this trouble if they didn\u2019t even get lunch out of it?</strong></p> <p>The benefit of that method of approaching mortgages \u2013 the bundling and slicing \u2013 is that if any apple pieces rotted, they would be smaller slices and not whole apples. One bad slice wouldn\u2019t ruin the whole basket.</p> <p>But there are drawbacks. For one thing, some banks sold baskets of mortgage apples without making it clear just how many of those slices were getting ready to go bad. That\u2019s mostly what this mortgage settlement is about. The other problem is that once you have these barrels of apple slices, it\u2019s really hard to tell who held all the original apples. So the banks couldn\u2019t follow the paperwork back to your specific apple, because the slices were all over the place. So the banks were just foreclosing on apple slices and hoping they were right.</p> <p><strong>You can\u2019t foreclose on an apple.</strong></p> <p>You get the idea.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tie Rack is to begin closing its 44 UK stores, threatening the loss of up to 200 jobs. The closures mark the end of the neckwear specialist's tricky 30-year existence. It has been in gradual retreat since its 90s heyday, when it had 450 shops, as men's fashion has changed and competition has intensified. The chain was launched in the 80s, when most men working in offices and attending special events wore ties. But open necked shirts are now so normal that even the prime minister is often pictured tieless. In recent years just a fifth of the chain's sales have been men's ties. All of Tie Rack's high street stores will close, while some of its handful of outlets in airports will also be shut down. A spokesman said: \"Following a period of prolonged decline in Tie Rack's fortunes, it is with regret that we today announce this closing down sale. Management are working with staff to provide support during this difficult time.\" The closing-down sale is expected to begin on Wednesday, with UK shops due to shut their doors for good by the end of the year. The closures follow the collapse into administration of film and games rental chain Blockbuster and shoe retailer Barratts in recent weeks which have put about 2,000 jobs at risk in the weeks before Christmas. Online fashion store My-wardrobe also restructured via a pre-pack administration. Like those stores, Tie Rack faces structural challenges beyond the squeeze on consumer spending caused by the economic downturn. Industry experts said Tie Rack had not moved with the times. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analysts Conlumino, said: \"Tie Rack did well in the 1980s consumer boom but it's very out of sync with the way people shop now. Men get their ties where they buy their shirts and there is nothing to differentiate Tie Rack, such as high quality or any brand attribute, that would really put it on consumers' radar.\" The Fingen Group, Tie Rack's Italian owner, has appointed the accountancy firm Grant Thornton to look for prospective buyers for around 30 overseas stores but will retain ownership of the brand online. Tie Rack was founded in 1981 by South African entrepreneur Roy Bishko. When the retailer floated on the stock exchange six years later it received \u00a31bn worth of applications for just \u00a312.5m in shares. It has been in decline since 1998. Accounts for last year show a pre-tax loss of \u00a36.8m on sales of \u00a368.1m.",

Pre-tax profits rose 51% to \u00a3478m and \u00a3308m is being paid in ordinary and special dividends. It makes you wonder why easyJet didn't abolish the scrum earlier. The short answer is that so-called \"free\" seating was regarded as one of the holy commandments laid down by Southwest Airlines, the US no-frills pioneer: random seating was deemed the quickest way to fill a plane and thus achieve quick turnarounds. But, as easyJet has shown, the theory was not supported by evidence. Punctuality hasn't suffered.

Pre-tax profits rose 51% to \u00a3478m and \u00a3308m is being paid in ordinary and special dividends.</p> <p>It makes you wonder why easyJet didn't abolish the scrum earlier. The short answer is that so-called \"free\" seating was regarded as one of the holy commandments laid down by Southwest Airlines, the US no-frills pioneer: random seating was deemed the quickest way to fill a plane and thus achieve quick turnarounds.</p> <p>But, as easyJet has shown, the theory was not supported by evidence. Punctuality hasn't suffered. Easyjet, and Ryanair, soon to switch to allocate seating, could have written the necessary computer algorithm a decade ago.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It would be cruel, but no exaggeration, to say that a \"root and branch\" review of the Co-op Group's governance would have been a good idea at any point in the past quarter of a century. It should not have required the blow-up of the bank, and now the allegations against its former chairman Paul Flowers, to persuade the Co-op to look in the mirror. The various re-groupings and defensive mergers within the movement should have been the cue. The main point the Co-op should now recognise is that management by committee \u2013 or rather, dozens of committees \u2013 rarely serves an organisation well. In the Co-op's case, the sprawl of area and regional committees seems to have bred a culture of cliques and cronyism. At the top of this structure sits a group board consisting of 20 non-executive directors, 15 elected from the regional boards and five appointed by independent co-operative societies. There are at least three practical faults with such a main board. First, 20 directors is too many to be effective. Second, if the only way onto the board is by climbing the Co-op's greasy pole, the culture is bound to be inward-looking and lack checks and balances. Third, a board consisting solely of non-executives will tend to lack front-line expertise; Flowers, a small-time Labour councillor dispatched to chair the bank in 2010 even though he had no senior banking experience, was the crowning example. A conventional board containing both executives and non-executives would be a useful way for the Co-op to start to reform. And, crucially, the non-execs should include some independent outsiders. A useful template could be the board of John Lewis \u2013 another democratic organisation, but one which has always stressed the need to remain commercially competitive. John Lewis has a chairman who appoints five executive directors; another five are elected by the partners; and there are three non-executives from outside. It seems to work well. Equal culpability for Flowers's appointment lies with the regulator. The Financial Services Authority, succeeded by the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, had many warnings of the perils of allowing non-bankers to be chairmen of banks. Northern Rock was chaired by Matt Ridley, a scientist and journalist; Royal Bank of Scotland was led by Sir Tom McKillop, who had been a successful chief executive of pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca but was not a banker; and HBOS also had a non-banker in the chair in the form of Lord Stevenson, who didn't spot the storm clouds gathering in 2008. Three times is a trend, they say, so alarm bells should have sounded when Flowers was proposed at Co-op Bank in 2010. Instead, the appointment was rubber-stamped and Flowers was allowed to remain in post even when the bank was trying to buy 632 branches from Lloyds under the so-called Verde transaction. That deal clearly worried regulators. Andrew Bailey, head of the PRA, said this to MPs earlier this year: \"Towards the end of 2011 we made it clear to [the Co-op] that \u2026 it was not clear to us that Co-op Banking Group [the group] had the ability to transform itself successfully and sustainably into an organisation on the scale that would result from acquiring the Verde assets.\" If that was Bailey's damning view of the Co-op Bank's capabilities, why was he satisfied that Flowers should remain as chairman? \"Manifestly unsuitable\" \u2013 Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie's description of Flowers \u2013 applied even before the hard drug, and now pornography, allegations. The PRA must explain why it didn't intervene.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Justice ministers have rejected the offer on Tuesday of a \u00a324.1m \"credit note\" by the private security firm G4S after it admitted that overcharging on its contract for the electronic monitoring of thousands of offenders has been going on for years. Whitehall sources say that ministers are still assessing with auditors the full scale of the overbilling by the two firms involved, G4S and Serco, and are determined to secure a full refund for the taxpayer. The admission by one of the government's largest suppliers came just 24 hours before G4S and other outsourcing giants Serco, Atos and Capita are due to be grilled by the powerful Commons public accounts committee on Wednesday on the failings of outsourcing public sector contracts. The Serious Fraud Office started a full-scale criminal investigation earlier this month into both companies over their justice ministry contracts. G4S had disputed the justice ministry's claim until this week's admission and offer of apology and a credit note. The \u00a324.1m offered also raises the previous estimate of \u00a315m-\u00a320m for the final potential overcharging bill by both Serco and G4S to \u00a330m plus. It is thought that as many as 3,000 of the 18,000 offenders that the two companies charged for monitoring on a daily basis were \"phantom\". The company's offer was also made as a memorandum by the National Audit Office for Wednesday's showdown with MPs confirmed that the potentially fraudulent overcharging practices had been going on for years \u2013 since as long ago as 2005. The NAO report also details for the first time how both companies billed for tagging offenders who had already been returned to prison or were never tagged in the first place. Its detailed examples include: \u2022 G4S charged \u00a33,000 for 612 days tagging of an offender who had been sent to prison 20 months earlier. The company had removed the tagging equipment but kept on billing because the court had not provided the relevant paperwork. \u2022 G4S billed the justice ministry for \u00a34,700 for tagging an offender even though his monitoring equipment had been removed 935 days earlier. \u2022 Serco billed \u00a315,500 for almost five years' tagging despite being unable to install its equipment at the offender's address and carried on charging despite checks showing nobody was living there. \u2022 Serco billed the justice ministry four times over for tagging one offender who had been handed four separate court orders for four offences \"rather than one charge for the subject\", said the NAO. A G4S statement said that an external review it had commissioned from law firm Linklaters had established that the security firm \"had wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed\". It added that Linklaters had not identified any evidence of dishonesty or criminal conduct by any G4S employee in relation to overcharging. The overcharging was \"not consistent with the contract or G4S's values\" and credit notes had been issued totalling \u00a323.3m to cover amounts incorrectly billed between 2005 and June 2013. A further \u00a3800,000 credit note is to be issued to cover incorrect bills since then. Serco are in a different position to G4S in that they have co-operated with justice ministry inquiries since July and said they will refund any agreed overcharges. Ashley Almanza, the G4S Group chief executive, said the company's announcement was an important step in setting the matter straight: \"The way in which this contract was managed was not consistent with our values or our approach to dealing with customers. Simply put, it was unacceptable and we have apologised to the ministry of justice,\" Almanza said.",

We maintain our hold recommendation on the shares. <br> </blockquote> <p>Canaccord Genuity was less enthusiastic:</p> <blockquote> We continue to believe that Amec's valuation is up with events. In our view the recent rally in the stock has been driven by the two announcements in UK nuclear: the renewal of the Nuclear Management Partners [consortium where Amec has 36%] contract on Sellafield, and the decision to go ahead with a \u00a316bn new reactor at Hinkley Point. Amec has a leading position in UK nuclear engineering and has been able to generate margins well ahead of the group average, close to 15%. <br> The full year results are due in February. There is the potential for announcements of acquisitions between now and year-end, and if not, a buyback. </blockquote> <p>Amec added 17p to \u00a311.84.</p> <p>But overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 25.45 points lower at 6698.01, awaiting Wednesday's US Federal Reserve minutes and amid comments from various members of the US central bank which only served to muddy the waters about when it might start tapering its $85bn a month bond buying programme. On top of that, sentiment was dented by negative remarks about equities from US investment guru Carl Icahn. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote> A slightly more cautious approach has been the watchword today for European markets after last night's comments from billionaire investor Carl Icahn about his concerns about the sustainability of the current rally. As if to emphasis the concerns about a lacklustre global economic outlook the OECD downgraded its forecasts for global growth for 2013 and 2014. <br> Investors seem to care less about the fundamentals of the markets and the companies that they invest in, and more about the direction of policy of the central banks, and in particular the Federal Reserve. This exuberance does appear to be starting to be questioned now and that has to be a good thing, particularly given the gains we have seen so far this year when set against a backdrop of weak or negative GDP growth. </blockquote> <p>Testing group <strong>Intertek</strong> was among the main fallers, down 79p to \u00a331.02 after a disappointing update.

      "bodyText": "As markets paused for breath after recent rises, Amec bucked the downward trend after an upbeat trading statement. The engineering group said it was on course to meet expectations for full year profits, it had a strong pipeline of potential acquisitions, but it would consider returning cash to shareholders if it did not find the right purchase. A strong performance from the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico lifted its performance, just a couple of months after it revised down its revenue targets due to weakness in its mining division. Analyst Gavin Jago at Shore Capital said: The target of 100p of earnings in 2014 has been reiterated again in this...statement, leaving the shares trading on a prospective 11.7 times PE ratio, which does not seem expensive, in our view. We maintain our hold recommendation on the shares. Canaccord Genuity was less enthusiastic: We continue to believe that Amec's valuation is up with events. In our view the recent rally in the stock has been driven by the two announcements in UK nuclear: the renewal of the Nuclear Management Partners [consortium where Amec has 36%] contract on Sellafield, and the decision to go ahead with a \u00a316bn new reactor at Hinkley Point. Amec has a leading position in UK nuclear engineering and has been able to generate margins well ahead of the group average, close to 15%. The full year results are due in February. There is the potential for announcements of acquisitions between now and year-end, and if not, a buyback. Amec added 17p to \u00a311.84. But overall the FTSE 100 finished 25.45 points lower at 6698.01, awaiting Wednesday's US Federal Reserve minutes and amid comments from various members of the US central bank which only served to muddy the waters about when it might start tapering its $85bn a month bond buying programme. On top of that, sentiment was dented by negative remarks about equities from US investment guru Carl Icahn. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A slightly more cautious approach has been the watchword today for European markets after last night's comments from billionaire investor Carl Icahn about his concerns about the sustainability of the current rally. As if to emphasis the concerns about a lacklustre global economic outlook the OECD downgraded its forecasts for global growth for 2013 and 2014. Investors seem to care less about the fundamentals of the markets and the companies that they invest in, and more about the direction of policy of the central banks, and in particular the Federal Reserve. This exuberance does appear to be starting to be questioned now and that has to be a good thing, particularly given the gains we have seen so far this year when set against a backdrop of weak or negative GDP growth. Testing group Intertek was among the main fallers, down 79p to \u00a331.02 after a disappointing update. The company said ten month revenues grew by 7.6%, but this had slowed to 5% in the four months between July and October. It said: The industry-wide headwinds experienced in the first half of the year have persisted into the second half. The weakness of the minerals market and challenging conditions in Europe have continued, alongside lower growth in the industrial inspection market following two years of exceptionally high growth. News of the $95m acquisition of North American certification business Architectural Testing did little to limit the damage. Heading the other way was easyJet, up 89p to \u00a313.45 after a 51% rise in pretax profits to \u00a3478m beat expectations and it revealed plans to return \u00a3175m to shareholders through a special dividend. G4S rose 3.3p to 260.1p after it agreed to pay back around \u00a324m to the UK government for overbilling on its electronic tagging contracts. The outsourcing group, along with rival Serco, was alleged to have charged for prisoners who were not tagged or in extreme cases, were actually dead. After an independent review by Linklaters, G4S said it had wrongly billed for monitoring services in some cases \"when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed.\" The company has also apologised to the Ministry of Justice, but it said the review found there was no evidence of dishonesty or criminal conduct. It has issued credit notes worth \u00a324.1m, and has paid \u00a32m for the external investigation. Analyst Kean Marden at Jefferies said: In our view, this issue is nearing its endgame and, after the Bill Crothers report [the review of 29 G4S and Serco contracts] is published this side of Christmas, both companies will be permitted to bid for public sector contracts again. According to Capita, the Cabinet Office is \"distressed\" by developments at Serco and G4S and wants them \"back in the fold and bidding\". Babcock and Mitie have also hinted at a warmer relationship towards the outsourcers as disputes are delaying reform and savings.

Its full year like for like sales fell by 2.9%, hit by cold weather in the first half and the poor consumer environment. But fourth quarter sales provided a positive sign, edging up 0.6%, while growth had continued in the first seven weeks of the new financial year. Overall profits fell 11.7% to \u00a3121m, in line with expectations, while debt fell by \u00a3216m to \u00a32.5bn. Ted Tuppen, who founded Enterprise in 1991, announced plans to step down as chief executive next February and leave the group in May.

But he will now go immediately, and is taking responsibility for appointing the disgraced Paul Flowers to chair the bank three years ago. Wardle is expected to keep receiving his \u00a3145,000 fee until May.</p> <p>Flowers, currently suspended from his position at the Methodist church and his cherished membership of the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a>&#xa0;party, has been&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/17/co-operative-bank-chairman-drugs-paul-flowers\">videoed handing cash to pay for drugs</a>.</p> <p>The new temporary chairman of the Co-op Group \u2013 which has a presence in every postcode in the country through its supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes \u2013 was named as Ursula Lidbetter, currently deputy chair. She will now lead an ongoing review into the way the Co-op is structured after starting at the group as a buyer and department store manager in Lincoln. She has been chief executive of the local co-operative since 2004 and was the first woman to head that organisation.</p> <p>\"These are very difficult times for the Co-operative Group and the wider movement, but I believe that we can and will come through this period stronger than ever by facing up to our challenges,\" she said.</p> <p>The Flowers' scandal has put fresh focus on the way the Co-op is run and its links to the Labour party at a time when its bank is desperately trying to raise \u00a31.5bn to stave off collapse.</p> <p>The group is ceding control of the bank to bondholders, led by two US hedge funds. But bondholders, including 15,000 retail investors, have to agree to the rescue and accept losses on their bonds by the end of the month if the plan is to succeed.</p> <p>Many of the problems at the Co-op bank have been linked to the merger with Britannia building society in 2009 \u2013 now responsible for \u00a3550m of bad loans at the banks. But David Anderson, the head of the Co-op financial services division at the time of that transaction, put up a robust defence of the deal at an appearance before the Treasury select committee, insisting the two entities were stronger together than apart.</p> <p>The Britannia deal \"was not enough to bring down the bank\", Anderson, now a non-executive director at John Lewis, said on at least three occasions. \"It contributed to the current situation,\" but on its own was not to blame for the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall that the Bank of England has identified.</p> <p>Anderson, a one-time boss of Yorkshire Building Society, also said he disagreed \"with anyone who says this undermines the mutual financial model of business\".</p> <p>Flowers chaired the bank until June when he left just as the scale of the problems emerged and Wardle said he was leaving because he had been in overall charge when the methodist minister was appointed in March 2010.</p> <p>Wardle said: \"The recent revelations about the behaviour of Paul Flowers, the former chair of the Co-operative Bank, have raised a number of serious questions for both the bank and the group. I led the board that appointed Paul Flowers to lead the bank board and under those circumstances I feel that it is right that I step down now, ahead of my planned retirement in May next year.\"</p> <p>Warlde has already said his successor should come from outside the co-operative movement, which currently requires its 20-strong board to comprise members of the mutual organisation. \"I have already made it clear that I believe the time is right for real change in our operations and our governance and the board recently started a detailed review of our democracy. I hope that the group now takes the chance to put in place a new democratic structure so we can modernise in the interests of all our members,\" Wardle said.</p> <p>Flowers' personal problems emerged after he had appeared before MPs on the select committee and boasted about his links to the Labour party, which he joined at 16. He discussed how he had been involved in sanctioning a donation by the Group \u2013 not the bank \u2013 to the office of Ed Balls, the most prominent Co-op MP.&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/19/labour-urged-return-co-op-donation-paul-flowers\">The Labour party is now being urged to return the \u00a350,000 Co-op Group donation</a>.

This follows a 5.4% year-on-rise in sales during September, as this graph shows:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f9873e6c-f3a2-4574-9cd8-55d24866c8c9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384844177158/e8fde3dd-cb9d-4a63-b1bf-b2dbf3fea362-460x258.png\" alt=\"European car sales, to October 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"258\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: /ACEA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Spanish</strong>&#xa0;car sales were the stand-out performer -- up 34% year-on-year, from 45,000 in October 2012 to 60,000 last month.

So I'm going to shut up. The lunchtime summary is here, with full details of the Co-op's ongoing crisis, the OECD's new global forecasts, and those positive European car sales. And our latest report on the deadlock in Greece is here. I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW Europe's stock markets have closed, with the main indices all down. FTSE 100: down 25 points at 6698, -0.4% German DAX: down 32 points at 9193, -0.35% French CAC: down 48 points at 4272, -1.12% Spanish IBEX: down 153 points at 9,629, - 1.5% Italian FTSE MIB: down 338 points at 18,766. -1.7% The Dow Jones index, meanwhile, is all but flat. Here's a flavour of IG's closing market note: UK markets easyJet has posted some great figures, with full-year profits up 51% and coming in at the top of analysts\u2019 expectations. This is all the more impressive when compared to the truly terrible numbers announced by bitter rival Ryanair. Gloating rights belong to Stelios this year, as Michael O\u2019Leary watches him pocket his slice of the \u00a3175 million extra dividend. US markets Any investment guru who has created a $20 billion personal fortune from investing in the markets is worth listening to, and Carl Icahn\u2019s words of caution about over-valuation in the equity markets look to have been taken to heart by US investors. Coinciding with these comments, all three of the major US indices are nearing big psychological levels, giving investors every reason to pause and reassess. Yesterday's 'risk-off' mentality might not last long, as Thursday is pencilled in as the day when dovish Janet Yellen will be confirmed as the next Fed Chairwoman. But before that, President Obama is speaking at a Wall Street event tonight. He is not expected to come out with any surprises, but he wouldn\u2019t be the first politician to spook the markets by saying something out of left-field. Back on the Co-op crisis, former City minister Paul Myners has welcomed early departure of chairman Len Wardle as \"laudable\", and said regulators had fallen \"far short\" of meeting the highest standards in their oversight of Co-op Bank. Speaking on Radio 4's The World At One, Myners also suggested that the US hedge funds who forced the Co-op Group to surrender majority control of the bank in return for supporting its capital raising may now be having second thoughts. I think there is some risk that the hedge funds might be sitting back now and saying: ''Have we struck as good a deal as we thought we had. Should we actually renegotiate?\" The interview is online here (that quote comes at the end) Over in Greece tortuous negotiations between the government and visiting mission chiefs representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF appear to be deadlocked today. There's little hope that a deal can be reached in time for the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers in early December. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: \u201cTotal impasse\u201d is how one well-placed official put it this afternoon. From the size of the budget black hole Greece will face next year to repossessing the homes of those who owe more than \u20ac200,000 to the bank, the two sides were well and truly \u201cmiles apart.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re conducting marathon around-the-clock talks but it\u2019s unlikely that an agreement can be reached before the next [December 9th] euro group,\u201d he said. Although consensus was growing on the extent of the fiscal gap, which the Greek finance ministry insists will be much smaller than the almost \u20ac3bn euro estimated by the troika, differences remain on ways to plug it. Athens' argument that structural reforms will be enough to make up for it have been poo-pooed by the foreign lenders along with claims that the lost revenue can be made up by adjusting social security funds and more robust tax collection. Insiders say the biggest difference, however, remains lifting the ban on home foreclosures \u2013 an especially sensitive issue given the growing poverty levels in Greece. Government officials fear that rather than hitting \u201cstrategic defaulters\u201d who voluntarily cut off mortgage payments to banks, it will be vulnerable Greeks no longer able to afford instalments who will be affected most. In a rare moment of pique, the usually mild-mannered development minister, Kostis Hadzidakis, is believed to have \u201cread the riot act\u201d to the troika telling officials that, without prior acceptance by parliament, the measure would never pass. Greece's Kathimerini is also reporting that a deal is unlikely before the eurogroup meeting on December 9th, while the MNI news agency is also hearing that the troika still isn't convinced by Athens' figures. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras, meanwhile, is in Cyprus attending the state funeral of the island's former president, Glafcos Clerides. He's due in Berlin to meet Angela Merkel on Friday... Heads-up: European Central Bank vice president Vitor Constancio has spoken about the possibility of the ECB embarking on a full-blown quantitative easing bond-buying programme to stimulate the euro economy. QE hasn't been discussed \"in any detail\" though, he added. Reuters has the quotes: 19-Nov-2013 14:57 - ECB'S CONSTANCIO - QUANTITATIVE EASING IS A POSSIBILITY, BUT HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED IN ANY DETAIL 19-Nov-2013 14:58 - ECB'S CONSTANCIO - EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE, HAVE NOTHING TO ADD TO WHAT PRAET SAID ON QE (last week ECB executive board member Peter Praet floated the idea that the ECB could used QE to bring inflation closer to its target) 19-Nov-2013 14:58 - ECB'S CONSTANCIO - HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IMPACT OF NEGATIVE DEPOSIT RATES, ALL POLICY DECISIONS INVOLVE TRADE-OFFS 19-Nov-2013 14:59 - ECB'S CONSTANCIO - ALL INSTRUMENTS ARE ON THE TABLE Many analysts have suggested the European Central Bank should launch a aggressive bond-buying programme to kickstart growth in the region. Indeed, the OECD's new report on the global economy this very morning said the ECB should prepare to launch unconventional monetary policy measures. It would be a minefield for the ECB, though. Whose bonds would it buy? And would the German constitutional courts immediately try to block it, as an unacceptable monetisation of one euro zone country's debts by the rest? The Wall Street opening bell has been rung, the market is open, and shares are calm. The Dow Jones is bobbing below the 16,000 mark which it smashed through for the first time ever yesterday (before a late selloff), up just 22 points at 15,998 after 10 minutes trading.. Home Depot is the biggest riser on the Dow after beating profit and sales targets -- suggesting its benefitting from the recovery in the US housing market. Plenty of interesting corporate news stories around today.... \u2022 G4S has apologised after overcharging the Ministry of Justice \u00a323.3m via its contract to electronically tag offenders. It comes as an official report found that the MoJ was billed for months or years after electronic monitoring activity of some individuals had stopped. G4S and Serco will face MPs tomorrow.... \u2022 Paddy Power has warned that profits will miss expectations, after a run of success for punters (basically, too many favourites have been romping home) \u2022 Cut-price supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl are celebrating after winning 6.9% of the UK grocery market in the last 12 weeks. Almost one in three British households took a trip down the Aldi aisles since August. While the OECD has raised its forecast for UK growth next year to 2.5%, from 1.6%, it had less cheering news for Germany. Today's report into the global economy included a call to Berlin to liberalise its service sector and stimulate investment. The OECD also cut its growth forecast for Germany in 2014, from 1.9% to 1.7%. Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist, told Reuters that under-investment in Germany was helping toc cause its current account surplus. \"More investment would be good for Germany in terms of growth but also in terms of demand. Higher investment would address the current account surplus,\" he said, adding that this could be achieved by liberalising the services sector and improving policies that support innovation. \"This would go in the long-term interests of Germany to have a stronger economy. We certainly do not argue for a less competitive Germany.\" The OECD also urged the European Central Bank to consider unconventional monetary policy to stave off deflation. As Padoan put it: Risks of deflation may be slowly increasing...The ECB must be very careful and be prepared to use even non-conventional measures to beat any risk of deflation becoming permanent. Here's economics editor Larry Elliott's analysis: UK economy boosted by cheap money, Help to Buy and consumer spending So, a general round-up of events so far. \u2022 There's a shake-up at Britain's troubled Co-op Group, where the chairman has resigned as the inquiry into the turmoil at the mutual organisation begins. Len Wardle is being replaced, on a temporary basis we understand, by deputy Ursula Lidbetter. Lidbetter will lead the 'root and branch' inquiry into the Group, as the scandal enveloping former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers continues. Here's a few facts about Lidbetter, the CEO of Lincolnshire Co-op. The Labour party is also distancing itself from Flowers over a \u00a350,000 received from the Methodist minister, who has apologised after being filmed apparently buying drugs. \u2022 The inquiry into how Co-op bank lurched into crisis, leaving two US hedge funds calling the shots, continued at parliament. Its former chief exec, David Anderson, repeatedly told MPs that the controversial merger with Britannia did not, on its own, sink the bank. He took responsibility for initiating the deal, and defended those who analysed Britannia's books and concluded it was a good idea. Highlights start here...... and end here. \u2022 The OECD has warned that the global economic is vulnerable, as it cut its forecasts for world growth. It raised its forecasts for the UK ,though, in the latest sign that Britain's economy is picking up speed at last. \u2022 Europe's car sales have picked up, with a 4.8% rise in new registrations year-on-year in October. Spanish sales jumped by a third, while Italy was the only major market to deteriorate. Details start here. \u2022 German investor optimism has hit a four year high. \u2022 Stock markets have fallen in Europe, after investor Carl Icahn warned last night that share prices could see a \"big drop\". Icahn argued that recent corporate profits may not be sustainable. At1pm GST, the main indices were all in the red with the FTSE 100 down 30 points, or 0.5%. France's CAC had dropped 1%. \u2022 EasyJet, though, is flying -- with shares up 8% after reporting a 50% jump in profits and a new special dividend for investors. Jill's been updating her news story on the Co-op with the latest developments, so in lieu of a summary here it is: Co-op Group chairman resigns amid bank boss drugs scandal The crisis at the Co-operative Group deepened on Tuesday when its chairman, Len Wardle, quit abruptly in the wake of allegations about drug taking by the former chairman of its embattled bank. Wardle had intended to leave the post, which he has held since 2007, in May. But he will now go immediately, and is taking responsibility for appointing the disgraced Paul Flowers to chair the bank three years ago. Wardle is expected to keep receiving his \u00a3145,000 fee until May. Flowers, currently suspended from his position at the Methodist church and his cherished membership of the Labour party, has been videoed handing cash to pay for drugs. The new temporary chairman of the Co-op Group \u2013 which has a presence in every postcode in the country through its supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes \u2013 was named as Ursula Lidbetter, currently deputy chair. She will now lead an ongoing review into the way the Co-op is structured after starting at the group as a buyer and department store manager in Lincoln. She has been chief executive of the local co-operative since 2004 and was the first woman to head that organisation. \"These are very difficult times for the Co-operative Group and the wider movement, but I believe that we can and will come through this period stronger than ever by facing up to our challenges,\" she said. The Flowers' scandal has put fresh focus on the way the Co-op is run and its links to the Labour party at a time when its bank is desperately trying to raise \u00a31.5bn to stave off collapse. The group is ceding control of the bank to bondholders, led by two US hedge funds. But bondholders, including 15,000 retail investors, have to agree to the rescue and accept losses on their bonds by the end of the month if the plan is to succeed. Many of the problems at the Co-op bank have been linked to the merger with Britannia building society in 2009 \u2013 now responsible for \u00a3550m of bad loans at the banks. But David Anderson, the head of the Co-op financial services division at the time of that transaction, put up a robust defence of the deal at an appearance before the Treasury select committee, insisting the two entities were stronger together than apart. The Britannia deal \"was not enough to bring down the bank\", Anderson, now a non-executive director at John Lewis, said on at least three occasions. \"It contributed to the current situation,\" but on its own was not to blame for the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall that the Bank of England has identified. Anderson, a one-time boss of Yorkshire Building Society, also said he disagreed \"with anyone who says this undermines the mutual financial model of business\". Flowers chaired the bank until June when he left just as the scale of the problems emerged and Wardle said he was leaving because he had been in overall charge when the methodist minister was appointed in March 2010. Wardle said: \"The recent revelations about the behaviour of Paul Flowers, the former chair of the Co-operative Bank, have raised a number of serious questions for both the bank and the group. I led the board that appointed Paul Flowers to lead the bank board and under those circumstances I feel that it is right that I step down now, ahead of my planned retirement in May next year.\" Warlde has already said his successor should come from outside the co-operative movement, which currently requires its 20-strong board to comprise members of the mutual organisation. \"I have already made it clear that I believe the time is right for real change in our operations and our governance and the board recently started a detailed review of our democracy. I hope that the group now takes the chance to put in place a new democratic structure so we can modernise in the interests of all our members,\" Wardle said. Flowers' personal problems emerged after he had appeared before MPs on the select committee and boasted about his links to the Labour party, which he joined at 16. He discussed how he had been involved in sanctioning a donation by the Group \u2013 not the bank \u2013 to the office of Ed Balls, the most prominent Co-op MP. The Labour party is now being urged to return the \u00a350,000 Co-op Group donation. The Co-op party is regarded as the sister party to the Labour party. Flowers also had a seat on an advisory panel for Labour leader Ed Miliband. [end] So, Mr Anderson, what do you actually take responsibility for? The former CEO of Co-op financial services says he feels responsible for initiating the merger with Britannia, and for overseeing the assessment of whether the deal made sense. He can't take the blame for what happened after 2009. Tyrie points his inquisitorial spotlight at the due diligence (which was a running theme through the grilling), Don't you feel your team let you down when conducted that assessments of Britannia's property loans in 2009, when \"commercial property was falling off a cliff\". Loyally, Anderson says he doesn't. And that's the end of the hearing - highlights start at 10.18am. Andrew Tyrie has the floor again -- and takes David Anderson back to the central question of what went wrong at the Co-op's banking arm. Anderson reiterates that a series of factors were to blame.... the deeper-than-expected recession, the clear 'management stretch' of merging Britannia, the PPI mis-selling bill, the distraction of the Lloyds branch deal.... That bid [for the Lloyds branches] had a very big impact. Tyrie looks a little unimpressed, saying that his committee have seen a string of people over the years saying that the crisis couldn't be predicted and that no-one was really at fault. Anderson sticks to his guns -- that the Britannia losses on their own weren't enough to sink the Co-op bank. It was the additional \u00a3300m of PPI mis-selling provisions, the cost of the bank's IT problems, new capital requirements and the \u00a3100m* lost on the ill-fated chase to buy hundred of Lloyds branches that overwhelmed the Co-op (and created that \u00a31.5bn black hole). * - Anderson points out that the cost of the Project Verde deal has actually gone for good, rather than being a mere loan impairment. Loan impairments are very important, Tyrie shoots back. Did regulators not voice concerns about the Britannia deal? David Anderson says that the regulators did not give any reasons to abort the merger or attach any conditions to it. Are you sure you weren't blind to the warning signs because of your own enthusiasm? Anderson suggests that the analysis, which showed that the combined entity would be safer than either Co-op or Britannia, would actually have been rather attractive to the regulators as well. Back to the Treasury committee hearing, it's the turn of Jesse Norman MP to press David Anderson over the due diligence over the Britannia deal. Norman wants to know who led the various teams of advisers. Anderson says Tim Wise was the head man at JP Morgan, Simon Walker led the KMPG team, but he never met the Deloitte team leader as they were working for the Co-op's pension trustees. Maybe we'll see them in the Thatcher Room soon as MPs drill into the Co-op debacle? Anderson insists that assessments of the Britannia loan book was highly accomplished, claiming that those involved couldn't reasonably have predicted the subsequent deep recession that drove many loans into impairment. Norman isn't convinced, asking if this is a classic case of \"the operation being a complete success, unfortunately the patient died\". Anderson denies it. His position remains that the pre-merger was done competently, that subsequent economic problems couldn't have been predicted, that the \u00a3560m loan impairments on the Britannia side were not, on their own, enough to bring down Co-op bank, and only a fraction of those impairments have led to actual losses. It never rains... new data has shown that the Co-op's supermarket arm suffered declining sale in the last three months, a bigger fall than rivals. The Telegraph's Graham Ruddick sums it up: One passing mention aside, MPs on the Treasury committee have avoided mentioning the disgraced former Co-op bank chairman Paul Flowers (who has apologised after being filmed apparently buying drugs). But elsewhere in Westminster, the Labour party is trying to distance itself from the Methodist minister -after it emerged he'd handed over a \u00a350,000 donation. Press Association reports: Sources insisted he was \"neither influential nor important\" and on Monday the 63-year-old was suspended from the party for bringing it into disrepute following footage that appears to show him buying drugs days after being grilled by the Treasury select committee over the bank's disastrous performance. A Labour source: \"It's true that there was a private meeting with Ed in March of this year. There were two informal dinners - three meetings that we can find records of in the space of three years. \"This shows that Mr Flowers was neither influential nor important.\" David Anderson is making a fairly decent impression on the Treasury committee, I reckon (reminder, there's a livefeed here). George Mudie MP compared him favourably to the bosses at those former mutuals who decided to float on the stock market and embrace higher boardroom pay and the like. You seem to represent the good side of mutuals, Mudie says, \"very very careful, very very sensible\". Anderson bashfully struggles to reply. Pat McFadden MP reminds David Anderson of a speech the former Co-op boss gave after the credit crunch struck, on how the public were ready to embrace a new era of mutualisation in the financial markets. Isn't the role of mutuals in banking under real threat? Anderson laughs wryly at his words being quoted back at him, but he doesn't swallow them. He says that substantial mutuals have an important part of our financial landscape, and \"will continue to do so\". He's arguing that Co-op's woes shouldn't cause permanent damage to the whole sector. Anderson clarifies that JP Morgan's role was to say whether the Britannia merger was a good deal, or not. KPMG's role in the due diligence was narrower (as mentioned at 10.51am, Anderson's own team assessed Britannia's commercial loan book). Brooks Newmark MP homes in on this issue -- saying that \u00a3970m of loan impairments subsequently reported by Co-op Bank comprised \u00a3560m of Britannia distressed loans and \u00a3460m of Co-op ones. Surely that shows that the due diligence of Britannia's loan book was particularly unsatisfactory? Anderson pins some of the blame on regulatory changes, which means that loans were labelled as distressed after 30 days of non-payments not 90 days. He also argued that the 'synergies' from the deal would override some of these problems, adding that only a fraction of the distressed loans have actually crystallised into losses. He's not claiming that everything's rosy,though. Didn't your team blunder when it assessed the Britannia commercial loan book, then? Anderson argues that the work was conducted competently at the time. MPs are asking several questions about the analysis conducted before the Co-op/Britannia deal. Anderson says he sent in his own team to handle the detailed due diligence on the commercial loan book at Britannia, but that other work was handled by various other firms - including KPMG and JP Morgan. So, did you put too much faith in your advisers? No, the board took the decision. We're responsible, says Anderson. We were influenced by 'reputable firms' saying it was a compelling transaction, but in the end we decided to do the deal. So, with hindsight, was the Britannia deal a good idea or a mistake? Anderson agrees that the merger has added to the problems at Co-op Group. However, he still believes it was the right decision at the time based on the information to hand. Was there pressure from the government for the Co-op to merge with Britannia, asks Andrea Leadsom: Anderson insists not, saying the city regulators showed \"healthy scepticism\", adding that he didn't feel any political pressure to get the deal done. Andrea Leadsom MP points out that the Co-op/Britannia merger talks began in 2008, as the financial crisis got underway. Did you recognise that you were in the middle of a financial crisis based on leverage, Leadsom asks: Most definitely, Anderson adds. We were the clearing bank for Northern Rock (which hit trouble in September 2007). We'd seen what could happen. He agrees that 2008 looks like a \"strange time\" to be plotting a bank deal, but insists that both sides took every precaution. David Anderson say he's given a lot of thought to the merits of the Britannia/Co-op merger in 2009. He still thinks the deal could have worked, and that both organisations would have struggled alone. Were you surprised that Britannia was so keen to merge with the Co-op? Anderson says he was initially struck that Britannia's managers were very interested when a merger was proposed, but on reflection attributed this to the fact Britannia faced similar challenges to the Co-op's own financial services arm. How much blame to you take for the disastrous events at the Co-op bank, committee chair Andrew Tyrie asks David Anderson. Anderson says he played a full role in the merger with Britannia. The subsequent 'downfall' was due to several factors, he argued, including problems that developed in the loan books of both organisations, and the amount of management time devoted to implementing the merger: As Anderson put it: As ever when something goes disastrously wrong, it tends to be a series of things that went wrong rather than just one. What about PPI mis-selling, asks Tyrie. Anderson says that the levels of PPI sales fell during his time at the bank. He says he was concerned about these products. So who was driving the policy, demands Tyrie? Most of the sales happened in the early 2000, before I started, so it's hard to tell, Anderson adds. The Co-op set aside another \u00a3100m to cover compensation payments to those who were missold insurance - in one of the biggest scandals in British banking in recent years. Anderson starts by explaining that he left the Co-op's financial services arm when it merged with the Britannia building society. You can only have one CEO, he points out, and says he didn't mind that the Britannia's Neville Richardson got the top job. It was the best decision for the mutual, Anderson says. Back to the Co-op, and the Treasury committee has just begun its hearing with the former chief of its banking arm, David Anderson. It's being streamed live here. MPs want to know what went so wrong at the Co-op's banking arm. In other economic news, investor confidence in Germany has hit a four year high, according to the monthly ZEW index. It found that analysts and business people in the eurozone's largest economy are more upbeat about prospects, partly due to a better economic outlook in the euro area. The OECD's decision to upgrade its forecasts for UK growth has been swiftly welcomed by the Conservatives: The OECD also upgraded its view of Greece's economy, predicting a less severe recession this year. Breaking away from the Co-op briefly, the OECD has just cut its forecast for global economic growth in 2014 to 3.6% of GDP, down from 4%. It warns that the outlook for the global economy has darkened as the prospects for emerging markets deteriorate and the United States approaches another debt deadline early next year. The UK, though, is improving. My colleague Katie Allen writes: Predicting that stronger investment and household spending will drive faster growth, the OECD now forecasts the UK economy will grow by 2.4% in 2014. In May it had forecast 1.5%. That outlook for next year is more optimistic than the 1.9% growthforecast by the International Monetary Fund and 1.8% predicted in March by the the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury's independent forecaster. Full story: Global economy still vulnerable but UK improving, OECD warns Here's City editor Jill Treanor on today's Co-op developments: The crisis at the Co-operative Group deepened on Tuesday when its chairman, Len Wardle, quit abruptly in the wake of allegations about drug taking by the former chairman of its embattled bank. Wardlehad intended to leave the post, which he has held since 2007, in May. But he will now go immediately, and is taking responsibility for appointing the disgraced Paul Flowers to chair the bank three years ago. Flowers, currently suspended from his position at the Methodist Church and his cherished membership of the Labour party, has been videoed handing over cash to buy drugs. The 63-year old has apologised. Here's Jill's full story: Co-op Group chairman resigns amid bank drugs scandal There's a nice profile of the Co-op Group's temporary chair, Ursula Lidbetter, on This is Lincolnshire, in which she talks about her passion for the Co-op's ethical principles. It's about community, we never forget that It explains that in 20 years, she went from a graduate trainee to the top of the Lincolnshire Co-op, becoming the first woman CEO in its history. She's also \"Lincoln born and bred\", having been schooled in the area before studying operational research at the University of Hull. Her talents were in maths and music (she plays the flute, the organ and the piano) \u2013 and poetry was her passion. Poetry is still a big interest \u2013 particularly the works of Tennyson, and she is president of the Lincoln Music And Drama Festival. Len Wardle's immediate resignation from Co-op Group comes just minutes before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee begin questioning the former chief executive of its financial services arm, David Anderson. Anderson will be answering questions about the Co-op's failed bid to buy hundreds of bank branches from Lloyds, which collapsed as the true state of its capital shortfall became clear. The hearing will be streamed live here. Committee member Pat McFadden is concerned about the whole future of mutual groups in the UK banking sector: Ursula Lidbetter will only be a temporary replacement for Len Wardle at the head of the Co-op Group. Wardle has already indicated that his successor should be an outsider. Today's statement says Lidbetter will replace Wardle, and \"chair the Group through the current governance review, which will include consideration of how the Board is constituted and chaired\". The Co-op Group's new leader, Ursula Lidbetter joined the organisation almost 30 years ago as a graduate trainee. Following her degree in Operational Research and Management, Ursula joined the co-operative movement\u2019s graduate training scheme in 1984. In 2003 she became a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. The Society has won many awards under her leadership, including Investors in People Gold. Ursula is a passionate advocate for co-operation, having set up the Lincolnshire Co-operative Development Agency in 2003 and been the founding secretary of a local credit union. She is non- executive Chair of the Co-operative Group\u2019s Food Board. Her community roles include chairing Business in the Community East Midlands, Lincoln Business Improvement District, Lincolnshire Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership. Via this biography. The chairman of Britain's Co-operative Group has quit with immediate effect, following the recent revelations involving the former chair of its banking arm, Paul Flowers. The Co-op Group just announced that Len Wardle is being replaced by Ursula Lidbetter, deputy chair of the Group, who is also CEO of the Lincolnshire Co-op. Wardle had been due to step down in May 2014, but is exiting now after the Co-op Bank's former chairman, Paul Flowers, was filmed appearing to buy drugs including cocaine and crystal meth. Last night, the Co-op Group launched a full \"root and branch review\" of its practices - that process will now be managed by Lidbetter. The Co-op Group was already under scrutiny after a \u00a31.5bn black hole led to it losing control of its banking arm, with two US hedge funds now calling the shots. In a statement, Wardle said the Co-op Group needs to change. He said: The recent revelations about the behaviour of Paul Flowers, the former Chair of The Co-operative Bank, have raised a number of serious questions for both the Bank and the Group. I led the Board that appointed Paul Flowers to lead the Bank Board and under those circumstances I feel that it is right that I step down now, ahead of my planned retirement in May next year. \"I have already made it clear that I believe the time is right for real change in our operations and our governance and the Board recently started a detailed review of our democracy. I hope that the Group now takes the chance to put in place a new democratic structure so we can modernise in the interests of all our members.\" Here's the full statement. We'll have a full story shortly Budget airline EasyJet is bucking today's downward trend, soaring gracefully to the top of the FTSE 100 with a 6.2% jump in its share price. It posted strong results this morning, including a 51% leap in pre-tax profits. This means it's hiked its dividend by 55%, and promised shareholders an extra 'special dividend' on top. The figures look even better once you remember that rival Ryanair has delivered two profit warnings this year, and embarked on a new charm offensive to woe people who weren't impressed by its previously, er, robust approach to customer service. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: Easyjet shareholders are in line for a \u00a3308m windfall as profits at the UK's largest budget airline group surged by more than 50%. Chief executive Carolyn McCall said the strong performance of the no-frills airline had been boosted by its decision to introduce allocated seating on its planes. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme she said: \"It's a nice, calmer boarding process, and a lot of people have taken up the option.\" Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of September rose to \u00a3478m, up from \u00a3317m the previous year. Here's the full story: EasyJet shareholders to get windfall after surge in profits Europe's major stock markets are all in the red in early trading, as yesterday's optimism wanes (for now, anyway). Having seen the US Dow Jones and the German DAX hit fresh record highs yesterdays, investors are now fretting about whether the rally is sustainable. Two factors are pushing down shares. 1) Influential investor Carl Icahn warned yesterday that that recent solid corporate results have owed more to the current record low interest rates than to strong management. Markets could be heading for a \"big drop\", he reckons. 2) Charles Plosser, head of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, declared last night that the Fed should set a final target for its bond-buying programme, rather than simply continuing QE until conditions look rosier. That's enough to send the FTSE 100 down 37 points, or 0.5%, to 6685, The German DAX is down 0.4%, while French, Spain and Italy's markets have all dropped by over 0.6%. Traders reckon there's a bit of profit taking this morning. But, as Michael Hewson of CMC puts it: It is getting to the point that investors care less about the fundamentals of the markets and the companies that they invest in, and more about the direction of policy of the central banks, and in particular the Federal Reserve. Speaking of Greece, striking administrative staff have been protesting outside the University of Athens this morning. Here's a photo, via twitter user (and university lecturer) Spyros Gkelis: Workers voted yesterday to hold two more 48-hour strikes, on protest at the Athens government's cuts to the state workforce. Kathimerini has more details: The strikes mean that students and academic staff will not have access to classroom and other facilities. Education Minister Constantinos Arvanitopoulos said that students and parents are being made to suffer unnecessarily due to the dispute between the government and the administrative staff. What else is afoot today? The OECD is releasing its latest forecasts for the global economy at 10am GMT. We also get the monthly ZEW index of German business confidence at the same time - it's expected to show a rise in morale. Stock markets are expected to drop back after yesterday's rally (indeed, the FTSE 100 just opened 0.4% lower). We'll be watching Greece, where talks between the government and the troika over its bailout programme resumed yesterday. No signs of progress yet. And there are reports that Wall Street giant JP Morgan could finally be hit with the long-awaited $13bn penalty later today, to settle claims that it mis-sold bundles of toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis. The 34% jump in Spanish new car registrations in October means that sales for 2013 are finally higher than this stage in 2012, even though the country's economy has been in recession for most of this year. Madrid's car subsidy scheme is credited with driving sales this year. The programme is similar to the scrappage scheme which the previous UK government introduced. So how does it work? Anyone who buys a new car worth up to \u20ac25,000, and part-exchanges an older model (seven to 10-years old) will receive a \u20ac1,000 subsidy. The new car must be more fuel-efficient than the old one, and the dealership has to match the discount. The Spanish government says the programme has been used to buy 300,000 new cars this year -- around half the 606,000 registrations reported. Last month, it announced that it would add \u20ac70m to the scheme, which is the third time the original scheme has been topped up with fresh funds. More details here. While total car sales in Europe during 2013 are down 3.1% , there are some notable differences across the EU. In the Netherlands, for example, new car sales are down 25% this year (yet were +37.4% higher this October than last). German car sales are down 5.2% over the last 10 months, while in France they're down 7.4%. While in Cyprus, the impact of its bailout programme and the imposition of capital controls is clear - just 5,961 cars have been sold this year, a 38.5% slump on last year. On the upside, Portuguese car sales are up 8.1% during 2013, while in the UK they've risen by 10.2% (thanks in part to cheap credit deals). October looks like a decent month for most of the major car makers, after some torrid times. ACEA reports that Toyota Group sales rose 17% year-on-year, followed by Renault's 14.8%. VW Group's sales increased by 5.8% year-on-year last month; while General Motors sales grew 6.5%. However, two big name manufacturers didn't do too well. PSA Group (Peugeot and Citreon) saw sales dip 0.9%. And Fiat suffered a 7.3% decline -- perhaps reflecting the -5.6% decline in the Italian car market during October. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Is the European car market turning the corner? New figures just released show that sales across the EU rose by 4.7% year-on-year in October -- the first time that we've seen two consecutive monthly rises since September 2011. A total of 1,004,935 new cars were registered during the month, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. This follows a 5.4% year-on-rise in sales during September, as this graph shows: Spanish car sales were the stand-out performer -- up 34% year-on-year, from 45,000 in October 2012 to 60,000 last month. That suggests the Madrid government's car subsidy scheme, which lets car buyers save \u20ac1,000 when they trade in an older model, is having an effect. Encouragingly, most of Europe's major market posted growth in October -- with German car sales up 2.3%, France's up 2.6% and the UK up 4.0%. Italy, though, was the laggard - down 5.6% year-on-year. That reflects the fact that the Italian economy remained bogged in recession in the last quarter. The recovery in September and October doesn't make up for some hefty falls during earlier months, though. A total of 10,006,807 new cars have been registered so far in 2013. That means sales during 2013 are still down 3.1% compared to the first 10 months of 2012. And last month remains the second-lowest weakest October on record (last year having been the worst, of course). Most manufacturers posted a rise in demand, with Renault sales up 14.8% year-on-year.

    "webTitle": "EasyJet: allocated seating attracts older passengers and boosts profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Increasing numbers of older, affluent passengers are flying with easyJet, driving profits at the budget airline to record levels and delivering a \u00a3308m windfall to shareholders. The chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said the decision to introduce allocated seating on its flights had drawn in older passengers and business travellers who once shunned the budget airline. \"I think no question there has been an increase in people who refused to even contemplate flying easyJet.\" The average age of an easyJet passenger is now 42, compared with 38 or 39 a few years ago - \"a small but \u2026 significant change\" that reflects changing perceptions of easyJet, McCall said. Many older passengers, especially, \"our parents' generation\", do not want to be in the scrum for boarding, she said. EasyJet's rising fortunes help explain why struggling rival Ryanair has launched a charm offensive to win back customers put off by its reputation for penny-pinching and aggressive customer service. Ryanair, still Europe's largest no-frills carrier, recently announced it was introducing allocated seating, after issuing two profits warnings in two months. But McCall contended that easyJet's main rivals were legacy carriers, where there is more direct competition in the same airports. \"It is about competing with Alitalia, Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa and those are our key markets.\" EasyJet has boomed as a host of regional airlines and legacy national carriers have run into trouble in recent years, reducing the number of players in the market. Small carriers have closed, while British Airways owner International Airlines Group has cut routes, allowing rivals to fill the gaps. EasyJet's offer of allocated seating, as well as declining competition in the European aviation market, helped it to a 51% growth in pre-tax profits. In a set of results that sent its share price up by more than 6% to \u00a313.54, easyJet reported pre-tax profits of \u00a3478m for the year to the end of September, up from \u00a3317m the previous year. Almost 61 million passengers flew with easyJet during the year, including 11 million business customers, a more lucrative group because they book later and are prepared to pay for more leg-room. This helped lift the average profit per seat to \u00a37.03, up from \u00a34.81 in 2012. The strong results put easyJet shareholders \u2013 including controversial company founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou \u2013 in line for a \u00a3308m windfall. The budget airline has promised shareholders a special dividend of \u00a3175m, on top of the ordinary dividend of \u00a3133m, which is paid in line with the company's policy of doling out one third of annual profits to investors. Haji-Ioannou, who holds 36.5% of shares and has repeatedly clashed with easyJet's board this year over plans to buy 135 Airbus jets, can be expected to gain more than \u00a3100m. He described the payout as a victory for shareholders: \"The directors have now accepted that more money has to be returned to the shareholders \u2013 if only they would accept that less cash should go to Airbus for more planes.\" McCall, a former boss of the Guardian Media Group, will also reap rewards: she could take home \u00a33.37m in pay, bonuses and share options in 2013, compared with \u00a33.1m last year. She is credited with improving customer service and cutting costs since she joined the budget airline in 2010. As well as allocated seating and the introduction of speedy boarding, easyJet has overhauled its in-flight menus, offering porridge and fruit salad, as well as the usual coffee and sandwiches. The airline has dropped unprofitable routes, while introducing flights to Moscow and Luxembourg from the UK, and opening a base in Naples. EasyJet plans to launch flights to Strasbourg and Tel Aviv, targeting business and leisure customers. The airline has said it expects capacity to grow by 5% next year, but warned that its next set of quarterly numbers may look subdued against last year, when interest in visiting the UK surged after the Olympics. City analysts cheered the results, which come after easyJet arrived in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies in March. Over the past year easyJet has seen its share price rise 96%, compared with a 20% average rise for the FTSE 100, according to Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. \"EasyJet is maintaining cruising altitude with another set of fine numbers,\" he said.",

    "webTitle": "Half of recent UK graduates stuck in non-graduate jobs, says ONS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Almost half of recent graduates in the UK are in non-graduate jobs, according to official data that has underscored the challenges facing young people entering the labour market. The proportion of recent graduates working in jobs for which a higher educational background is not usually required was 47% this year, up sharply from 39% before the financial crisis struck. Most of the increase has come since the 2008/9 recession, the Office for National Statistics said. Its report on graduates found that people with a degree in medicine or dentistry had the highest employment rate of all graduates, at 95%, followed by those with media and information studies degrees at 93%. Medical graduates also had the highest median pay, at \u00a345,600 a year but media and information studies graduates had the lowest pay of all subject groups, at \u00a321,000. Labour market experts said the high number of recent graduates \u2013 defined as those who left full-time education in the last five years \u2013 who were not in graduate jobs was a worrying sign for the economy. \"The pre-recession rates of underemployment of graduate skills in the UK economy were already disappointing \u2013 the post-recession rates represent an alarming jump in underemployment and a massive waste of investment in skills,\" said John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist consultancy. \"These figures further highlight the plight of young people in the jobs market at present. The fact that the unemployment rate for recent graduates (9%) is much lower than that for non-graduates is due simply to the fact that almost half of those who have recently gained higher education qualifications are entering jobs for which they are over qualified, which makes it even harder for the less qualified to find work.\" Graduates, defined by the ONS as those leaving education with a qualification higher than A-level, were more likely to be employed than those who left education with qualifications of a lower standard, the report said. But the unemployment rate for recent graduates, at 9%, is up from 8% a year ago and well above pre-crsis rates of 5% seen in early 2008. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of the jobs search engine Adzuna, which provides labour market data to David Cameron and No 10, said the number of advertised jobs was rising but job-hunting was still tough for many. \"Despite signs of a wider jobs recovery, the pick-up in the graduate jobs market has been less pronounced,\" he said. \"In the face of fierce competition, many graduates are being forced to take on lower-skilled jobs. Our last jobs report found that there were more than 50 graduates competing for every entry level job in September. Advertised graduate salaries fell 3.4% compared to last September, and our latest data shows graduate vacancies have fallen 19% in the past year to October.\" The ONS said there was still evidence however that going on to higher education can help a young person find a job, with the unemployment rate for non-graduates aged 21 to 30 much higher than for recent graduates at 14%. But the details on who is employing graduates did not bode well for their prospects, economists said. More than 40% of graduates worked in the public administration, education and health industry, the ONS said. Philpott commented: \"The public sector is by far our biggest employer of graduate skills but is currently in the process of major job downsizing. College students expecting investment in higher education to pay them a decent career dividend must therefore hope that our private sector businesses become far more skills intensive in the coming years.\" Industry said students needed to take greater account of the subject choices if they wanted to increase their chances of a private sector job. Steve Radley, director of policy at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: \"We need a concerted effort to get more young people studying the science and engineering degrees that will drive our economy forward and more of them taking up well paid opportunities.\" He pointed out that graduates in engineering are the second highest earners and those in physical sciences \"earn far beyond average\". The ONS said that for graduates who do find work, the earning prospects were better than for their non-graduate peers. \"Annual earnings for graduates increase at a fast pace as they become older and more experienced in the workplace, before levelling out around age 38 at a median of \u00a335,000 a year,\" the report said. In contrast, for those who left education with an A* to C grade GCSE, average earnings level out around age 32 at \u00a319,000 - and for those with A-levels, their pay at age 34 comes in at around \u00a322,000. The data showed a divide between science and arts graduates when it came to employment prospects. After medicine and media studies, the next highest employment rates were for medical-related subjects, such as nursing or midwifery, technology, agricultural sciences and architecture. The employment rate was lowest for those with humanities degrees, at 84%, while arts, languages and education were also among the lowest rates.",

      "body": "<p>Almost half of recent graduates in the UK are in non-graduate jobs, according to official data that has underscored the challenges facing young people entering the labour market.</p> <p>The proportion of recent graduates working in jobs for which a higher educational background is not usually required was 47% this year, up sharply from 39% before the financial crisis struck. Most of the increase has come since the 2008/9 recession, the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lmac/graduates-in-the-labour-market/2013/rpt---graduates-in-the-uk-labour-market-2013.html\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics</a> said.</p> <p>Its report on graduates found that people with a degree in medicine or dentistry had the highest employment rate of all graduates, at 95%, followed by those with media and information studies degrees at 93%.</p> <p>Medical graduates also had the highest median pay, at \u00a345,600 a year but media and information studies graduates had the lowest pay of all subject groups, at \u00a321,000.</p> <p>Labour market experts said the high number of recent graduates \u2013 defined as those who left full-time education in the last five years \u2013 who were not in graduate jobs was a worrying sign for the economy.</p> <p>\"The pre-recession rates of underemployment of graduate skills in the UK economy were already disappointing \u2013 the post-recession rates represent an alarming jump in underemployment and a massive waste of investment in skills,\" said John Philpott, director of <a href=\"http://thejobseconomist.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Jobs Economist</a> consultancy.</p> <p>\"These figures further highlight the plight of young people in the jobs market at present. The fact that the unemployment rate for recent graduates (9%) is much lower than that for non-graduates is due simply to the fact that almost half of those who have recently gained higher education qualifications are entering jobs for which they are over qualified, which makes it even harder for the less qualified to find work.\"</p> <p>Graduates, defined by the ONS as those leaving education with a qualification higher than A-level, were more likely to be employed than those who left education with qualifications of a lower standard, the report said. But the unemployment rate for recent graduates, at 9%, is up from 8% a year ago and well above pre-crsis rates of 5% seen in early 2008.</p> <p>Andrew Hunter, co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.adzuna.co.uk/\" title=\"\">jobs search engine Adzuna</a>, which provides labour market data to David Cameron and No 10, said the number of advertised jobs was rising but job-hunting was still tough for many.</p> <p>\"Despite signs of a wider jobs recovery, the pick-up in the graduate jobs market has been less pronounced,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In the face of fierce competition, many graduates are being forced to take on lower-skilled jobs. Our last jobs report found that there were more than 50 graduates competing for every entry level job in September. Advertised graduate salaries fell 3.4% compared to last September, and our latest data shows graduate vacancies have fallen 19% in the past year to October.\"</p> <p>The ONS said there was still evidence however that going on to higher education can help a young person find a job, with the unemployment rate for non-graduates aged 21 to 30 much higher than for recent graduates at 14%.</p> <p>But the details on who is employing graduates did not bode well for their prospects, economists said. More than 40% of graduates worked in the public administration, education and health industry, the ONS said.</p> <p>Philpott commented: \"The public sector is by far our biggest employer of graduate skills but is currently in the process of major job downsizing. College students expecting investment in higher education to pay them a decent career dividend must therefore hope that our private sector businesses become far more skills intensive in the coming years.\"</p> <p>Industry said students needed to take greater account of the subject choices if they wanted to increase their chances of a private sector job.</p> <p>Steve Radley, director of policy at <a href=\"http://www.eef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">EEF, the manufacturers' organisation</a>, said: \"We need a concerted effort to get more young people studying the science and engineering degrees that will drive our economy forward and more of them taking up well paid opportunities.\"</p> <p>He pointed out that graduates in engineering are the second highest earners and those in physical sciences \"earn far beyond average\".</p> <p>The ONS said that for graduates who do find work, the earning prospects were better than for their non-graduate peers.</p> <p>\"Annual earnings for graduates increase at a fast pace as they become older and more experienced in the workplace, before levelling out around age 38 at a median of \u00a335,000 a year,\" the report said.</p> <p>In contrast, for those who left education with an A* to C grade GCSE, average earnings level out around age 32 at \u00a319,000 - and for those with A-levels, their pay at age 34 comes in at around \u00a322,000.</p> <p>The data showed a divide between science and arts graduates when it came to employment prospects. After medicine and media studies, the next highest employment rates were for medical-related subjects, such as nursing or midwifery, technology, agricultural sciences and architecture. The employment rate was lowest for those with humanities degrees, at 84%, while arts, languages and education were also among the lowest rates.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Private security company G4S has admitted it has overcharged the Ministry of Justice more than \u00a324m on its contract for the electronic monitoring of thousands of offenders in England in a practice that was going on for years. The admission by one of the government's largest suppliers comes just 24 hours before G4S and other outsourcing corporate giants, Serco, Atos and Capita are due to be grilled by the powerful Commons public accounts committee on Wednesday over their failings on public sector contracts. G4S said an external review it had commissioned by the law firm Linklaters had confirmed it had been wrong to consider it was contractually entitled to bill for monitoring offenders when tags had not been fitted or after they had been removed. G4S said it had apologised to the MoJ and issued credit notes for \u00a323.3m that had been incorrectly billed between 2005 and May 2013. A further credit note for \u00a3800,000 is to be issued to cover continued overcharging that has happened since June. The security company said the Linklaters review had not identified \"any evidence of dishonesty or criminal conduct by any employee of G4S in relation to the billing arrangements under the electronic monitoring contracts.\" The G4S statement added that it had \"wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed\". The admission by the company comes after the Serious Fraud Office announced earlier this month that it was launching a criminal investigation into G4S and Serco for overcharging on criminal justice contracts. The G4S statement was timed to coincide with the publication of a National Audit Office memorandum that shows that, in some instances, both contractors were charging the justice ministry for months or years after electronic monitoring activity had stopped.

The NAO also says the firms charged the ministry over similar timescales when electronic monitoring was never undertaken and charged multiple times for the same individual if that person was subject to more than one electronic monitoring order at the same time. Serco has also said it will refund any amount that it agrees represents overcharging. The justice ministry has not yet agreed to any refund offers made by either firm. In July, the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, revealed that G4S and Serco had overcharged the government by \"tens of millions of pounds\" on the tagging contracts.

They include: \u2022 The justice ministry was charged \u00a33,000 for 612 days monitoring of an offender who had been sent to prison for two years 20 months earlier. G4S removed the tagging equipment but kept on billing because the court had not provided the relevant paperwork. \u2022 On 28 October 2010, G4S removed tagging equipment from the address of an offender where a number of breaches of curfew had been reported. The court failed to confirm the tag was no longer required even when chased in December 2012 so billing continued until 20 May 2013. The total bill was \u00a34,700 for 935 days without a tag being in place. \u2022 Serco billed \u00a315,000 for almost five years' monitoring in a case where it was unable to install tagging equipment in July 2008 at an address where the subject was due to be arrested. In October 2010, when Serco visited the property it was told nobody had been living there for 18 months. Ashley Almanza, the G4S Group chief executive, said the company's announcement was an important step in setting the matter straight and restoring trust. \"The way in which this contract was managed was not consistent with our values or our approach to dealing with customers. Simply put, it was unacceptable and we have apologised to the Ministry of Justice,\" Almanza said. \"As part of a wider programme of corporate renewal, we have changed the leadership of our UK business and we are putting in place enhanced risk management and contract controls. \"We remain committed to working with the ministry and the UK government to resolve this matter and to provide enhanced oversight of service delivery and contract performance.\" The MoJ said it was not prepared to comment while a criminal investigation was under way. The Cabinet Office is carrying out a government-wide review of G4S and Serco contracts but G4S said that no evidence had so far come to light that suggested that similar billing practices applied to other government contracts. Both Serco and G4S withdrew from the tendering process for the next generation of electronic tagging. But both companies have been allowed to bid for \u00a3450m-worth of probation contracts but will not be awarded them unless they are given a clean bill of health over the tagging dispute.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The outlook for the global economy has darkened as the prospects for emerging markets deteriorate and the United States approaches another potentially catastrophic debt deadline, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development The thinktank upgraded its outlook for the UK but cut its forecasts for the global economy. The Paris-based group forecast that unemployment would remain stubbornly high in several of its 34 mainly rich countries, that growth would slow in many emerging markets and that there was a significant threat to financial stability from the US Federal Reserve unwinding its stimulus programme \u2013 a process known as tapering. Presenting its global outlook, Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD's deputy secretary-general and chief economist said many parts of the global economy had been left vulnerable by a deep recession and exceptional stimulus packages. \"The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, with some acceleration of growth anticipated in 2014 and 2015. But global growth forecasts have been revised down significantly for this year and 2014, in large part due to weaker prospects in many emerging market economies. Downside risks dominate and policy must address them,\" he said. For the UK, however, the Paris-based thinktank is more optimistic than many other forecasters and has revised up forecasts made in May. Predicting that stronger investment and household spending will drive faster growth, the OECD now forecasts the UK economy will grow by 2.4% in 2014. In May it had forecast 1.5%. That outlook for next year is more optimistic than the 1.9% growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund and 1.8% predicted in March by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury's independent forecaster. For the wider OECD group of countries, the thinktank forecasts 2014 growth of 2.3%, unchanged from May. For the United States it is pencilling in 2.9% and for the eurozone just 1%. Global GDP growth is now forecast at 3.6%, revised down from 4% predicted back in May. \"Almost all of this reflects a further growth slowdown in the large emerging market economies, which is tempering the pace of the recovery in the OECD economies. At the same time, downside risks have also risen once more,\" the OECD's outlook says, citing fragilities in the eurozone banking sector as well as the threat of financial instability during Fed tapering. Problems in emerging markets could ripple into other economies and hamper growth, particularly in Europe and Japan, the thinktank warns. For the United States, the OECD is calling on the Federal Reserve to keep monetary policy accommodative for some time and to balance uncertainty about where demand and the jobs market are headed against the costs of postponing an exit from its quantitative easing scheme. It also has some strong words for US politicians after October's 16-day government shutdown and the row over the debt ceiling, or the borrowing limit that Congress sets for itself. \"Brinkmanship over fiscal policy in the United States remains a key risk and uncertainty,\" said Padoan. \"The debt ceiling needs to be scrapped and replaced by a credible long-term budgetary consolidation plan with solid political support.\" In the euro area, the OECD feels the recovery is \"lagging and uneven\" while unemployment \u2013 especially among the young \u2013 remains very high and inflationary pressures are very subdued. It also sees weakness in the banking system as a major drag on growth in the euro area. A spokesman for the UK Treasury said: \"The OECD have revised their forecast for UK GDP up by more than any other G7 country over the next two years. This provides more evidence that the UK's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity. Today's report also highlights the risks that remain to the recovery and urges the UK to stick to the government's plan that is growing the economy, lowering the deficit and inflation, and creating jobs. This is the only sustainable way to raise living standards for hardworking families\".",

Was your shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, aware of this when he accepted \u00a350,000 to fund his personal office?\" Shapps asked.</p> <p>When Flowers quit in September 2011, and as a local councillor shortly afterwards, he cited \"increasing and competing demands\" on his time when he was chairing the bank. The Co-op refused to comment, citing its own fact-finding review, launched on Monday, into any inappropriate behaviour at the bank and the group,</p> <p>A spokesman for Miliband, who met Flowers in March, said: \"Ed and the Labour leadership have been as shocked as anyone at the recent revelations regarding Flowers. That is why we have taken immediate action and suspended him from the party.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Balls said: \"Ed has never discussed the donation with Paul Flowers and, as far as Ed was aware, he had no involvement in it at all.\"</p> <p>The Flowers scandal has put fresh focus on the way the Co-op is run at a time when its bank is desperately trying to raise \u00a31.5bn to stave off collapse. The group is being forced to hand 70% of the bank to bondholders \u2013 led by two US hedge funds.</p> <p>Lord Myners, the former City minister during the banking crisis, said in a BBC interview there was \"some risk\" the hedge funds might now try to change the terms of the deal.</p> <p>He also raised the involvement of the coalition in trying to broker an attempt by Co-op to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group in a deal that collapsed this year. \"I think the real political embarrassment here is for the current coalition government and the encouragement that they were giving to the Co-op Bank to take over the Lloyds branches under the so-called Project Verde,\" he told the BBC's World at One.</p> <p>Many of the problems at the Co-op Bank have been linked to the merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009. David Anderson, head of the Co-op financial services division at the time of that transaction, put up a robust defence of the deal in an appearance before the Treasury select committee. He insisted the two businesses were stronger together than apart.</p> <p>The Britannia deal \"was not enough to bring down the bank\", Anderson, now a non-executive director at John Lewis, said on at least three occasions.</p>",

The details about Flowers' resignation from Bradford council \u2013 where he had been a member of the executive from May 2010 \u2013 prompted Grant Shapps, Tory chairman, to pose nine questions to Miliband about what he and Balls knew about the private life of the methodist minister. \"Were you aware that Paul Flowers had resigned from Bradford council over inappropriate adult material on his computer at the time you appointed him to your advisory group? Was your shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, aware of this when he accepted \u00a350,000 to fund his personal office?\" Shapps asked. When Flowers quit in September 2011, and as a local councillor shortly afterwards, he cited \"increasing and competing demands\" on his time when he was chairing the bank. The Co-op refused to comment, citing its own fact-finding review, launched on Monday, into any inappropriate behaviour at the bank and the group, A spokesman for Miliband, who met Flowers in March, said: \"Ed and the Labour leadership have been as shocked as anyone at the recent revelations regarding Flowers. That is why we have taken immediate action and suspended him from the party.\" A spokesman for Balls said: \"Ed has never discussed the donation with Paul Flowers and, as far as Ed was aware, he had no involvement in it at all.\" The Flowers scandal has put fresh focus on the way the Co-op is run at a time when its bank is desperately trying to raise \u00a31.5bn to stave off collapse. The group is being forced to hand 70% of the bank to bondholders \u2013 led by two US hedge funds. Lord Myners, the former City minister during the banking crisis, said in a BBC interview there was \"some risk\" the hedge funds might now try to change the terms of the deal. He also raised the involvement of the coalition in trying to broker an attempt by Co-op to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group in a deal that collapsed this year. \"I think the real political embarrassment here is for the current coalition government and the encouragement that they were giving to the Co-op Bank to take over the Lloyds branches under the so-called Project Verde,\" he told the BBC's World at One. Many of the problems at the Co-op Bank have been linked to the merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009. David Anderson, head of the Co-op financial services division at the time of that transaction, put up a robust defence of the deal in an appearance before the Treasury select committee. He insisted the two businesses were stronger together than apart. The Britannia deal \"was not enough to bring down the bank\", Anderson, now a non-executive director at John Lewis, said on at least three occasions.",

The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 retreated from record levels with less than an hour to go in Monday's session. The Nasdaq, which had been down slightly for most of the day, fell 1.1% to a session low. Speaking at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, Icahn said he was\"very cautious\" on the stock market, saying he could see a \"big drop\" because earnings at many companies are fuelled more by low borrowing costs than the strength of management. He also hinted at his plan for Apple, the most valuable US stock by market value, saying he does not want to fight with the management of the iPhone maker. He said he has no plans to walk away from his investment. The Nasdaq was hammered by a sell-off in social media and cloud-related stocks, including Facebook, which finished down 6.5% at $45.83. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.32 points, or 0.09%, to end at 15,976.02. The S&amp;P 500 Index slipped 6.65 points, or 0.37%, to finish at 1,791.53. The S&amp;P 500 had earlier hit 1,802.33 and the Dow touched 16,030.28, their highest levels ever. On Friday, both closed at record highs in their sixth straight week of gains. A number of US Federal Reserve speakers offered more insights into the central bank's stimulus. The latest was Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, who said improved economic and labour market conditions suggest the Fed should set a fixed dollar amount on its current bond-buying programme and end the programme when that amount was reached. William Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that he was becoming \"more hopeful\" about the US economy. But with intervention from the Fed likely to keep interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future, equities are expected to continue to attract yield-seeking investors, even after the Fed starts scaling back its asset purchases. Traders said the latest impetus for the market gains was last week's testimony to the US senate by Janet Yellen, President Obama's nominee to replace Ben Bernanke as head of the Fed. Yellen calmed fears that the central bank might begin to wind down its bond-buying programme before next year. The programme has been a key support for markets for several months and the central bank believes that despite US GDP growing at a better-than-expected 2.8% in the third quarter, a change in policy could easily push the recovery off track, especially with the unemployment rate edging up from 7.2% to 7.3% in October. The recent US government shutdown has also caused some disruption to the economic indicators. The dollar dropped against the yen and euro on Monday after China announced its most sweeping economic and social reforms in nearly three decades, lifting investors' appetite for higher-yielding currencies. Increased demand for riskier assets had earlier pushed the dollar down to its lowest against the euro since 6 November, while global equity markets climbed on China's plans. The euro received some support after data showed the euro zone's trade surplus grew more than expected in September.",
