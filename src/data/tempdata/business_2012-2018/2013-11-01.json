Seizing the opportunity provided by RBS's regime change, George Osborne drew a line under the hostile relations with former boss, Stephen Hester, and got himself snapped sipping tea with the new man, Ross McEwan, in a cycle store. The message? The bank and its unwilling owner, the Treasury, were now of one mind \u2013 and pushing hard on the pedals to revive the institution and aid a wider recovery. The substance of the plan, insofar as it was there, involved confirming that RBS's toxic debts would not be split into a separate bank, but would be separately managed internally with a view to earlyish disposal. The markets were unimpressed, pushing RBS shares down 8% at one point. Lifting the threat of division was supposed to reassure investors, but few were ever spooked by it. Much talked about in 2008-09, when it might have made a difference, it was only ever on the agenda in 2013 because the great and the (more debatably) good, in the form of Nigel Lawson and Mervyn King, told the banking commission in March that they favoured a split. Seeing most of the poison had already been drained from RBS's balance sheet by this point, this intervention smacked of clever men scrambling around for something clever to say. By this stage of the game, it was never going to happen. But with no real strategy for RBS of his own, the chancellor was rattled, and commissioned a costly review, complete with Rothschild's analysis, which duly served up yesterday's obvious conclusions. A separate, and more interesting, report for the bank itself on Friday highlighted failings in the way that RBS is serving (or too often not serving) small business. At least Mr McEwan displays some interest in this shortcoming, but \u2013 while necessary \u2013 better customer service is far from sufficient. For, as the whole world discovered in 2008, the problems here go deeper than that. Here is a fatally over-stretched global empire attempting to transform itself into something more mundane. That would be a painful transition at any time, but competing pressures worsen the plight: RBS is told to get more money out into the real economy, but also to squirrel more away in its vaults. Then there is a chancellor, itching for the earliest privatisation he can get, breathing down its neck. The bank is keen not merely to restart paying dividends, but to shrug off a stricture, imposed as part of the bailout, that the government must receive these before anyone else. This is a demand for a return to business as usual. How extraordinary that after all the bankruptcies and the bailout, we missed the chance for a wider debate about what we want finance to do.",

The Co-op movement has deep roots in mutualism, ethical and collective principles which are ostensibly at odds with the capitalist principles upon which the takeover is based. This suggests that there are three options: 1) a name change for the currently named Co-operative Bank if the bank no longer operates as a mutual; 2) the possibility of switching members from the currently named Co-op Bank to a newly structured entity (perhaps based on credit unions) and residing within the Co-op structure (should that be permitted); 3) the 30% Co-op members acting alone to switch or remain in a bank that no longer is based on the principles which had drawn them to it in the first place.

      "bodyText": "A global investigation into allegations of manipulation in the \u00a33tn-a-day currency markets appeared to be deepening with more banks admitting they were co-operating with regulators and Barclays suspending six of its traders. JP Morgan, America's biggest bank, and Citigroup added their names to the growing list of banks forced to admit they have been contacted by regulators investigating the potential manipulation of currency benchmarks. The investigation \u2013 at an early stage and involving regulators in the US, UK, other parts of Europe and Asia \u2013 is being compared to the one into the rigging of Libor, which has now so far led to five big financial firms being fined by regulators around the world. Barclays had revealed this week that it was co-operating with regulators, and on Friday it emerged that six staff had been placed on suspension while an internal investigation into currency dealings was under way. Barclays declined to comment. Bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland was also said to have suspended two of its traders and it has been reported that traders at other banks in the City have been suspended while investigations begin. RBS, in its third quarter results statement, said it had received enquiries from government and regulatory authorities looking at foreign exchange trading and that the investigations appeared to involve \"multiple financial institutions\". RBS said it was \"reviewing communications and procedures to certain currency exchange benchmarks as well as its foreign exchange trading activity\" and was co-operating with the authorities. It declined to comment on the reports that two of its traders had been suspended. The bank was fined \u00a3390m for rigging Libor and in June was penalised by the Singaporean authorities for deficiencies in handling benchmarks, including a foreign exchange spot benchmark, between 2007 and 2011. The Singaporean authorities required the bank \u2013 and others \u2013 to hold an additional S$1.2bn (\u00a3600m) on reserve until it could design a \"remediation plan\". The investigation into foreign exchange markets appears to have been prompted by allegations that traders at big banks were putting in client orders before a 60-second window when benchmarks run by WM/Reuters \u2013 and used by fund managers to value their investments \u2013 are set. Deutsche Bank and UBS revealed this week they are co-operating with the investigation, during which regulators are expected to look at the electronic chats that traders exchange, as was the case during the Libor investigation. The Financial Conduct Authority has said its investigation could take months and it could be \"some time\" before it can determine if any misconduct has taken place. The admission by JP Morgan that it had been contacted by regulators investigating the foreign exchange markets adds to its list of potential problems. It also disclosed that authorities outside the US are now investigating its Asian hiring practices. It had already disclosed it faces an investigation in the US over the recruitment of staff related to well-connected Chinese officials. JP Morgan's latest regulatory filing said the Wall Street regulator, the securities and exchange commission, and the justice department were also looking at its \"engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region\". \"Separate inquiries on these or similar topics have been made by other authorities, including authorities in other jurisdictions, and the firm is responding to those inquiries,\" the bank said in its statement. JP Morgan, which has put aside $23bn for potential litigation since 2010, joins a list of companies, including Avon and News Corp, that are being investigated by US authorities under the foreign corrupt practices act (FCPA). Violations of the act can trigger fines running to hundreds of millions of dollars.",

Ratings agency Fitch has revised its outlook for the country from negative to stable and reaffired its bond ratings at BBB. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spain has improved its policy track record in 2012-13. Fiscal consolidation over that period has shaved 2.5pp off the general government deficit/GDP ratio despite strong cyclical headwinds. The authorities have made significant reforms of the labour market, pension system, fiscal framework and financial sector. The pace of reform is likely to slow in 2014-15 as external pressures ease and 2015 elections loom, but the effort made to date should put the economy on a surer footing.</p> <p>Fitch forecasts that the economy will begin to recover in 2014 as headwinds from fiscal austerity and financing conditions ease. As is currently the case, the recovery will be primarily driven by net exports; domestic demand will remain subdued for a longer period. The agency maintains its potential growth assumption of 1.5% in the second half of the decade.</p> <p>Fitch projects that public debt will peak in 2015-16 at 103% and decline gradually thereafter, assuming an effective interest rate close to current levels. Medium-term forecasts assume some slippage relative to official public deficit targets.</p> <p>Fitch judges that the contingent liabilities from the banking sector have been adequately sized and that additional capital injections required from the Spanish sovereign will not exceed EUR20bn. Nonetheless, if the recession is deeper and longer than currently expected, the risk that the government may be required to make further injections of capital cannot be fully discounted.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full statement is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=806817&amp;origin=home\">Fitch revises Spain's outlook to stable</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T17:16:36.348Z\">at 5.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5273d59fe4b01fc33230d467\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T16:25:05.005Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> shares continue to decline.

A senior Fed official said today that the bank wants to make sure the improvement in the US jobs market is not just temporary before scaling back the bond buying. In <a href=\"http://www.stlouisfed.org/newsroom/displayNews.cfm?article=1973&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SM&amp;utm_campaign=Twitter\">a speech at a financial forum&#xa0;</a> St Louis Fed president James Bullard said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To the extent that key labour market indicators continue to show cumulative improvement the likelihood of tapering asset purchases will continue to rise. The committee also wants reassurance that any progress made in labour markets will stick.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those comments suggested to some that Bullard was becoming less dovish. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Bullard\u2019s views are highly relevant as he has been a bellwether for investors: at the beginning of this year, he was one of the first Fed officials to discuss the need to taper. Since the summer, however, he became much more dovish, highlighting concerns about the too low inflation rate. Today\u2019s remarks suggest that Mr Bullard has again abandoned his dovish bias and is \u2013 under certain conditions \u2013 willing to support the tapering.</p> <p>In short, his speech and the presented slides indicate that to him average monthly payroll gains of about 180,000 would represent a substantial improvement in the labor market, the necessary condition for the Fed to wind-down its asset purchase program.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T17:54:56.993Z\">at 5.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5273bd15e4b0ad7c52b60506\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T14:51:23.990Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-54f4114c-24a0-4fae-80d6-6e17e4da06cf\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/8/22/1377166412900/Shopper-pushes-a-trolley--010.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad is 412th on the Forbes list of billionaires.

And however much people care about inequality, almost every place on Earth would like to be the kind of place where successful new firms are born and raised.</p> <p>The good news about Sweden is that it\u2019s exactly that kind of place. High taxes go to finance cheap health care and education, an excellent system of public transportation, and relatively generous subsidies to low-income households that keep the poverty rate and inequality low.

Thanks for all your comments (and apologies once more for the earlier problems). Back on Monday for coverage of all the key events in the financial world. Have a good weekend. In Greece, the saga over whether senior troika officials will visit Athens to finalise their inspection tour of the country is still raging despite the government\u2019s insistence that the scheduled trip will go ahead as planned. Helena Smith in Athens writes: Far from being set in stone the Greek media is now describing the controversy surrounding the troika\u2019s forthcoming visit as a \u201cthriller.\u201d Statements this afternoon by a spokesman of the European Commission has thrown further doubt over the visit following the assertion that it will only happen \u201cunder appropriate conditions.\u201d Put on the defensive, finance ministry officials at the highest level repeated that a meeting between mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF and Yannis Stournaras, the Greek finance minister, had been set for noon on Tuesday. In the midst of the furore, the country\u2019s Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) announced today that it would seek to raise \u20ac1bn by issuing six-month treasury bills on the same day. That, ironically, is the amount Greece is seeking in its next installment of aid from the troika. European markets have closed the week on a downbeat note. Worries about the US Federal Reserve beginning to slow down its $85bn a month bond buying programme re-emerged after more strong manufacturing data. Royal Bank of Scotland's hefty losses and \u00a338bn bad bank proposal, along with further revelations relating to foreign exchange manipulation by global banks also hit sentiment. So the final scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up just 3.31 points at 6734.74 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.29% to 9007.83 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.62% lower at4273.19 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB dropped 0.97% to 19,164.26 \u2022 Spain's Ibex lost 0.7% to 9838.3 \u2022 The Athens market fell 0.88% to 1177.7 Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.15% higher. Some good news for Spain. Ratings agency Fitch has revised its outlook for the country from negative to stable and reaffired its bond ratings at BBB. It said: Spain has improved its policy track record in 2012-13. Fiscal consolidation over that period has shaved 2.5pp off the general government deficit/GDP ratio despite strong cyclical headwinds. The authorities have made significant reforms of the labour market, pension system, fiscal framework and financial sector. The pace of reform is likely to slow in 2014-15 as external pressures ease and 2015 elections loom, but the effort made to date should put the economy on a surer footing. Fitch forecasts that the economy will begin to recover in 2014 as headwinds from fiscal austerity and financing conditions ease. As is currently the case, the recovery will be primarily driven by net exports; domestic demand will remain subdued for a longer period. The agency maintains its potential growth assumption of 1.5% in the second half of the decade. Fitch projects that public debt will peak in 2015-16 at 103% and decline gradually thereafter, assuming an effective interest rate close to current levels. Medium-term forecasts assume some slippage relative to official public deficit targets. Fitch judges that the contingent liabilities from the banking sector have been adequately sized and that additional capital injections required from the Spanish sovereign will not exceed EUR20bn. Nonetheless, if the recession is deeper and longer than currently expected, the risk that the government may be required to make further injections of capital cannot be fully discounted. The full statement is here: Fitch revises Spain's outlook to stable Royal Bank of Scotland shares continue to decline. Shortly before the market closes they are down more than 7% to 340p after revealing its \u00a338bn bad bank plans. The US Federal Reserve may have left its $85bn a month bond buying programme unchanged at this week's meeting, but the speculation continues about when the central bank will begin to ease off on QE. A senior Fed official said today that the bank wants to make sure the improvement in the US jobs market is not just temporary before scaling back the bond buying. In a speech at a financial forum St Louis Fed president James Bullard said: To the extent that key labour market indicators continue to show cumulative improvement the likelihood of tapering asset purchases will continue to rise. The committee also wants reassurance that any progress made in labour markets will stick. Those comments suggested to some that Bullard was becoming less dovish. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: Mr Bullard\u2019s views are highly relevant as he has been a bellwether for investors: at the beginning of this year, he was one of the first Fed officials to discuss the need to taper. Since the summer, however, he became much more dovish, highlighting concerns about the too low inflation rate. Today\u2019s remarks suggest that Mr Bullard has again abandoned his dovish bias and is \u2013 under certain conditions \u2013 willing to support the tapering. In short, his speech and the presented slides indicate that to him average monthly payroll gains of about 180,000 would represent a substantial improvement in the labor market, the necessary condition for the Fed to wind-down its asset purchase program. Here is a question for Friday afternoon: why does Sweden have so many billionaires? Matthew Yglesias at Slate looks at why a country famed for its generous welfare state, produces such a high number of super rich individuals, relative to its population size. Critics of the Swedish model have contended that state spending is a barrier to innovation, a myth that Yglesias debunks. To reach that level of stratospheric riches, you probably either need to start a big, successful company or else inherit one from someone who did. And however much people care about inequality, almost every place on Earth would like to be the kind of place where successful new firms are born and raised. The good news about Sweden is that it\u2019s exactly that kind of place. High taxes go to finance cheap health care and education, an excellent system of public transportation, and relatively generous subsidies to low-income households that keep the poverty rate and inequality low. But they haven\u2019t stopped Swedish entrepreneurs from building giant firms like H&amp;M, Ikea, and Tetra Pak. You can read his full piece here. I am passing onto Nick Fletcher now. Thanks for all the comments so far... Data firm Markit also keeps an eye on U.S factory output. Using a slightly different methodology, they paint a gloomier picture than the ISM. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index stood at 51.8 in October, better than expected, but still a point below September's reading. As usual, 50 counts for expansion. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said October's troubles could be temporary. However, even the faster growth of employment remains only modest, consistent with barely any increase in official data on manufacturing payrolls. So there you are. The U.S manufacturing data is compiled by the Institute for Supply Management and you can crunch through their full data here. A few highlights: \u202214 out of 18 manufacturing sectors recorded growth in October \u2022 New orders were slightly up on the previous month: 60.6 Oct v 60.5 in Sept \u2022Production was also down: 60.8 Oct v 62.6 Sept \u2022Employment showed the weakest growth since June: 53.2 in Oct v 55.4 in Sept The instant view: Hot off the wires...US manufacturing grew at its fastest rate last month since April 2011 The monthly index of manufacturing activity for October was 56.4, compared to 56.2 in September, better than expectations. Anything over 50 means expansion. The euro just keeps on falling, today hitting a two-week low, as the big banks eye a possible interest rate cut from the European Central Bank. The common currency is down 0.6% against the dollar to $1.3513, in sight of its biggest weekly drop since July, extending its losses after yesterday's data showing a fall in inflation across the bloc. John Hardy at Saxo Bank says that there has been a major change of sentiment on the euro. The ECB's single mandate has always been on inflation so this gives [European Central Bank President Mario] Draghi and co further reason to do something at next week's meeting. We see considerable further downside, the likes of euro/dollar back into the old range, down towards $1.30.\" Quote courtesy of Reuters. Someone in the city is fed up with George Osborne's handling of RBS, and is briefing TV journalists about it... Over in Greece the government has moved fast to douse speculation that officials representing the country\u2019s troika of foreign creditors have cancelled their forthcoming visit because of ongoing differences. The Guardian's Helena Smith reports from Athens The Greek finance ministry insisted Friday that a much-anticipated visit by senior Troika officials was not only on track but had been \u201cpencilled in\u201d the diaries of everyone involved. \u201cThey will come here for a meeting with the minister on Tuesday morning,\u201d said a senior official at the finance minister. Speculation that international inspectors had decided indefinitely to put off their visit to Athens \u2013 originally due to take place this week before being deferred to Monday 4th November \u2013 was highlighted in a Reuters report late on Thursday. Referring to the debt-stricken country\u2019s looming funding gap (estimated at \u20ac500m by Athens and \u20ac2bn euro by creditors) the agency said mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF had decided to put the planned trip on ice because of ongoing differences over how to put the Greek economy back on track. The officials hold the key to \u20ac1bn euro in rescue funds \u2013 the latest installment of a \u20ac240bn package of rescue loans agreed by foreign lenders since May 2010 to stop Greece falling into bankruptcy. But friction between the two sides has been growing with Athens\u2019 fragile two-party coalition resolutely refusing to resort to yet more austerity \u2013 in the form of fresh tax increases and across- the-board pay and pension cuts - to plug a fiscal gap that it says can been easily fixed by better control of social security contributions. Earlier this week tensions were raised a notch further when the country\u2019s normally mild-mannered president Carolos Papoulias used an annual commemoration of the country\u2019s stand against fascism to insist that \u201cGreek people cannot give anymore\u201d. Athens\u2019 outright rejection of new belt-tightening measures has outraged creditors who in private insist that fresh cuts are the only way forward. Indicative of the mood in a country where disposal incomes have been slashed by up to 50%, the government has been forced to backtrack on a new bill outlining property taxes with the finance minister, Yannis Stornaras, promising to amend the legislation in the coming days. The pound is down 0.5% against the dollar to $1.5958, as investors shrug off Friday's economic good news. Manufacturing data showed the fastest growth in export orders for two years, but many traders are not convinced the pick-up in the UK economy will be sustained. The RBS bad bank is also an important move for Ulster Bank, the largest bank in Northern Ireland. Around \u00a39bn of Ulster Bank's bad loans will find a home in the RBS internal bad bank. The Guardian's Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald writes that Ulster Bank is critical for both states on the island. Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers has welcomed RBS' decision to continue operating as the Ulster Bank on both sides of the Irish border. The secretary of state said today she had been working closely with colleagues in the Treasury \"to ensure the importance of this decision to Northern Ireland was clearly understood and properly considered.\" She said the restructuring of RBS overall would \"give Ulster Bank a greater ability to lend, providing extra help to Northern Ireland business and the economy.\" The Northern Irealnd Finance Minister Simon Hamilton said the news that RBS was not being split up was \"far better than many people feared\". \"We do have the opportunity as a result of the review that will take place to shape Ulster Bank into the bank that we need it to be,\" he added. More from HM... RBS will create an internal \"bad bank\" ring-fencing \u00a338bn of toxic assets such as loans not expected to be repaid. Around \u00a39bn of those toxic assets are from Ulster Bank. Ulster Bank will also face a further review aimed at finding a \"viable and sustainable business model\". The Ulster Bank also revealed it lost a further \u00a3132m in the third quarter of this year as it continues to suffer from the impacts of the property crash particularly in the Irish Republic. The bank's importance to the economies of both states on the island of Ireland is critical to the banking sector. Ulster Bank is the largest bank in Northern Ireland and the third largest in the Republic. Most of its debts on the island were generated when it lent billions in commercial property loans during the Celtic Tiger years before the crash. The Guardian's city editor Jill Treanor has been taking a look at the contents of the Royal Bank of Scotland's bad bank. Read her piece here. More evidence of the UK's north-south divide in housing from chartered surveyors e.surv. Their latest research shows that four of the UK's top five \"repossession hotspots\" in north-west England. Chester, Blackpool, Oldham and Wigan are among the areas with the highest proportion of homeowners at serious risk of losing the roof over their head. As the Guardian's Rupert Jones reports, the picture is not as simple as a pure north and south divide Two areas within Greater London \u2013 Romford and Croydon - also featured in the repossessions top 10, with Ilford and Enfield not far behind, despite all the publicity about rocketing house prices in and around the capital. But Chester tops the table of hotspots by a substantial margin, with 8.4 repossessions per 1,000 households\u2013 three times the UK average of 2.8 per 1,000. In second place was Blackpool, with 4.5 per 1,000, while Oldham (4.3 per 1,000) and Wigan (4.2 per 1,000), both in Greater Manchester, took fourth and joint fifth place respectively. In the north-west England overall, eight out of 10 towns (79%) had above the UK average number of repossessions. Read his full story, showing the top 10 repossession areas, here. The co-owner of London's 'Gherkin' tower has said it hopes to be out of insolvency by next year. German property group IVG Immobilien is working on a re-organisation plan to clear its debts and hopes to be up and running under different owners next spring. Just when you though German-U.S relations couldn't get any worse, Washington has managed to infuriate Berlin with an ill-timed lecture on the much-lauded German economic model. Coming in the wake of reports that U.S spies were bugging Angela Merkel's phone , the U.S government shutdown and wrangling over the debt ceiling, the timing does seem... well, unfortunate. A quick recap: on Wednesday the US Treasury accused Germany of holding back eurozone recovery. US officials believe that Germany's consistent current account surpluses are choking off economic revival for its neighbours, who could benefit from a more free-spending German consumer. On Thursday Germany hit back at this \"incomprehensible\" critique. In a statement the Economics Ministry said The trade surpluses reflect the strong competitiveness of the German economy and the international demand for quality products from Germany. Does Berlin sense a hint of envy about German export success? And senior policymakers are queuing up to tell the U.S to get its own house in order. Michael Meister, a lawmaker and close ally of chancellor Angela Merkel criticised the high U.S debt level, which \u201cdoesn\u2019t just unsettle [the U.S.], but has negative effects on the global economy.\u201d As the Wall Street Journal reports, he said: The U.S government should critically analyse its own economic situation. A spokesman for Germany's opposition green party said: [Willingness] to take advice from Washington has decreased massively after the U.S government shutdown put the entire financial system in jeopardy. Ouch While Stormy-Annika Mildner at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Der Spiegel that the US Treasury is putting too much of the blame on Germany. She also said the Treasury's tough language could undermine the EU-US free trade negotiations set to resume next month. The skin is getting thinner on this side of the Atlantic. Good news: our comments system is back up and running. And there is plenty to talk about, from RBS's mini bad bank, the German-US spat over economic policy and the pick-up in UK export orders. RBS is dominating the corporate news agenda this morning. But you don't have to look far on the FTSE 100 to find another market-moving story. Shares in Vodafone are up more than 2% on reports of a takeover by the U.S telecoms giant AT&amp;T. Nothing is confirmed, but Bloomberg has reported that AT&amp;T are laying the groundwork internally for a potential takeover of Vodafone, which is the UK's fifth largest company. The combined companies would be worth a cool $250 bn (\u00a3156 bn). From Bloomberg's story: A merger, which would create the world\u2019s largest telecommunications operator by sales, wouldn\u2019t be AT&amp;T\u2019s first attempt at combining the companies. AT&amp;T approached Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) this year about a transaction in which AT&amp;T would buy Vodafone\u2019s European operations, with Verizon taking over their wireless joint-venture and America MovilSAB taking much of the rest, two of the people said. Verizon rejected that approach as too complex and likely to slow its own $130 billion purchase of Vodafone\u2019s 45 percent stake inVerizon Wireless, they said. The report predicts political opposition, but notes that UK takeover laws do not allow the government to block a foreign deal. Previous opposition to Kraft Foods Inc.\u2019s 2010 takeover of chocolate-maker Cadbury Ltd. didn\u2019t go beyond strongly-worded speeches and newspaper editorials. The pick-up in export orders is certainly the most eye-catching detail to emerge from the Markit manufacturing survey. Senior Markit economist Rob Dobson greeted the news as a sign that the UK \"is no longer being left behind in the chase to benefit from improving global markets\". Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First currency brokers, agrees that the rise in new orders is encouraging, but points to economic clouds across the channel. We are looking for UK data to cool somewhat through Q4 following such a great 3 month-term between July and September, but signs from the manufacturing sector so far remain optimistic. I am particularly encouraged by the expansion in the new orders component \u2013 a strong leading indicator of future jobs growth. The one caveat we will have to assign to the UK manufacturing remains the economic area 21 miles off our coast \u2013 Europe. Recent data from the Eurozone has remained poor, and should we see another European slowdown, we will not be unaffected here in the UK. We would expect the manufacturing sector to be the first part of the economy to show the strain as orders dry up. More RBS. This is what Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, has to say about the future of the 81% state owned bank: After the firesales of Royal Mail and Northern Rock, we will scrutinise George Osborne's plans for the future of RBS very carefully. As we argued when, earlier this year, the chancellor flirted with the idea of a quick sale of RBS to a political timetable, the taxpayer interest must come first. The tests for these changes at RBS are whether they see the taxpayer ultimately get its money back and whether they actually boost business lending and radically transform this bank to put an end to business as usual. On the banking system more widely, business and the public are right to be concerned that lending to business is still falling while the radical reforms we need are being watered down. For example, he is still refusing to implement the Parliamentary Commission\u2019s call for a backstop power that would allow for full separation of all the banks, not just one or two, if ring-fencing proves ineffective and does not deliver the cultural change we need. We are still working on getting the comments function on the blog up and running. Please bear with us. UK factories were humming in October, according to the latest purchasing managers' index from survey group Markit. A sharp upturn in exports helped manufacturing to notch up solid rates of growth, with new orders close to 19-year records. Here is Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit: Despite only accounting for less than 11% of the economy, the current strength of growth seen in manufacturing means the sector will still provide a major boost to the economy in October, boding well for the strong pace of economic growth we saw in the second and third quarter being sustained into the fourth quarter. The survey suggests manufacturing output is growing at a quarterly rate of around 1%-1.5%. Maintaining this solid expansion will be important if we are to see any real signs of the economy rebalancing, as manufacturing remains 9% smaller than its pre-crisis peak, while services have already closed the gap. A sharp uptick in inflows of new export business to a 32-month high was also one of the big stories from the latest figures, signalling that the UK is no longer being left behind in the chase to benefit from improving global markets. A strengthening domestic market, riding on the crest of a wave from recent positive economic news, also remains a prime driver of the recovery. This should help UK manufacturing remain one of the brighter growth spots in the world manufacturing economy, as highlighted by its position at the top of the global PMI rankings throughout the third quarter. The full release from Markit is here. Breaking news... British factory activity edged down slightly in October. The purchasing managers' index was 56 in October, compared to 56.3 in September, on an index where anything over 50 signals growth. Sterling has fallen against the dollar, as markets wait for UK manufacturing data that is expected to show a slowdown in the pace of recovery. Sterling is down 0.3% to $1.5987, a two-week low, weighed down by growing doubts about whether the recent improvement can be sustained. We will find out more soon... With all the excitement about RBS's massive loss, its share price tanking and the mini bad bank, let's not overlook that the bank has suspended two traders in connection to an investigation into the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, refused to confirm details in his media conference call this morning, but said the bank would come down hard on wrongdoers. And here is some Twitter reaction to the creation of an internal bad bank at RBS: George Osborne has been on Radio 4's Today programme. This is what the chancellor had to say, when asked when the British taxpayer would get their money back from bailing out the Royal Bank of Scotland. I think, sadly, it is still some way off. I think, quite frankly, it is unlikely before the general election. If there was a transformation in RBS and all these problems that it has to confront were dealt with much more quickly, maybe we would reconsider. But I say 'unlikely' in the real sense of the word, which is I don't think it's very likely. I wouldn't feel comfortable going to the British people and saying 'Invest in RBS' until I was absolutely clear that it was on top of its problems. Quotes courtesy of PA The Royal Bank of Scotland is on course to make a substantial loss in 2013, its chief executive has said this morning, as it announced it would create a mini bad bank to house its toxic assets. RBS shares are down 3.4%, making them the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, and at 355 pence well below the 500 pence the taxpayer paid for them when the bank received its bailout. Here is the report from the Guardian's city editor Jill Treanor The review into creating a bad bank \u2013 commissioned by the chancellor George Osborne after the Mansion House speech in June \u2013 had concluded the \"effort, risk and expense involved in the creation of an external bad bank is not justified\". Instead about \u00a338bn of troublesome loans \u2013 including \u00a39bn from Ulster Bank \u2013 will be placed into a new non-core division to be known as the capital resolution division, which will aims to be wound down in two years. McEwan \u2013 who said he wanted to \"reset the key relationships\" with government and regulators \u2013 will accelerate the spin off RBS's US arm Citizens to next year rather than 2015 and signalled a review of a large number of businesses, the outcome of which will be announced in February. You can read the full story here. It is the electronic equivalent of 'leaves on the line'... we are doing some technical work on our blog platforms and no comments can be posted at the moment. I'll post an update when I have more information. European markets are looking subdued this morning, on a day that is a public holiday in several countries. FTSE 100 +0.24% at 6,747 points Spain's IBEX -0.2% at 9,888 points Italy's FTSE MIB -0.5% at 19,237 points Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. China\u2019s manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in 18 months, adding to signs that the world\u2019s second largest economy is stabilising. The official purchasing managers\u2019 survey rose to 51.4 from 51.1 - an index where anything over 50 means growth. Analysts now think China could exceed its 7.5% growth target this year. A separate HSBC survey also showed that manufacturing was expanding. And we have plenty of other news. The Royal Bank of Scotland has just announced \u00a3634m loss for the third quarter, as it outlines plans to create an internal \u2018bad bank\u2019 for its problem loans. Germany has hit back at US criticism of its export-focused economic policy - adding to tensions between the two countries over spying. UK data released at 9.30 is expected to show expansion in the manufacturing sector, although slightly below last month. I\u2019ll be tracking that and all the latest throughout the day...",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail shares reach new record while Vodafone lifted by bid talk", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The army of small investors who have so far resisted the temptation to sell their Royal Mail shares have been rewarded by seeing the company's shares hit yet another new peak. Adding more fuel to the accusations that the business was sold too cheaply, it closed 14p higher at 574p on Friday, up 74% from the 330p level it floated at just three weeks ago. The move will also be welcomed by activist hedge fund TCI, which was recently revealed as the company's largest shareholder apart from the UK government. The latest positive news driving the share price rise came when workers decided to call off a strike planned for next Monday, with the company and the Communications Workers Union saying they had made progress in talks over pay and conditions. And soon there will be little escape from the company in the run-up to Christmas: viewers of the X-Factor and Downton Abbey will be regaled with a choir of Royal Mail workers singing its praises in its first TV adverts for six years, beginning tonight. Royal Mail has booked some 430 slots for the ads, which feature the workers singing All You Need is Love. Elsewhere Vodafone was in the spotlight again. Most City conversations about the mobile phone group used to revolve around the possible sale of its US wireless joint venture to partner Verizon. Now that the two sides have finally agreed a $130bn deal, the speculation has quickly turned to the chances of the remainder of Vodafone receiving a bid from AT&amp;T. Vodafone's shares jumped 8p to 232.5p on Friday, making it the biggest riser in the leading index, following a report that AT&amp;T - the second largest mobile group in the US after Verizon Wireless - was working on a bid which could come early next year. If such a deal went ahead it would create the world's largest telecoms company with a market capitalisation of more than $250bn. Before Vodafone agreed to sell its US wireless business, it was widely rumoured that Verizon and AT&amp;T had considered a joint break-up bid for the UK business. Despite that idea coming to nothing, the City believes AT&amp;T could still be interested. AT&amp;T boss Randall Stephenson fuelled the speculation in September by saying his company would buy wireless assets in Europe at the right price, and analysts have also recently been weighing up the prospects of a bid. With Vodafone's help, the FTSE 100 finished at 6734.74, up 3.31 points on the day and 13 points higher over the week. But it was another volatile few days of trading, with the index hitting a new five month high of 6777 as the US Federal Reserve gathered for its latest policy meeting. The central bank decided to maintain its $85bn a month bond buying programme, much to investors' relief. But then came stronger than expected US manufacturing figures, which immediately rekindled concerns the Fed could start to turn off the money taps before the end of the year, and took some of the shine off shares. James Knightley at ING Bank said: The US ISM manufacturing index has surprisingly risen to 56.4 in October versus 56.2 in September and the consensus expectation of 55.0. [This] will help keep faint thoughts of a December Fed taper alive. However, the apparent loss of momentum in the labour market coupled with a likely soft third quarter GDP number next week could quickly see them fade again. In the eurozone, the single currency came under pressure as an increasing number of economists suggested the European Central Bank could cut interest rates at its meeting next week, in the wake of a sharp drop in inflation. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The sharp drop in eurozone consumer price inflation to 0.7% in October means that an ECB interest rate cut from 0.50% to 0.25% is now a very real possibility at its 7 November policy meeting. However, the ECB may prefer to hold fire until its December meeting when it will have available the new eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts from its staff Either way, we expect the ECB to cut interest rates from 0.50% to 0.25% before the end of this year. Royal Bank of Scotland slumped 7.5% to 340p after reporting a hefty third quarter loss of more than \u00a3600m. But the bank was not the recipient of the FTSE 100 wooden spoon. That honour went to Meggitt, which lost 63.5p or 11% to 509p after it warned of lower than expected sales. The aircraft parts supplier said it expected revenues to grow in the low single digits this year, down from its prediction in August of mid-single digit gains. The company, which makes avionics and wheels for the likes of Airbus and Boeing, said trading in the four months to the middle of October had fallen slightly below expectations. It said: [This was] principally due to short term production difficulties at Meggitt Sensing Systems and the timing of contract wins and project milestones in one of our energy businesses. It said military revenues remained flat despite the US budget issues, but the strengthening of the pound against the dollar in the second half also had an effect. But it identified a raw material supply issue dating back to 2012, involving replacing various parts over the next few years at a cost of \u00a320m. Analyst Chris Dyett at Investec said: Meggitt's third quarter management statement is a disappointment, leading us to make pretax profit downgrades of around 7% for this year and next. Underlying trading is largely as expected, but a number of newly identified issues have impacted the second half and also 2014. In addition, a foreign exchange headwind has compounded the issues. Our new price target is 515p and we move to hold, expecting the stock to unwind part of the recent re-rating as well as reflecting the downgrade. Better than expected Chinese PMI figures failed to lift the mining sector, with Antofagasta down 18p at 837p. Fears of Fed tapering outweighed the positive signs from China. But Royal Dutch Shell B shares recovered 30p to 2189.5p after falling back in the wake of Thursday's disappointing figures. Associated British Foods dipped 16p to \u00a322.51, ahead of full year results next Tuesday. The City is keen to hear whether the company would countenance spinning off its successful Primark discount fashion retailer from its other businesses including British Sugar, and analysts will also want to know about Primark's expansion plans. The US is seen as a natural growth area for the business, with Morgan Stanley saying in a recent note that it could easily link up with shopping centre owner Westfield to tackle north America. The bank said: Although management has not commented on US expansion and there is no visibility on the timeline, we believe the Primark format would be successful in the US given: 1) The success of European fast fashion retailers Topshop and ASOS in the US. 2) The Primark store at Westfield, Stratford has been a clear success, paving the way for potential global collaboration between Primark and Westfield. Westfield operates 47 shopping malls in the US, which could provide Primark with the first leg of its US expansion. Still with retail, Marks &amp; Spencer fell 8.8p to 494.7p on profit taking ahead of figures next week. There was a flurry of excitement on Thursday following news that Bill Adderley, the billionaire founder of soft furnishings group Dunelm, had secretly amassed a 3% stake worth nearly \u00a3250m, making him the retailer's largest private shareholder. Meanwhile French Connection lost 1p to 38.5p after gaining ground earlier in the week on suggestions Mike Ashley or his Sports Direct International could be interested in bidding. Balfour Beatty, another company to report on bonfire night, dropped 3.7p to 282p as analysts at Liberum suggested the infrastructure group could issue a warning on the outlook. They said: There could be fireworks \u2013 there is an evens chance of a downgrade to 2013, but investors may look through it if they believe it marks the end of the downgrade cycle. The 2013 result is contingent on no more contract surprises, the Australian mining project (Pilbara is looking increasingly safe) and the \u00a315m Professional Services settlement (beyond analysis). Order book progress could underpin 2014 earnings and result in improving cash flow, re-assuring on the dividend. The shares offer margin recovery and exposure to the early cycle US. Transport group Go-Ahead went into reverse, down 56p to \u00a316.26 after UBS downgraded its recommendation from neutral to sell: With core markets struggling for growth, we see no justification for premium valuations. Go-Ahead cannot be questioned operationally, but now has a negative risk- reward balance, in our view. Finally drugs discovery minnow Summit Corporation was steady at 11.375p as its treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy received approval for a phase 1b clinical trial.",

But then came stronger than expected US manufacturing figures, which immediately rekindled concerns the Fed could start to turn off the money taps before the end of the year, and took some of the shine off shares.</p> <p>James Knightley at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The US ISM manufacturing index has surprisingly risen to 56.4 in October versus 56.2 in September and the consensus expectation of 55.0. [This] will help keep faint thoughts of a December Fed taper alive. However, the apparent loss of momentum in the labour market coupled with a likely soft third quarter GDP number next week could quickly see them fade again.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the eurozone, the single currency came under pressure as an increasing number of economists suggested the European Central Bank could cut interest rates at its meeting next week, in the wake of a sharp drop in inflation. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The sharp drop in eurozone consumer price inflation to 0.7% in October means that an ECB interest rate cut from 0.50% to 0.25% is now a very real possibility at its 7 November policy meeting. However, the ECB may prefer to hold fire until its December meeting when it will have available the new eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts from its staff</p> <p>Either way, we expect the ECB to cut interest rates from 0.50% to 0.25% before the end of this year.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> slumped 7.5% to 340p after reporting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/royal-bank-scotland-losses-internal-bad-bank-rbs\" title=\"\">a hefty third quarter loss of more than \u00a3600m</a>. But the bank was not the recipient of the FTSE 100 wooden spoon. That honour went to <strong>Meggitt</strong>, which lost 63.5p or 11% to 509p after it warned of lower than expected sales. The aircraft parts supplier said it expected revenues to grow in the low single digits this year, down from its prediction in August of mid-single digit gains.</p> <p>The company, which makes avionics and wheels for the likes of Airbus and Boeing, said trading in the four months to the middle of October had fallen slightly below expectations. It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>[This was] principally due to short term production difficulties at Meggitt Sensing Systems and the timing of contract wins and project milestones in one of our energy businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said military revenues remained flat despite the US budget issues, but the strengthening of the pound against the dollar in the second half also had an effect. But it identified a raw material supply issue dating back to 2012, involving replacing various parts over the next few years at a cost of \u00a320m. Analyst Chris Dyett at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Meggitt's third quarter management statement is a disappointment, leading us to make pretax profit downgrades of around 7% for this year and next. Underlying trading is largely as expected, but a number of newly identified issues have impacted the second half and also 2014. In addition, a foreign exchange headwind has compounded the issues. Our new price target is 515p and we move to hold, expecting the stock to unwind part of the recent re-rating as well as reflecting the downgrade.</p> </blockquote> <p>Better than expected Chinese PMI figures failed to lift the mining sector, with <strong>Antofagasta</strong> down 18p at 837p. Fears of Fed tapering outweighed the positive signs from China.</p> <p>But <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares recovered 30p to 2189.5p after falling back in the wake of Thursday's disappointing figures.</p> <p><strong>Associated British Foods</strong> dipped 16p to \u00a322.51, ahead of full year results next Tuesday. The City is keen to hear whether the company would countenance spinning off its successful Primark discount fashion retailer from its other businesses including British Sugar, and analysts will also want to know about Primark's expansion plans. The US is seen as a natural growth area for the business, with Morgan Stanley saying in a recent note that it could easily link up with shopping centre owner Westfield to tackle north America. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Although management has not commented on US expansion and there is no visibility on the timeline, we believe the Primark format would be successful in the US given: 1) The success of European fast fashion retailers Topshop and ASOS in the US.<br>2) The Primark store at Westfield, Stratford has been a clear success, paving the way for potential global collaboration between Primark and Westfield. Westfield operates 47 shopping malls in the US, which could provide Primark with the first leg of its US expansion.</p> </blockquote> <p>Still with retail, <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> fell 8.8p to 494.7p on profit taking ahead of figures next week. There was a flurry of excitement on Thursday following news that Bill Adderley, the billionaire founder of soft furnishings group Dunelm, had secretly amassed a 3% stake worth nearly \u00a3250m, making him the retailer's largest private shareholder.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>French Connection</strong> lost 1p to 38.5p after gaining ground earlier in the week on suggestions Mike Ashley or his Sports Direct International could be interested in bidding.</p> <p><strong>Balfour Beatty</strong>, another company to report on bonfire night, dropped 3.7p to 282p as analysts at Liberum suggested the infrastructure group could issue a warning on the outlook. They said:</p> <blockquote> <p>There could be fireworks \u2013 there is an evens chance of a downgrade to 2013, but investors may look through it if they believe it marks the end of the downgrade cycle. The 2013 result is contingent on no more contract surprises, the Australian mining project (Pilbara is looking increasingly safe) and the \u00a315m Professional Services settlement (beyond analysis). Order book progress could underpin 2014 earnings and result in improving cash flow, re-assuring on the dividend. The shares offer margin recovery and exposure to the early cycle US. </p> </blockquote> <p>Transport group <strong>Go-Ahead</strong> went into reverse, down 56p to \u00a316.26 after UBS downgraded its recommendation from neutral to sell:</p> <blockquote> <p>With core markets struggling for growth, we see no justification for premium valuations. Go-Ahead cannot be questioned operationally, but now has a negative risk- reward balance, in our view. </p> </blockquote> <p>Finally drugs discovery minnow <strong>Summit Corporation</strong> was steady at 11.375p as its treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy received approval for a phase 1b clinical trial.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How do you build an orphanage out of flip-flops? That's the task that Rob and Paul Forkan have set themselves by next year, in time to mark the 10th anniversary of the Boxing Day tsunami, in which they lost both their parents while travelling in Sri Lanka. The brothers, who lost almost everything in the 2004 disaster, have set up Gandys, a new \"brand for good\" selling flip-flops which promises to give 10% of the profits from every pair sold to help other orphans around the world. Starting out from a small flat in Brixton, south London, 18 months ago, the Forkans have built a brand stocked in 400 stores including Selfridges and Topman and won the support of high-profile fans including Richard Branson and the pop star Jessie J. This year the company expects to turn over \u00a31.2m. This week they collected an award for accessories and footwear design at the WGSN Global Fashion Awards in London, lining up alongside big name award-winners from the world of fashion including Acne, Erdem and Net-a-Porter. Rob and Paul were 13 and 11 when their parents, Kevin and Sandra, pulled them out of school in Croydon to work on humanitarian projects in south Asia. In 2001, the family, including Rob and Paul's younger brother and sister, packed a backpack and did away with the rest of their possessions to move to Goa. They were on holiday in Sri Lanka when the family's hotel was hit by the tsunami wave on Boxing Day 2004. Rob and Paul saved themselves by clinging to a metal bar high up in the building but Kevin and Sandra lost their lives to the water after managing to get their younger children to safety. Devastated by their loss and with no money or passports, the children managed to hitchhike 200 miles to the airport and get home to Britain, where they were supported by friends and family. Rob and Paul finished their education and went off travelling the world again, getting jobs here and there to pay their way. But they had bigger ambitions: \"We wanted to build a brand based on our own beliefs from our upbringing and alternative lifestyle,\" says Rob. Having spent years wandering the world in flip-flops, that simple form of footwear seemed a good place to start. When Rob woke up after a night of partying at a music festival saying his \"mouth felt like one of Gandhi's flip-flops\", the brand was christened. Rob and Paul had no idea how to launch a brand or set up a company, but they didn't let that stop them. \"Our parents had a fearless approach. As children, nothing was ever a drama. We just rocked up in India with no plans. A lot of people wouldn't be able to live with that situation but that has helped us with what we are doing now,\" says Rob, 26, whose dyed black hair and skinny jeans are more student than chief executive. The Forkans spent time on the internet working out how to get their flip-flops made, eventually finding a supplier via Alibaba.com, the online wholesale search engine. With boxes of footwear piled up in the flat, the brothers set up a website, and tried selling flip-flops at the beach. With sales going nowhere, the next step was to approach stores. On their first outing, an independent shop in Spitalfields, east London, took an order and the Forkans realised they were on to something. Throughout 2011 they built up to 40 small outlets. Their next target was major retailers, and they employed some serious south London cheek teamed with branded cupcakes to get their flip-flop in the door. They sent a pair of Gandys to Philip Green, the boss of Topshop owner Arcadia, hoping their shared Croydon roots might help. When they couldn't get an appointment, the Forkans hung around in the lobby of Arcadia's head office until someone agreed to see them. They persuaded Branson to wear a pair of Gandys by promising to name their red variety of flip-flops after Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, which he owns, and inviting his PRs to one of their launch parties. \"We are quite relentless in our approach. We have seen how quickly circumstances can change in life and don't for a moment take for granted or go to sleep with what we are doing,\" Rob said. When it came to finding investment to help secure supplies for larger retailers last year, the brothers tracked down wealthy entrepreneurs featured in newspaper articles and TV shows. \"We wrote to them and said, 'Why should we let you get involved in what we are doing?'\" said Rob. The plan resulted in a \u00a3250,000 investment from Dominic List, a successful young IT entrepreneur who had been on the TV show Secret Millionaire and is now finance director of the company. The rest of Gandys' now 20-strong team, based in south-west London, are mostly young people with enthusiasm but little expertise, according to Rob. Sales have increased from 70,000 in 2011 to 250,000 this year and are forecast to reach 400,000 to 500,000 next year. The flip-flops cost about \u00a320 with a buy two pairs, get one free discount. Sales have paid for medical supplies and the recruitment of a teacher in Goa where the Forkans once lived. Now they are selling globally via their website and trying to get listed by retailers outside Britain. The aim is to raise enough for the planned Goa orphanage. Beyond that, projects will be voted for by customers and staff. \"The brand is creating a community and getting people involved. It's how we are growing so quickly, using the power of people,\" said Rob. \"If we build it to the level we think we can, like Havaianas (the Brazilian flip-flop brand), the impact could be huge.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Friday that it was on course for a substantial loss this year, dashing any remaining hopes of a return to the private sector until after the 2015 election. Announcing that \u00a338bn of troublesome loans would be ringfenced within the bank, the new chief executive Ross McEwan heralded a \"resetting\" of the often fraught relationship with the Treasury \u2013 owner of 81% of the shares \u2013 and the Bank of England, which regulates the bank and is poised to impose tougher rules on capital. McEwan who took the helm only a month ago after Stephen Hester was ousted in the summer, said he wanted to end the \"weariness\" and \"defensiveness\" that had crept into RBS. He is embarking on a review of all the bank's operations \u2013 including its troublesome Ulster operations in Ireland and the already-scaled back investment bank \u2013 which will be announced in February. He will accelerate the sale of the US arm, Citizens. \"The bar for RBS is higher than for any other bank because we got saved by the UK government,\" said McEwan. A highly critical report into its lending to small business found it turning away three out of every four applications for business loans and acting too aggressively towards customers in difficulty. Unions feared a new wave of job cuts on top of 30,000 already axed since the 2008 bailout. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: \"Management claim that customer service is a priority for the bank and its reputation depends on it but RBS has cut staff numbers to the bone.\" RBS shares were the second biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 7.5% at 340p \u2013 well below the 500p average price the taxpayer spent \u00a345bn buying them for \u2013 after the bank reported a third-quarter loss of more than \u00a3600m. Demonstrating a thawing of relations with the new boss, Chancellor George Osborne was at the London office of RBS for the announcement of the result of the review he had commissioned into whether the bank should be split up. The study by financial advisers Rothschild, estimated to have cost \u00a39m, stepped back from a full break-up and creation of a \"bad bank\" suggested by senior figures such as former chancellor, Lord Lawson and former Bank of England governor Lord King. Instead, about \u00a338bn of troublesome loans \u2013 including \u00a39bn from Ulster Bank \u2013 will be placed into a new non-core division to be known as the capital resolution division, which the bank aims to wind down in three years. This will mean writing off up to \u00a34.5bn of problem loans in the next quarter \u2013 driving the bank to a \"substantial loss\" for the full year. But some \u00a311bn of capital should be released as a result. McEwan insisted the government had not forced RBS into the new-look non-core bank, saying it had to listen major shareholders. \"If you were a hedge fund and had 81% of the business you'd want to be having good conversations,\" he said. Commissioned following a recommendation by the parliamentary commission on banking , the review concluded the \"effort, risk and expense involved in the creation of an external bad bank is not justified\". A 150 page document published by the Treasury said creating bad bank would \"do more harm than good\". Labour MP Pat McFadden, who sat on the commission, said the outcome \"simply changes the name plate on what was already happening\". Lord McFall, also on the commission, said on Twitter it was the \"status quo w[ith] frills\". But Osborne said the bank was now set on a \"new direction\", to focus on the UK and small business lending and become a bank that would be \"batting for Britain\". A sale of the government's stake was unlikely to happen before the May 2015 election, Osborne said. Sir Philip Hampton, RBS chairman who had previously indicated a sale could start next year, said that since its bailout RBS had pumped \u00a315bn into Ulster bank, paid out more in compensation to customers and paid fees to the government which should be taken into account when assessing its share performance. McEwan's aim is \"to dispel any suggestions that RBS is travelling light on capital\" at a time when the Bank of England is preparing to force all UK banks to hold more capital and more quickly than international regulations require. It is aiming for a 12% ratio in three years. The Treasury said the bank needed to \"accommodate any additional headwinds which may adversely affect their capital resources, for example future costs of redress\". The bank took a fresh provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling of \u00a3250m \u2013 taking its total bill so far to \u00a32.65bn, and admitted it was involved in new investigation into alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets. RBS is now in discussions about releasing the dividend access share that would have forced the bank to pay dividends \u2013 when it could afford them \u2013 to the government before its other shareholders. An \u00a38bn contingent capital facility which required the government to pump more money into the bank if its capital ratio fell is now being repaid a year early.",

The Treasury said the bank needed to \"accommodate any additional headwinds which may adversely affect their capital resources, for example future costs of redress\".</p> <p>The bank took a fresh provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling of \u00a3250m \u2013 taking its total bill so far to \u00a32.65bn, and admitted it was involved in new investigation into alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets.</p> <p>RBS is now in discussions about releasing the dividend access share that would have forced the bank to pay dividends \u2013 when it could afford them \u2013 to the government before its other shareholders.</p> <p>An \u00a38bn contingent capital facility which required the government to pump more money into the bank if its capital ratio fell is now being repaid a year early.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's manufacturers enjoyed rising export demand and hired new workers in October, according to a survey. The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI report suggested export orders grew at their fastest pace in more than two years, although overall activity rose at a slightly softer pace. Although manufacturing output remains well below the level enjoyed before the recession, it notched up its seventh straight month of improvement with a reading of 56.0.

The survey suggested manufacturing employment rose for the sixth consecutive month as total new orders for the sector continued to rise. Within that, export orders increased at the fastest pace since February 2011 as companies reported growing demand from Asia, the US, mainland Europe, Ireland, the Middle East and Russia.
