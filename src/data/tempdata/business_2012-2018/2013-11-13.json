    "webTitle": "Bank of England in no hurry to raise low interest rates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise interest rates during the key pre-election year of 2014 despite being taken aback by the strength of the economy's recovery over the past three months. Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, said recovery had \"finally taken hold\" but that Threadneedle Street believed an early end to ultra-low interest rates would threaten business and consumer confidence. Carney stressed that the Bank could deal with the threat of a house-price bubble without the need for dearer borrowing and that there was no guarantee its nine-strong monetary policy committee would raise rates even when unemployment fell to 7%, the level at which an increase in the cost of borrowing will first be discussed under the governor's forward guidance plan. The Bank's new forecasts suggest that the jobless rate will hit the 7% threshold in the final three months of next year, rather than early 2016, raising the prospect of the MPC discussing an increase in interest rates from their historic low of 0.5% during the highly charged months leading up to the general election of 2015. But Carney said: \"It is important to remember that the unemployment threshold is a staging post for assessing policy, not a trigger for an automatic increase in Bank rate. When the threshold is reached, the MPC will set policy to balance the outlook for inflation against the need to provide continued support to the recovery in output and employment.\" The Bank was eager to play down City fears that the rosier outlook for the economy would trigger an early end to the 0.5% official interest rate that has been in force since early 2009. Official data on Wednesday showed an extra 177,000 people in work in the three months to September and the unemployment rate down from 7.8% to 7.6%. Shares fell sharply, with the near 100-point drop in the FTSE 100 index the biggest one-day drop since August. But Carney said a sustainable recovery required confidence that the stimulus would be continued in the face of poor prospects for UK exporters, government austerity and the desire of households to pay down high debt levels. \"Our forward guidance means the MPC will not even consider raising Bank rate, at least until the unemployment rate reaches 7%. Through that guidance, we are giving businesses and households the confidence that interest rates won't go up until jobs, incomes and spending are recovering at a sustainable pace.\" Carney said that without the Bank's forward guidance there would already be pressure from the City for policy to be tightened. \"With the recovery taking hold, our task now is to secure it. The Bank will remain vigilant to risks to financial stability from the housing sector, in particular from rapid increases in house prices and household leverage. We have a direct line of sight on the housing market across all of our responsibilities, and any potential risks will in the first instance be addressed by the financial policy committee.\" Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the Bank's forecasts showing that the economy is on course to grow by more than 3% next year, but said that there was no recovery for millions of families. \"As the governor is rightly warning, prices are still rising faster than wages and new figures today show working people are on average \u00a31,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office.\" While ministers will be hoping that the Bank can avoid raising rates this side of polling day, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said they would eventually have to rise. \"I really don't think it helps for me to start trying to second-guess how interest rates may or may not be set in the future. All I would say is that interest rates are at an unprecedentedly low level because of the unprecedented economic challenges the country has faced. We are going through abnormal times and so interest rates have been set at very unusually low levels.\" The Office for National Statistics said unemployment using the internationally agreed labour force survey measure fell by 48,000 to 2.47 million in the three months to September. But the official data showed cost pressures from the labour market are still abating despite the increased availability of jobs. The ONS said average earnings in the quarter ending September were 0.7% higher than in the same period of 2012 \u2013 a 0.1 point drop compared with the three months ending in August 2013. Foreign exchange Mark Carney, the first non-Briton to head the Bank of England, has confirmed that he plans to become a British citizen. The Canadian told Channel 4 News that he would take up British citizenship when he meets the residency requirement near the end of his term as governor. The term is usually eight years, but the chancellor, George Osborne, told parliament Carney indicated he intended to serve for five years and to stand down at the end of June 2018. Carney has been married to his British wife for 18 years. He has also held Irish citizenship since 1988, when he started working for Goldman Sachs in London, according to the Financial Times.",

But Carney said a sustainable recovery required confidence that the stimulus would be continued in the face of poor prospects for UK exporters, government austerity and the desire of households to pay down high debt levels.</p> <p>\"Our forward guidance means the MPC will not even consider raising Bank rate, at least until the unemployment rate reaches 7%. Through that guidance, we are giving businesses and households the confidence that interest rates won't go up until jobs, incomes and spending are recovering at a sustainable pace.\"</p> <p>Carney said that without the Bank's forward guidance there would already be pressure from the City for policy to be tightened. \"With the recovery taking hold, our task now is to secure it. The Bank will remain vigilant to risks to financial stability from the housing sector, in particular from rapid increases in house prices and household leverage. We have a direct line of sight on the housing market across all of our responsibilities, and any potential risks will in the first instance be addressed by the financial policy committee.\"</p> <p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the Bank's forecasts showing that the economy is on course to grow by more than 3% next year, but said that there was no recovery for millions of families.</p> <p>\"As the governor is rightly warning, prices are still rising faster than wages and new figures today show working people are on average \u00a31,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office.\"</p> <p>While ministers will be hoping that the Bank can avoid raising rates this side of polling day, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said they would eventually have to rise. \"I really don't think it helps for me to start trying to second-guess how interest rates may or may not be set in the future. All I would say is that interest rates are at an unprecedentedly low level because of the unprecedented economic challenges the country has faced. We are going through abnormal times and so interest rates have been set at very unusually low levels.\"</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said unemployment using the internationally agreed labour force survey measure fell by 48,000 to 2.47 million in the three months to September. But the official data showed cost pressures from the labour market are still abating despite the increased availability of jobs. The ONS said average earnings in the quarter ending September were 0.7% higher than in the same period of 2012 \u2013 a 0.1 point drop compared with the three months ending in August 2013.</p> <h2>Foreign exchange<br></h2> <p>Mark Carney, the first non-Briton to head the Bank of England, has confirmed that he plans to become a British citizen. The Canadian told Channel 4 News that he would take up British citizenship when he meets the residency requirement near the end of his term as governor. The term is usually eight years, but the chancellor, George Osborne, told parliament Carney indicated he intended to serve for five years and to stand down at the end of June 2018.</p> <p>Carney has been married to his British wife for 18 years. He has also held Irish citizenship since 1988, when he started working for Goldman Sachs in London, according to the Financial Times. <strong> </strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's has written off plans for 15 new supermarkets, incurring a cost of \u00a392m. The announcement came as the chain revealed a better than expected rise in profits, resulting in its shares rising by 3%, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE on Wednesday. Sainsbury's has moved ahead of rival Morrisons in terms of profitability for the first time and reclaimed its position as the UK's second biggest grocer a decade after falling behind Asda. It is the only one of the UK's big four supermarket chains to increase market share in the past year in the face of strong competition from discounters such as Aldi and upmarket stores such as Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Pre-tax profits, before one-off costs, rose 7% to \u00a3400m in the six months to the end of September. The company said that underlying sales growth, plus \u00a355m in cost cuts and the addition of more convenience stores, which are more profitable than large outlets, all helped boost the bottom line. Total sales rose 4.4% to nearly \u00a314bn . Justin King, the chief executive, said he believed the supermarket was doing well because customers liked its mix of competitive prices and values, such as using ethical or British producers. \"We believe our values make us different and customers give us credit for that,\" he said. He denied that sales had been boosted by any rise in prices relative to competitors. \"I categorically say that our prices are more competitive today than they have ever been ,\" he said. But the supermarket warned that its underlying sales growth was likely to slow in the next six months, particularly in the quarter to March. \"The consumer backdrop remains challenging,\" said King. \"The reality for individual consumers is that they are not seeing more money in their pockets as inflation is growing faster than wages.\" He said consumers were still feeling gloomy, if better than last year, and he expected that to continue into 2014. \"We are planning our business on the basis that we won't get any help from consumers getting richer,\" he said. Despite that, King expects consumers to spend heavily on Christmas after carefully saving for the event throughout the year. He said they would look to save money by buying more own-label goods, which already make up more than half Sainsbury's sales. Own-label food has been increasing at twice the pace of branded goods at Sainsbury's but the retailer admitted that sales of its cheapest range, Basics, had dropped back. The range is currently being relaunched with some new products, including non-food for the first time, while some food items have been down-sized and offered at a lower price, in the face of heavy competition from the likes of Aldi and major rival such as Morrisons and Tesco which have both recently revamped their cheapest own-label ranges. John Rogers, the finance director, said Sainsbury's had written off \u00a392m relating to property because it had decided not to go ahead with plans to open supermarkets on 15 sites, mostly redevelopments of land close to town centres, because changes to planning regulations meant it was easier to open out of town. However, Sainsbury's continues to open about 10 new large stores a year and at least two convenience stores a week.",

He said they would look to save money by buying more own-label goods, which already make up more than half Sainsbury's sales.</p> <p>Own-label food has been increasing at twice the pace of branded goods at Sainsbury's but the retailer admitted that sales of its cheapest range, Basics, had dropped back.</p> <p>The range is currently being relaunched with some new products, including non-food for the first time, while some food items have been down-sized and offered at a lower price, in the face of heavy competition from the likes of Aldi and major rival such as Morrisons and Tesco which have both recently revamped their cheapest own-label ranges.</p> <p>John Rogers, the finance director, said Sainsbury's had written off \u00a392m relating to property because it had decided not to go ahead with plans to open supermarkets on 15 sites, mostly redevelopments of land close to town centres, because changes to planning regulations meant it was easier to open out of town.</p> <p>However, Sainsbury's continues to open about 10 new large stores a year and at least two convenience stores a week.</p>",

MPC members agreed that unemployment was a strong indicator of slack in the economy.

Effectively he pledged that borrowing costs won't rise until the UK jobless rate drops to 7% (<em>from 7.7% a month ago</em>), which Carney didn't see happening until 2016.</p> <p>Since then, a rich seam of solid economic data has shown that Britain's economy is performing better than most analysts thought in August. So the Bank is likely to upgrade its growth forecasts, and could also predict that unemployment will fall faster than previously expected.</p> <p><strong>And that could fuel predictions that UK interest rates will finally rise from their record low of 0.5% somewhat earlier than 2016</strong>.</p> <p>The unemployment data, meanwhile, is expected to show another drop in the number of people signing on for the Jobseeker's Allowance in October. The headline jobless rate is expected to stay at 7.7% for the three months to September.</p> <p>Michael Hewson of CMC helpfully rounds up the recent figures:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest&#xa0;unemployment&#xa0;numbers look set to show the&#xa0;ILO September&#xa0;unemployment&#xa0;rate stuck at 7.7%&#xa0;despite double digit falls in jobless claims numbers for the last four months.</p> <p>Claims numbers for October&#xa0;are expected to show another&#xa0;double digit decline of 33k, following on from declines of 41.7k, 32.6k, 29.2k and 21.2k, in previous months.</p> </blockquote> <p>But with pay still lagging behind inflation (which fell to 2.2% yesterday), it may not feel like a recovery to many.</p> <p><em><strong>We'll be tracking all the events through the day...</strong></em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-13T07:42:19.086Z\">at 7.42am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Investors had expected the Fed to begin winding down its $85bn a month bond buying programme next year, but there are growing hints it might end sooner. Meanwhile the UK economy appears to be growing more strongly than expected, bringing forward the prospect of rising interest rates. Conversely, the European Central Bank could yet buy assets from banks and sanction negative deposit rates, according to board member Peter Praet. So here are the market movements: \u2022 The FTSE 100 is down 96.79 points or 1.44% at 6630.00, its biggest one day fall since 15 August \u2022 Germany's Dax has dropped 0.24% to 9054.83 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.56% lower at 4239.94 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1.43% to 18,733.02 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended down 0.33% at 9675.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 50 points or 0.32% lower. On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow for another busy day. Something to please Mark Carney (probably): Meanwhile, in Madrid...... Over in Greece, the country is said to be on track to balance its budget this year. According to deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras, the recovery has been helped by a recovery in tax revenues. AP has the story: Staikouras said the country was expected to post a budget surplus of about \u20ac345m before interest payments this year a key target set by bailout lenders. The January-October balance stood at \u20ac1.1bn, Staikouras said, after traditionally weak tax revenues came in \u20ac250m above target, at \u20ac35.59bn for the 10-month period. \"It seems that the country will meet its national target. Of course, this is due to the enormous sacrifices made by Greeks, unprecedented in post-war Europe,\" Staikouras said. Unemployment in Greece is nearing 28%, amid rapidly increasing poverty due to years of austerity measures imposed in exchange for the bailout program worth \u20ac240bn. Greece is currently in talks with bailout inspectors to try and resolve a disagreement over 2014 budget cuts and how to ease government protection for distressed mortgages. The left-wing opposition Syriza described the negotiations as a sham. \"These negotiations with the Europeans are a charade. The (government) is in fact reciting its loyalty to its lenders,\" a party statement said. \"Its goal was and remains the resolute implementation of bailout commitments with no consideration for the social cost.\" The euro has come under pressure after an ECB board member hinted the central bank could authorise negative interest rates or buying assets from banks to hit its inflation target. Peter Praet told the Wall Street Journal: If our mandate is at risk we are going to take all the measures that we think we should take to fulfil that mandate. That's a very clear signal. The balance sheet capacity of the central bank can also be used. This includes outright purchases that any central bank can do. The ECB cut interest rates to 0.25% last week and kept the deposit rate at zero. Praet said: On standard measures, interest rates, we still have room and that would also include the deposit facility. Over in Ireland, some good employment news. Henry McDonald, Ireland Correspondent, writes: Belfast's iconic shipbuilding firm that constructed the Titanic has given Northern Ireland's economy a temporary boost with the creation of 600 short term skilled jobs. Harland and Wolff, whose giant yellow cranes dominate the Belfast skyline, announced today that they are recruiting the extra skilled tradesmen to work on one of the largest oil rigs ever built in its shipyard. The 360 ft tall Blackford Dolphin offshore drill platform is currently on its way from Brazil to Belfast where it will undergo maintenance work at the yard where the Titanic was made. David McVeigh, head of sales and marketing at Harland and Wolff, said the contract was on such a large scale and completed within such a tight time frame, that the 600 additional workers had to be found in a relatively short period of time. \"Harland and Wolff continues to compete successfully in a sector which has seen competition grow,\" said McVeigh. \"Apart from being able to exceed stringent health and safety element requirements for such contracts, H&amp;W is also capable of great flexibility which means we can put 600 contractors from electrical, welding, engineering and painting disciplines in place in a short time.\" The shipyard now concentrates on maintaining and repairing oil rigs rather than ships. Its giant Samson and Goliath cranes will have to be moved out of their current positions along tracks to the end of the building dock for the estimated 50 days of work on the Blackford Dolphin rig. Our Data Blog has pulled together statistics on the unemployment figures: The unemployment rate dropped from 7.8% in the three months to June to 7.6% \u2013 its lowest level in four years, but what has happened to the claimant count? Using the October 2013 figures from Nomis, the map shows the numbers by each local authority. The data is here: UK unemployment mapped The FTSE 100 is on course for its worse one day fall in months. It is 105 points or 1.57% lower which would be its biggest drop since 20 June, if it ends like this. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 90 points lower, so there will be no help for the bulls from that direction. The falls are being driven by the feeling that central banks could finally start switching off the money taps, which have been providing support for the markets for what seems like forever. On Tuesday US Federal Reserve member Dennis Lockhart - seen as being in the centre as far as the policy debate goes - suggested there was a possibility the bank could reduce its $85bn a month bond buying programme at its December meeting. Most observers had still been banking on no change to the stimulus programme until next year. Meanwhile, as we have been reporting this morning, the Bank of England may also raise rates sooner than had been anticipated. On the Bank of England's raised growth forecasts, our economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports: The Bank of England expects to consider raising interest rates in 2015, a year earlier than expected, following a sharp fall in unemployment. But the bank tempered expectations of an early increase with the warning that the recovery remained fragile and rates could still remain low for several years. Governor Mark Carney said he expected growth to remain modest over the next couple of years while the economy continues to be hampered by a weak banking sector and stumbling overseas markets. Speaking after publication of the central bank's quarterly inflation report, Carney played down concerns that the current 0.5% base rate would rise before real incomes begin to rise and the recovery is secured. \"The economy is growing robustly as lifting uncertainty and thawing credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand. But significant headwinds \u2013 both at home and abroad \u2013 remain, and there is a long way to go before the aftermath of the financial crisis has cleared and economic conditions normalise,\" he said in the report. \"That underpins the monetary policy committee's (MPC) intention to maintain the exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy until there has been a substantial reduction in the degree of economic slack.\" In August the BoE said as part of its new policy of forward guidance that it would not consider raising interest rates before unemployment fell to 7%. MPC members agreed that unemployment was a strong indicator of slack in the economy. Figures for August show that rate has fallen to 7.6% following an unexpectedly sharp rise in job recruitment over the previous three months. In response the BoE said there was now a three in five chance that the UK unemployment rate would hit 7% in mid-2015 compared to a previous prediction of late 2016. Deputy governor Charlie Bean said forward guidance was still pointing to a rate rise later rather than sooner. He said: \"The key message is that policy is not going to be related to growth rates but the elimination of slack.\" Here's the full story: Interest rates could rise in 2015 \u2013 BoE The other big news story of the day is the drop in UK unemployment, to a four-year low of 7.6%. Economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Britain's rising population means that a record number of people \u2013 29.95 million \u2013 are in work but the employment rate remains lower than it was before the deep recession of 2008-09. The current rate of 71.8% compares with 73% at the peak in early 2008 but above the trough of 70.8% reached in 2011. The bulk of the jobs created in the latest three months were full time but a record 1.46 million people were working part time because they could not find a full-time job. Unemployment as measured by the number of people out of work and claiming eligible benefits dropped by 41,700 in September to 1.3 million.

Shares are still lower in London, with the FTSE 100 down 107 points... GW As well as the departure of Sir Hector Sants, Barclays has also reported that chief operations and technology officer, Shaygan Kheradpir, is leaving the company. Here's the bank's statement: Hector Sants has been on sick leave since the beginning of October, suffering from stress and exhaustion. He has concluded that he will not be able to return to work in the near term. Consequently he has decided to resign from Barclays and not return from sick leave. Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Operations and Technology Officer, is leaving Barclays to take on a role as CEO for a company based in the United States. An internal and external search will be launched for both posts. In the meantime Allen Meyer, Head of Compliance, Corporate and Investment Banking will act as Interim Head of Compliance and Government and Regulatory Relations. Darryl West, Barclays\u2019 Chief Information Officer, will act as Interim Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer. In these posts both will join the Executive Committee and report to Group Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins. Sir Hector Sants, the former head of the UK's Financial Services Authority, has stepped down from his role as head of compliance at Barclays, my colleague Jill Treanor reports. This comes a month after Sants began a \"leave of absence\" after being diagnosed with exhaustion and stress. Over in Brussels, the European Commission has - as anticipated - launched an inquiry into the German trade surplus. In a new report, the EC said it would launch an \"in-depth review\" of both Germany and Luxembourg. It plans to: better scrutinise their external position and analyse internal developments, and assess whether any of these countries is experiencing imbalances. It explained that the German trade surplus has exceeded the EC's 'threshold' (6% of national GDP) each year since 2007, so it clearly isn't a short-term problem. This means Germany becomes one of 16 Member States who are being probed for imbalances (many others face questions over current account deficits, losses of competitiveness and debt and deficit levels). This chart shows the differences between EU member states: Germany's defenders say it should not be blamed for running a successful export sector, and suggest that other countries could learn a few lessons. Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso sounded conciliatory at a press briefing in Brussels, saying: Europe needs more Germanys. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann has already warned that Germany shouldn't be penalised, according to this Reuters newsflash: \u2022 WEIDMANN SAYS ANSWER TO GERMANY'S CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS CANNOT BE TO MAKE GERMAN COMPANIES LESS COMPETITIVE Here's some economist reaction: David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce: We support Governor Carney\u2019s statement that the pressure on living standards can only be addressed when productivity increases. Simply raising wages before this happens would make businesses uncompetitive and threaten the recovery. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: The message coming loud and clear from the Bank of England is that it remains in no hurry at all to raise interest rates despite the economy\u2019s improved performance and a likely significantly faster fall in unemployment than the central bank had previously expected. It is clear that the Bank of England wants to give the economy every chance to develop sustainable decent growth and not to risk choking it off by any premature increasing of interest rates. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank: The BoE signalled its first rate hike might come in 2015, rather than late 2016 as it had previously said, in its quarterly forecast update this morning..... We see a 70% chance that unemployment falls to the 7% threshold by Q3 2015, compared to the BoE\u2019s 50% chance. So while they have moved towards our view and the market, they still have some way to go. The risks are probably that the BoE is underestimating the speed at which the economy can recover. With loose policy, falling uncertainty and booming house prices, the recovery could snowball and more than 3% growth next year is not impossible. There are downside risks too of course, that we should not forget, but they seem to be diminishing. The pound has rallied by around 0.5% today, following the Bank of England's new forecasts and this morning's drop in UK unemployment (see 9.30am onwards). It's gained three quarters of a cent, against the US dollar to $1.5977. Shares, though, are down in London as traders anticipate monetary policy being tightened more quickly. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 93 points, or 1.39%, to 6633. Financial stocks are among the fallers -- with RSA Insurance down 3.8%, Standard Chartered down 3.4% and Barclays losing 3.1%. So, to quickly recap. \u2022The Bank of England has raised its economic forecasts, concluding that Britain's output will rise faster than expected this year and in 2014. This will help to pull down the UK unemployment rate, with a roughly 40% chance that it will be 7% by the end of next year. \u2022 Governor Mark Carney said the UK recovery had \"finally taken hold\", but warned that it needs to become \"strong and sustained\" to get more people into work, and to drive wages higher. For the first time in a long time you don't have to be an optimist to see the glass is half full. The recovery has finally taken hold. This chart shows how the BoE sees more chance of the jobless rate hitting 7% soon: \u2022 Carney defended his 'forward guidance' on interest rates, which states that borrowing costs won't rise until the jobless rate has hit 7%. He said the pledge had helped to sustain the recovery, and did not mean that a rate rise was inevitable once the 7% rate has been hit. He said: There was always going to be movement in the timing of when potentially the unemployment threshold was reached .. but what's important is two things. One is what we learn between now and when that threshold is achieved, what we learn about the economy, what we learn about how much extra slack there is in the economy. And secondly what the conditions are when it's achieved and we're providing the confidence to businesses and households that we will not even begin to think about moving interest rates until that threshold is achieved. \u2022 Carney was also asked about the UK housing market, and concerns of a bubble in London. He replied that the Bank is setting policy for the whole country, not \"inside the Circle Line\", adding: In terms of housing valuation there are clearly areas in the country where valuation is very elevated. What we are seeing across the UK is the greatest price momentum is for houses that are towards the upper end of the valuation spectrum. The bank, through the Financial Policy Committee, will be vigilant about potential risks there but we need to put the pickup in housing activity in perspective. Activity levels, while they've picked up, are still running at between two thirds or three quarters of historic averages in terms of whether its transactions or approvals, homebuilding, so there is some room for that to further pickup and that's the initial phase of this recovery. \u2022 And the Bank is still cautious about the situation in the eurozone, even though the 'pall' of uncertainty over the future of the euro has mostly lifted. Carney said the UK central bank isn't expecting a big pick-up in demand from Europe. And that's the end of the press conference - cue a brief burst of Beethoven* on the webcast feed. * - 9th Symphony, 2nd movement, rather awesome Several questions on the government's Help to Buy mortgage subsidy scheme. Observer economics editor Heather Stewart asks about the Treasury Select Committee's concerns (they want the Bank of England to clarify its role in the scheme). Carney says that the issue will be considered at the next meeting of the Financial Policy Committee (responsible for ensuring economic stability). He adds that the Bank has a range of ways to influence the housing market. Kathryn Hopkins of The Times raises the issue of gender targets (the Bank of England's senior ranks are dominated by men). Mark Carney replies that \"it is an objective of this institution to increase the diversity of our junior ranks, and senior ranks\". Appointments to the senior ranks are made by others, he points out (the Treasury picks the governor, and the members of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee), but the Bank can increase diversity at all levels. A review of the Bank's talent management and recruitment policies is underway, he adds, though he won't prejudge its conclusions Asked about the eurozone, Mark Carney says that the Bank of England only expects \"quite modest demand growth\" in this major export market. We do expect the removal, or reduction, of the pall of uncertainty that hung over businesses over the future of the eurozone, he adds. But Threadneedle Street is not relying on any meaningful recovery in Europe to drive this forwards. And that's why the GDP growth forecasts remain relatively modest compared to previous recoveries, he adds. How much credit does Mark Carney take for the recent pick-up in the UK economy, asks Channel 4's Faisal Islam. Governor Carney says that \"our view is that forward guidance is helpful to sustain the recovery, that's why we did it.\" You only see the value of it at events like today, and in meetings with people around the country. People understand that the Bank of England \"needs to see sustained momentum and the slack picked up\" before we would tighten monetary policy. The government's Funding for Lending scheme is also helping to support the recovery and provide support for bank balance sheets, Carney adds. Should the Bank's Financial Policy Committee act on the house price levels in London, the main topic of conversation at dinner parties in the capital? Carney says the Bank is looking at the bigger picture: We don't make policy for inside the Circle Line, we make it for the entire United Kingdom. And at this stage, the Bank isn't very worried about the housing market. He argues that expectations of future earnings can drive increased consumption levels, rather than the fact that people's houses are worth more (which doesn't deliver a real 'wealth effect' unless people can unlock the value). What would a more normal economy look like? Mark Carney says that as the economy 'heals', the natural rate of unemployment should return to the pre-crisis levels of around 5%. But to be a sustainable, we need to see growth in real wages (ie, pay rises need to beat inflation not lag behind it) to sustain consumption growth. Our economics editor Larry Elliott calls the Bank of England's forecasting record to account. Larry asks: You failed to spot the recession in 2008, you failed to spot the flat-lining economy in 2010, and now you've failed to spot the stronger recovery. How can we have any faith in the forecasts that underpin forward guidance? Carney defends the Bank's record, says that it's confident that it's predictions are on the right path. He adds, though, that he's trying to make the forecasts more transparent to that doubters can better understand the bank's thinking. He then bats the question over to chief economist Spencer Dale -- who says that weaker global demand was one reason the Bank's UK growth forecasts were too optimistic in the past. Dale also argues that the real power of forward guidance is that people understand the Bank's approach to monetary policy, rather than its forecasts. What on earth is the point of forward guidance on interest rates, asks Chris Giles of the FT, given the dramatic changes in the Bank of England's predictions. Imagine a world without forward guidance, replies Mark Carney. We've had an unexpectedly strong recovery - stronger than most analysts expected. If forward guidance wasn't introduced in August, the discussion would be 'is the Bank going to raise interest rates today'. No-one is asking that question today... ...and rightly so, Carney adds. A rate rise would mean the bank would \"take a recovery that has finally taken hold and pull the rug out from under it\". Here's the key quote from the Bank of England's report, declaring that the British recovery is, at last, underway: In the United Kingdom, recovery has finally taken hold. The economy is growing robustly as lifting uncertainty and thawing credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand. But significant headwinds \u2014 both at home and abroad \u2014 remain, and there is a long way to go before the aftermath of the financial crisis has cleared and economic conditions normalise. That underpins the MPC\u2019s intention to maintain the exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy until there has been a substantial reduction in the degree of economic slack. The pace at which that slack is eroded, and the durability of the recovery, will depend on the extent to which productivity picks up alongside demand. Productivity growth has risen in recent quarters, although unemployment has fallen by slightly more than expected on the back of strong output growth. The full quarterly inflation report is online here. What can the Bank of England do to close the gap between wages and inflation, asks Sky's Ed Conway. Carney replies that it is important that the recovery persists, and \"we need a pickup in business investment\" too. The Bank's pledge to keep interest rates at record lows at least until the jobless rate is 7% will also help, he adds. As expected, Mark Carney is having to defend his forward guidance policy on interest rates. Asked how people and businesses are supposed to plan for the future if the bank's forecasts change so much, governor Carney explains that his priority is to \"provide confidence\" that borrowing costs won't rise until the recovery is secured. Interest rates won't immediately rise when the jobless rate hits 7%, he insists. The Bank of England's Q&amp;A is being webcast here. Mark Carney is telling reporters in London that: For the first time in a long time, you don't need to be an optimist to see that the glass is half full. The recovery has taken hold. He's explaining that the Bank of England's job is to help secure the recovery, and make it strong enough to get more people back into work. The Bank of England has also raised its growth forecasts. It expects GDP to rise by 1.6% for 2013 as a whole, up from 1.4%. In 2014, it expects growth of 2.8%, up from 2.5% in the August report. It still expects growth of 2.3% in 2015. The Bank of England has just released its latest quarterly report on the UK economy. And it's raised its economic forecasts, saying that the unemployment rate will fall faster than it expected three months ago. There is a \"two in five chance\" that it could be 7% at the end of 2014, Mark Carney says. However, that doesn't mean interest rates would immediately rise (7% being the target in the Bank's forward guidance). It also believes that the inflation rate will fall to the 2% target faster than it thought in August. Here's the Reuters newsflashes: \u2022 BANK OF ENGLAND NOV INFLATION REPORT - UK RECOVERY HAS FINALLY TAKEN HOLD, ECONOMY GROWING ROBUSTLY BUT SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS REMAIN \u2022 BOE - MPC INTENDS TO KEEP EXCEPTIONALLY STIMULATIVE POLICY STANCE UNTIL SLACK HAS REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY 13-Nov-2013 \u2022 BOE - UNEMPLOYMENT LIKELY TO FALL MORE QUICKLY THAN FORECAST IN AUGUST, HITTING 7 PCT THRESHOLD WILL NOT NECESSARILY TRIGGER RATE RISE \u2022 BOE INFLATION REPORT SAYS MPC SEES 41 PCT CHANCE OF 7 PCT UNEMPLOYMENT AT END-2014, 57 PCT AT END-2015, 68 PCT AT END-2016 BASED ON MARKET INTEREST RATES The recovery in the UK unemployment rate comes as the Bank of England prepares to release its latest Quarterly Inflation Report (in just a couple of minutes). Having pinned UK interest rates to the jobless rate, will Mark Carney now say that the recovery is accelerating faster than he expected? We're about to find out.... Here's the political reaction to the news that Britain's unemployment rate has fallen to 7.6%, but that pay remains well below inflation (see 9.31am onwards for all the details). Minister for Employment Esther McVey This Government is delivering on its promise to rebalance the economy, promote job creation, and support people to get off benefits and into work. Today's figures show that the number of people in work has risen by more than a million under this Government, with the growth driven by full-time private sector jobs. At the same time, the number of people claiming the main out-of-work benefits has fallen by almost half a million. There's more work to do, and we are not complacent, but these are all very positive signs. Rachel Reeves MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Today\u2019s fall in unemployment is welcome, but families facing a cost-of-living crisis need a recovery that benefits them, and these figures show we are still far from achieving that. Prices have now risen much faster than wages for 40 of the 41 months since David Cameron became Prime Minister. On average working people are now over \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this out-of-touch Government. The employment figures give no cause for complacency. The number of people who want to work full-time but are stuck on part-time hours is at a record high. And youth unemployment is still at unacceptable and unaffordable levels with almost a million young people still out of work, while the number of young people unemployed for a year or more has gone up by 7,000 this quarter. The Tory-led Government\u2019s Work Programme and Youth Contract are failing \u2013 they should adopt Labour\u2019s compulsory jobs guarantee, funded by repeating the tax on bank bonuses, and limiting pension tax relief for the very highest earners. This would guarantee real paid work for young people unemployed for a year, or adults unemployed for two years \u2013 work they would have to take or lose benefits. Incidentally, we've just learned that September was a less cheery month for the eurozone. Factory output fell by 0.5%, rather worse than expected. Now this is interesting.... the ONS has also released an unofficial snapshot of the UK labour market just for September. It's more informal than the official data -- \"not designated as National Statistics\" as the jargon has it. But with that caveat duly noted.... the data shows that the jobless rate was just 7.1% in September itself (compared to 7.6% for the July-September quarter). It's online here.... That's much closer to the 7% target which the Bank of England has set as a milestone before interest rates could rise. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank says unemployment is falling faster than economists, or the Bank of England, expected -- but he is also concerned that wage growth is so weak. Wood comments: There is a lot of good news in this release for the UK economy. Stonking job gains show the UK is recovering rapidly. At the same time those jobs gains are not cutting unemployment as fast as might be expected because the workforce is rising rapidly. Unlike in the US, the UK participation rate is rising. People are competing for jobs rather than giving up and leaving the workforce. That is keeping wage growth very subdued. Many analysts concerned by the lack of progress in pay (with total weekly earnings up just 0.7% annually). As this graph shows, the UK unemployment rate has now dropped to its lowest in over four years - it hit 7.6% in May 2009, during the recession sparked by the financial crisis: This chart shows how the rise in the labour force was split between men and women, and between full-timer and part-time staff: At 29.95 million people, the UK workforce is now at a record high having jumped by 177,000 in the July-September quarter. However, this partly reflects increased population levels. The employment rate of 71.8% is not at a record high -- as this graph shows, it's still below its pre-crisis levels: It's moving the right way, though.... While the fall in the headline jobless rate is clearly welcome, the detail of the ONS report paints a more sober picture. For example, the number of people working part-time because they can't get full-time employment is at a record high. According to the ONS there were 1.46 million employees and self-employed people who were working part-time because they could not find a full-time job, the highest figure since records began in 1992. The full report from the Office for National Statistics is online here: Labour Market Statistics, November 2013 But while unemployment is down, pay packets are not yet feeling the benefits. Total pay, including bonuses, rose by 0.7% annually in September -- down from 0.8% in August. That's dwarfed by the 2.2% rise in inflation over the last year in Britain. Average pay fell year-on-year in the public sector. The ONS reported: Average weekly earnings for the private sector increased by 1.1% but average weekly earnings for the public sector fell by 0.4%. In September 2013 average pay including bonus payments in the private sector was \u00a3473 a week, \u00a314 a week lower than the public sector figure of \u00a3487 a week. However, excluding publicly owned financial corporations, average weekly pay in the public sector was only \u00a33 a week higher than for the private sector, at \u00a3476 a week. The UK claimant count is also down -- dropping by 41,700 people in October. That takes the claimant count rate down to 3.9%. The total number of people in work across the UK rose by 177,000 in the three months to September, taking the total to 29.953 million. That's the biggest jump since the June to August quarter. Breaking: the UK unemployment rate has fallen to 7.6% in the three months to September. The number of people out of work fell by 48,000 to 2.466m in the quarter, which Reuters says is the lowest level in three years. More to follow.... We get the latest UK unemployment data in less than 15 minutes time. As mentioned at the start, economists expect: \u2022 a drop in the claimant count of around 30,000 people in October (compared with 41k last month) \u2022 a rise in the number of people in work in the three months to September, of around 113,000 \u2022 No change to the unemployment rate, of 7.7% [which is crucial to UK monetary policy given the Bank of England's pledge not to raise rates till it hits 7%] \u2022 Another fall in real pay, with average weekly earnings expected to have risen by just 0.7% over the last year. In other words, some signs of recovery in the labour market, but no relief to the squeeze on living standards and wages. The youth unemployment data will also be scrutinised, with a new report warning that the jobless rate among young people has still risen despite the UK economy returning to growth. Bad economic data from the Netherlands -- retail sales tumbled by 6.1% year-on-year in September. European stock markets are in the red this morning, with the FTSE 100 shedding 47 points or 0.7%. Traders are blaming nervousness ahead of the Bank of England's inflation report (what will Mark Carney say about growth prospects and rate rises?), and another bout of jitters over when the US Federal Reserve will start to slow its own stimulus programme. There's also a knock-on effect from Asia. China's stock market shed 2% following the conclusion of the Beijing government's Plenary meeting where leaders pledged to give the markets a \"decisive role\" in the country's economic future. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says traders are disappointed by the rather general/vague Chinese statement in terms of its plan for the next decade. In the corporate world, Sainsbury's is getting into the early festive spirit with a 7% jump in profits, the top of analyst forecasts. The supermarket chain also reported that its market share was at its highest for a decade, but remained cautious about UK economic prospects. Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultants Retail Remedy, reckons \"The fairytale continues at Sainsbury's\", and predicts it will do well this Christmas. More here: Sainsbury's profit rise 7% as own-brand and online sales thrive Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit tweets that yesterday's drop in UK inflation, to 2.2%, gives Mark Carney and colleagues a little more room to manoeuvre. And as our economics editor Larry Elliott wrote yesterday, spending power is on the wane in many countries. Inflation fall shows effects of spending power squeeze Speaking of the eurozone, we get also industrial production data for September at 10am -- economists expect a 0.3% drop month-on-month. Germany's top central banker, Jens Weidmann, is giving a speech around noon GMT. Let's hope he comments on last week's ECB interest rate cut, given the Bundesbank chief is understood to have opposed it. Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, meanwhile is reported to be in Brussels - perhaps preparing for tomorrow's Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers. Yesterday, Stournaras denied that the Athens government and its troika inspectors were \"miles\" apart in their assessment of Greece's performance against its bailout programme. It's just meters, he insisted. Spain's annual inflation rate turned negative last month, according to new data that will heighten concerns that parts of the eurozone are slipping into deflation. The latest inflation data showed that the Spanish consumer prices index fell by 0.1% in October, on an annual basis. On a monthly basis, the CPI rose by 0.4%. On an 'EU harmonised basis', prices were flat year-on-year. We have seen a steady stream of low inflation rates recently (German's CPI fell to 1.2%), while the cost of living fell by 2.0% in Greece last month. Understandable, given sluggish demand, weak European growth and cash-strapped consumers. City traders are predicting the blue-chip Footsie index will drop by around 0.6%, when trading begins in a few minutes. Much was made of Mark Carney's Canadian background when he was named as Sir Mervyn King's successor. The FT has now discovered that he's also the proud holder of Irish citizenship too: Chris Giles reports: Since his arrival as governor of the Bank of England in July Mark Carney has had the luck of the Irish, enjoying rising growth, falling unemployment and rapidly moderating inflation. That cannot have been much of a surprise to the BoE or Treasury as on Tuesday night both confirmed that the Canadian running the old Lady of Threadneedle Street has also held Irish citizenship since 1988 when he started working for Goldman Sachs in London. More here: Mark Carney brings luck of the Irish to BoE And on the FT's front page: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. UK economics is centre-stage today, with the release of fresh unemployment data (at 9.30am) followed by the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report (from 10.30am). And what a difference three months makes. Back on August 7, governor Mark Carney pushed the Bank of England into a bold new era by setting 'forward guidance' on interest rates. Effectively he pledged that borrowing costs won't rise until the UK jobless rate drops to 7% (from 7.7% a month ago), which Carney didn't see happening until 2016. Since then, a rich seam of solid economic data has shown that Britain's economy is performing better than most analysts thought in August. So the Bank is likely to upgrade its growth forecasts, and could also predict that unemployment will fall faster than previously expected. And that could fuel predictions that UK interest rates will finally rise from their record low of 0.5% somewhat earlier than 2016. The unemployment data, meanwhile, is expected to show another drop in the number of people signing on for the Jobseeker's Allowance in October. The headline jobless rate is expected to stay at 7.7% for the three months to September. Michael Hewson of CMC helpfully rounds up the recent figures: The latest unemployment numbers look set to show the ILO September unemployment rate stuck at 7.7% despite double digit falls in jobless claims numbers for the last four months. Claims numbers for October are expected to show another double digit decline of 33k, following on from declines of 41.7k, 32.6k, 29.2k and 21.2k, in previous months. But with pay still lagging behind inflation (which fell to 2.2% yesterday), it may not feel like a recovery to many. We'll be tracking all the events through the day...",

We do not think 5.2% is a long term sustainable UK operating margin in a declining volume environment.  Tesco is still losing like for like sales in the UK, after excluding maturing stores, online, refits, and extensions. Meanwhile like for like costs are rising, due to inflation and to Tesco investing into staff, refits, and infrastructure. All of this implies that a flat operating margin of 5.2% needs a rising gross margin to offset costs and the impact of adverse operational gearing from falling sales. In a market with declining demand, rising capacity and intense discounter competition, we question the wisdom of dogmatically holding on to this target.  International is driving our downgrades and Ireland could be heading to a meltdown. The interim results highlighted how poor international has been performing with an on-going deterioration in trading. The interims showed every country in every region delivering like for like losses, with European trading profit down 70.8% at constant foreign exchange rates. Our updated forecasts reflect this poor performance and take account of our concerns for the second half. Ireland could be the next big disappointment. Recent market share data in Ireland saw Tesco losing 200 basis points of market share last quarter (source: Kantar) implying like for like sales were down around 6.5%. This is the 12th successive quarter of sales decline for Tesco. Ireland may be just 3.6% of sales but in profits, it is proportionately bigger and a profit collapse here, will move the dial on overall earnings per share.

Fearful that the Bank of England will be forced to respond to the bubble in the housing market? Starting to get alarmed by the prospect of servicing the big mortgage you have just taken out if borrowing costs were to rise? Well don't worry about a thing. The economy is not growing particularly quickly by historic standards. There is loads of slack in the labour market despite the big rise in employment seen in the three months to September. And Threadneedle Street is watching the housing market like a hawk, ready to pounce if things get too frothy. That was the gist of governor Mark Carney's comments when he presented the Bank's quarterly inflation report on Wednesday. Sure, the Bank continued its dismal recent forecasting record by being too pessimistic about the speed at which the jobless rate is coming down. True, unemployment will now fall to the Bank's 7% threshold much sooner than expected. But that doesn't mean that an increase in the cost of borrowing will automatically follow. It is clearly uncomfortable for the Bank that it has had to tear up its unemployment forecasts within three months of making them, but the governor believes that, without guidance, market interest rates would already be on the rise. Carney's aim is to provide fresh reassurance to those who have just clambered on to the first rung of the housing ladder that there will be no early rise in interest rates. The fact that inflation is coming down more quickly than the financial markets anticipated makes it easier to continue with stimulative policies for longer than would otherwise have been the case. The pledge to keep rates on hold means that the strong growth seen since the spring will continue into 2014. According to Carney, the pace of growth will slacken over the next months but the inability of the Bank to spot the recession of 2008 or the flat-lining of 2011-12 makes its views about the current state of the economy less than wholly reliable. For interest rates to stay low until the end of 2015, however, the economy has to perform the way the Bank expects. Provided inflation remains close to its 2% target, Carney will be under no pressure to raise borrowing costs even if strong growth reignites the housing market. The Bank will rely on its new financial policy committee to keep house price inflation in check by regulating borrowing and lending. Financial markets are far from convinced and these doubts will grow if the Bank is still underestimating the momentum in an economy that has been awash in cheap money for almost five years now. Any suggestion of overheating will lead to pressure for interest rates to be raised much more quickly. Which is why those treating Carney's forward guidance as gospel would be advised to show some caution.",

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England expects to consider raising interest rates in 2015, a year earlier than expected, following a sharp fall in unemployment.</p> <p>But the Bank tempered expectations of an early increase with the warning that the recovery remained fragile and rates could still remain low for several years.</p> <p>The Bank governor, Mark Carney, said he expected growth to remain modest over the next couple of years while the economy continues to be hampered by a weak banking sector and stumbling overseas markets.</p> <p>Speaking after publication of the central bank's quarterly inflation report, Carney played down concerns that the current 0.5% base rate would go up before real incomes began to rise and the recovery was secured.</p> <p>\"The economy is growing robustly as lifting uncertainty and thawing credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand. But significant headwinds \u2013 both at home and abroad \u2013 remain, and there is a long way to go before the aftermath of the financial crisis has cleared and economic conditions normalise,\" he said in the report.</p> <p>\"That underpins the monetary policy committee's (MPC) intention to maintain the exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy until there has been a substantial reduction in the degree of economic slack.\"</p> <p>In August the BoE said as part of its new policy of forward guidance that it would not consider raising interest rates before unemployment fell to 7%. MPC members agreed that unemployment was a strong indicator of slack in the economy. Figures for August show that rate has fallen to 7.6% after an unexpectedly sharp rise in job recruitment over the previous three months.</p> <p>In response the BoE said there was now a three in five chance that the UK unemployment rate would hit 7% in mid-2015, compared with a previous prediction of late 2016.</p> <p>Deputy governor Charlie Bean said forward guidance was still pointing to a rate rise later rather than sooner. He said: \"The key message is that policy is not going to be related to growth rates but the elimination of slack.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, City analysts jumped on the Bank's revised forecast, saying it showed that the economy was recovering strongly and would overheat without a rise in interest rates possibly as early as next year.</p> <p>David Nicholls, a manager at currency dealer UKForex, said: \"With the UK jobless rate falling, sustained positive data on British growth and a housing market that is defying gravity, the timetable for interest rate rises is being brought forward. If data continues to be strong, we expect the first rate hikes to be at the start of 2015.\"</p> <p>But business groups said they expected the bank to resist calls for an early rise, saying it was necessary for rates to remain low at least until the end of 2015.</p> <p>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Carney stressed that reaching the 7% threshold would not necessarily trigger a rise in interest rates, and this leads us to believe that there will be no increase until the end of 2015.</p> <p>\"This will provide stability for businesses to invest and create jobs. In the meantime, the MPC must continue to combine forward guidance with a commitment to maintaining economic stability.\"</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses said it also welcomed the governor's caution and called on the government to encourage business investment to prevent a return to low growth.</p> <p>Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, commenting on earlier jobs figures, said that falling unemployment disguised a worsening in the standard of living of most workers.</p> <p>\"Britain's workforce is getting larger but poorer. It is encouraging that more jobs are being created but job quality is falling and close to a 20-year low. A record number of people are stuck in part-time jobs because they can't find full-time work, while real wages continue to shrink fast despite falling inflation.\"</p> <p>Carney said concerns that the recovery was lopsided and favoured housing and finance over manufacturing and exports were misplaced. He said the recovery in the housing market was a positive sign that consumers were rediscovering their confidence in the economic outlook. He said the bank was monitoring the situation for signs of over-heating.</p> <p>He said: \"The greatest house price momentum is among houses in the upper value end of the market. We have a good line of sight on the housing market and we do look at measures of momentum and leverage and whether people are becoming over-extended. We don't just make policy for inside the Circle Line, but for the whole country.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We have a recovery that is centred on household spending. Three-quarters of growth over the next two quarters will come from household consumption or property-related consumption. That is not debt-fuelled consumption. It is out of income. So for that recovery to be sustained we need to see a rise in real incomes, which hasn't happened yet.\"</p>",

The Bank governor, Mark Carney, said he expected growth to remain modest over the next couple of years while the economy continues to be hampered by a weak banking sector and stumbling overseas markets. Speaking after publication of the central bank's quarterly inflation report, Carney played down concerns that the current 0.5% base rate would go up before real incomes began to rise and the recovery was secured. \"The economy is growing robustly as lifting uncertainty and thawing credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand. But significant headwinds \u2013 both at home and abroad \u2013 remain, and there is a long way to go before the aftermath of the financial crisis has cleared and economic conditions normalise,\" he said in the report. \"That underpins the monetary policy committee's (MPC) intention to maintain the exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy until there has been a substantial reduction in the degree of economic slack.\" In August the BoE said as part of its new policy of forward guidance that it would not consider raising interest rates before unemployment fell to 7%. MPC members agreed that unemployment was a strong indicator of slack in the economy. Figures for August show that rate has fallen to 7.6% after an unexpectedly sharp rise in job recruitment over the previous three months. In response the BoE said there was now a three in five chance that the UK unemployment rate would hit 7% in mid-2015, compared with a previous prediction of late 2016. Deputy governor Charlie Bean said forward guidance was still pointing to a rate rise later rather than sooner. He said: \"The key message is that policy is not going to be related to growth rates but the elimination of slack.\" Nevertheless, City analysts jumped on the Bank's revised forecast, saying it showed that the economy was recovering strongly and would overheat without a rise in interest rates possibly as early as next year. David Nicholls, a manager at currency dealer UKForex, said: \"With the UK jobless rate falling, sustained positive data on British growth and a housing market that is defying gravity, the timetable for interest rate rises is being brought forward. If data continues to be strong, we expect the first rate hikes to be at the start of 2015.\" But business groups said they expected the bank to resist calls for an early rise, saying it was necessary for rates to remain low at least until the end of 2015. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Carney stressed that reaching the 7% threshold would not necessarily trigger a rise in interest rates, and this leads us to believe that there will be no increase until the end of 2015. \"This will provide stability for businesses to invest and create jobs. In the meantime, the MPC must continue to combine forward guidance with a commitment to maintaining economic stability.\" The Federation of Small Businesses said it also welcomed the governor's caution and called on the government to encourage business investment to prevent a return to low growth. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, commenting on earlier jobs figures, said that falling unemployment disguised a worsening in the standard of living of most workers. \"Britain's workforce is getting larger but poorer. It is encouraging that more jobs are being created but job quality is falling and close to a 20-year low. A record number of people are stuck in part-time jobs because they can't find full-time work, while real wages continue to shrink fast despite falling inflation.\" Carney said concerns that the recovery was lopsided and favoured housing and finance over manufacturing and exports were misplaced. He said the recovery in the housing market was a positive sign that consumers were rediscovering their confidence in the economic outlook. He said the bank was monitoring the situation for signs of over-heating. He said: \"The greatest house price momentum is among houses in the upper value end of the market. We have a good line of sight on the housing market and we do look at measures of momentum and leverage and whether people are becoming over-extended. We don't just make policy for inside the Circle Line, but for the whole country.\" He added: \"We have a recovery that is centred on household spending. Three-quarters of growth over the next two quarters will come from household consumption or property-related consumption. That is not debt-fuelled consumption. It is out of income. So for that recovery to be sustained we need to see a rise in real incomes, which hasn't happened yet.\"",

      "bodyText": "The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain rose by 19% to 121,438 in the last year, according to the latest official labour market statistics. The 19,000 increase in the number of Romanians and Bulgarians employed in Britain is, however, overshadowed by figures showing that more than 90% of the 378,000 extra people in jobs in the UK in the past year are British nationals. The figures in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) quarterly survey demolish claims that the vast majority of new jobs have gone to foreigners. The ONS statistics show that 348,000 of the extra people in work in the 12 months to September are British citizens and only 26,000 are foreign nationals. The 19% rise in the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain comes ahead of the lifting of the final restrictions on their access to the UK labour market in the new year. UK and non-UK estimates do not equal the total number of people in employment because some people do not state their nationality in their interviews. Many of the Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain are employed through temporary work schemes, such as the seasonal agricultural workers' scheme for fruit and vegetable pickers, which have been running since the two countries joined the European Union in 2007. The schemes require them to return home at the end of their temporary contracts. The figures were released as the Daily Mail highlighted a claim by the former Labour home secretary Jack Straw that opening up the British labour market to Poles and other new European Union members in 2004 was a \"spectacular mistake\". The Mail's front-page story was based on a column by Straw published six days ago in the Lancashire Evening Telegraph that substantially repeated the acknowledgement of the \"mistake\" made by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in a party political broadcast earlier this year. David Blunkett, not Straw, was the home secretary at the time the decision was taken to allow Poles and others immediate access to the British labour market. He argued it was better they came legally than illegally. Illegal migration was a major concern at the time. Straw focused on the \"worthless\" forecast that Polish migration would be \"relatively small\". The Oxford-University-based Migration Observatory has pointed out the forecast was partly based on what had happened when Spain and Portugal joined the EU and assumed that all other EU states, including Germany, would open their borders to working Poles. As it happened only Britain, Ireland and Sweden gave them an immediate right to work. Romanians and Poles have faced restrictions on their access to the British labour market as part of a seven-year transition period since they joined the EU in 2007. More than 3 million Romanians left their country to work abroad in 2007, with the vast majority going to Spain or Italy. The latest ONS figures show there are 2.64 million foreign nationals working in Britain out of a total labour force of 30 million. More than half \u2013 1.45 million \u2013 are EU nationals working in Britain, 666,000 of whom are eastern Europeans. The number of migrant workers from outside Europe in Britain has fallen by 40,000 to 1.19 million in the past year. The largest falls have been in the number of workers from Africa \u2013 excluding South Africa \u2013 India and the US.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's jobless rate is edging closer to the 7% level that will prompt the Bank of England to consider higher borrowing costs following a fall of almost 50,000 in unemployment in the three months to September. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the recovery in the economy generated a sharp pickup in job creation during the summer with an extra 177,000 people in work. The unemployment rate dropped from 7.8% in the three months to June to 7.6% \u2013 its lowest level in four years \u2013 in the quarter ending in September following the 48,000 drop in joblessness to 2.47 million on the internationally agreed labour force survey measure. Threadneedle Street has said it will not start thinking about raising interest rates until the jobless rate has hit 7% unless there is a risk of higher inflation or overheating in the property market. But the ONS figures suggest cost pressures from the labour market are still abating despite the increased availability of jobs. The ONS said average earnings in the quarter ending September were 0.7% higher than in the same period of 2012 \u2013 a 0.1 point drop compared with the three months ending in August 2013. Britain's rising population means that a record number of people \u2013 29.95 million \u2013 are in work but the employment rate remains lower than it was before the deep recession of 2008-09.

    "webTitle": "SSE hikes shareholder payouts ahead of Friday's energy price rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Energy firm SSE has announced an inflation-busting dividend for shareholders just two days before it puts up customer bills by 8.2%. SSE's dividend to shareholders will go up by 3.2% to 26p a share, a healthy return above the 2.2% inflation rate. On Friday SSE's 10 million customers \u2013 largely in Scotland and southern England \u2013 will see their bills going up well above inflation, taking the average dual-fuel bill to \u00a31,380, in the same week that the National Audit Office warned of above-inflation energy bills until 2030. SSE made the case for higher bills in its first-half results on Wednesday morning, which showed a 12% fall in adjusted pre-tax profits to \u00a3354m for the six months to the end of September, compared with \u00a3400m last year. SSE said it made a \u00a389.4m loss on its retail business of selling energy to customers, blaming higher wholesale gas prices, as well as rising environmental, social and distribution costs. The firm made a \u00a3455m profit from running energy networks and \u00a3160m on its wholesale business, which generates electricity, produces and stores gas. SSE, which was fined a record \u00a310.5m by regulator Ofgem earlier this year for \"prolonged and extensive mis-selling\", also revealed it had lost 60,000 customers over the period. Company executives were forced on the defensive on Wednesday morning, insisting they put customers before shareholders. Alan Young, managing director of corporate affairs at SSE, admitted that standards in the industry needed to improve. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"If we don't have a decent relationship with customers we will lose the mandate to run the business.\" Young defended SSE's generous payouts to shareholders, after the company boasted in its latest annual report that it has paid above-inflation dividends every year since SSE was formed in 1998. \"SSE is a good performer when it comes to paying dividends, but those dividends have got a purpose,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we are able to continue to attract the investment \u2026 that is needed to make sure the UK has secure energy supplies for many years to come.\" The SSE chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies, told Radio 5 bills would be cut \u2013 \"no ifs, no buts\" \u2013 if the government's green levies were reduced. The big six energy companies have been calling on the government to shift the cost of green levies, which pay for free and subsidised home insulation, from their businesses to the taxpayer. Hard-pressed customers face further bad news as Whitehall's spending watchdog warned of 17 years of rising utility bills, while in a separate report, UBS analysts have warned that energy costs are set to rise by almost 50% by 2020. SSE kicked off the annual winter price hikes this year and has since been followed by British Gas, nPower, Scottish Power and EDF Energy \u2013 generating a political furore over soaring energy bills. The climate change and energy secretary, Ed Davey, became the latest to join the chorus of condemnation on Tuesday when he accused the big six of using customers as \"cash cows to be squeezed in pursuit of higher returns for shareholders\". The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, former prime minister John Major and the archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby have also weighed in against the energy companies, which the latest polls show are less trusted than banks and car salesman. E.ON, the only one of the big six not to have announced a price rise, is reported to be planning to reveal a 6.6% price increase later this month.",

The big six energy companies have been calling on the government to shift the cost of green levies, which pay for free and subsidised home insulation, from their businesses to the taxpayer.</p> <p>Hard-pressed customers face further bad news as Whitehall's spending watchdog warned of 17 years of rising utility bills, while in a separate report, UBS analysts have warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/fuel-bill-increases-edf-big-six\" title=\"\">energy costs are set to rise by almost 50% by 2020</a>.</p> <p>SSE kicked off the annual winter price hikes this year and has since been followed by British Gas, nPower, Scottish Power and EDF Energy \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">generating a political furore over soaring energy bills</a>.</p> <p>The climate change and energy secretary, Ed Davey, became the latest to join the chorus of condemnation on Tuesday when he accused the big six of using customers as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/11/ed-davey-public-trust-energy-companies\" title=\"\">cash cows to be squeezed in pursuit of higher returns for shareholders</a>\".</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, former prime minister John Major and the archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby have also weighed in against the energy companies, which the latest polls show are less trusted than banks and car salesman.</p> <p>E.ON, the only one of the big six not to have announced a price rise, is reported to be planning to reveal a 6.6% price increase later this month.</p>",
