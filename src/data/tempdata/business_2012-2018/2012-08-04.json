    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes asks why public money is being spent to build the Thames tunnel, which will benefit a debt-laden private water company", 
      "body": "<p>On the opening day of the 2012 Games, MP Simon Hughes, who represents a constituency just over the river from the Olympic Park, was fretting over a project that will cost nearly seven times more than the stadium. The \u00a33.6bn Thames tunnel \u2013 nicknamed the \"super sewer\" \u2013 is a source of great concern to the residents living above its planned 24-mile route from Acton in the west to Abbey Mills in the east. The story behind its funding and the financing of its user, Thames Water, is also likely to cause wrinkled noses, at a time at a time when public hostility to opaque tax affairs has never been stronger.</p> <p>Hughes points to the tarpaulin-covered mound scarring the riverfront of his Bermondsey constituency, marking the entry and exit point for the boring machines that will gouge out the tunnel, which is needed to prevent 39m tonnes of sewage leaking into the Thames every year. It will not only blight the area, says Hughes, but will cost customers of Thames Water and taxpayers dear.</p> <p>The MP is interested in the issue not only because the tunnel runs through his constituency but because Thames Water, which wants the tunnel to be built, has been paying very large dividends to its shareholders for several years while simultaneously running up huge debts.</p> <p>Why, asks Hughes, if Thames Water's dominant shareholder, the Australian bank Macquarie, has reaped millions of pounds in dividends from its investment, should the sewer be built with taxpayer support worth billions? \"Over the years Macaquarie has paid out very large dividends,\" says Hughes. \"If they had not done that they could have financed it from their own resources.\"</p> <p>An <em>Observer </em>investigation shows that in the five years to March 2012 Kemble Water Holdings, the Macquarie-led vehicle that owns Thames Water, paid out dividends to its investors of nearly \u00a3700m and, according to its cash flow statements, paid no net UK corporation tax, receiving instead a rebate of \u00a343.7m. Thames Water itself has declared total dividends of almost \u00a31.4bn for that period.</p> <p>\"It is clear from the accounts that a succession of owners have decided to award themselves huge payouts on borrowed money at a time when they should have been making long-term investments for the benefit of all of us,\" argues Hughes.</p> <p>He believes the company has benefited from a tax break sanctioned by industry regulator Ofwat in 2007, when it was allowed to add huge amounts of debt to its balance sheet. In March 2007 the company had debts of \u00a33.2bn but by March this year that had more than doubled to \u00a37.8bn. This restructuring enabled it to offset interest payments to reduce the amount of taxable profits.</p> <p>The move was given Ofwat's blessing because \"where capital restructuring may bring about tax efficiencies these would be passed to customers\". But Hughes, deputy leader of the Lib Dems, argues that customers are no better off and the company should not benefit from the public purse.</p> <p>Our analysis of Thames's accounts shows that the total dividend payments add up to nearly \u00a31.1bn. This excludes the two most recent interim dividend payments for 2012 of a further \u00a3301.4m, bringing Thames's total dividend payments to almost \u00a31.4bn over five years. Thames defends the dividends, saying some of the \u00a31.1bn was used to pay down debt (including \u00a3318m of interest payments on inter-company debts) as well as to compensate shareholders.</p> <p>Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, has accepted Thames's explanation. In a letter to Hughes she said the company only paid out unusually high dividends between 2006 and 2007 when \u00a3656.3m was paid to RWE, the then German owners who sold out to Macquarie. She adds that, according to regulated accounts, Thames paid a dividend of \u00a3222m in 2010 and \u00a3307.9m in 2009, payouts amply covered by after-tax profits of \u00a3331m and \u00a3314.8m.</p> <p>Thames's regulatory accounts may provide data relevant to watchdogs such as Ofwat, but our analysis is based on the statutory accounts, which look at the company as a whole and are more relevant to investors. They suggest the dividends were much larger \u2013 at \u00a3291.5m in 2010 and \u00a3398.9m in 2009. Over the two years they add up to \u00a3690.4m, exceeding Thames's after-tax profits of \u00a3645.8m.</p> <p>A Thames spokesman said its customers had benefited from its new-look finances. In its last five-yearly review Ofwat triggered clauses enabling it to claw back \"tax efficiencies\" generated by rising debts. The move, Thames said, effectively negated any notional benefits gained between 2007 and 2010: \"The amount allowed for tax in the regulatory price review for the 2010-2015 period was reduced as a result of additional financing costs in the period that arose from the 2007 refinancing. Therefore, customers have benefitted from the financing efficiencies in the current period.\"</p> <p>According to Ofwat, the average household water and sewerage bill for Thames Water customers was \u00a3322 in 2007 and \u00a3335 in 2012, accounting for inflation. That compares with an industry average of \u00a3360 in 2007 and \u00a3375 now.</p> <p>In theory, if water companies whittle down costs \u2013 even costs such as their tax bill \u2013 customers should benefit from lower bills. \"Efficiencies made in 2005-10 [at Thames] were passed back to customers in Ofwat's 2009 price review,\" said a spokesman for the watchdog.</p> <p>The Consumer Council for Water, a government body, has warned that \"there is no guarantee that the [cost of] Thames tunnel will not be subject to further escalation\".

      "bodyText": "On the opening day of the 2012 Games, MP Simon Hughes, who represents a constituency just over the river from the Olympic Park, was fretting over a project that will cost nearly seven times more than the stadium. The \u00a33.6bn Thames tunnel \u2013 nicknamed the \"super sewer\" \u2013 is a source of great concern to the residents living above its planned 24-mile route from Acton in the west to Abbey Mills in the east. The story behind its funding and the financing of its user, Thames Water, is also likely to cause wrinkled noses, at a time at a time when public hostility to opaque tax affairs has never been stronger. Hughes points to the tarpaulin-covered mound scarring the riverfront of his Bermondsey constituency, marking the entry and exit point for the boring machines that will gouge out the tunnel, which is needed to prevent 39m tonnes of sewage leaking into the Thames every year. It will not only blight the area, says Hughes, but will cost customers of Thames Water and taxpayers dear. The MP is interested in the issue not only because the tunnel runs through his constituency but because Thames Water, which wants the tunnel to be built, has been paying very large dividends to its shareholders for several years while simultaneously running up huge debts. Why, asks Hughes, if Thames Water's dominant shareholder, the Australian bank Macquarie, has reaped millions of pounds in dividends from its investment, should the sewer be built with taxpayer support worth billions? \"Over the years Macaquarie has paid out very large dividends,\" says Hughes. \"If they had not done that they could have financed it from their own resources.\" An Observer investigation shows that in the five years to March 2012 Kemble Water Holdings, the Macquarie-led vehicle that owns Thames Water, paid out dividends to its investors of nearly \u00a3700m and, according to its cash flow statements, paid no net UK corporation tax, receiving instead a rebate of \u00a343.7m. Thames Water itself has declared total dividends of almost \u00a31.4bn for that period. \"It is clear from the accounts that a succession of owners have decided to award themselves huge payouts on borrowed money at a time when they should have been making long-term investments for the benefit of all of us,\" argues Hughes. He believes the company has benefited from a tax break sanctioned by industry regulator Ofwat in 2007, when it was allowed to add huge amounts of debt to its balance sheet. In March 2007 the company had debts of \u00a33.2bn but by March this year that had more than doubled to \u00a37.8bn. This restructuring enabled it to offset interest payments to reduce the amount of taxable profits. The move was given Ofwat's blessing because \"where capital restructuring may bring about tax efficiencies these would be passed to customers\". But Hughes, deputy leader of the Lib Dems, argues that customers are no better off and the company should not benefit from the public purse. Our analysis of Thames's accounts shows that the total dividend payments add up to nearly \u00a31.1bn. This excludes the two most recent interim dividend payments for 2012 of a further \u00a3301.4m, bringing Thames's total dividend payments to almost \u00a31.4bn over five years. Thames defends the dividends, saying some of the \u00a31.1bn was used to pay down debt (including \u00a3318m of interest payments on inter-company debts) as well as to compensate shareholders. Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, has accepted Thames's explanation. In a letter to Hughes she said the company only paid out unusually high dividends between 2006 and 2007 when \u00a3656.3m was paid to RWE, the then German owners who sold out to Macquarie. She adds that, according to regulated accounts, Thames paid a dividend of \u00a3222m in 2010 and \u00a3307.9m in 2009, payouts amply covered by after-tax profits of \u00a3331m and \u00a3314.8m. Thames's regulatory accounts may provide data relevant to watchdogs such as Ofwat, but our analysis is based on the statutory accounts, which look at the company as a whole and are more relevant to investors. They suggest the dividends were much larger \u2013 at \u00a3291.5m in 2010 and \u00a3398.9m in 2009. Over the two years they add up to \u00a3690.4m, exceeding Thames's after-tax profits of \u00a3645.8m. A Thames spokesman said its customers had benefited from its new-look finances. In its last five-yearly review Ofwat triggered clauses enabling it to claw back \"tax efficiencies\" generated by rising debts. The move, Thames said, effectively negated any notional benefits gained between 2007 and 2010: \"The amount allowed for tax in the regulatory price review for the 2010-2015 period was reduced as a result of additional financing costs in the period that arose from the 2007 refinancing. Therefore, customers have benefitted from the financing efficiencies in the current period.\" According to Ofwat, the average household water and sewerage bill for Thames Water customers was \u00a3322 in 2007 and \u00a3335 in 2012, accounting for inflation. That compares with an industry average of \u00a3360 in 2007 and \u00a3375 now. In theory, if water companies whittle down costs \u2013 even costs such as their tax bill \u2013 customers should benefit from lower bills. \"Efficiencies made in 2005-10 [at Thames] were passed back to customers in Ofwat's 2009 price review,\" said a spokesman for the watchdog. The Consumer Council for Water, a government body, has warned that \"there is no guarantee that the [cost of] Thames tunnel will not be subject to further escalation\". The council is concerned that these costs will potentially be borne by all Thames Water's sewerage customers, in and outside London. The annual tunnel surcharge facing Thames Water customers has been put at between \u00a340 and \u00a3120 a year. \"The government must not allow any scheme to go forward where the public picks up the tab for the poor financial management of private companies while their owners walk away with big gains,\" says Hughes. \"It is not clear why government should now help out this company after years of excessive, unjustified borrowings and extraordinary dividend payments that have eroded its financial position.\" Martin Blaiklock, a former banker and now project finance consultant who has warned government of the risks associated with private equity investment in privatised public service utilities, agrees with Hughes. In particular he is worried that the regulatory regime is not geared up to deal with the complex structures used by the private equity industry. \"The financial and operational regulation for such utilities is outdated and needs adjustment to be able to provide the public with the service protection they deserve,\" he says. Thames Water is adamant there is nothing unusual about a structure that sees a raising of debts turn, ultimately, into a reduction in tax paid.

The company accepts, however, that it had a complex structure. An abbreviated group chart shows nine intermediate companies between Kemble Water Holdings, the ultimate parent company, and Thames Water Utilities, the operating company which bills 14 million customers. \"While we would concede that our financial structure appears complicated, it is very much in line with other similarly sized companies both within and without the water and sewerage sector,\" the company said. Ofwat said it had no mandate to regulate the broader corporate structures underpinning vital services. \"We regulate Thames Water and other appointed water and sewerage companies, not their parent companies. Tax and other commercial affairs are a matter for companies, their shareholders and advisers,\" it said.

      "bodyText": "These are terrible times. We are stuck in the longest double-dip recession since the second world war and the worst slump in modern economic history. We can also say that the most damaging crash has been met by the poorest policy response. Previous recessions seemed pain-free for many; the unemployed suffered for sure, but most of those in work kept their heads above water. This time we have endured the biggest squeeze on living standards in living memory. More than 2.5 million people are out of work, and are usually on poorer benefits than they would have been under Margaret Thatcher. Another 2 million are underemployed, while those in work have seen their real incomes fall for two years. We face a triple crisis: no growth, not enough jobs and falling living standards. And yet the government's sole focus on the deficit means that it is making each of these things worse. Even on its own narrow terms, the policies are failing. Austerity has sucked so much demand out of the economy during a period of global turbulence that the deficit is getting worse. In the short term there is a growing consensus about the alternative, as even business leaders speak out. We need an immediate stimulus based on infrastructure, transport, green industries and housing, supported by new banks and help for young people that goes beyond \"workfare\". Borrowing has never been cheaper, and the markets now see a needlessly depressed UK as a worse bet than one enjoying some demand-driven growth. But that is not enough. Trying to put the economy back together, Humpty Dumpty-style, to where it was before the crash is just a recipe for another one. The squeeze on living standards precedes the crash. The share of the economy going into wages has been falling since the late 1970s and as that slice of the pie has shrunk, those at the top have grabbed more, doubly squeezing medium- and low-earners. Real wages for those in the middle stopped rising in 2003, five years before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Last week we learned that Britons' disposable incomes are no better than they were a decade ago. Between 2003 and 2008 the economy grew by 11%, but very little of that growth has trickled down from the top. The growth in inequality and faltering wage growth were not separate from the crash, but a key cause of it. Faced with flat wages, households turned to borrowing to maintain their spending, both here and in the US. Britain is a textbook case of how growing inequality leads to economic crisis. The years before the crash were marked by a sharp rise in remortgaging and the growth of 0% balance transfer credit cards. By 2008 the UK had the highest ratio of household debt to GDP of any major economy. What we really need for a truly sustainable recovery is \"wage-led growth\". The share of the economy going into pay packets should gently rise, and wages should be more fairly shared. This would not only begin to address the crisis in living standards, but also the crisis in growth because demand would grow in a sustainable manner. Rising wages for the many scores a growth, jobs and living standards hat-trick. We therefore need an industrial and skills strategy that helps create better jobs, but we also need to look at how to increase the amount ordinary people get paid in the jobs they already have. This requires stronger measures to keep top pay in check, such as putting workers on corporate remuneration committees. Bonuses for those at the top should be scrapped in favour of policies that reward the team effort that lies behind real success. For those in the lowest-paid work, the minimum wage has been an enormously successful policy \u2013 providing a vital pay floor for more than 1 million workers. But it's not the whole answer. The government must do more. Why should public sector workers, and those in the private sector who are contracted to provide our public services, be claiming tax credits and in-work benefits because they aren't being paid decent wages? If politicians are serious about supporting the living wage, they must ensure the lowest-paid workers their organisations employ get a fairer deal than they do at present. And of course all the international evidence suggests the best way to achieve a better pay distribution is through what the IMF dryly calls measures to \"boost the bargaining power of labour\". Countries with higher levels of collective bargaining did much better in holding down inequality, saw smaller rises in household debt and were less vulnerable when the crisis hit. Modern trade unions are an important part of our society and economy, with a strong role to play in negotiating wages and conditions at work that go beyond the minimum standards set in law. We can argue about whether over-mighty unions in the 1970s were the problem that many say they were, but what is now clear is that anti-union policies both here and in the US helped fuel the 2008 crash, and that stronger unions delivering a fairer society must be part of the road to a future that works.

All of which will leave it with the option of another monetary stimulus, just to try to get things moving again. Mining merger questions remain A big week for the big miners, with Xstrata reporting on Tuesday and Rio Tinto following them up on Wednesday. Both have been hit by a sluggish market for metals and minerals, with fears that demand from China \u2013 which has powered the sector \u2013 might slide further as its economic growth falters. However, while many analysts reckon that shares in both companies have been showing signs of perking up a little of late, pointing to attractive yields on both stocks, all that technical talk is largely academic, as only one big question remains: will Xstrata still be an independent by the end of the year? Glencore's proposed takeover of Xstrata still lurks in the background and even though analysts don't expect an update this week, it looks precariously balanced. The cheeky move by the Qataris to build a 10% Xstrata stake and then demand better terms may still be an issue, but with the shares now at much lower levels, many investors might feel that they can rebuff Glencore without damaging their own investment. City scribblers at Liberum also question whether Glencore's owners would bid more. Crunch time approaches. A taste for Greggs For investors \u2013 just as for many of its customers \u2013 high-street baker Greggs has become something of a guilty pleasure. We scoff our way through 140m of its sausage rolls each year, and City analysts seem to like what the baker has to offer too \u2013 with one such fan being Shore Capital's Clive Black, hardly a loyal supporter of food retailers (though he may have indulged in the odd product). The weak performance on the high street on the back of all the usual weather and consumer spending excuses are the typical reasons for avoiding these companies, but within that depressed scenario Greggs seems to have a decent enough story to tell, with plenty of new store openings to go alongside fresh places to sell its products, such as Moto service stations. We'll hear that all again this week when the company updates the market. Yet despite Black pencilling in like-for-like sales in the second half of the year that look flatter than a chapati (the same could also be said of the group's share price graph), Black still reckons that Greggs' \"sales growth\" and \"strong balance sheet\" make it his \"positive play, for now\". Just like a weight-watcher caught with a jam doughnut \u2013 it's best to have a convincing explanation ready.",
