      "bodyText": "Italian prosecutors on Monday requested that officials at ratings agencies Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's \u2013 including London-based staff \u2013 stand trial on charges of market rigging connected to their downgrading of Italy. Prosecutors in the southern town of Trani alleged that five S&amp;P officials had deliberately supplied markets with \"tendentious and distorted\" information about \"the reliability of Italian credit and initiatives taken by the Italian government to restore and relaunch the economy\". The agency, the prosecutors added, helped \"discourage the purchase of Italian public debt and thus drive down its value\". The S&amp;P managers accused included former president Deven Sharma and other London-based managers. Two Fitch managers, including ratings chief David Riley, were also accused of releasing information to the markets \"that should have remained private\" during trading hours, leading to price fluctuations. Magistrates dropped allegations they had considered against Moody's. A judge will now rule on whether the managers should stand trial. Trani prosecutor Carlo Mario Capristo said on Monday that an audit court in the region of Lazio had also opened an inquiry and had estimated damages wrought by the agencies on the Italian treasury at \u20ac120bn (\u00a396bn). In a statement, S&amp;P said: \"These claims are entirely baseless and without any merit as our role is to publish independent opinions about creditworthiness according to our public and transparent methodologies, which we apply consistently around the world.\" Fitch did not comment. The assertion by prosecutors that the agency is open to prosecution for being overly harsh on Italy echoes the common view of Italy's political class that downgrades are \"attacks\" on Italy. Investigators from Trani raided offices of the agencies in Milan in January after complaints from Italian consumers associations , complaints which had been turned down by magistrates in Milan and Rome. Elio Lanutti, president of one of the consumer groups that took issue with the agencies, called them \"an erratic danger to state sovereignty in the areas of economics and finance\". During their inquiry, prosecutors questioned Mario Draghi, the then president-designate of the European Central Bank, Italy's former prime minister, Romano Prodi, and Giulio Tremonti, who served as finance minister in Silvio Belusconi's government last year. European policymakers have complained that while they have punished struggling national economies, ratings agencies missed the growing threat to the global economy from subprime mortgages, which triggered the economic crisis in 2008. In a potentially precedent-setting ruling last week, a judge in Australia found S&amp;P guilty of giving its highest rating to derivatives which then lost most of their value in the runup to the crisis. Justice Jayne Jagot said S&amp;P and ABN Ambro had deceived 12 Australian councils that bought the triple-A rated constant proportion debt obligation, notes created by the bank. After telling councils that the notes had less than a 1% chance of defaulting, the notes went on to default within six months, costing the councils A$16m (\u00a310.4m).

      "body": "<p>On Tuesday, 15 financial officials will be among the only people in Washington not engaged in obsessive conversations about the fiscal cliff.</p> <p>The group, from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, will be fighting a battle that, just before the presidential election, looked completely lost. Their task: to prevent money-market mutual funds from collapsing the next time we have a crisis.</p> <p>It sounds like a no-brainer, doesn't it? After all, consider the alternative: who would prefer money-market funds to take down the financial system when the next Lehman comes around?</p> <p>Yet, like all financial reform, it's been a hard sell in Washington. Tim Geithner, the treasury secretary, has been its champion; no use. You couldn't say that the battle was lost. It didn't even come to a real fight. Mary Schapiro, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, canceled an important vote on it in August after three SEC commissioners refused to participate in reforming the money-market funds just yet. </p> <p>If you thought the fiscal cliff was Washington gridlock, the fight over money-market funds would make your head spin.</p> <p>At least with the fiscal cliff there are deeply held socio-economic positions on both sides about fairness and taxation and prosperity. Money-market funds are not \u2013 or at least should not be \u2013 a flashpoint. Everyone should be able to agree that money-market funds need to be safer.</p> <p>If you're an average American, it's hard to see why. As boring as taxes are, money-market funds are perhaps even less riveting. Money-market mutual funds don't sound exciting \u2013 and they aren't. They hide away, unnoticed, in the 401ks of most Americans. Their chief virtue is that they're a way to park money, like a savings account, without a lot of risk to your wallet. They barely pay any interest. They have no flash, and no dazzle.</p> <p>But don't be fooled by appearances. The money invested in those unassuming funds is huge \u2013 in the US alone, it adds up to $2.6tn in cash. That's about the same amount Americans spend on healthcare annually. </p> <p>And, as the money would indicate, those money-market funds are also extremely powerful. They are the underpinning for nearly the whole US financial system. </p> <p>Here's how money-market funds work: they take money from ordinary investors; you usually need about $1,000 to start. The funds invest that money in different kinds of securities, like bonds. As an investor in the fund, you collect some interest \u2013 not much, but more than a savings account. Money-market funds are just like other mutual funds in that way.</p> <p>But, unlike mutual funds, which you know you can lose money on, money-market funds have an untouchable reputation. They are considered as safe as treasury bonds, which are the safest investment in all of America. For that reason, money-market funds turn around and use the money you invest to lend money to banks, here in the US and in Europe. The money-market funds lend money overnight, and the banks pay it back. Since banks thrive on such short-term lending, they could really not do business without money-market funds behind them.</p> <p>Yet the system behind money-market failed once, at the worst possible time. Around September 2008, people who had their cash in money-market funds like the Reserve Primary Fund freaked out. They took their money out. It was like a run on a bank. The money-market funds saw their value fall beneath the strict bar of $1 a share. This was like going to your savings account and finding out the bank had taken it. The money-market funds then had to pull that money away from banks \u2013 including Lehman Brothers \u2013 which were already struggling to survive. </p> <p>Financially, this debacle was like an atomic bomb going off in the middle of a war \u2013 disaster upon disaster. It was shocking to banks and regulators and the people with money in the funds themselves. The government had to run in to protect investors, banks and the funds. </p> <p>Four years after the crisis, money-market funds still enjoy their completely safe reputation, but they are still the most vulnerable part of the US financial system, and the least touched by rules. The funds are barely regulated. SEC chair Schapiro said, accurately, \"The risks posed by money-market funds to the financial system are part of the important unfinished business from the financial crisis of 2008.\"</p> <p>So those regulators will gather on Tuesday to find out, and agree, about what to do about it. There are three big problems with money-market funds: they appear completely safe when they are not; investors get more money if they take out their money early in a crisis, which creates disaster for other investors who react slowly; and the funds invest in stocks and bonds that can't be sold right away, so it's hard for them to round up the ready cash to pay for big redemptions from investors. </p> <p>There are a few ideas on the table. </p> <p>One idea is to price money-market funds at their real value. Right now, even if a fund is worth 99.8 cents, you would still get a full $1 if you tried to pull your money out. Any time you look at your money-market fund, the value is always $1. This creates the illusion that the funds are safe, unchanging, immune to the market. That illusion is false. So one solution that Schapiro likes is to force the funds to actually write the real, current value of each share \u2013 whether it is 99.8 cents or 99.3 cents \u2013 into their accounts. This would rip away the smokescreen that the funds are perfectly safe; if investors saw the value of money-market funds fluctuating, they would realize that their money is really at risk. The money-market fund managers think that $1 is a nice round stable number and easier to keep track of in their computers. </p> <p>Another idea is to impose penalties for people who try to withdraw their cash from money-market funds, which is called \"gating\". This would make it harder for investors to pull their money out; but at some point, no matter how bad things get, you have to give people access to their own money, so this option is the most temporary one. </p> <p>And yet another idea would be to force the money-market funds to hold extra money on the side, in case people want their money back right away. This idea of having reserves is common in the banking system, but it's not common in the fund industry. Like banks, money-market funds hate having extra money lying around that they can't really put to use. </p> <p>Not all of this is going to be hammered out on Tuesday; but it needs to start in earnest. Many in the US won't be paying attention to this meeting. The fiscal cliff, with its broad strokes of politics and disaster, is a much more appealing drama. But it would be a mistake to ignore money-market funds. </p> <p>When the next financial disaster comes, they're the first thing we're going to start worrying about.

      "bodyText": "Senior executives from Amazon, Starbucks and Google were accused of diverting hundreds of millions of pounds in UK profits to secretive tax havens during a fraught exchange with a committee of MPs. Members of the public accounts committee described a director from Amazon as being \"deliberately evasive\" and displaying \"outrageous\" ignorance after he failed to say how much profit is generated in Britain or who owns the online retailer's Luxembourg-based holding company. A senior figure from Starbucks, which employs more than 7,000 staff in more than 800 outlets in the UK, was told he was not believed when he claimed the coffee chain did not make profits in Britain. An executive from Google admitted it operates in Ireland because of a low corporation tax rate there of 12.5% and was later accused by the committee chair, Margaret Hodge, of \"immoral\" behaviour. Hodge told the executives that UK taxpayers are increasingly frustrated by the use of tax havens and creative accounting by large firms trading in Britain. \"People want to know why companies which benefit from an infrastructure paid for by them and are paying people low wages who receive taxpayer-funded tax credits from the exchequer are not paying their fair share,\" she said. Amazon avoids UK taxes by reporting European sales through a Luxembourg-based unit, MPs alleged. This structure allowed it to pay a rate of less than 12% on foreign profits last year \u2013 less than half the average corporate income tax rate in its major markets. Andrew Cecil, Amazon's director of public policy, was accused of being \"totally evasive\" after failing to explain who owned the company, and was unable to detail the income made by the Britain arm of his business. Hodge claimed the director was not a \"serious person\" to appear before the committee and vowed to order another senior executive to appear before it to fill in the blanks in his evidence. She asked why customers buying books through a UK website are billed from the UK and goods are delivered from UK centres but taxes are paid in Luxembourg. Cecil said some taxes are paid in Britain. Amazon.co.uk paid \u00a31.8m in corporation tax on more than a \u00a3200m turnover for 2011. He added that the firm was being investigated by the tax authorities in France. Starbucks paid no corporation or income tax in the UK in the past three years, it emerged last month. The world's biggest coffee chain paid \u00a38.6m in total UK tax over 13 years during which it recorded sales of \u00a33.1bn. Troy Alstead, its global chief financial officer, faced repeated claims from MPs that it engaged in aggressive tax avoidance in the UK as he tried to explain its corporate affairs. He declined to give details publicly of a favourable rate granted it in the Netherlands on a proportion of profits transferred there in the form of an intellectual property \"royalty\" on UK shops. Dutch authorities wanted that to remain confidential, he claimed, prompting allegations it was a \"sweetheart\" deal that bosses wanted to keep under wraps. Tory MP Stephen Barclay said a reduction in the level of that royalty from 6% of sales to 4.7% after talks with HM Revenue &amp; Customs appeared to be merely a \"cosmetic\" move. It resulted in an \u00a38m increase in corporation tax, Alstead said. He was unable to give any breakdown of how either figure was calculated. Alstead claimed that globally Starbucks remains \"an extremely high tax payer\" but had failed to generate substantial UK profits. \"Respectfully I can assure you there is no tax avoidance here,\" he said. Asked to say what rate the firm paid in Amsterdam, where it had a roasting operation, he said tax authorities there had asked for it not to be disclosed publicly. Google's filings show it had \u00a32.5bn of UK sales last year, but despite having a group-wide profit margin of 33%, its main UK unit had a tax charge of \u00a33.4m in 2011. The company avoids UK tax by channelling non-US sales via Ireland, an arrangement that allowed it to pay taxes at a rate of 3.2% on non-US profits. It also diverts some of its profits through Bermuda. Matt Brittin, the head of its northern Europe operation, said that Google operates in Ireland and Bermuda because they offer attractive tax rates. \"Like any company you play by the rules [and] manage costs efficiently to offer fair value to shareholders,\" he said. \"We're not accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral,\" replied Hodge. All three companies have been asked to supply further information to the committee. Another Amazon executive will be asked to appear before the committee in two weeks to respond to unanswered questions, Hodge said.",

      "bodyText": "With eurozone ministers hard at it in Brussels, the news flow appears to have dried up. There could be a Eurogroup press conference late tonight (depending on progress), but I think it's time for a closing summary of the last 12 hours in the crisis: \u2022 There is still deadlock over Greece's financial programme, and its next aid payment. The International Monetary Fund and European officials remain divided over the country's debt levels, and its path to debt sustainability. The row means Greece's Troika of lenders have still been unable to deliver a final report into the Greek economy. (see 12.51pm) \u2022 Eurozone leaders are attempting to hammer out a deal on Greece tonight. We have early photos at 7.37pm. The word from Brussels, though, is that another meeting will be needed to before a final decision is reached on whether Athens gets the \u20ac31.5bn aid tranche that has been delayed for months. \u2022 The Troika has accepted that Greece should be given another two years to hit its targets. A draft Memorandum of Understanding shows that Athens would be given until 2016 to achieve a primary surplus of 4.5% - not 2014 as previously mandated. The MoU also outlines wide-ranging labour reforms and spending cuts \u2013 which appear to be line with the measures agreed in recent days. See 5pm for a flavour of the MoU. A separate Troika report has apparently concluded that Greece's funding gap over the next few years could reach \u20ac32bn (see 2.59pm). \u2022 There have been protests in Portugal as German chancellor Angela Merkel paid a brief visit. A puppet and a photo were burned in separate protests (see 7.07pm). Earlier, Merkel told a press conference that Germany stood alongside Portugal, and promised additional help to tackle its youth unemployment crisis (see 4.12pm) \u2022 Fresh from winning approval for Greece's 2013 budget last night, prime minister Antonis Samaras has insisted that Greece has a brighter future. The PM told reporters that Greece has a vision for its rebirth (see 6.52pm) \u2022 The latest Japanese GDP added to fears over the global economy. GDP fell by 0.9% in the last quarter, indicating that the world's third-largest economy is heading into recession (see 8.55am). We'll be back tomorrow morning for further rolling coverage of the crisis - and it should be another lively day. Meetings will continue in Brussels, involving all EU finance ministers. We also get new UK inflation data, a rather important Greek debt auction, and a meeting between David Cameron and Mario Monti in Rome. Thanks, and goodnight! Megan Greene of Roubini Global Economics has been discussing the eurozone crisis on Sky News tonight. She pointed out that the Greek bailout puts the International Monetary Fund in a very tricky position \u2013 can the IMF really believe that Greece is on the path to debt sustainability, given its latest budget forecasts? The demonstrations in Portugal against Angela Merkel intensified this afternoon, with a mannequin dressed in the colours of the German flag burned, along with an image of the chancellor and a puppet. One protests took place in Porto, as well as in Lisbon (where Merkel paid a short visit today - see 1.46pm and 9.41am), as this photo shows: And these two photos show protests in Lisbon, where AFP reports that people booed Merkel and carried banners accusing her of seeking European domination. Another group of protesters made a bonfire outside Lisbon's Belem cultural center where Angela Merkel took part in a business conference attended by German and Portuguese companies. Back in Greece, prime minister Antonis Samaras has just given a statement to the media after holding marathon six hour talks at development ministry whose policies he has vowed to take personally under his wing. Samaras insisted that growth and development are the only path to optimism (our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports). The prime minister also painted a picture of a country where jobs would be created again, putting \"smiles on the faces of Greeks.\" Samaras added that: Greece has a vision and plan for its rebirth and the future of its children, adding that the process of attracting foreign investment \"had already begun.\" There were plenty of smiles, hugs and air kisses at the start of this afternoon's Eurogroup meeting - and here are the early pictures to prove it: But there were also signs that tonight's meeting would be robust, with the Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi looking pretty serious. As we reported at lunchtime, the IMF and the ECB are still wrangling over the details of Greece's debt sustainability, and the question of who pays for the country's two-year extension. Christine Lagarde and Yannis Stournaras were also spotted in deep conversation before the meeting began: German newspaper Die Welt is reporting this evening that the European Central Bank has decided to broaden the framework under which Greek commercial banks can access tap emergency loans from Greek central bank.. The move could be a sign that the ECB has bowed to pressure over Greece's impending \u20ac5bn debt repayment, by making it easier for Greek banks to buy the \u20ac5bn of bonds that will be auctioned on Tuesday. Here's the story in German: Griechen sollen zwei Jahre mehr Zeit bekommen and here's a Google translation into English A draft version of the new memorandum of understanding between the Troika and Greece has emerged today, and here's what it looks like: (via our Europe editor Ian Traynor). Skimming through it now, the first thing to report is that the MoU outlines that Greece will get the two-year extension it has been seeking. Here's a flavour, from the section titled: Achieving Sound Public Finances: The fiscal adjustment path has been revised to take into account the deeper-than-expected economic recession. Maintaining the original two-year fiscal adjustment path of the second programme would have implied a need to find measures for the period 2013-14 amounting to \u20ac20.7bn compared with \u20ac11.5bn envisaged in March. The two-year extension of the adjustment period will mitigate the impact on the economy, while securing a sustainable fiscal position. Under the revised adjustment path the primary balance targets have been set at 0%, 1.5%, 3% and 4.5% of GDP for the four-year period 2013-2016, respectively. Those revised primary balances square with recent reports for Greece's economic path. The MoU also covers a range of issues including labour market reforms and bank recapitalisations -- which appear to have already been included in the austerity package voted through last week..... The MoU, though, does not include any debt sustainability or funding gap figures \u2013 such as the \u20ac32bn black hole which Bloomberg reported this afternoon (see 2.59pm) Europe's stock markets have closed after a particularly unexciting day's trading, with Spain showing the largest losses FTSE 100: down 2 points at 5767, -0.04% German DAX: up 6 points at 7169, +0.09% French CAC: down 10 points at 3413, -0.3% Spanish IBEX: down 68 points at 7567, -0.9% Italy's FTSE MIB: down 59 points at 15121, -0.39% This afternoon's Eurogroup meeting dominates traders' attention, as Chris Beauchamp of IG explains: It appears the latest report on Greece is being held up over the small matter of how much to pay the troubled nation and who will pay it. The lack of market response to this is a sign of the degree of crisis fatigue that prevails among investors, but more of a reaction seems likely tomorrow as Athens makes a bid for emergency funding from bond markets in case the bailout tranche does not arrive in time. Angela Merkel has also pledged that Portugal will not experience Greek-style uncertainty when its next aid payment comes up, saying she is 'convinced' that the Troika will give Lisbon a favourable report. Over in Lisbon, people demonstrating against the visit of Germany's Angela Merkel have pushed over a fence: Merkel has also been giving a press conference, in which she pledged that Germany would show solidarity with Portugal through the debt crisis. The chancellor said: I sense a great sense of determination here in Portugal to overcome this difficult phase.... I know that it's very hard for some people - unemployment is high, especially among young people, so Germany wants to support Portugal in particular with professional training for young people. This is reminiscent of Merkel's recent comments that 'her heart bled' for Greece. The press conference followed a meeting with Portugal's prime Minister, Pedro Passos Coelho: (see1.46pm for our earlier coverage of Merkel's visit) Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's finance minister, doesn't sound in the mood to roll over on Greece. Speaking as he arrived at the eurogroup meeting, Schauble said Germany was aware of its 'responsibilities' but insisted that any decision would have to wait for German parliamentary approval. So not quite the 'real fix' that Christine Lagarde called for a few minutes ago: Now it's Christine Lagarde's turn to speak to the press at the start of the eurogroup meeting in Brussels. The head of the IMF said that lenders needed to make progress to match Greece's own achievements (agreeing its \u20ac13.5bn austerity package and 2013 budget in recent days). Lagarde added: We're not here for the quick fix, we're here for the real fix. Catchy. Luke Baker, Reuters bureau chief in Brussels, isn't too excited by the draft Troika report which emerged half an hour ago on Bloomberg (see 2.58pm) All's fair in love, war, and newswires Back to Brussels, where French finance minister Pierre Moscovici has told reporters that he hopes to make some progress on Greece today. Speaking as he arrived for the eurogroup meeting, Moscovici said Europe must make a 'decisive' political decision on Greece: We have to come out of this meeting with a political solution. He added that the Greek people deserve nothing less, but admitted that a full agreement today is unlikely (as we and others been reporting most of the day!) Dow Jones newswires reckons that the Bundestag could vote on the Greek bailout/programme extension next week (which rather suggests a second eurogroup meeting this week might be premature) Bloomberg is reporting that the draft Troika report into Greece shows that the country needs over \u20ac30bn of extra funding. David Tweed, Bloomberg's Europe editor, just reported that the Troika has concluded that Greece may need an extra \u20ac15bn to cover its funding needs between now and 2014. A two-year extension would need an additional \u20ac17bn, he added. Should caution that this is the 'draft' Troika report -- the ongoing row between the IMF and Europe (see 12.51) means it has still not been finalised. So it's also not clear on what basis these funding needs were calculated -- are they more in line with the IMF models, or Europe's?..... Developing Speculation is swirling in Brussels that a second eurogroup meeting will be needed later this week to resolve the deadlock over Greece's aid tranche. Jutta Pauliina Urpilainen, Finland's finance minister, started the ball rolling by telling reporters that the eurogroup did not have all the information needed on Greece yet. Urpilainen added that a decision today was unlikely, so euro finance ministers will \"probably\" meet again later this week. Marco Zatterin, journalists at of La Stampa, then tweeted that Wednesday was seen as the most likely day for a second meeting: Wednesday, incidentally, is the date when unions in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy will hold a general strike. Juergen Baetz, AP's Germany correspondent, reckons Wednesday is the earliest that Germany could agree parliamentary approval for handing Greece its next aid tranche: UPDATE: Spain's economics minister, Luis de Guindos, has told MEPs this lunchtime that Spanish economic forecasts are not 'made in stone'. Speaking to the European Parliament, de Guindos conceded that some \"international bodies\" had more negative forecasts for Spain's GDP than Madrid did itself. However, he insisted that the government's forecasts were accurate. Here's the key quotes: We are aware that economic forecasts for Spain by international bodies are below our expectations. But forecasts are not written in stone. We are working on our programme of economic measures in order for our outlooks to be met, which we consider to be realistic. Last week the EC predicted that Spain's GDP would fall by 1.5% in 2013, while Madrid forecasts a 0.5% decline. [with thanks to de Guindos's office for the transcript -- we originally thought the minister was suggesting that Spain's own targets could change - but clearly not. Apologies for the confusion] Greek bank shares have now tumbled by almost 20% in Athens, with the main stock index down over 4%. The trigger for the selloff is the news that Greek banks must issue new shares and bonds to raise their capital ratio levels to at least 6%. Reuters has more details: Greece sets terms for bank recapitalisation While the IMF and Europe continue to argue over who pays the bill for Greece, officials in Athens are pointing out that a two-year extension to its fiscal programme has already been agreed. There is some dispute over how much it will cost, though. Helena Smith reports from Athens: It [the extension]was part of the package of measures that we voted though parliament last week,\" said a senior finance minister source. \"Being given an extra two years to meet budget targets was a central plank of the accord. There's no rolling back on that.\" The Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras says the extension will not cost more than \u20ac20bn \"at most\" - rather less than the \u20ac30bn that some officials reckon. As we reported earlier (see 12.51 for Ian Traynor's inside line from Brussels) -- a \u20ac30bn black hole could require euro countries and the ECB to write down the value of their Greek debt. Simply extending bond maturities and lowering the interest rate repayment on Greek bonds would not be enough. Economics professor Yanis Varoufakis has a classical take on Angela Merkel's visit to Portugal: [that quote refers to the Roman conquest of Britain some 2,000 years ago - an early example of closer European union...] Angela Merkel has arrived in Portugal for her meetings with the country's prime minister and president (see 9.41am for details), as protesters gather in Lisbon. The German chancellor has already sat down with Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva - and here's a couple of early photos: But outside the palace, there were signs of opposition to the chancellor's visit - to a country deep in recession and midway through a \u20ac78bn bailout programme. The protests appeared peaceful: Reuters reports that anti-austerity protesters \"draped Lisbon statues in black mourning sashes\" to mark Merkel's visit (can't find a photo of this, sorry). Portuguese media also attacked Merkel ahead of her visit today. As Open Europe reports, the front page of today's edition of Portuguese newspaper I Informa\u00e7\u00e3o has the headline: Hail Angela, those who are going to die salute you And a business newspaper, Diario Economico, also criticisised Merkel today - saying: Merkel has made an economic Frankenstein out of Portugal. Greek bank shares have fallen this morning, as traders wait to see whether Athens receives its outstanding \u20ac31.5bn aid tranche (much of which will be used to recapitalise the sector). Efthimia Efthimiou in Athens has the numbers: The International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank remain divided today over Greece and its faltering bailout programme. From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that IMF officials are still arguing with European officials over the details of Greece's debt levels and the country's path to 'debt sustainability'. This row goes to the heart of the battle over austerity, with the IMF adamant that heavy fiscal cuts are more damaging to growth than Europe believes (or wants to). This means that the Troika report into Greece has not been fully finalised, according to EU officials. (even though Jean-Claude Juncker says he has it - see 11.31am) Ian explains that the dispute over Greece is now political rather than financial. Fundamentally - who pays for the extra time that Greece needs? Extending Greece's financial targets by two years will cost around \u20ac30bn \u2013 and Europe is unwilling to provide the funds by accepting losses on its Greek bonds. And without an agreement on how Greece's debt can become sustainable (a key demand for an IMF rescue programme), the Troika report cannot be finalised. This means deadlock. As Ian puts it: They can't agree a deal until they have the troika report. But they can't get the troika report until they have a deal So how is this circle resolved? Well, Europe could agree to stomach losses on its Greek bonds (politically very unpalatable). More alarmingly, the IMF could walk away (debt sustainability is one of the central planks of its strategy). Or some compromise could be haggled out.... All could become clearer tonight, or it may drag on through the week. There's talk in Brussels of a second Eurogroup meeting (either face-to-face or a teleconference call) later this week. A quick update on timing for the eurogroup meeting in Brussels. A macro economic dialogue meeting has been taking place this morning (see photo above). Eurozone finance ministers are due to officially arrive around 1.30pm (so watch out for those 'doorstep' statements to the huddled ranks of the euro press pack). A round-table to discuss issues (Item 1: Greece) begins at 4pm. A press conference is then expected around 9pm BST, involving Jean-Claude Juncker and EU commissioner Olli Rehn. The German finance ministry has declared that there is no chance of a deal today on Greece's bailout programme, despite Athens approving its 2013 budget last night. Ministry spokeswoman Marianne Kothe told reporters in Berlin that it wasn't realistic to expect a decision at tonight's Eurogroup meeting (of euro finance ministers), particularly as German MPs must have their say first. Kothe said: Everyone is working under a lot of pressure to resolve questions which are still open... I think it's rather unrealistic to expect a final decision today as in Germany the Bundestag has to agree to it in advance. There are also reports this morning that Jean-Claude Juncker, chair of the Eurogroup, has also ruled out a decision this evening. The precise whereabouts of the Troika report on Greece is another issue ... Germany's Kothe said today that she didn't think the final version was complete yet. And more from Greece, where our correspondent Helena Smith says government officials are also making clear that the ball is now in Europe\u2019s court even if few expect the tranche disbursement to be made before the next EU summit in late November. Helena writes: The Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras was the first to say that the crisis-hit country is not expecting more than a \u201cpolitical statement \u201dof support at tonight\u2019s meeting of eurogroup finance ministers. \u201cAs has been confirmed the installment will be disbursed as soon as possible,\u201d he said ahead of last night\u2019s vote, emphasising that Greek coffers were actually \u201cbetter off than expected because the 2012 budget is being executed very satisfactorily\u201d. But although almost everyone in the governing coalition believes the \u20ac31.5bn aide tranche will be forthcoming, relief has also been tinged by anxiety in the wake of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s statements that the long-delayed loan is unlikely to be released in the coming days. Aides close to Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, say the \u201cwaiting game cannot go on for ever\u201d and they expect the decision to disburse the funds to be made \u201cat the next EU summit at the end of the month\u201d once the question of Athens\u2019 debt sustainability is also resolved. Samaras, who is about to hold talks with the development minister, says he is not only expecting the agreed \u20ac31.5bn to be released (in one lump) but is \u201cworking continuously\u201d for more money to be disbursed with a view to kickstarting growth and development in Greece. In the long, drawnout fight over the latest disbursement Greece has missed drawing down an estimated \u20ac12bn in bailout loans from creditors at the EU and IMF. The next EU summit is scheduled for 22 and 23 November, to discuss the EU budget. Here's a video clip showing highlights from last night's debate and vote in the Greek parliament: Italy's legal tussle with the credit rating agencies has taken a dramatic twist this morning. Prosecutors have called for charges to be brought against five officials from Standard &amp; Poor's, and two from Fitch, following an investigation into alleged market manipulation. However two officials from Moody's who were also investigated will now not face charges. The probe began in mid-2011 when police raided S&amp;P's and Moody's offices, amid claims that Italian sovereign bond yields were soaring because of skullduggery behind the scenes. Back to Greece, and the country's debt management agency has insisted this morning that there is no danger of a default when \u20ac5bn of bonds mature on Friday. A spokesman from the agency confirmed to Reuters that the country will auction \u20ac5bn of bonds tomorrow, and expects them all to be sold. The official added that there have been negotiations with the European Central Bank over the 'ceiling' it sets on how much Greek sovereign debt can be held by its banks (the key to a smooth auction). The official said: We are very confident the issue will be rolled over without any problem... We have liaised with the ECB regarding the ceiling on the outstanding stock of T-bills and there is no problem. That suggests that Greek banks will be allowed to buy up all the debt (which they can then use as collateral with the central bank of Greece). Angela Merkel is paying a flying visit to Portugal today \u2013 her second visit to the eurozone periphery in a month. The trip will last just six hours. It is designed to allow the German chancellor to show support for Lisbon's government, which has been battered by public opposition to its austerity budget. Merkel will meet with President Anibal Cavaco Silva and Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho. Speaking yesterday, she told Portuguese broadcaster RTP that: Portugal is meeting the commitments it has assumed very well. Merkel is traveling with a retinue of around 100 German businesspeople \u2013 a sign that Europe's biggest economy wants to help weaker nations grow their way out of the crisis. Unions have already called for protests in Lisbon to mark Merkel's arrival, but the visit should be less dramatic than her visit to Athens in October. Two demonstrations have been organised - one at 12.30 GMT and a second at 3pm GMT. Opposition politicians are divided over Merkel's visit. The socialist party is optimistic that it could lead to an economic boost, while the communists blame the chancellor for the relentless austerity being piled on Portugal: Journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo has the details: Here's what City analysts and economists are saying about the eurozone crisis this morning. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research As the finance ministers prepare to gather in Brussels Mr Sch\u00e4uble has been making it clear that the release of the next tranche is not a done deal and that the Troika are unlikely to have the report on Greece ready for today\u2019s meeting and thus they are unlikely to make any decision with regard to the release of the money. It might be that Mr Sch\u00e4uble is talking tough for domestic reasons and wants to give the impression that the German government is thinking long and hard about providing more money to Greece. Of course it might be that some young junior intern who is working in the office where they prepare the cheque innocently inquired of his superiors as he was typing out the sum of \u20ac31.3bn whether they thought that it would ever be repaid. At some stage unless Greece discovers oil or enjoys an unprecedented period of economic growth they are likely to require another debt restructuring. So why not undertake that now? Well I suppose because current politicians don\u2019t want to explain to voters why they are writing off so much money that has only recently been lent to the country. Better to leave that task to the next lot. Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy The big issues of the eurozone crisis and the fragile US economy are in the hands of politicians who remain inadequate to the task... Greek sovereign risk is not about economics, but about trust between Athens and its creditors. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets Europe remains in disarray with Greece\u2019s ruling coalition securing enough votes to approve the 2013 budget, raising hopes that the next tranche of bailout aid will be received, although the disagreement among the troika of lenders themselves maintains uncertainty as to when. It is considered unlikely that today\u2019s Eurozone finance ministers meeting will shed any light. Greece also plans to sell \u20ac5bn short-term debt to avoid a default on maturing debt this week, but national banks look capable of being able to cover only 70%. (more details) What about the rest? Michael Hewson of CMC Markets With Greece's cash reserves almost depleted and a \u20ac5bn t-bill rollover later this week the hope is that this will be enough for EU Finance ministers, meeting in Brussels today, to sanction the release of the next tranche of aid. Unfortunately things are never that simple with arguments raging amongst EU ministers about how best to get Greece\u2019s runaway debt levels under some semblance of control, without the need to find any more money. A difficult prospect when a two year extension is likely to require another \u20ac30bn.... The ECB has already ruled out considering any form of restructuring due to it being tantamount to monetary financing, with President Draghi last week saying that the ECB is done with Greece, which leaves EU leaders with the thorny problem of trying to sell the idea of more time and more money to a country that has consistently failed to meet its fiscal targets. The latest Japanese economic data has sent a shiver through the markets this morning \u2013 GDP fell by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2012, and economists believe the world's third-largest economy is slipping into recession. The eurozone crisis takes some of the blame - exports to Europe from Japan dropped sharply this summer. That may have helped deter companies from investing more at home -- capital expenditure declined by an alarming 3.2% during the quarter as firms hunkered down. Another sign that the global economy is ending 2012 with a whimper. More here. The Financial Times focuses on the issue of Greece's looming debt repayment this morning. Athens must repay \u20ac5bn of maturing short-term bonds on Friday, but as things stand it's not clear how it will finance this, if it doesn't get its next bailout cash quickly. The FT writes (\u00a3): The country\u2019s debt management office has announced plans to cover the \u20ac5bn debt through a treasury bill auction on Tuesday, but Greek banks expected to buy the issue can only raise about \u20ac3.5bn of collateral acceptable to the European Central Bank, according to two senior Athens bankers. \u201cThe situation is quite tight,\u201d said one banker. \u201cThey will have to find the remainder in other ways. My colleague Ian Traynor reported on Friday that Brussels officials insist that Greece will not drift into a default on Friday. But with the European Central Bank refusing to give Greek banks permission to buy more Greek debt, it's not clear how this issue will be fixed... Europe's financial markets have not taken much cheer from the Greek budget vote. The euro began falling once European traders got to their desks, and is down around 0.3 of a cent since 6am at $1.2708. There's no rally on the stock markets either: FTSE 100: flat at 5769 German DAX: flat at 7162 French CAC: down 2 points at 3420, - 0.1% Spanish IBEX: down 30 points at 7606, -0.38% Italian FTSE MIB: up 11 points at 15192, + 0.07% Antonis Samaras's government may have been applauding last night (see opening post), but there was no delight on the streets of Athens as the 2013 budget was voted through. Greek police estimate that there were 13,000 people demonstrating last night (so the true total is probably higher). There was clear anger against the government, other European leaders and the International Monetary Fund, as these photos show: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis - and other key events across the world economy. Greece has moved another step closer to receiving the next slice of its bailout package, after its parliament approved the 2013 budget in a crucial vote late last night. Antonis Samaras's government managed a fairly comfortable victory, attracting 167 votes in the 300-seat parliament. Speaking afterwards, the prime minister claimed that the country was 'turning a corner'. Samaras said: The sacrifices included in that law* and in the budget we are voting today are the last. We will start rectifying the injustices included in them once we get out of the deficits ... But the reforms we passed will be permanent and will boost the economy. * - the austerity package agreed last week. But arguably the really difficult work now starts for Greece's fragile coalition, as it must implement unpopular measures that will worsen the recession and living standards for a debt-stricken country that has endured three years of relentless austerity. As we reported last night, the budget contains a large portion of the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package agreed last week -- and also predicts another year of deep recession and soaring debts. The immediate question, though, is whether Greece will now finally receive the \u20ac31.5bn tranche of bailout cash which it has been awaiting for months. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet in Brussels this evening to discuss the issue, but it still appears that a decision will NOT be made today. Samaras's aides have told our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, that last night's comfortable victory are a 'very strong card' for Greece to play with the eurogroup -- a sign that the government is still in control. But public opposition remains strong, with thousands of people protesting last night in Athens. We'll be tracking reaction to the Greek vote, and developments in Brussels, through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Redrow, the home-building group whose largest shareholder is Wolverhampton Wanderers owner Steve Morgan, suffered one of the largest protest votes as investors rounded on an \"extraordinarily weak\" deputy chairman who they believe tried to sell the company on the cheap. Almost a quarter of shareholders voting at Monday's annual meeting opposed the reappointment of Alan Jackson, the non-executive deputy chairman, after he appeared to wave through an attempt by Morgan to take the company private. Morgan, who remains the company's executive chairman and owner 40% of the shares, was frustrated by the Takeover Panel and the deal collapsed. One top independent shareholder, who voted against Jackson's reappointment, said: \"We felt the independent directors were extraordinarily weak throughout the whole process. They allowed executives to get very close to the bidders and effectively become part of the bidding team. Their job is to stand up for the rights of all shareholders. They quite plainly did not do that.\" Apart from Jackson, Redrow has two other non-executive directors on its board: Paul Hampden Smith had previously announced he would stand down, so the resolution on his re-election was withdrawn from the meeting; and Debbie Hewitt, who joined the board in August 2009, suffered a sizeable protest with 8.77% of votes cast opposing her re-election. A spokeswoman for Redrow said: \"The board has always acted in the interests of all investors. Through the recent period of a potential offer for the company, the independent directors, led by Alan Jackson, were focused on protecting minority shareholders and, supported by independent advisers, worked on this basis. \"Alan Jackson has been reappointed to the board with over three quarters of shareholders voting in favour. He has the full support of the board and along with the rest of the board and the management team, is clearly focused on continuing to drive Redrow forward under the existing successful strategy.\" Morgan's Bridgemere Securities vehicle made an offer to take Redrow private with the backing of 14% shareholder Toscafund and Penta Capital, a buyout firm associated with Tosca.

They could have threatened the bank's existence if the FSA hadn't given assurances at the time,\" Hickman told a panel established by the banking standards commission to look at the collapse and rescue of HBOS.</p> <p>He was giving evidence with two former finance directors of HBOS: Mike Ellis, who held the role between 2001 and 2004 and again in 2008, and Phil Hodkinson, who was finance director between 2005 and 2006.</p> <p>HBOS was rescued by Lloyds in October 2008. The witnesses were asked repeatedly about Lloyds having to set aside \u00a37bn for bad loans shortly after taking over the bank.</p> <p>Hodkinson said the board had not foreseen the collapse of the commercial property market that eventually caused the losses in the corporate banking division. Hodkinson said: \"With the benefit of hindsight it may have been beneficial if there had been more people on the board with corporate banking experience.\"</p> <p>The corporate banking division was led by Peter Cummings, who has been fined \u00a3500,000 by the FSA and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/hbos-banker-peter-cummings-banned-fined-fsa\" title=\"\">banned from working in the City</a>.

      "bodyText": "Stock market speculators nearly brought down HBOS in March 2008, the bank's head of risk at the time has told a parliamentary hearing. Peter Hickman, group risk director of HBOS in 2007-8, said assurances from the Financial Services Authority over rumours of the bank being in trouble helped to restore confidence. Referring to 20 March 2008, when the bank's shares plunged almost 20%, Hickman said there appeared to have been a \"deliberate attempt\" by short-sellers \u2013 who sell shares they do not own in the hope of making a profit from buying them back at lower prices \u2013 to spread rumours about the bank being in financial difficulty. The bank had been \"threatened by short-selling in March and deposits were being withdrawn. They could have threatened the bank's existence if the FSA hadn't given assurances at the time,\" Hickman told a panel established by the banking standards commission to look at the collapse and rescue of HBOS. He was giving evidence with two former finance directors of HBOS: Mike Ellis, who held the role between 2001 and 2004 and again in 2008, and Phil Hodkinson, who was finance director between 2005 and 2006. HBOS was rescued by Lloyds in October 2008. The witnesses were asked repeatedly about Lloyds having to set aside \u00a37bn for bad loans shortly after taking over the bank. Hodkinson said the board had not foreseen the collapse of the commercial property market that eventually caused the losses in the corporate banking division. Hodkinson said: \"With the benefit of hindsight it may have been beneficial if there had been more people on the board with corporate banking experience.\" The corporate banking division was led by Peter Cummings, who has been fined \u00a3500,000 by the FSA and banned from working in the City. In its decision notice on Cummings, the FSA said the division had a \"culture of optimism\" which led to Lloyds having to take the \u00a37bn provision. Hodkinson said the board had regarded lending in the corporate division as \"confident but cautious\" and had been assured lending was cautious. Turnbull, chairing the panel, read from board minutes from October 2003, which he said warned that the commercial property market was getting \"too hot and strong\". Ellis said HBOS had an \"atypical\" approach to lending in the corporate bank. In a document from January 2004, Ellis warned the board that the FSA believed the group's strong growth and use of capital \"have given a rise to an accident waiting to happen in their [the FSA's] view\". Ellis was reporting to the board on an Arrow report, used by the FSA to assess the risks being taken by banks. Hodkinson said HBOS, like other banks, had not expected the funding markets to dry up completely, the problem that led to the nationalisation of Northern Rock. \"We stress-tested funding plans rigorously.

The event which did bring down the bank, that all wholesale markets would be closed to banks for some period of time, was not conceivable,\" Hodkinson said.",

HMRC's new head of enforcement, Jennie Granger, said: \"Our message to the small percentage who don't [pay the right tax] is a simple one: the net is closing in. \"We will detect you if you haven't put a job through the books, if you haven't declared investment income, if you've hidden assets offshore or if you haven't even registered for VAT.\" Critics of the Revenue's approach have suggested it is already piling excessive pressure on some taxpayer groups because they are easy targets rather than being the worst offenders. Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, said last week there was \"a mood of anger out there\", with many feeling they are hounded by the tax authorities while those suspected of avoiding hundreds of millions of pounds \"might be invited in for a cup of coffee with HMRC\".
