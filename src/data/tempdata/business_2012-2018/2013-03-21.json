      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has been dragged to a \u00a3600m loss by its banking arm, casting fresh doubt on the grocer and funeral operator's ability to take over 632 branches being sold by Lloyds Banking Group. The \u00a3662m of losses in the banking arm were caused by setting aside \u00a3150m to cover claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance, together with a \u00a3150m writedown of IT systems and \u00a3377m of bad loan losses, largely from its Britannia building society business. \"The bank is not immune to the terrible problems impacting the financial services sector,\" chief executive Peter Marks said. The Co-op's total provision for PPI mis-selling \u2013 which for the industry has reached more than \u00a312bn \u2013 is \u00a3244m. Presenting his last set of results after 40 years with Britain 's largest mutual, Marks described 2012 as a \"challenging year\" but insisted that progress was being made on the Lloyds deal, which would triple the Co-op's branch network and transform the group into a major competitor to the big four banks. He insisted that the Financial Services Authority had not expressed any concerns about the deal or about the capital position of its banking arm. Even so, he has put the Co-op's insurance arm up for sale after finally agreeing this week to sell its life assurance and savings business to Royal London. \"These moves are in line with our strategy of focusing on our banking activities and will also strengthen our capital position,\" Marks said. He blamed the economic backdrop for the poor performance of the bank, which reported a profit of \u00a3138m a year ago, and stressed that the bank's core tier-one capital ratio \u2013 closely watched by regulators as a measure of financial strength \u2013 had increased to 9.2% from 8.8% at the end of last year and was above the regulatory minimum. Marks was unable to give specific reasons why the sale of the Lloyds branches \u2013 known as Verde and being forced upon Lloyds by the EU as a condition of its \u00a320bn bailout \u2013 was not finalised eight months after it was announced in July. \"We're trying to conclude this transaction in very difficult economic times. That's what makes it more difficult. We're trying to establish what the risks are and to mitigate those risks,\" Marks said. Marks will be replaced by Euan Sutherland, previously boss of DIY chain B&amp;Q, in May. Marks' career with the Co-operative movement began in 1967 when he started as a shelf stacker. He said he preferred to focus on operating profits, which were \u00a354m, down from \u00a3526m a year ago. In the grocery business, there was a 0.7% fall in like-for-like food sales and a fall in operating profit from \u00a3318m to \u00a3288m. The specialist businesses of pharmacies, legal services and funeral homes reported a rise in operating profit to \u00a3107m from \u00a399m, largely driven by a better performance in the funeral business. The full-year dividend, which goes to members, is not announced until June, but the interim payment of \u00a3104m, declared in November, was down from \u00a3142m. Banks analyst Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital described the results of the banking arm as \"very grim reading\". \"The absolute capital position appears weak to us and, alongside weak profitability, will no doubt raise questions as to the ability of the Co-op to complete an acquisition of project Verde from Lloyds. \"This may not be such a bad outcome for Lloyds, in our view, given the rally in bank share prices since the deal was originally announced last year on what appeared to us to be terms that were very penal to Lloyds.\"",

    "webTitle": "Gas price warning as cold March leads to short supplies", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The cold snap in March could lead to Britain's gas supplies running out next month, forcing the nation to pay higher prices for fuel from elsewhere. Forecasts suggest that gas supplies in the UK could theoretically be exhausted by 8 April, requiring Britain to turn to imports from Norway and Russia. The warning came on the day Scottish and Southern Energy, one of the UK's biggest power suppliers, warned that there could be electricity blackouts in the country within three years. A lack of gas storage facilities, and rapid depletion at the UK's North Sea gas fields, has led to the UK having as little as two days' supply of the fuel in reserve. Demand spiked during the coldest March in 50 years. Though experts have warned of the problem for years, and the government has championed a \"dash for gas\" that would see a massive rise in demand for the fuel, little has been done to increase storage facilities. Ian Marchant, chief executive of SSE, said there was a \"very real risk of the lights going out\" within the next three years. SSE intends shutting down power plants, enough to have supplied 2m homes, as the stations are either uneconomic or coming to the end of their lives. Other firms are also planning to take power stations out of service, including the UK's fleet of ageing nuclear reactors, increasing the risk that demand for electricity will exceed the available supply. Marchant said: \"It appears the government is significantly underestimating the scale of the capacity crunch facing the UK in the next three years and there is a very real risk of the lights going out as a result.\" His comments follow warnings by Alistair Buchanan, the departing chief of Ofgem, that power shortages will be many times more likely in the next five years. Government estimates suggest that energy bills could rise by \u00a3100 a year this winter. Britain only ever holds about 15 days of gas in reserve because of lack of storage facilities and a failure to attract investment to build new ones. Britain is in fact unlikely to run out before 8 April but the estimate is based on trends that include current imports and consumption. The warnings are a particular blow to George Osborne, the chancellor, who has championed a new \"dash for gas\" in the UK, that would see gas take over as the dominant fuel in the UK's power generation market. Much of the generating capacity that SSE plans to retire consists of gas-fired power stations, though the recent budget has given tax breaks for shale gas extraction in the UK and heralded what could be the biggest expansion of UK gas-fired power in a generation. SSE said gas-fired power was uneconomic because of the fuel's high price compared with coal. The move by SSE highlights the disputes over energy policy and energy generation, following upheavals in the international markets for fossil fuels. It also brings into question whether targets to cut carbon dioxide can be met. Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said energy firms were trying to hold the government to ransom by threatening power outages that would help them extract concessions to get financial benefits. The UK has only six big energy suppliers to households, which campaigners say reduces competition and raises prices. Coal has become much cheaper because of the use of fossil fuel in the US in the past five years, where a massive increase in the supply of cheap gas is attributed to fracking, the controversial method of blasting dense rocks apart under high pressure. The coal that would have been burned in the US is now available on international markets at cut-price, and has now become \"the preferred fuel\", according to SSE. That is the opposite of what the government, and the EU intended by their energy policies in the past decade. Coal was supposed to become more expensive than gas, because of the EU's emissions trading scheme, which puts a price on carbon emissions. That has not happened, because flaws within the system mean the price of carbon is near an all-time low, meaning coal-fired power stations are not penalised for their effect on the climate. Marchant urged the government to bring forward reforms favouring gas. \"The government can reduce this risk [of power cuts] very easily, by taking swift action to provide much greater clarity on its electricity market reforms.\" An energy bill is under discussion by parliament at the moment. SSE's warnings were dismissed by green campaigners as \"an attempt to force the government's hand\". Pendleton said: \"The risk is that these companies are holding us to ransom, in order to make the environment more favourable to their forms of generation. There is a lot at stake here. Basing our energy strategy on gas rather than clean forms of energy such as renewables means we could be held to ransom more and more in the future in this way. It could do a huge amount of harm.\" The government rebuffed the claims from SSE. John Hayes, minister for energy, said: \"We're alive to the challenge facing us. The bill before parliament will set the conditions for the investment needed to keep Britain's lights on in the long-term. The amount of spare power available today is currently comfortable. As old infrastructure closes over the coming years we expect this margin to reduce but we will make sure it stays manageable.\" Most of the UK's nuclear power plants are slated for closure by 2022, and many coal-fired stations must be closed or run at reduced capacity within the next few years because of EU rules on pollution. Experts have warned for years of a looming \"energy gap\" between demand and supply. The building of wind farms and other forms of renewable energy, which were supposed to fill the gap, has been below expectations, in part due to planning laws. Hayes said: \"We are not complacent about this... We are confident in our approach and in the responsiveness of the market in providing secure power supplies.\" Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"Not content with the profits they're making from sky-high energy bills the gas industry now seems to be trying to hold everybody to ransom \u2013 'give us even more of your cash or we'll turn out the lights'. \"Cheap coal and the collapse of the carbon price have made gas burning less profitable, but that's a reason to ban unabated coal burning and reform the carbon market, not to give hand-outs to the big six energy companies. \"Gas-fired generation should only be a last-ditch backup for renewable energy sources, and [ministers] should prioritise support for interconnectors, storage, and combined heat and power stations that would compliment renewables and guarantee we have secure power.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With Cypriot MPs delaying the vote until tomorrow morning, I'm going to stop. Here's a very brisk round-up after another dramatic day: \u2022 Cyprus's parliament will vote on new legislation on Friday morning that will radically restructure its biggest banks. The decision is expected to protect smaller depositors at Laiki, its second biggest bank, but those with over \u20ac100,000 faces the possibility of large losses (see here onwards) \u2022 MPs will also consider legislation to give the power to impose capital controls, limiting cash transactions in Cyprus. \u2022 The move comes after the European Central Bank set Cyprus a deadline of next Monday to find \u20ac6bn to quality for its bailout package. Fail, and the ECB would withdraw its emergency liquidity support. See here onwards for the statement, and here for some analysis. \u2022 Rumours that Laiki was about to collapse swept Cyprus. This lead to more customers queuing at its cashpoints to withdraw funds (see here and here) \u2022 Angry bank staff also held a demo near to the Cyprus parliament, demanding answers about their future. There were isolated scuffles with police, but otherwise the protests were calm (latest photos here) \u2022 The Eurogroup said tonight that it was ready to discuss a new proposal with Cyprus, and reiterated the importance of protecting savings up to \u20ac100,000. The statement is here. \u2022 This morning, Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said he took responsibility for the decision that Cyprus would impose losses on savers with less than \u20ac100,00 in the bank (see here onwards) \u2022 The latest economic data showed that the euro economy continues to shrink, with France's private sector contracting particularly sharply (details here) \u2022 And S&amp;P downgraded Cyprus by one notch to CCC (see here) I'll be back in the morning. Goodnight! Before we go -- my colleague Helena Smith is in Nicosia, and reports on the sense of anger at the cash machines: At branches in Nicosia, the divided capital, Cypriots queued for hours in the hope of withdrawing cash with lines frequently moving at a snail\u2019s pace because of the inability of cash machines to dispense more than \u20ac40 euro at a time. \u201cI\u2019ve had to use my card ten times to get 400 euro,\u201d said Maria Gika, stuffing wads of cash into the pockets of her jeans before Laiki announced the \u20ac260 euro limit late on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m entitled to withdraw 800 euros a day. It\u2019s disgusting that I\u2019m unable to access my own money.\u201d Reuters says the vote in Cyprus was delayed until tomorrow because lawmakers needed \"more time for consultations\". Word from Cyprus that the parliament has postponed the vote on introducing emergency legislation, including the restructuring of its banking sector and the new laws to allow capital controls. That's off the Reuters terminal, and via journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo who adds that MPs should get their teeth into the plan tomorrow morning: The front page of this week's Economist captures the way that the Cyprus crisis suddenly fell on us last weekend: Ian Traynor, our Europe editor, sees method in the madness: The Eurogroup's statement hasn't generated much instant cheer among followers of the eurocrisis: The Cyprus crisis has helped to drive the Dow Jones industrial average down again. Wall Street has shut for the day, with the Dow falling 90 points to 14421. Another blow: Standard &amp; Poor's has cut its credit rating on Cyprus by one notch a few minutes ago, to CCC. That's two notches above default. Interesting timing - given the uncertainty tonight over Cyprus's plans. And I imagine anyone considering investing in Cyprus is well aware that it got somewhat riskier this week. FT Alphaville's Joseph Cotterill advises against snarking about rating agencies, though: Here's the statement from the eurogroup on Cyprus: Statement of the Eurogroup President on Cyprus The Eurogroup held a teleconference to take stock of the developments in Cyprus. The Eurogroup stands ready to discuss with the Cypriot authorities a draft new proposal, which it expects the Cyprus authorities to present as rapidly as possible. The Eurogroup would subsequently, on the basis of a Troika analysis that needs to be undertaken, be prepared to continue negotiations on an adjustment programme, while respecting the parameters defined earlier by the Eurogroup. After the conclusion of such negotiations the Cyprus authorities should begin legislating the elements of such an agreement. he Eurogroup reaffirms the importance of fully guaranteeing deposits below \u20ac100,000 in the EU. The Euro area Member States continue to stand ready to assist the Cypriot people in their reform efforts and stand ready to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole. The Greek finance ministry has told Reuters that the eurogroup has 'urged Cyprus' to present a new proposal on its bailout quickly, and reiterated (again!) the importance of protecting savers with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank. Not much new there.... Where's that statement?! The Eurogroup call on Cyprus has finished, and details are leaking out..... The deputy leader of the ruling Democratic Rally, or DISY, party has told reporters that the decision to 'restructure' Laiki will cut \u20ac2.3bn from Cyprus's contribution to its own bailout. That is because the restructuring removes some, or all, of the cost of recapitalising Laiki. So Cyprus would just have to raise another \u20ac3.5bn through its solidarity fund, or other sources.... Averof Neophytou didn't give further details, but reports suggest that Laiki's \"good assets\" will be merged with the country's largest lender, Bank of Cyprus. That is likely to include savers with less than \u20ac100,000. Larger deposits would end up in the bad bank, and could face rather larger losses than the 9.9% tax which Cyprus initially proposed: Details of the capital controls bill going through the Cyprus parliament, hot off the Reuters terminal. It states: The purpose of this law is, in case of an emergency for purposes of public order or security, to assign powers to the (Finance) Minister, or the (Central Bank) governor to take and impose temporary restrictive measures, including restrictions on capital controls. While we wait for developments in Cyprus or from the eurogroup, here are more photos of tonight's rally outside the parliament building in Nicosia: The Eurogroup conference call on Cyprus is reported to be underway (it was due to start at 6pm GMT). Reminder - we'll get a statement from them later, which could show whether finance ministers support Cyprus's new plan. The WSJ's SImon Nixon reckons they'll like parts of it at least -- the restructuring of Cyprus's banking sector. Dow Jones newswires is reporting the bank reform legislation which is being submitted to the Cypriot parliament tonight will impost capital controls on its banking sector. That will restricted the amount of money that can be taken out of a bank (when they reopen). Quite a moment for the single currency. Cyprus state TV are reporting that the legislation to create the solidarity fund has been placed at parliament (as president Nicos Anastasiades pledged this afternoon). Apparently seven (!) more bills are following, as part of the restructuring plan for Laiki Bank announced by central bank governor Panicos Demetriades in the last hour. Economist Nouriel Roubini tweets that it is vital that savers in Cyprus with less than \u20ac100,000 are protected, otherwise savers across Europe will fear that their own deposit guarantee schemes cannot be trusted: The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 112 points, or 0.8%, at 14401 following the latest developments in Cyprus. Wall Street also didn't like the look of the latest economic data from Europe, which showed the eurozone service and manufacturing sectors shrinking again (even Germany's manufacturing sector contracted). Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told Marketwatch: It seems to be Europe, and the somewhat weak manufacturing report that came out of Germany, which certainly has been the continent\u2019s bastion of economic growth, that set the market back. (see 10.05am for more details) Breaking News: Cyprus's central bank governor, Panicos Demetriades, is announcing that Laiki Bank is being restructured, speaking live on national TV. He's saying that the \"resolution process\" will avert bankrupcy, and protect savings up to \u20ac100,000. Demetriades added that a bill to implement the plan has been placed with the Cyprus parliament, and could be voted on tonight (according to Bloomberg). Laiki's decision to limit daily cash withdrawals is unlikely to stop the queues at its ATM machines. Apart from anything else, people will need to top up their wallets etc more frequently -- as there are still four more days until the banks are due to reopen. More positively, the announcement does mean that Laiki is still operating, even if not quite as 'normal'. Laiki Bank has just announced a new limit on ATM withdrawals of \u20ac260 per customer -- that's a newsflash on Reuters. More photos coming in over Twitter: Anti-German feelings being displayed in Cyprus tonight, reports Michelle Caruso-Cabrera of CNBC: Big crowds too: Another photo of workers from the Laiki (Popular) Bank, demonstrating outside the parliament building in Nicosia. Many of the people gathered outside the Cyprus parliament are bank workers who fear they will lose their jobs. The reports, since denied, that Laiki Bank will shut down helped to drive people to take part in the protests. The Wall Street Journal's Matina Stevis is there, and has filed a video clip (you can see it here) She also reports that the scene is \"very emotional\" with women crying and demanding answers about their jobs and their own savings. The TV feed is showing a video clip of the moment this afternoon when a few angry Cypriots pushing through the metal gates set up outside the parliament building, before some were pushed back by the riot police. You can watch the scene outside the Cyprus parliament on this live news feed. A large crowd has now gathered outside the Cyprus parliament, where riot police have been mobilised to prevent people getting close to the building. Reports from the scene say there have been clashes between citizens and the police in the last few minutes. Right now, it appears tense, but there are no signs of violence. Plenty of riot police though: Just in: the Cyprus central bank has now repeated its denial that Laiki Bank is to close.... (see previous post). Update: Central Bank spokeswoman Aliki Stylianou told state television: We deny these reports. Efforts are under way right now to find the best possible solution for this bank. As you were Cyprus media are now reporting that Laiki Bank is to close. Cyprus's state television station, CYBC, says that Laiki will be split into a good bank and a bad bank. Rumours that Laiki - Cyprus's second largest bank - would be split were circulating this morning, but were being denied by the country's banking regulator. The decision would appear to mean depositors with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank would be fully protected under the deposit insurance scheme. But the situation is unclear. There was applause and shouts of \"hurrah\" at a conference in Moscow today, when prime minister Dmitry Medvedev announced that Cyprus had decided to drop its savings tax. Over to Howard Amos in Russia for the story: Outrage over a threat to levy a deposit tax on Cyprus' banks has been on display in Russia when the news about the Cypriot Parliament's decision to drop the compulsory tax filtered through to Moscow. \u201cWhile we are sitting here, Cyprus has once and for all refused to introduce a tax on deposits,\u201d Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told the Congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in the Russian capital, after glancing at his iPad. The announcement prompted a round of applause amongst conference delegates and shouts of \u201churrah,\u201d the Interfax news agency reported. The governor of Cyprus's Central Bank Panikos Dimitriadis told Russian newspaper Vedomosti this morning that Russian citizens have as much as \u20ac10.2 billion in frozen Cypriot bank accounts. Eurozone finance ministers will hold a conference call tonight, at 6pm GMT, to discuss the situation in Cyprus. A statement should then be issued. That's via the president of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem: If you're just joining us, Dijsselbloem told MEPs this morning that Cyprus was 'unfortunately' a systemic threat to the eurozone, and took responsibility for the bailout deal that was hammered out last weekend (and then rejected by the Cypriot parliament) (see 8.35am onwards) In Athens the left-wing firebrand leader, Alexis Tsipras, has held a press conference at which he declared his Syriza party was 'in solidarity' with Cyprus. Tsipras told a press conference that the Cypriot parliament had delivered a blow to \"neoliberal policies in Europe.\u201d It bolsters Syriza's argument that Greece can, and should, renegotiate its own austerity package, he added It has opened a window of opportunity. We call on all Greeks to show solidarity with Cyprus and its decision to say 'no'. Cyprus's council of ministers will begin considering the details of the country's new 'Investment Solidarity Fund' at 6pm local time (4pm GMT). Government spokesman Christos Stylianides has issued this official statement earlier today, confirming that all sides support the plan: Following a proposal by the President of the Republic there was a consensus reached and a unanimous decision was taken for the establishment of an Investment Solidarity Fund. The proposal is currently undergoing legal and technical processing by the Law Office of the Republic.... For this purpose draft, legislation is being prepared by the Law Office of the Republic, which will be presented before the Council of Ministers in a meeting today at 6pm. The plan is then to submit it to parliament for 'final approval' at 7pm GMT - which could mean a vote tonight. Other reports, though, have suggested this is unlikely. Confusing picture. (the hashtag reads 'we will make it' ) People are continuing to wait patiently in line at Laiki cash machines in Cyprus. The queues all appear pretty calm: In Cyprus, politicians and officials are continuing to work on the details of a new solidarity fund, in an effort to find new funding before the ECB carries out its threat to withdraw liquidity. Demetris Syllouris, who leads the right-wing Evroko, took part the negotiations led by president Nicos Anastasiades this morning. He has now reporters that the fund would seek donations from ordinary Cypriots, businessmen and foreign investors, according to AP. Shares have fallen on Wall Street at the start of trading, with the Dow Jones dropping 53 points to 14457, -0.4% as investors catch up with the reports of longer queues at some ATM machines in Cyprus. European stock markets are still in the red (FTSE 100 down 0.8%, Germany down 1.2%, France down 1.5%). Threatening to cut funding to Cyprus's banks is a dramatic step by the European Central Bank, but it reflects fears that Europe's central bank itself could suffer significant losses if a bank run began in Cyprus. Under the ECB's own rules, it can only supply liquidity to a eurozone bank if it is confident that it remains solvent. Without the IMF/EU bailout, Laiki bank's future looks particularly troubled. And the ECB's governing council must fear that it could incur very large losses itself if it continued to supply liquidity to Cypriot banks while depositors systematically emptied their accounts. The ECB has currently extended \u20ac9bn of liquidity to Cyprus's banking system. Total deposits has been estimated at \u20ac60bn, with perhaps \u20ac20bn belonging to Russian depositors. So, the current liquidity probably isn't enough to cover an actual bank run. If the ECB offered more liquidity to Cypriot banks to cover deposit withdrawals, and the banks collapsed anyway, then Cyprus could still leave the euro and default on its liabilities under the Target 2 system (Europe's interbank payment system). As the Open Europe think tank explains: Extending the ELA without a clear deal could lead to a significant transfer of risk towards the ECB and questions over its credibility. This would be a particularly poisonous debate in Germany, something which neither the ECB nor the German government would want ahead of the German elections in September. With this in mind, it is possible to see why the ECB has taken such a strict line here. That said, it certainly ramps up the pressure over the next few days. Lastly, although the ECB is taking the decision based on technical considerations, it's clear the good folks in Frankfurt are now deeply embroiled in a highly political debate - precisely what the ECB wants to avoid at all costs. More from Open Europe here. Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine thinktank argues that the ECB's threat to turn off support for Cyprus next week is a challenge to the democratic process - and puts more pressure on eurozone leaders: Russia's two largest state-owned banks have now both said they are uninterested in buying Cypriot banks, reports Howard Amos. The island-state's banking assets were one of the bargaining chips Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis Sarris was hoping to be able to use to tempt the Kremlin into offering a rescue package. \u201cWe don't, of course, have any plans of that sort,\u201d said Andrei Kostin, the head of Russia's second biggest bank, VTB. \u201cOur interests are that we are given the opportunity to carry out payments and access the accounts of our clients.\u201d VTB has a subsidiary on Cyprus called Russian Commercial Bank which is at risk of losing \u201cmillions of euros\u201d in a compulsory levy. German Gref, the head of Russia's biggest bank, Sberbank, said last night that he had been approached about buying Cypriot banks, but had turned the offer down. Over in Russia, prime minster Dmitry Medevdev has said that he is counting on Cyprus' problems being solved without an compulsory levy on depositors. \u201cSooner or later it will be necessary to sort out all the problems there, and I hope that the solution will not be with confiscations, but will be rational and modern,\u201d he said at a government meeting in Moscow on Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported. Last night Medvedev told journalists that the EU's behaviour in Cyprus was similar to that of an \u201celephant in a china shop\u201d and that the plan to tax deposits \u201clooked like theft.\u201d Medvedev has also came up with a novel solution to turn Cyprus' problems to Russia's advantage. The Kremlin should develop the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin in the country's Far East as new offshore banking destinations, Medvedev told government ministers. Russia's ownership of the Kuril Islands is disputed by Japan, and visitors currently require special permission from the security services. Sakhalin is a rain-swept island off Russia's Pacific coast and the site of a former Tsarist penal colony. (that's via Howard Amos in Russia) Another selection of photos from Nicosia of the lengthening queues at cash machines run by Laiki Bank, one of the two lenders who could collapse if the ECB follows through on its threat to withdraw emergency liquidity next week Reports from Cyprus that the country's cabinet will meet to discuss the proposal for a solidarity fund at 6pm local time (4pm GMT or noon PDT). Martin Wheatley, chief executive of Britain's new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which begins life formally next month, has admitted that contagion from Cyprus is a concern. He also said that the idea of putting a levy on bank accounts \"undermines confidence in the banking system\" (a reference to the eurozone's \u20ac100,000 deposit protection scheme) Wheatley was speaking at a press conference in London (my colleague Jill Treanor reports). The FCA will officially replace the Financial Services Authority (FSA) from the start of April, with tougher powers to keep the UK financial industry in line and protect customers. Another option for Cyprus could be to use the energy resources off its coastline as collateral for a stability fund. That fund could then issue bonds to investors, raising some/all of the \u20ac6bn which Cyprus needs to satisfy the IMF and the EU: There are several reports of longer queues at some of Cyprus's cash machine's this morning - specifically those belonging to Laiki bank -- Cyprus's heavily indebted second-largest lender. Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, CNBC's chief international correspondent, tweets two photos: And here's another, from freelance journalist Janine Louloudi: Eurozone officials are increasingly alarmed about the situation in Cyprus, according to the notes of a conference call seen by Reuters. During the call, which took place last night, officials admitted they were \"in a mess\" as they discussed whether capital controls (limits on bank withdrawals and cash movements) could protect the country. Cyprus didn't attend the call - another worrying sign - as other officials talked about the risk of the country quitting the eurozone. Reuters reports: In detailed notes of the call seen by Reuters, one official described emotions as running \"very high\", making it difficult to come up with rational solutions, and referred to \"open talk in regards of (Cyprus) leaving the euro zone\". The call was among members of the Eurogroup Working Group, which consists of deputy finance ministers or senior treasury officials from the 17 euro zone countries as well as representatives from the European Central Bank and the European Commission. The group is chaired by Austria's Thomas Wieser. Cyprus decided not to take part in the call, a decision that several participants described as troubling and reflecting the wider confusion surrounding the island's predicament. \"The (Cypriot) parliament is obviously too emotional and will not decide on anything, if Cyprus does not even feel that they can attend the call it is a big problem for us,\" the French representative said, according to the notes seen by Reuters. \"We have never seen this.\" The full story is online here: Exclusive: Euro zone call notes reveal extent of alarm over Cyprus Here's the quote from the speaker of the Cypriot parliament, Yiannakis Omirou, following this morning's talks on a new bailout plan: We didn't discuss a (deposit) haircut and we are not reverting to it. Reports out of Cyprus in the last few minutes suggest that the country's leaders have decided to create \"national solidarity fund\", at this morning's talks in Nicosia. Averof Neophytou, who is the deputy leader of the ruling Democratic Rally party, made the comments to reporters in Nicosia. There's no word on what the fund would includes - but reports last night suggested pension assets, various state assets, and even property owned by the Church of Cyprus. The parliament's speaker has also been speaking, suggested that a vote will not take place on the plan today. He also indicated that the leaders did not consider the issue of a bank levy -- suggesting a savings tax might now be off the agenda. More to follow! Cyprus's central bank governor, Panicos Demetriades, has declared that the country will manage to hammer out a financial support package in time. Soeaking in Nicosia a few minutes ago, Demetriades said: I expect a programme of support for Cyprus by Monday. No suggestion of what it will be, though.... ...but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup president, made the important point during his appearance at the European Parliament's economic affairs committee this morning: that taxing large depositors in Cyprus is a better, fairer way than raising money from taxpayers. Dijsselbloem insisted that the eurogroup considered alternative solutions, but concluded that \"many of the taxes we looked at would have touched the local people\". And as reported at 8.35am, Dijsselbloem is adamant that the burden of a bank savings levy should fall on those with big deposits (who are arguable investors, not simply savers). Reuters has full highlights of his appearance here. Europe's stock markets are sliding this morning, following the ECB's threat to withdraw support for Cyprus's banks next week (see here onwards). The disappointingly weak PMI data (see 10.05am) has also driven shares lower: FTSE 100: down 56 points at 6376, -0.87% German DAX: down 66 points at 7935, - 0.8% French CAC: down 39 points at 3789. -1% Spanish IBEX: down 92 points at 8324, -1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 92 points at 15924, -0.6% The euro is also dropping, hitting a five-week low of 85.05p against the pound. It's back below $1.29 against the US dollar too. Europe's economy was already weakening before the Cyprus crisis blew up, bleak economic data released this morning has shown. Europe's private sector is shrinking this month at a faster rate than in February, and rather quicker than analysts had expected. Markit's 'flash composite PMI', which measures services and manufacturing firms across the eurozone, fell to 46.5 this month, from 47.9 (any number below 50 means the sector contracted) France's economy looks particularly bleak, with its service sector PMI tumbling to a worryingly weak 41.9. That's the lowest level since February 2009, and the dark days after the collapse of Lehman Brother. And growth in Germany also slowed, with its composite PMI (services and manufacturing) falling to 51.0, from 53.3. It suggests the eurozone recession is deepening . Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, warned that the data was pretty disappointing, with the Cyprus crisis probably already making the situation even worse: Events that hit business confidence can have a very rapid effect on the data and so there is good reason to believe that responses we collect this week will on average be more negative. Meanwhile over in Moscow, Cypriot finance minister Michael Sarris says talks will continue with the Russian government. He insisted negotiations were going well, telling Reuters: The banks are the ultimate objective in any support we get, so it'll either be a direct support to the banks or the support that we get through other sectors will be channelled to the banks, because this is our biggest challenge to recapitalise the banks. If the ECB does pull the plug then there could be turmoil in Cyprus next Tuesday, when the banks were scheduled to finally reopen. And the deposit guarantee scheme which is meant to protect depositors in the event of a bank collapse could quickly be proved worthless. As Frances Coppola (a former banker) has blogged about here, deposit guarantee schemes are only as good as the national government who stands behind them. And Cyprus does not appear to have the assets to hand to cover the first \u20ac100,000 deposits in its banking sector: So, Coppola explains: It is time that depositors were told the truth. The lack of a common deposit insurance scheme in the Eurozone means that deposit insurance is a luxury available only to those countries that can afford it - which are also the countries that least need it. Everywhere else, it is a sham. Potentially awful news for Cypriots, as well as thousands of ex-pats from the UK and beyond. More here: Sham guarantee Some early reaction to the ECB's threat to stop supporting Cyprus's banks next week: BIG NEWS: The European Central Bank has announced that it has agreed to continue supplying emergency funding to Cyprus's banks until next Monday. But if the bailout hasn't been agreed by then, the ECB would step away. It's quite an ultimatum. Here's the statement: The Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided to maintain the current level of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) until Monday, 25 March 2013 Thereafter, Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) could only be considered if an EU/IMF programme is in place that would ensure the solvency of the concerned banks. That sets Nicosia a clear deadline -- find \u20ac6bn by next week, in a way that satisfies the IMF and the European Union, or your banks collapse. Jeroen Dijsselbloem has taken responsibility for the fateful decision that Cyprus's smaller savers with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank should be taxed: I take full responsibility, I'm the chairman [of the eurogroup]. Dijsselbloem then points out that the various parties in the room last Friday night/Saturday morning all had their own agenda, but that it was his job to steer the group towards a compromise that worked. (our inside story of the negotiations has the background, btw) Jeroen Dijsselbloem went on to warn: [Cyprus] is definitely a systemic risk, and the unrest of the last couple of days have proved that, unfortunately. He also cautioned that a new large Russian loan would not solve Cyprus's problems: Building up the debts of Cyprus does not help it towards a sustainable future. (And if the International Monetary Fund isn't convinced that Cyprus's debts are sustainable, it would not support the bailout....) Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Dutch finance minister and head of the eurogroup, is discussing the Cyprus crisis at the European parliament now. It's being streamed live, here. Dijsselbloem told MEPs that the eurogroup felt it was fairer that Cyprus's \u20ac6bn contribution to its bailout and bank restructuring should come from its bank savers, particularly from \"non residents with large deposits\". He \"strongly hopes\" that the new package being drawn up in Cyprus offers a \"more fair balance\". UPDATE: Here's the key quote: The Eurogroup thinks it's very important that we should have a fair burden share, and that means a larger contribution from large depositors than, of course, from small depositors. Over at Dialogue Russia-EU in Moscow, ,European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has said he is worried about the situation in Cyprus, but tried to sound positive: I'm very concerned with the recent developments in Cyprus, mainly because of the consequences for the citizens of Cyprus. We have in the past solved bigger problems. I hope that this time a solution can also be found. The session is being streamed live on Russian TV, here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the unfolding crisis in Cyprus. The Cypriot government is racing to pull together a new plan today to secure its bailout package and prevent the collapse of its banking sector. This \"Plan B\" has just been presented to party leaders this morning, and could possibly be voted on later today. State TV have reported that the plan could include a levy on bank deposits over \u20ac100,000, after MPs dramatically rejected the original plan to tax smaller deposits on Tuesday night. It could also potentially include a new loan from Russia, nationalising pension funds, or restructuring and selling off - or even closing down - parts of the banking sector. However it is put together, Plan B must raise enough money to satisfy the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the rest of the eurozone, and unlock Cyprus's \u20ac10bn aid package. But there are no easy answers in a game of brinksmanship that continues to spread concern across the eurozone, leaving the Cypriot people facing a deeply worrying future. Meanwhile Cyprus's finance minister, Michael Sarris, remains in Moscow negotiating with the Russian government. Sarris didn't appear to make much progress yesterday, raising fears that his dash to Moscow was failing. Speaking of Russia...European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is in Moscow today for \"Dialogue Russia-EU\", and meetings with prime minister Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev was scathing about the crisis last night, particularly the plan to tax bank deposits, telling reporters that: I cannot compare it to anything but some decisions made at a certain period of time by the Soviet authorities that did not care much about people's savings. Which should make for a lively meeting....",

This week the Financial Services Authority (FSA) said it was taking a tougher approach to fines by basing them on stock market value rather than assessments made by the enforcement division. On Cyprus, Wheatley said an initial plan to skim \u20ac5.8bn from savers' bank accounts as part of the bailout could hit confidence in the banking system as it may undermine the \u20ac100,000 guarantee on deposits across the EU.

In addition to the potential for contagion in the eurozone, Wheatley said the regulator was also concerned that customers would start to seek out riskier products because interest rates were so low, and that once rates started to rise customers might start to have difficulty repaying loans. John Griffith-Jones, who will be the non-executive chairman of the FCA, said the regulator could make \"a fresh start.\" \"Prevention in this industry is much cheaper than a cure,\" he said.",

    "webTitle": "Cyprus crisis: EU risks the unthinkable if bailout ultimatum fails", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deadlines have been set. Ultimatums have been delivered. The EU has given Cyprus until Monday to come up with \u20ac5.8bn to part fund its own bailout or have its financial lifeline cut off by the European Central Bank. Unthinkable less than a week ago, the possibility of the eurozone losing one of its 17 members is now being discussed. Reuters reported that a meeting of eurozone officials openly canvassed the need to impose capital controls to insulate the rest of the single-currency club in the event of Cyprus leaving. It was never envisaged that any country would ever leave the euro. There is therefore no template for an exit strategy that would prove painful for Cyprus and have potentially wide-ranging implications not just for the rest of Europe, but for the whole global economy. The first stage of the process would involve the EU calling Cyprus's bluff. At the moment, Cypriot banks are being supported by the European Central Bank's Emergency Liquidity Assistance, which allows them to remain open for business. The moment the ECB pulls the plug, Cyprus's banks will go bust. They have a \u20ac17bn cash shortfall, no equity and could raise only perhaps \u20ac2bn from forcing bondholders to take a haircut. The banks would shut and deposits would be worthless. Stage two would involve the government in Nicosia re-introducing the Cypriot pound as legal tender. This would cause logistical difficulties, unless the government has stashed away piles of the old currency when it joined the euro five years ago. This seems unlikely, so the government would have to start printing new notes. This would take time to organise and in the meantime the government would have to use euro notes re-denominated as Cypriot pounds. One way of doing this would be to over-print the notes in a distinctive way, as happened in Germany during its currency crisis in the 1920s. Nick Parsons, head of strategy at National Australia Bank said the capital controls on withdrawals from cashpoints would make this process simpler, since there would be fewer euros in circulation when the crunch came. The government would then have to set an exchange rate for the Cypriot pound against the dollar and would probably set it at the level that existed before it entered the single currency. If the currency was allowed to float freely on the foreign exchanges, the pound would drop like a stone. If the authorities set a fixed exchange rate, the official value of the currency would bear not the slightest resemblance to its black market value. When Argentina abandoned its convertibility against the dollar in 2002, the peso depreciated by around 75% in the subsequent 15 months. A plunging currency would lead to dearer imports, rising inflation and sharp cuts in living standards. The government would impose strict capital controls to prevent money leaving the country. It would also try to ensure that all transactions in euros ceased. Unofficially, the euro \u2013 along with other hard currencies such as the dollar \u2013 would circulate on the black market. One additional problem would be whether contracts agreed in euros could be enforced. The concept of lex monetae means debts in euros would become debts in Cypriot pounds and settled at an exchange rate decided by the government in Nicosia. So what are chances of this happening? Parsons says it is still unlikely but the risk is far greater than it was. He writes: \"A few months ago I would have put the possibility of Cyprus leaving the euro at 1%. Today I would put it at about 30%.\"",

      "body": "<p>Deadlines have been set. Ultimatums have been delivered. The EU has given Cyprus until Monday to come up with \u20ac5.8bn to part fund its own bailout or have its financial lifeline cut off by the European Central Bank.</p> <p>Unthinkable less than a week ago, the possibility of the eurozone losing one of its 17 members is now being discussed. Reuters reported that a meeting of eurozone officials openly canvassed the need to impose capital controls to insulate the rest of the single-currency club in the event of Cyprus leaving.</p> <p>It was never envisaged that any country would ever leave the euro. There is therefore no template for an exit strategy that would prove painful for Cyprus and have potentially wide-ranging implications not just for the rest of Europe, but for the whole global economy.</p> <p>The first stage of the process would involve the EU calling Cyprus's bluff. At the moment, Cypriot banks are being supported by the European Central Bank's Emergency Liquidity Assistance, which allows them to remain open for business. The moment the ECB pulls the plug, Cyprus's banks will go bust. They have a \u20ac17bn cash shortfall, no equity and could raise only perhaps \u20ac2bn from forcing bondholders to take a haircut. The banks would shut and deposits would be worthless.</p> <p>Stage two would involve the government in Nicosia re-introducing the Cypriot pound as legal tender. This would cause logistical difficulties, unless the government has stashed away piles of the old currency when it joined the euro five years ago. This seems unlikely, so the government would have to start printing new notes.</p> <p>This would take time to organise and in the meantime the government would have to use euro notes re-denominated as Cypriot pounds. One way of doing this would be to over-print the notes in a distinctive way, as happened in Germany during its currency crisis in the 1920s. Nick Parsons, head of strategy at National Australia Bank said the capital controls on withdrawals from cashpoints would make this process simpler, since there would be fewer euros in circulation when the crunch came.</p> <p>The government would then have to set an exchange rate for the Cypriot pound against the dollar and would probably set it at the level that existed before it entered the single currency. If the currency was allowed to float freely on the foreign exchanges, the pound would drop like a stone. If the authorities set a fixed exchange rate, the official value of the currency would bear not the slightest resemblance to its black market value. When Argentina abandoned its convertibility against the dollar in 2002, the peso depreciated by around 75% in the subsequent 15 months.</p> <p>A plunging currency would lead to dearer imports, rising inflation and sharp cuts in living standards. The government would impose strict capital controls to prevent money leaving the country. It would also try to ensure that all transactions in euros ceased. Unofficially, the euro \u2013 along with other hard currencies such as the dollar \u2013 would circulate on the black market.</p> <p>One additional problem would be whether contracts agreed in euros could be enforced. The concept of <em>lex monetae </em>means debts in euros would become debts in Cypriot pounds and settled at an exchange rate decided by the government in Nicosia.</p> <p>So what are chances of this happening? Parsons says it is still unlikely but the risk is far greater than it was. He writes: \"A few months ago I would have put the possibility of Cyprus leaving the euro at 1%. Today I would put it at about 30%.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir John Peace really should know better. He is the chairman of a bank, Standard Chartered, that has admitted responsibility for breaching US sanctions against Iran and agreed to pay huge fines. In that position you cannot drop broad hints that you think the bank was a victim of a shake-down by regulators. Peace's inflammatory words at his press conference earlier this month were: \"We had no wilful act to avoid sanctions.\" Not surprisingly, the US department of justice and New York County district attorney's office have come down on him like a ton of bricks. They have, in effect, told him to sit on the naughty step and repeat the shameful lines for public consumption: \"Standard Chartered Bank unequivocally acknowledges and accepts responsibility \u2026 for past knowing and wilful criminal conduct in violating US economic sanctions laws and regulations, and related New York criminal laws.\" The interesting part is the context of Peace's stupid remark. He was being asked about pay and bonuses. Why wasn't the bank trying to claw back past bonuses? The question remains. OK, strictly speaking, there is a straightforward answer: clawback provisions were not in place in 2001-07 when the sanction-breaching took place.

      "body": "<p>Sir John Peace really should know better. He is the chairman of a bank, Standard Chartered, that has admitted responsibility for breaching US sanctions against Iran and agreed to pay huge fines. In that position you cannot drop broad hints that you think the bank was a victim of a shake-down by regulators.</p> <p>Peace's inflammatory words at his press conference earlier this month were: \"We had no wilful act to avoid sanctions.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the US department of justice and New York County district attorney's office have come down on him like a ton of bricks. They have, in effect, told him to sit on the naughty step and repeat the shameful lines for public consumption: \"Standard Chartered Bank unequivocally acknowledges and accepts responsibility \u2026 for past knowing and wilful criminal conduct in violating US economic sanctions laws and regulations, and related New York criminal laws.\"</p> <p>The interesting part is the context of Peace's stupid remark. He was being asked about pay and bonuses. Why wasn't the bank trying to claw back past bonuses? The question remains.</p> <p>OK, strictly speaking, there is a straightforward answer: clawback provisions were not in place in 2001-07 when the sanction-breaching took place. On the other hand, Standard Chartered's current chief executive, Peter Sands, and its finance director, Richard Meddings, were both in senior positions during that period. Sands was finance director for most of the time and Meddings was a group executive director responsible for risk.

      "bodyText": "US regulators have forced Standard Chartered to retract comments by its chairman dismissing its breaches of US sanctions to Iran as \"clerical errors\". Sir John Peace also apologised for remarks, which included describing the bank's breaches as not \"wilful acts\". He made the comments this month at its full-year results press conference. Last year regulators fined Standard Chartered \u00a3415m and reached deferred prosecution agreements with the bank to avoid further sanctions. In an unusual step, the bank was forced to issue a formal stock market announcement yesterday by US regulators. In a signed letter by Peace, the chairman said that during the press conference: \"I made certain statements that I very much regret and that were at best inaccurate.\" The statement appeared to demonstrate the influence of the US regulators by containing American spellings \"willful\" and \"apologize\". At the press conference questions were asked \"concerning individual employee conduct and compensation\" following the deferred prosecution agreements. Peace had replied, when asked about bonuses for executives: \"We had no wilful act to avoid sanctions; you know, mistakes are made \u2013 clerical errors \u2013 and we talked about last year a number of transactions which clearly were clerical errors or mistakes that were made.\" But Thursday's announcement said: \"My statement that Standard Chartered 'had no willful act to avoid sanctions' was wrong, and directly contradicts Standard Chartered's acceptance of responsibility in the deferred prosecution agreement and accompanying factual statement.\" He was sitting alongside the chief executive, Peter Sands, and the finance director, Richard Meddings, when he made the remarks, and their names are also contained in the statement. \"To be clear, Standard Chartered Bank unequivocally acknowledges and accepts responsibility, on behalf of the bank and its employees, for past knowing and willful criminal conduct in violating US economic sanctions laws and regulations, and related New York criminal laws, as set out in the deferred prosecution agreement,\" Peace said. \"I, Mr Sands, Mr Meddings, and Standard Chartered Bank apologize for the statements I made to the contrary.\" The bank would not elaborate on its statement or explain why it had been issued, other to than say that there had been \"discussions\" with US regulators. Sands was forced to cut short his holiday last year when regulators published documents detailing the breaches of sanctions. One of the documents appeared to indicate that Meddings had said \"fucking Americans\" when warned about the potential breaches of sanctions, though the bank insists that this is not accurate. Sands has admitted that he has been awarded a bonus of nearly \u00a32m for 2012, down 10%, while the bonus pool at the bank, which does most of its business in emerging markets, is down 7%. The settlements were with the office of foreign assets control, the Federal Reserve, the US department of justice and the New York department of financial services (DFS). The period of the offences covered 2001 to the end of 2007 \u2013 making it difficult for the bank to claw back bonuses, as such provisions were not contained in contracts at the time. The regulators found that $24m (\u00a316m) of transactions processed on behalf of Iranian parties and a total of $109m to Burma, Sudan and Libya also appeared to be in violation of sanction laws. Standard Chartered has stressed that its New York office, during the period, processed $139tn in US dollar payments. The bank has also stressed that it stopped any Iranian-dollar payment business in late 2006 and in the following year stopped any new business with Iranian entities.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The Fed chairman's press conference proved quietly historic as Bernanke aligned his legacy with the cause of banking reform", 
      "body": "<p>Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is unassuming. He has an academic beard and, no matter how well-dressed he is, his clothes always look nondescript. When he speaks during press conferences, his eyes get moist and his voice takes on a nervous, shaky tinge. He has been in the middle of crisis after crisis during his term, and yet, for the most part, he has faded into the background where more brash or foul-mouthed figures like former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner came to the forefront. </p> <p>Bernanke is so low-key, in fact, that <a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/02/14/is-bernankes-shyness-holding-back-the-economy/?iid=SF_F_LN\">one research report this year from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested</a> that the Federal Reserve would have been more aggressive on the economy if Bernanke weren't so shy. So it's easy to forget that Bernanke has quietly changed everything about the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>That was <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57575419/bernanke-stimulus-hinges-on-sustained-improvement/\">highlighted Wednesday in the Fed chairman's first press conference of 2013</a>. The press conference ended up being less about the economy \u2013 which is ho-hum and moving along \u2013 and much more of an insight into what Bernanke thinks about the role of a Fed chairman and how he has changed it.</p> <p>Two reporters asked Bernanke about his plans after the Fed. He did say he had talked to the president but Bernanke remained vague; he archly told a Wall Street Journal reporter he'd give him a call when he decided on his next step.</p> <p>Bernanke did say a few things that illuminated that this otherwise closed-off man may be thinking more carefully about how history will evaluate his time overseeing \u2013 and forever changing \u2013 the Federal Reserve and the nation's financial system. In fact, Wednesday's press conference, which seemed boring in the context of economic news, was a watershed moment for showing some unaccustomed public introspection from Bernanke.</p> <p>For the first time, we heard Bernanke compare his views to not one, but two previous Fed chairmen: Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker.</p> <p>The Greenspan comparison was the most startling because it was the most pointed. When asked how the Fed would go on without him, Bernanke said, in essence, that he wasn't a magician, and that the Fed would easily survive his departure. He said he had worked to make the Fed more transparent as an institution and he had worked to reduce the Fed's previous reliance on \"personality\" to communicate.</p> <p>This was a none-too-subtle swipe against the disastrous Cult of Alan Greenspan, in which the press relied almost entirely on one man to get their read of the economy. Greenspan was, <a href=\"http://www.utne.com/2001-04-01/TheCultofGreenspan.aspx\">in the words of NPR</a>, more recognizable than Justin Timberlake, back in the 1990s.</p> <p>Bernanke, since taking over the Fed in 2006, has reversed that. Especially in recent years, he has recast the Fed as more collaborative: less an autocratic empire and more of a democratic senate. Bernanke has made the Federal Reserve board's votes and opinions open so that anyone can see that there is not one economic plan handed down on stone tablets from a single prophet, but instead, the result of lively debate. This wasn't all humility: Bernanke is still a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2009/08/the_rise_of_ben_bernanke.html\">shrewd political operator who distanced himself</a> from former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner when Geithner was being blamed for being too friendly to banks.</p> <p>Bernanke, an economic historian, is also used to taking the long view. He must also know it won't do for him to get blamed for everything if history is unkind later.</p> <p>Still, this show of humility \u2013 Bernanke's somewhat hard-to-believe implication that there are many potential capable leaders of the Federal Reserve \u2013 also served Bernanke's self-effacing, technocratic reputation as someone who doesn't care about the spotlight.

      "bodyText": "Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is unassuming. He has an academic beard and, no matter how well-dressed he is, his clothes always look nondescript. When he speaks during press conferences, his eyes get moist and his voice takes on a nervous, shaky tinge. He has been in the middle of crisis after crisis during his term, and yet, for the most part, he has faded into the background where more brash or foul-mouthed figures like former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner came to the forefront. Bernanke is so low-key, in fact, that one research report this year from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that the Federal Reserve would have been more aggressive on the economy if Bernanke weren't so shy. So it's easy to forget that Bernanke has quietly changed everything about the Federal Reserve. That was highlighted Wednesday in the Fed chairman's first press conference of 2013. The press conference ended up being less about the economy \u2013 which is ho-hum and moving along \u2013 and much more of an insight into what Bernanke thinks about the role of a Fed chairman and how he has changed it. Two reporters asked Bernanke about his plans after the Fed. He did say he had talked to the president but Bernanke remained vague; he archly told a Wall Street Journal reporter he'd give him a call when he decided on his next step. Bernanke did say a few things that illuminated that this otherwise closed-off man may be thinking more carefully about how history will evaluate his time overseeing \u2013 and forever changing \u2013 the Federal Reserve and the nation's financial system. In fact, Wednesday's press conference, which seemed boring in the context of economic news, was a watershed moment for showing some unaccustomed public introspection from Bernanke. For the first time, we heard Bernanke compare his views to not one, but two previous Fed chairmen: Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker. The Greenspan comparison was the most startling because it was the most pointed. When asked how the Fed would go on without him, Bernanke said, in essence, that he wasn't a magician, and that the Fed would easily survive his departure. He said he had worked to make the Fed more transparent as an institution and he had worked to reduce the Fed's previous reliance on \"personality\" to communicate. This was a none-too-subtle swipe against the disastrous Cult of Alan Greenspan, in which the press relied almost entirely on one man to get their read of the economy. Greenspan was, in the words of NPR, more recognizable than Justin Timberlake, back in the 1990s. Bernanke, since taking over the Fed in 2006, has reversed that. Especially in recent years, he has recast the Fed as more collaborative: less an autocratic empire and more of a democratic senate. Bernanke has made the Federal Reserve board's votes and opinions open so that anyone can see that there is not one economic plan handed down on stone tablets from a single prophet, but instead, the result of lively debate. This wasn't all humility: Bernanke is still a shrewd political operator who distanced himself from former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner when Geithner was being blamed for being too friendly to banks. Bernanke, an economic historian, is also used to taking the long view. He must also know it won't do for him to get blamed for everything if history is unkind later. Still, this show of humility \u2013 Bernanke's somewhat hard-to-believe implication that there are many potential capable leaders of the Federal Reserve \u2013 also served Bernanke's self-effacing, technocratic reputation as someone who doesn't care about the spotlight. (He didn't mention, naturally, that the spotlight, during his time, has generally been an ugly place to be.) That wasn't Bernanke's only attempt at putting his own views in the context of Fed history. Bernanke also compared himself to Volcker, when talking about the US banking system, which the Fed regulates. Volcker once said, famously, that the only great financial innovation of recent decades was the invention of the automated teller machine. Bernanke smiled as he quoted Volcker's bellicose quip and said he wouldn't go that far \u2013 but he was surprisingly frank in talking about the failures of the financial system and regulation. \"['Too big to fail'] is not solved and gone. It's still here,\" he said, emphasizing the point. He also threw in his lot with Elizabeth Warren, who often opposed Tim Geithner and others in her insistence that banks are of a dangerous size: \"I agree with [Warren] 100% that ['too big to fail'] is a real problem \u2026 We will not have successfully responded to the crisis if we do not address ['too big to fail'] successfully.\" That view is consistent with what Bernanke said as far back as 2009. But the subject of \"too big the fail\" has been a nonstarter for at least a year, since Occupy Wall Street protests receded. Bernanke also took an activist view of sorts by plumping for a return to regulatory reform and advocating that banks need to pay higher surcharges to help the country bail them out if things go wrong. Then Bernanke criticized banks again, implicitly, by saying that they had restricted lending too much, making it hard for ordinary Americans to get a mortgage. He went on to say that the Fed's bond-buying program has been successful largely because the Fed has learned how to monitor the markets better \u2013 implying, correctly, that those trading on Wall Street need a regulator to keep an eye on them. All of this was surprising on two fronts: first, that Bernanke actually shared his own opinion, instead of a technocratic, non-committal vague fluttering of economic opinions, as is often the case. Second, it's surprising that he took a somewhat controversial view, not designed to make friends on Wall Street.

It takes total job losses at the British drug company over the past 13 months to more than 11,000. As Astra's new chief executive announced the latest job cuts he praised his staff's \"talent, determination and focus to deliver for patients as well as shareholders\". Pascal Soriot said the move was part of the company's \"unambiguous commitment\" to \"focus, accelerate and transform our business\". The cuts will cost the company $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) in restructuring charges. The company, which employs 51,700 staff worldwide, declined to say how many jobs will be lost among its 6,700 British workforce. UK staff were the worst hit in cutbacks announced on Monday, comprising 700 of 1,600 job losses as the company consolidates its research and development facilities. Those cuts will be felt hardest in George Osborne's Tatton constituency, where 550 Astra staff will lose their jobs and another 1,600 employees have been told to relocate. Those cuts are part of Astra's decision to close its historic Alderley Park R&amp;D facility in Cheshire and relocate its research headquarters to Cambridge. More than 7% of Osborne's employed constituents, including, he says, \"some of the world's most skilled and experienced science professionals\", work at Alderley Park. The chancellor is also likely to face questions about the \u00a35m grant the government gave Astra to develop the site into a \"bioscience cluster\" just five months ago. When Astra was given the grant by the regional growth fund in October, the company said it was \"grateful\" for Osborne's support in securing the money. Dr Chris Doherty, project leader for Alderley Park, said: \"A number of people have been working hard behind the scenes to get us to this stage. In particular, we are grateful for the support of the Right Honourable George Osborne.\" Doherty said Astra was \"very excited about the potential of this initiative and the prospects for a dynamic science cluster in the north west\". Osborne did not respond to requests for comment about his role in securing the grant. The chancellor said the job cuts were \"obviously very difficult news for people directly affected by the decisions around Alderley Park\". \"I have worked hard with AstraZeneca over the last few weeks to make sure that a substantial number of jobs are kept there and will work closely with Cheshire East council and the government taskforce we are creating to bring new companies to the site,\" he said. \"We are all determined that Alderley Park shall remain a success story and at the heart of our local community.\" A spokeswoman for Astra said the funding was \"on hold\".",
