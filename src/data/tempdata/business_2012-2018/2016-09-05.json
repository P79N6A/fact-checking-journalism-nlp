      "bodyText": "Olympics on the TV and sunshine outside kept shoppers away from the high street in August and knocked retail sales, according to new industry data. The latest snapshot of takings for shops, online stores and supermarkets from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed sales dropped 0.9% on a year earlier, in like-for-like terms. That contrasted with growth of 1.1% in July and was the weakest performance since April. But there were some bright spots for retailers as the warm weather boosted sales of barbecues and wine. Watches and jewellery was the strongest performing category for the second month running as the pound\u2019s post-referendum weakness again attracted tourists to the UK to snap up cheaper luxury goods. The figures add another piece to the puzzle over how consumer spending and the wider economy have fared since the June referendum. Despite warnings before the poll that a vote for Brexit could spark a recession, so far consumer spending appears to have held up although there are signs both households and businesses are nervous about the UK\u2019s economic outlook. In the BRC report, it appeared that the weather and the timing of the new school term had by far the greatest impact on spending in August. Footwear was the worst performing category in August in the BRC report, compiled with consultants KPMG and covering the four weeks to 27 August. The report\u2019s authors blamed the comparatively late start to the new school term for the worst decline in children\u2019s shoe sales since April 2008 but said there were signs the dip would be offset by back-to-school trade in September. Home accessories, toys and baby equipment and furniture all suffered a dip and clothes sales were weaker as hot weather dampened demand for new autumn ranges. \u201cA month of extraordinary achievement for Team GB certainly produced a feel-good effect and consumer confidence was up on July, but that generally didn\u2019t translate into extra sales,\u201d said Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cConsumers were enticed towards leisure and outdoor activities rather than shopping, although food did post its strongest performance in more than two years, fuelled by demand for picnic, barbeque supplies and celebratory drinks.\u201d The trend for spending on going out was reinforced by separate figures from Barclaycard suggesting a pick-up in overall consumer spending in August was helped by people splashing out on holidays and entertainment. Consumer spending rose 4.2% in August, the fastest year-on-year growth for 13 months, according to Barclaycard, which processes around half of UK credit and debit card transactions. In contrast to the BRC retail report, Barclaycard found spending on clothes grew at a faster pace in August, up 3.4% on the year after a 1.5% rise in July. Spending in pubs was up 13.3% on the year, spending in restaurants rose 12.7% and cinema spending increased 14.6% on the year, helped by the release of Finding Dory. But Barclaycard\u2019s latest snapshot of consumer sentiment showed people were still cautious about the outlook. A poll of 1,660 people by YouGov for the cards company showed only 58% expressed confidence in their household finances, significantly lower than the average of 71% recorded in 2015. Only four in 10 said they were confident in the UK economy. \u201cConsumer spending has continued to grow after the EU referendum, with August being a particular stand-out month considering confidence in household finances remains low compared to levels seen last year,\u201d said Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard. \u201cConfidence continues to be shaky as the wider economic picture remains uncertain, suggesting it\u2019s too soon to tell if this lift in spending will last once everyone\u2019s holiday tans have faded.\u201d The BRC also cautioned against reading too much into one month\u2019s figures or drawing strong links to June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Dickinson said: \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of months, data portending the health of the economy paint a volatile picture. The fact is that so far little has directly changed for the UK\u2019s consumers as a result of the referendum, so it\u2019s the pre-existing market dynamics that are still driving sales.\u201d Official data on August retail sales will be released next week. The July figures showed a rise in sales, echoing other consumer spending reports and suggesting consumers were not put off spending by the vote to leave the EU in June\u2019s referendum.",

      "bodyText": "Only 3% of UK householders think there is a stigma attached to wasting food, while many try to save money by switching off lights or turning down the heating, instead of reducing food waste, according to a report. The Sainsbury\u2019s survey of food waste habits shows that the vast majority of people fail to see the value of watching out for food waste, compared with other money-saving habits that have become second nature. According to the poll of more than 5,000 UK adults, 74% of householders actively turn lights off when they leave a room and 55% turn down the heating. Nearly one-third (32%) have changed energy suppliers to keep household bills down, saving an average of \u00a3200 a year. Collectively, these changes would save \u00a3305 a year, less than half of the \u00a3700 a typical family wastes on food that goes uneaten and is thrown away. In January, Sainsbury\u2019s launched a partnership with the town of Swadlincote in Derbyshire, where it is spending \u00a31m to cut food waste by trialling new technology. The market town beat 188 rival areas to be awarded the project and the supermarket is planning to spend \u00a310m over the next five years to develop similar schemes across the UK. Working with the government\u2019s food advisory body, Wrap, the initiative will be measurable so that it can be used as a blueprint for the future. Ideas include testing smarter kitchen appliances such as fridges to allow people can check on their phone what they have at home and food-sharing apps such as Olio. The Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said: \u201cWe know our customers are concerned about food waste in their own homes, which is why we\u2019ve committed \u00a310m to help tackle the issue as part of our \u2018waste less, save more\u2019 programme. \u201cWasting food has become so normal, there is now no stigma attached to throwing food away. The report shows that people are cost-conscious and making concerted efforts to turn off lights and minimise energy use. However, people are still overlooking the much bigger savings that could be delivered by simply throwing away less food.\u201d On Wednesday, Sainsbury\u2019s will launch its first waste less, save more advertising campaign, aimed at helping householders save and store food more efficiently. Richard Swannell, the director of sustainable food systems at Wrap, said: \u201cWasting food costs \u00a3700 a year for the average family. That\u2019s money that could be spent on everyday essentials. Both Sainsbury\u2019s and Wrap want to help people see the benefits in making the most of their food.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Figures released last week on capital and consumer spending in Australia suggest there remains a strong disconnect between the state of the economy for people and businesses. That is also likely to be found in the GDP figures to be released on Wednesday. The GDP figures for the June quarter are not expected to show overwhelmingly strong quarterly growth, but in annual terms, the economy is likely to have grown at an above average pace. This is because the past three quarters have seen quite strong growth of 1.0%, 0.7% and 1.1%, whereas the June quarter in 2015 had growth of just 0.3%. But that weak quarter will be dropped in the latest annual growth count, thus should the June 2016 quarter have growth stronger than 0.3%, the annual rate should actually rise (unless there are some revisions to the other numbers). The consensus estimate for Wednesday quarterly growth is 0.4%, so annual GDP will likely increase and take away some of the sting of what will actually be a pretty weak result (in the past 20 years, average quarterly growth is 0.8%). Given that the latest data released on capital expenditure and retail sales, that growth is once again likely to be largely driven by exports rather than demand with Australia. Last week\u2019s capital expenditure figures which measure the amount of investment within the economy were, to put the sugar coating to one side, awful. Mining investment fell 34.5% in the past year. The manufacturing industry also declined 7%, and while investment in the \u201cother selected industries\u201d rose by 4.1%, and total non-mining investment grew by 2.8% it was nowhere near enough to cancel out the mining investment fall. Overall, new investment declined 15.2%: Clearly the story is about mining. Investment in that industry has fallen by 56% since its peak of September 2012. By contrast, non-mining investment since then has grown by just 5.9%, but it now is by far the largest of the two sections of the economy: And the news isn\u2019t great for the 2016-17 financial year either. The latest estimate (the third of seven that occur throughout each year) for total investment in 2016-17 is the lowest such estimate since 2009-10 \u2013 and that is in nominal terms, ie not accounting for inflation: To an extent there\u2019s not much anyone can do about the fall on the mining side of things. Sure, politicians love to take credit for the booms, but the reality is our mining sector rides the waves of the iron ore, coal and LNG prices, and those waves are now crashing on our shores: Thus our focus falls on the non-mining sector. Now the good news is that while the figures there have not been anything too vigorous, the outlook at least shows a strengthening pulse. The third estimate for non-mining investment in 2016-17 is up 4.5% on the same estimate for 2015-16. That\u2019s the second best growth in the past six years (although that doesn\u2019t say much, given four of those six years saw a decline). But even better, the third estimate is 28% above the first estimate for 2016-17 done back in January-February. As a rule, each estimate sees an increase in investment expectations \u2013 because companies are surer about what they will do. But the increase is among the best seen in the non-mining sector in the past 20 years \u2013 so businesses are becoming much more confident than usual about their investment decisions: And that somewhat good news (which still doesn\u2019t hide the fact that non-mining investment is still expected to be lower than it was in 2008-09) is a nice fillip given the overall poor capital spending figures are largely replicated by weak consumer spending. The latest figures out last week showed growth in consumer spending on retail items was absolutely flat in July in seasonally adjusted terms. The trend figures weren\u2019t much better \u2013 up just 0.1%: The biggest drag on the retail spending growth has been that of department stores and household goods (which includes electronic goods). The annual retail spending growth of just 2.7% is the worst since August 2013 and is well below the 20-year average of 5%. But one of the problems with the retail trade figures is that they are done in nominal dollars \u2013 because we do like to know how much money we are actually spending in the shops and restaurants. This means in times of low inflation the growth in money spent might not reflect actually weak levels of buying; rather, that people are able to take advantage of low prices. Thankfully, the ABS puts out quarterly figures that chart the volume of spending. We can use the latest figures to June to get some sense of whether the low retail trade growth is just a reflection of good value or whether we really have shut our wallets. Alas it does appear we have slowed our spending. In the past year, the amount of things we purchased increased by just 2.0% \u2013 the lowest amount since June 2013. The picture of Australia\u2019s spending on both capital items like buildings, machinery and equipment and on consumer items suggests that regardless of the GDP figures on Wednesday, the economy appears rather fragile. Weak investment and demand is translating into weak employment and wages growth and thus into weak spending growth. It\u2019s a cycle that is unlikely to be broken soon. And once again on Wednesday most people hearing that our economy is growing at above average levels will only shake their heads in disbelief at the disconnect between that growth and what they are experiencing themselves.",

The manufacturing industry also declined 7%, and while investment in the \u201cother selected industries\u201d rose by 4.1%, and total non-mining investment grew by 2.8% it was nowhere near enough to cancel out the mining investment fall. Overall, new investment declined 15.2%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private new capital expenditure - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QgVHt/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Clearly the story is about mining. Investment in that industry has fallen by 56% since its peak of September 2012. By contrast, non-mining investment since then has grown by just 5.9%, but it now is by far the largest of the two sections of the economy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private new capital expenditure (volume)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qdg97/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And the news isn\u2019t great for the 2016-17 financial year either. The latest estimate (the third of seven that occur throughout each year) for total investment in 2016-17 is the lowest such estimate since 2009-10 \u2013 and that is in nominal terms, ie not accounting for inflation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private new captial expeniture - 3rd estimate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NOJIZ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>To an extent there\u2019s not much anyone can do about the fall on the mining side of things. Sure, politicians love to take credit for the booms, but the reality is our mining sector rides the waves of the iron ore, coal and LNG prices, and those waves are now crashing on our shores:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Commodity prices\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4a6az/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Thus our focus falls on the non-mining sector. Now the good news is that while the figures there have not been anything too vigorous, the outlook at least shows a strengthening pulse.</p> <p>The third estimate for non-mining investment in 2016-17 is up 4.5% on the same estimate for 2015-16. That\u2019s the second best growth in the past six years (although that doesn\u2019t say much, given four of those six years saw a decline).</p> <p>But even better, the third estimate is 28% above the first estimate for 2016-17 done back in January-February. As a rule, each estimate sees an increase in investment expectations \u2013 because companies are surer about what they will do. But the increase is among the best seen in the non-mining sector in the past 20 years \u2013 so businesses are becoming much more confident than usual about their investment decisions:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Estimates for non-mining private new capital expenditure\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4JoNz/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And that somewhat good news (which still doesn\u2019t hide the fact that non-mining investment is still expected to be lower than it was in 2008-09) is a nice fillip given the overall poor capital spending figures are largely replicated by weak consumer spending.</p> <p>The latest figures out last week showed growth in <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/mediareleasesbyCatalogue/676AC4CC578D6559CA25773400204519?OpenDocument\">consumer spending on retail items</a> was absolutely flat in July in seasonally adjusted terms. The trend figures weren\u2019t much better \u2013 up just 0.1%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Retail trade - monthly growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HmjOh/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The biggest drag on the retail spending growth has been that of department stores and household goods (which includes electronic goods).</p> <p>The annual retail spending growth of just 2.7% is the worst since August 2013 and is well below the 20-year average of 5%.</p> <p>But one of the problems with the retail trade figures is that they are done in nominal dollars \u2013 because we do like to know how much money we are actually spending in the shops and restaurants. This means in times of low inflation the growth in money spent might not reflect actually weak levels of buying; rather, that people are able to take advantage of low prices.</p> <p>Thankfully, the ABS puts out quarterly figures that chart the volume of spending. We can use the latest figures to June to get some sense of whether the low retail trade growth is just a reflection of good value or whether we really have shut our wallets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Retail trade - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Q5EyO/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Alas it does appear we have slowed our spending. In the past year, the amount of things we purchased increased by just 2.0% \u2013 the lowest amount since June 2013.</p> <p>The picture of Australia\u2019s spending on both capital items like buildings, machinery and equipment and on consumer items suggests that regardless of the GDP figures on Wednesday, the economy appears rather fragile. Weak investment and demand is translating into weak employment and wages growth and thus into weak spending growth.</p> <p>It\u2019s a cycle that is unlikely to be broken soon. And once again on Wednesday most people hearing that our economy is growing at above average levels will only shake their heads in disbelief at the disconnect between that growth and what they are experiencing themselves. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The best reason \u2013 perhaps the only reason \u2013 for a Sports Direct shareholder to vote in favour of Keith Hellawell continuing as chairman is that finding a replacement to serve as boardroom counterweight to Mike Ashley might be tricky. The gig is not one to excite the usual club of non-executive directors. But that\u2019s a flimsy justification that no serious outside investor should entertain. Chairmen should be judged on their records and the list of complaints against Hellawell is long. There was a furious row over bonuses a couple of years ago when the board had to have four attempts to push through a scheme for Ashley. Then there was Hellawell\u2019s ineffectual appearance in front of the Scottish affairs select committee; MPs were astonished by his lack of knowledge about the collapse of a subsidiary. Or try Hellawell\u2019s baffling tolerance for Sports Direct being run without a permanent finance director for the past two and a half years; Matt Pearson has been \u201cacting\u201d chief financial officer since June last year. This year\u2019s kerfuffle put the others in the shade, of course: the HMRC investigation that followed this newspaper\u2019s investigation into working practices at the company\u2019s Shirebrook distribution warehouse. Ashley, as well as admitting to parliament that Sports Direct had broken the law by paying some workers less than the minimum wage, conceded that the company \u201cprobably\u201d outgrew his ability to manage it \u201ca long time ago.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t a responsible chairman have noticed? Outside shareholders would also expect an effective chairman to have told them more about the odd arrangement whereby Sports Direct pays a company owned by Ashley\u2019s brother to deliver online orders outside the UK. Again, that disclosure came via the press. Add it all up and this year\u2019s rebellion against Hellawell\u2019s stewardship is likely to be heavier than usual. Hermes, Legal &amp; General, Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London are all thought to be the \u201coppose\u201d camp. New rules mean Ashley cannot vote his 55% stake so it is possible that Hellawell\u2019s re-election could be defeated on Wednesday. If so, Sports Direct and Hellawell will have two options. The first is to say \u201cup yours\u201d and call a second poll, in which Ashley would be allowed to vote, and force through the appointment anyway. The second is to conclude that the game is up, and that a new chairman is overdue. Former policeman Hellawell is not a chap noted for taking a step backwards but even he should be able to see where Sports Direct\u2019s own interest lies. The shares have plunged 60% since last summer, shareholders aren\u2019t getting a dividend and the fabled bonus scheme isn\u2019t even paying out for full-time staff. Bloody-mindedness isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s time to go. Another JP Morgan bloke for Barclays\u2019 executive committee Chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s latest senior recruit to Barclays is Tim Throsby, who will head the corporate and investment bank. He comes from JP Morgan. They usually do. Staley has made five appointments to his executive committee since becoming boss last year. Two have been internal promotions and three have been hires from JP Morgan, his old shop. Another former Morganite, finance director Tushar Morzaria, was already in place when Staley arrived. So the ex-JPM tally now reads five out of nine members of the executive committee, including Staley himself. It\u2019s been a quiet takeover \u2013 though not necessarily one that will upset shareholders. But the lack of diversity is striking in another regard: where once there were two women on Barclays\u2019 executive committee, now there are none. \u201cWe want to see more women represented in senior roles,\u201d runs the bank\u2019s standard blurb. Easy to say; easier in practice, it seems, to get a bloke from JP Morgan. Corporate types take note: May might have meant it Still on boardroom governance, half the corporate world seems to have convinced itself that Theresa May didn\u2019t really mean it when she made that fierce speech in her leadership campaign about \u201cdoing something radical,\u201d like putting employees and consumers on boards. Corporate lobbyists have spent subsequent weeks suggesting ways in which the prime minister could water down her ideas with minimum political fuss. Instead of elected representatives on boards, how about allocating the role to a regular non-executive director?, runs one feeble compromise. What if May meant every word? \u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing out some proposals later in the year,\u201d said May when asked about corporate taxes and responsibility at the G20 summit. That commits her to nothing, but corporate types should take note: there\u2019s no hint of back-sliding yet.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is to open mini-Habitat shops and more than double the number of Argos outlets in its supermarkets by Christmas after finalising its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Home Retail Group. The supermarket said it would open 30 new Argos outlets, joining the 20 that have been trading for more than a year, as it kicks off the integration of its new acquisition. Five Habitat concessions will also open in Sainsbury\u2019s stores over the next few months. They will offer more than 600 products including furniture, lighting and homewares alongside Sainsbury\u2019s existing home and cookware. Habitat pulled out of concessions in Homebase after that group was bought out by the Australian DIY operator Wesfarmers earlier this year. The last of the 84 concessions closed on Sunday. After completing the takeover on Friday, Sainsbury\u2019s is now the UK\u2019s biggest retailer of non-food, as well as the second biggest grocer, with 195,000 employees and more than 2,000 outlets including supermarkets, Argos stores, convenience stores and three flagship Habitat outlets. Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said: \u201cThis is the start of an exciting new phase for Sainsbury\u2019s, Argos and Habitat.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece is facing another bailout standoff with its creditors amid reports that eurozone countries will refuse to release additional funds to it this month. Athens has frustrated its peers in the single currency by implementing only two of the 15 reforms that were a condition of last year\u2019s rescue package. EU officials told German daily Handelsblatt that Greece has delayed privatising state assets, adding to the frustrations of eurozone finance ministers who will discuss progress on Friday. Further funds are due to be disbursed under the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which will give Greece up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a372bn) of financial assistance by 2018 in return for reforms. After approving a first tranche of \u20ac10.3bn this spring, of which \u20ac7.5bn has so far been released, the 19 finance ministers are due to disburse the rest this month but might withhold payment for the rest of the year. A further finance ministers\u2019 meeting is planned for 21 September. The gridlock report came after the head of the ESM said at the weekend that Greece should be able to secure at least short-term debt relief measures but only if it began implementing the remaining reforms. \u201cWe have been working on these measures and they could be implemented very soon,\u201d Klaus Regling told Greek newspaper Ta Nea. \u201cWe hope the government implements remaining prior actions very soon,\u201d he added. EU officials are demanding that Athens pushes on with plans to set up a new privatisation fund, sell specific state assets, and reform its civil service. Eight years into the country\u2019s financial crisis, life has become harder for most Greeks. Unemployment is the highest in Europe and one survey in June found that extreme poverty had risen from 2.2% of the population in 2009 to 15% \u2013 a total of 1.6 million people \u2013 last year. Longer-term relief to help the country reduce its crippling debt of 176% of GDP will not follow until after the end of the bailout, Regling said. However, the International Monetary Fund \u2013 which is not participating in Greece\u2019s third rescue programme \u2013 has insisted that long-term relief including debt forgiveness must happen sooner. The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, warned last week that the country\u2019s next aid payout may be delayed because the government had failed to qualify for it, although he insisted any hold-up would last \u201cfor days, not weeks\u201d. Greek media said Athens faced a monumental task to push through the highly unpopular reforms and secure the last \u201cdesperately needed\u201d \u20ac2.8bn of funding, followed by the start of long-promised debt restructuring talks by the end of the year. The government is counting on the talks as a consolation prize to offset a hugely unpopular austerity package including spending cuts, tax hikes and pension reductions required by the bailout, the newspaper Kathimerini said. It added that the noises emanating from Brussels \u201cspeak volumes about eurozone countries\u2019 confidence levels\u201d in the Greek government, while hampering the ability of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to announce even modest measures to help people worst affected by Greece\u2019s prolonged economic crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has confirmed plans to cut 525 jobs from its head office in London and is to move another 400 roles outside the capital as part of a \u00a315m shakeup. The retailer is consulting with head office staff including those in buying, merchandising and marketing about the job cuts, which are part of new boss Steve Rowe\u2019s attempts to reduce costs and simplify the business. The net reduction in staff numbers, which first emerged over the weekend, will be achieved through a combination of redundancies, non-replacement of leavers and cutting contractors. On top of the job cuts, 400 IT and logistics staff will move from central London to M&amp;S\u2019s IT centre in Stockley Park, Middlesex, and its distribution hub in Hemel Hempstead, potentially enabling M&amp;S to move out of one of its two head office buildings near Paddington. The future of Laura Wade-Gery, the main board director currently on maternity leave, is also unclear. Wade-Gery, who was multichannel director in charge of UK retail and online operations, completed her one year break on 1 September. However, in her absence her responsibilities have been shared out among other directors and the retailer would not confirm when she will be returning. M&amp;S has about 3,000 head office staff working across seven locations so the changes will affect about a third of them. M&amp;S said it would engage in collective consultation with its employees about the changes via elected employee representatives on its Business Involvement Group. M&amp;S currently does not recognise a union. The retailer said it hoped the changes would save about 1% of its UK costs, after a one-off charge of \u00a315m including payoffs for senior managers including Stephanie Chen, head of childrenswear and homewares, and digital boss David Walmsley. Their departures were announced earlier this year. The cuts are part of Rowe\u2019s effort to turn around M&amp;S after its biggest fall in clothing sales since the 2008 banking crisis. Rowe, who found that M&amp;S had become too complex and inefficient in a review of a business after his appointment this year, said: \u201cM&amp;S has to become a simpler and more effective organisation if we are to deliver our plans to recover and grow our business. It is never easy to propose changes that impact on our people, but I believe that the proposals outlined today are absolutely necessary and will help us build a different type of M&amp;S \u2013 one that can take bolder, pacier decisions, be more profitable and ultimately better serve our customers.\u201d He said M&amp;S remained committed to investing more in improving the experience in stores for customers and so there would be no cuts in shop-floor staff. But the new chief executive, who took the top job after nearly 30 years at M&amp;S, has already faced criticism over changes to pay and pensions for shop-floor staff including cutting premium pay for Sundays. After more than 90,000 people signed a petition calling on the chain to scrap the changes M&amp;S said on Friday that staff would receive extra compensation to ensure their pay did not fall below current levels in future.",

In his current guise, the former policeman has become the obvious target for disgruntled investors in the sportswear chain, which is 55% owned by the billionaire Mike Ashley and has been widely criticised over its working practices and corporate governance. At last year\u2019s meeting, around one third of independent votes failed to be cast in favour of Hellawell as chairman \u2013 but the former chief constable\u2019s \u00a3155,000-a-year position was unassailable because of Ashley\u2019s support. However, since then, new rules mean that non-executive directors in companies with a single dominant investor must be put to a vote of minority shareholders first. And the past year\u2019s events \u2013 which have seen the retailer admit to the Guardian\u2019s revelations it was paying some workers less than the minimum wage, as well as its share price slumping by more than half, plus a string of setbacks with trading at its stores \u2013 have focused attention on the company and its chairman. Hermes Investment Management was the latest shareholder to call for Hellawell to go on Monday. Legal &amp; General, Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London are also believed to have lost patience with the chairman, as have three of North America\u2019s largest investors \u2013 CalPERs, CALSTRS and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan. Still, Hellawell, 74, is used to controversy. Born in 1942 just outside Huddersfield, he is the product of the toughest of upbringings. He has previously talked of how he never knew his father and how as a boy he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a young man who had access to their tenement rooms. As a teenager he went to work in the coal mines, before joining the police force at 20, where he was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1965 and inspector in 1966. In the 1980s he was seconded to interrogate Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, and reportedly succeeded in establishing that the serial killer had attempted two further murders. Yet, true to form, even these efforts attracted controversy. One winter Hellawell visited Broadmoor, where he handed a Christmas card to Sutcliffe. \u201cIt was just part of the rapport thing [to get Sutcliffe to open up], that was all,\u201d he told the Sunday Times in 2000, but a disgusted Broadmoor staffer informed the Daily Mail and Hellawell was lambasted in the press. It scarcely represented the final attack. As chief constable of West Yorkshire from 1993, Hellawell was again brought to national attention. He was jeered and booed at a Police Federation meeting in response to changes he introduced to the West Yorkshire CID. And during his time as chief constable he advocated several controversial, liberal positions, including the legalisation of brothels and operating a policy of widespread cautioning of cannabis-takers instead of automatically prosecuting them. Even so, he opposed the legalisation of cannabis. It was his expertise in narcotics that led to his appointment in 1998 as the UK\u2019s \u201cdrug tsar\u201d, only for that position to be downgraded in 2001 to an advisory role. He fell out with his Whitehall bosses and, while he had already resigned, publicly announced his departure in 2002 during an interview on Radio Four\u2019s Today programme. When quizzed about then home secretary David Blunkett\u2019s plan to downgrade the classification of cannabis from a Class B drug to Class C, Hellawell said on air that he opposed the policy. Pressed on how he could then stay in his job, he admitted that he wasn\u2019t. Last year, his granddaughter was jailed for three years after attempting to sell crack cocaine. His business career has been almost as newsworthy. He was appointed chairman of Goldshield in 2006, a pharmaceuticals business that was facing a criminal prosecution for colluding to overcharge the NHS for generic drugs. In August 2008, after an eight-year investigation, a judge threw out the case for legal reasons. In 2009 he became chairman of Sports Direct, and his tenure has included a disastrous appearance in front of the Scottish Affairs select committee last year, as well as presiding over a slumping share price that has seen the company relegated from the FTSE 100. Asked in March if he believed he would stay as Sports Direct chairman, Hellawell typically tried to tough it out. He said: \u201cYes, I do \u2026 That is the plan, yes.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s minority shareholders, however, might have a rather different plan.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HMRC is chasing the former BHS owner Dominic Chappell for unpaid bills and has started legal proceedings against him. The tax authority filed a petition at the high court to wind up Swiss Rock Limited, Chappell\u2019s personal business that was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS as part of his controversial acquisition of the retailer. A hearing was scheduled for Monday. Separately, Chappell has lined up David Rubin &amp; Partners as liquidator of Swiss Rock and is restructuring his assets. The prospect of Chappell walking away from a tax bill will further infuriate former BHS employees already reeling from a string of allegations about the conduct of the failed company\u2019s owners. The last of BHS\u2019s 164 stores closed last month after it collapsed into administration in April, 13 months after the retailer was bought by Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions. The demise of BHS has led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. However, Retail Acquisitions received at least \u00a317m from BHS during its ownership. In July, Chappell and his associates were labelled as \u201cincompetent and self-serving\u201d by a parliamentary committee investigating the failure of BHS. MPs accused Chappell of having \u201chad his fingers in the till\u201d and helping oversee the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of BHS. A spokesman for HMRC said: \u201cHMRC does not comment on identifiable cases. Our aim is to efficiently collect the debts due and to prevent things deteriorating further. \u201cWe only initiate winding up action where we believe this is the best way to protect both the interests of other taxpayers and creditors.\u201d Chappell said: \u201cWe will make a statement when it is ready to come out. There was a return that was made in error, they have acted upon it and we are rectifying that as we speak.\u201d When asked whether he would pay the tax that he owes, Chappell said: \u201cI am not going to get hooked into anything on this so I will make a statement when we are ready to make a statement.\u201d Last month, Chappell confirmed to the Guardian that Swiss Rock would enter insolvency proceedings, but said it was because he is \u201cno longer using\u201d the company. The Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator are investigating Chappell and the Serious Fraud Office is considering whether or not to launch a formal investigation. The former BHS owner is yet to submit details of his financial dealings when he was in charge of the retailer to the parliamentary committee. Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, said Chappell had so far not fulfilled his promise to file details of the money that he personally took out of BHS during Retail Acquisition\u2019s ownership. Chappell promised \u201ca full outline on a spreadsheet\u201d when he gave evidence in parliament in June and told MPs they would have the details by the end of August. \u201cThe committee genuinely eagerly awaits his submission,\u201d Field said. As well as lining up liquidators for Swiss Rock, Chappell has moved his family home in Dorset out of a \u00a31.5m loan handed over by Retail Acquisitions using cash from BHS. The security on the loan was switched from the Chappell family home to a property in Portugal and Land Registry documents no longer list Retail Acquisitions as the lender on the property. The Guardian revealed last month that the home was on the brink of repossession before the \u00a31.5m loan from Retail Acquisitions was used to pay off debts against it. The move could distance the property from administrators and investigators trying to recover cash for BHS. The Chappell family home now has no connection to Retail Acquisitions or BHS, so if the \u00a31.5m is ordered to be repaid, the property cannot be claimed instead.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s services sector enjoyed a record rise last month, as companies shrugged off the initial shock of the vote to leave the EU, according to a survey of business activity that adds to signs the economy has escaped recession in the immediate aftermath of the referendum. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index (pdf) for August rose to 52.9 after slumping to 47.4 for July following the vote to leave the EU, well above the 50 mark that indicates growth. That was the biggest month-to-month jump in the survey\u2019s 20-year history and followed the biggest drop on record the previous month when businesses were coming to terms with the outcome of June\u2019s referendum. Economists had expected August\u2019s survey to rise to 50, indicating that activity has been flat for a sector which makes up almost four-fifths of the UK economy. The services PMI excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector. The surprise surge helped push the pound to a seven-week high against the dollar of $1.3375. The services sector includes hairdressers and restaurants as well as banking and accountancy. The services report follows news of a similar rebound in the manufacturing sector and a more modest improvement in the construction sector last week. Taken with signs of a recovery in consumer confidence and high street spending, it will allay fears that economic growth is grinding to a halt after the referendum. IHS Markit, the compilers of the PMI reports on manufacturing, services and construction said that they suggested the economy will have managed to eke out some growth in the July-to-September quarter that followed the Brexit vote. \u201cThe UK saw business activity rebound from July\u2019s post-referendum decline in August, enjoying the strongest expansion for five months,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. There was a record rise in the Markit/CIPS all-sector PMI to 53.2 in August, its highest since March, more than reversing the record fall to 47.4 seen in July. \u201cAssuming further growth is signalled by the September PMI surveys, we expect the economy to have eked out a modest GDP expansion of 0.1% in the third quarter,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cWhile there\u2019s clearly been a sharp slowing in the pace of economic growth in the third quarter, the risk of imminent recession has fallen significantly, attributable in part to renewed stimulus from the Bank of England as well as the calming of uncertainty brought about by the swift introduction of the new government.\u201d The improvement in companies\u2019 new business and output followed an interest rate cut by the Bank of England to a new record low of 0.25% in early August. Businesses also said they had been helped by a weak pound, which fell sharply after the referendum, making UK exports more competitive and attracting foreign tourists to the UK on shopping sprees. But there was also evidence the weak pound was stoking inflation by raising import costs. The PMI report showed input price inflation accelerated to a 33-month high in August, linked to the weak pound and rising fuel and labour costs. Subsequently, service providers raised their own prices at the sharpest rate since January 2014. Economists warn that despite a post-referendum bounce in activity, the decision to leave the EU could be felt more acutely once negotiations to leave the bloc begin in earnest. There are also signs that companies are nervous about hiring and investing as they await more clarity on future trading relationships and immigration rules. The services report showed business confidence, although improving on July\u2019s multi-year low, remained well below its long-run trend. \u201cMany companies remain cautious about the outlook, suggesting that political and economic uncertainty is likely to prevail in coming months, subduing growth. It therefore remains far too early to say whether August\u2019s upturn is a dead-cat bounce or the start of a sustained post-referendum recovery,\u201d said Williamson. Other economists also said the August news should be treated with caution. \u201cJust as the July survey probably overstated the economy\u2019s underlying weakness, the August survey probably overstates its subsequent recovery,\u201d said Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cWe think an average of the July and August surveys paints a more accurate picture of the economy post-Brexit. And this is consistent with quarterly GDP growth of close to zero \u2013 in line with our forecast for the third quarter as a whole.\u201d Bank of England policymakers have already hinted they will cut interest rates again before the end of the year. Few expect another rate reduction at next week\u2019s policy meeting, but many economists predict the monetary policy committee will move rates again in November and take borrowing costs close to zero. \u201cToday\u2019s improvements are in line with the string of robust economic figures we\u2019ve seen throughout August. But, while there is some reason for optimism today, it\u2019s still too early to conclude that the UK has escaped the Brexit vote unscathed,\u201d said Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve seen some resilience in the UK economy, many are questioning whether last month\u2019s monetary policy committee decision was the right one. We believe the Bank of England has taken the correct course of action and expect them to ease further before the year is out.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Republicans at fault if Obama can't raise minimum wage, US labor secretary says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If Barack Obama leaves the White House in January without having increased the federal minimum wage during his two terms it will be Republicans\u2019 fault, US labor secretary Tom Perez said. It\u2019s very likely that this will be the case and the minimum wage will remain at $7.25, where it has been since July 2009. If so, Obama will be the third president to fail to raise the rate since the minimum wage was enacted in 1938. \u201cWhat we see throughout the country is people reacting to the fact that the Republican Congress has refused to exercise leadership on minimum wage,\u201d Perez told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating and totally preventable that President Obama is about to become the third president \u2013 only the third president since [Franklin D Roosevelt] \u2013 who hasn\u2019t had an opportunity to sign an increase in minimum wage, and the reason that\u2019s the case is Republican intransigence. \u201cThey are so hellbent on making sure they never deliver a legislative victory to this president, and if they hurt their own constituents, so be it. It\u2019s not hard to figure out why there is a revolt in the Republican party.\u201d This summer marked seven years since the last increase in federal minimum wage, a hike signed into law by George W Bush. The other two presidents who did not enact a hike in the minimum wage were Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. (The minimum wage did go up while Ford was president, though, since Richard Nixon had signed a law increasing the minimum wage just months prior to his resignation.) According to Perez, GOP lawmakers nowadays often vote against the interests of their constituents \u2013 especially on the minimum wage. In 2014, four states that tend to vote Republican \u2013 Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2013 voted to increase their state minimum wage. \u201cThe American people understand that seven and a quarter is not enough to live on, but the Republican leadership here in the Congress hasn\u2019t gotten that memo,\u201d Perez said. Donald Trump seems to have gotten the memo. After flip-flopping on the issue, the Republican presidential candidate recently came out in support of increasing the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour. The minimum wage is not the only issue on which the Obama administration and congressional Republicans have failed to see eye to eye. Last year, the Republican-held Congress passed Obama\u2019s $300bn highway bill, focused on improving US infrastructure such as roads and bridges, after a long-running dispute over federal tax policy. The five-year funding bill was signed just before a three-month stop-gap bill extending transportation funding was about to expire. Obama previously scolded GOP lawmakers for being unable to agree to a long-term deal on time and for \u201cleaving all the business of the US government until the last minute\u201d. Another point of contention between Obama and the Republicans in Congress has been GOP opposition to government spending. Whereas the Obama administration has argued that investing in the economy would help the US recover from recession, Republicans have led the charge on spending cuts and even allowed the US government to shut down for two weeks in 2013. \u201cIf we had the investment rates that we saw during the Reagan administration now, we would have an unemployment rate that would be probably two to three tenths of a percent lower than it currently is,\u201d Perez said. \u201cBut the lingering effect of sequester [the automatic budget cuts that were included in the 2011 Budget Control Act] has a dramatically negative impact on government hiring and it also had on a federal level and on state and local level.\u201d Government hiring usually recovers fast during the early stages of the recovery, but it did not do so this time around, Perez said. It took much longer. \u201cNow we are seeing some real rebound in government jobs, which tend to be solid middle class jobs,\u201d said Perez, pointing to the jobs report released on Friday. \u201cWe saw 25,000 jobs gained last month and we have seen 164,000 jobs over the last year. If you look at two years ago, that\u2019s a significant bump from what we saw in the previous twelve months stretch.\u201d From August 2014 to August 2015, another 130,000 government jobs were added. The twelve months before that, it was just 44,000 jobs.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019d usually be expecting Wall Street to open soon but everyone\u2019s on holiday for Labor Day. Let\u2019s remind ourselves of what snippets of business and economic news today has brought us, led by the keenly-watched services sector Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey data. The services sector returned to form, bouncing back from 47.4 in July to 52.9. It was the biggest month-to-month rise in the 20 years that the index has been running. The performance of services means an all-sector PMI figure of 53.2, the highest since March. Economists say this makes a post-referendum recession less likely, although growth is unlikely to be impressive. Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans to cut more than 500 jobs. New car sales rose 3.3% in August. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments. Shares in RBS and Lloyds are taking a bit of a pounding today, both appearing among the five worst-performing stocks on the FTSE 100 so far. The catalyst was a note from banking analyst David Lock at Deutsche Bank, who predicts that a prolonged period of low interest rates, as the Bank of England tries to stimulate the economy, will cause pain for the UK banking sector. Lock says RBS is most at risk because it has already cut costs and deposit rates, leaving itself very little wiggle room if things deteriorate further. He has cut his rating on the taxpayer-backed bank from \u201chold\u201d to \u201csell\u201d. The lower-for-longer environment is clearly negative for the sector. RBS was down 2.88% at 198.4p, while Lloyds Banking Group shed 1.8% to 59.85p, underperforming the FTSE100, which is down 0.2%. Time for a quick round-up of how Europe\u2019s stock indices were doing by lunchtime, starting with a rather lacklustre FTSE 100. The blue-chip index edged downwards after strong PMI data boosted the pound. Many of the biggest firms in the FTSE 100, such as oil companies and miners, earn their money in dollars, while the stronger data has made further stimulus measures from the Bank of England less likely. European markets are faring a little better though. FTSE 100: down 0.24% at 6,878.3 Germany\u2019s DAX: up 0.22% at 10,706.96 France\u2019s CAC: up 0.27% at 4,554.41 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: up 0.23% at 17,222.73 Spain\u2019s IBEX: up 0.42% at 8,946.50 Europe\u2019s STOXX: up 0.22% at 3086.61 To anyone waiting for news of Wall Street\u2019s opening performance, don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s Labor Day in the US, which means stock markets are closed. As Theresa May attends the G20 meeting in China, where the fraught Hinkley Point nuclear project is likely to be on the agenda, another Chinese investment in the UK is afoot. Shanghai\u2019s biggest property developer has pressed the button on plans to build an \u00a3800m tower in London and it is set to be western Europe\u2019s tallest residential skyscraper. But the snappily-titled Spire London is likely to ruffle feathers, given the gulf it exposes between the capital\u2019s richest and poorest residents. Time for an update on inflation data that came in overnight. Overall shop prices reported deflation of 2.0% in August, from the 1.6% decline in July, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC)-Nielsen shop price index. Non-food deflation picked up speed 2.5% from 2.2% in July, while food prices accelerated to a record low, down 1.1% from a declined of 0.8% in the previous two months. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson OBE said: The devaluation of sterling in wake of the referendum will put upward pressure on shop prices. But that\u2019s likely to take several months to properly feed through, given that retailers won\u2019t feel the brunt of the cost increases until existing contracts with foreign suppliers come to an end. Even then, retailers will have to make a decision about when and how much to pass onto consumers. Given the strength of competition in the market, and if the economy softens in line with predictions, any pass through may be more limited than implied by the exchange rate movement. As far as they can, retailers will endeavour to mitigate impacts by looking for productivity gains in their own businesses, rather than compromising on the value they are offering to consumers. Marks &amp; Spencer has admitted that it plans to cut up to 525 jobs from its head office and move a further 400 outside London in a bid to cut costs. Steve Rowe, M&amp;S chief executive, said: M&amp;S has to become a simpler and more effective organisation if we are to deliver our plans to recover and grow our business. The review highlighted that M&amp;S has become too complex and inefficient and today\u2019s proposals aim to address this by removing duplication, driving accountability and establishing clear, consistent processes; which in turn will strip out unnecessary costs. Analysts are increasingly training their sights on the Bank of England, after strong PMI data suggested the Monetary Policy Committee may have moved too soon by cutting rates to 0.25% earlier this month. Some pundits are predicting red faces when MPC members go before the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at foreign exchange firm Monex, says: The Bank of England is now in an interesting position. This week\u2019s testimony to the Treasury Select Committee will be a trial for MPC members. Having eased early and aggressively, the MPC will doubtlessly be asked by lawmakers if they jumped the gun, and will have to once again justify their previous warnings about the potential effects of Brexit. But analysts at Capital Economics think the Bank will still move to cut rates in November, to a rock-bottom 0.1%. Scott Bowman, UK economist, says: Note that the MPC expects growth to be slightly positive in the second half of 2016 and the majority of members thought it would be appropriate to cut bank rate to its effective lower bound if their forecasts were met. Therefore, we continue to think the Committee will cut bank rate to 0.10% in November. While UK eyes were on the services sector PMI data, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil bubbled upwards in anticipation of a statement from Saudi Arabia and Russia at the G20 meeting in China. In the end, two of the world\u2019s largest oil producing nations didn\u2019t have much to say. They have agreed to set up a joint task force to ensure greater stability in the oil market, after watching prices slump from $100 a couple of years ago to less than $30 earlier in 2016. The agreement could involve curbing supply to address a global oil glut. Brent crude was up by 2.75% to $48.12 in advance of the statement. More signs of strength in the economy now, as sales of new cars picked up again following a lacklustre performance in July. Sales rose by 3.3% year on year during August, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT), compared to a meagre 0.1% rise in July. Private car sales were down 0.2% but the slight decline was more than offset by a 7.7% rise in fleet car sales, as businesses showed they were still prepared to splash out on vehicles. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: August is traditionally one of the quietest months as consumers look ahead to the September plate change, so growth, albeit small, is good news. With showrooms full of exciting models featuring the very latest technology and a raft of affordable finance options, it still makes economic sense to consider buying a new car. The key to maintaining this strong market is consumer confidence for which we look to government to deliver the conditions for economic growth. Here\u2019s a handy graph from the SMMT showing how car sales have performed since August 2000. And here\u2019s another handy graph, this time showing what the best-selling cars were in August and so far this year. It\u2019s no surprise to find the Ford Fiesta motoring ahead. A bit more reaction to the PMI data coming in now. Here\u2019s Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to \u2018Big Four\u2019 accountant EY\u2019s economic forecasting group the ITEM Club: A rise in the headline activity balance of the CIPS services survey exceeded economists\u2019 expectations and represented the biggest monthly jump since the survey began in 1996. The details of the survey showed that a recovery in total activity was accompanied by a rise in new orders to a four-month high. Employment also expanded, following stagnation in July. But the inflationary consequences of a weaker pound appear to be making their mark in the services sector \u2013 input prices rose at the fastest pace in 33 months. The strong recovery in all three CIPS surveys in August suggests that the likelihood of a recession this year is looking more remote, in line with our view. However, a composite PMI, which weights together the sectoral PMIs by their respective shares in the economy, points to an economy that will struggle to see much growth in Q3. Our expectation, allowing for the official and survey data available so far, suggests that GDP will expand by around 0.2%. So while the gloomier predictions around the EU vote are unlikely to be realised, the economy is not out of the woods yet. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, also thinks the UK will avoid economic contraction in the third quarter. The v-shaped recovery between July and August suits our above-consensus calls for the second half of the year that the UK will dodge a recession. If we take the July/August average of our weighted PMI for services, manufacturing and construction at face value, it points to stagnation in Q3. Importantly, whereas the PMIs indicated that the economy slowed in Q2 to a growth rate of around 0.2% quarter on quarter, official data showed the economy actually expanded by 0.6%. If we apply the same difference of +0.4ppt to the Q3 PMI prediction of 0.0%, it points to a significant upside risk to our already above-consensus forecast of 0.1% in Q3. With some solid PMI data in the bag, economists will be looking to tomorrow\u2019s August retail sales data from the British Retail Consortium for a further injection of good news, this time from the High Street. Forecasters at IHS Global Insight are expecting a strong result, helped by good weather, foreign tourists using the weak pound as an excuse for a shopping spree and a \u201cfeel good factor\u201d thanks to Team GB\u2019s gold-plated performance in the Rio 2016 Olympics. It is also notable that the fundamentals are currently still pretty healthy for consumers with employment at a record high and purchasing power benefiting from earnings growth running well above consumer price inflation. This has seemingly encouraged consumers to keep spending despite confidence falling sharply in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote \u2013 and confidence actually recovered some of its losses in August. However, IHS expects the buoyant mood on the High Street to be relatively short lived. Consumers are likely to face less favourable purchasing power as inflation rises and earnings growth is limited by companies striving to limit their costs. In addition, unemployment seems seem likely to rise over the coming months. Meanwhile, a likely softening labour market and reduced consumer confidence will dilute workers\u2019 ability and willingness to push for higher pay awards even though inflation is expected to rise appreciably over the coming months. There is a very real likelihood that inflation will move above earnings growth during 2017. The services sector PMI may have come in ahead of expectations at 52.9, resulting in a healthy figure of 53.2 for the economy as a whole, but the blue-chip stock index remains unimpressed. Having started the day flat, the FTSE 100 is has edged down by around 0.2% to 6,880. However, the pound is on the up, reaching a seven-week high of $1.3375 against the dollar. Analysts at Spreadex said the FTSE was suffering its \u201cusual post-pound push malaise\u201d, given that so many of the index\u2019s companies earn in dollars. The UK index shouldn\u2019t feel too dejected, however; it\u2019s still near 6900, while its oil and mining stocks are currently enjoying a strong start to the week thanks to Brent Crude\u2019s 3% rise. Scratching the surface of the PMI data, it seems that the weakness of sterling is driving up inflation. Here\u2019s more from Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which publishes the PMI data. While the weaker currency has helped boost exports, the drop in the exchange rate has also sparked inflationary pressures. Input costs rose sharply on average, increasing at the fastest rate for five years. Manufacturing and construction saw particularly steep rises in costs linked to higher imported raw material prices. Both sectors reported the steepest cost increases since mid-2011. Services input costs rose at the fastest rate since November 2013. Average prices charged for goods and services showed the largest monthly increase since January 2014 as firms passed higher costs onto customers. The rise in factory gate prices was the steepest for five years. Over at the wealth management arm of Swiss bank UBS they think it\u2019s too soon to breathe a sigh of relief about the Brexit vote aftermath. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, said: Today\u2019s improvements are in line with the string of robust economic figures we\u2019ve seen throughout August. But, while there is some reason for optimism today, it\u2019s still too early to conclude that the UK has escaped the Brexit vote unscathed. We still expect growth to slow to zero in the second half of the year, although the current quarter may be a little stronger than anticipated, followed by greater weakness in the fourth quarter. Now that we\u2019ve seen some resilience in the UK economy, many are questioning whether last month\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee decision was the right one. We believe the Bank of England has taken the correct course of action and expect them to ease further before the year is out. With service sector survey data from IHS Markit now added to the results from construction and manufacturing, we have a result for the whole economy. All-sector PMI hit 53.2, its highest level since March, more than recouping July\u2019s slump to 47.4. Christopher Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: While July\u2019s decline had been largely attributed by companies to heightened political and economic uncertainty following the UK\u2019s June 23rd vote to leave the EU, August\u2019s increase reflected a marked improvement in sentiment. Businesses have reported that business and consumer confidence revived in August, with an immediate impact on demand. A variety of factors, including the weaker pound, the establishment of the new government and the Bank of England\u2019s aggressive stimulus are likely to have all helped to reduce uncertainty compared to July. Many companies were seeing business return to normal either simply as a result of customer confidence rising or a stoic determination to \u201cBuck Brexit\u201d and carry on regardless. \u201cThe most important news is a rebound in services activity, with the rise in the business activity index being the largest on record. Hiring also picked up again amid signs of business returning to normal for many companies after the uncertainty caused by the shock referendum result. IHS Markit says the risk of a recession \u201chas fallen significantly\u201d and predicts the economy will grow by 0.1% in the third quarter. They\u2019ve provided a handy graph showing the historical relationship between PMI and economic output (GDP). The better-than-expected services sector PMI result is receiving a warm welcome, albeit with a note of caution. Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: It\u2019s encouraging to see a recovery in the index this month. There are bright spots from consumer retail figures and the recent manufacturing PMI. There is also a short-term feel-good factor in the markets as investors return to equities from low-yielding assets as a result of the Bank of England\u2019s intervention on interest rates and quantitative easing. However, it is too easy to over-interpret often volatile monthly data, particularly sentiment-based indices. Without a sustained period of hard numbers around business investment and trading, it is impossible to get an accurate picture of the economic impact of the vote to leave the EU. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for the UK\u2019s dominant services sector has come in at 52.9, where anything above 50 means growth. Just to recap, the consensus forecast among analysts was for a flat 50, meaning unchanged activity. So the figure of 52.9 will be greeted with cheers in the City. That\u2019s a record jump for services PMI from one month to the next, compared to a record fall the previous month. The eurozone economy is still expanding but at its slowest pace for 19 months, according to the latest survey of business activity in the region\u2019s major economies. The slowdown is largely due to weaker growth in Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. A small but significant regulatory announcement this morning, as the London Stock Exchange listing for Argos owner Home Retail Group is cancelled, following its \u00a31.4bn takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s. The FTSE 100 has started the day in uncertain mood, hovering around last week\u2019s close of 6,894. A 2.2% surge on Friday saw it gain nearly 150 points to within spitting distance of 7,000 but it\u2019s a more muted start to this week. Some of the European markets are doing slightly better though. FTSE 100: flat at 6,894 Germany\u2019s DAX: up 0.4% at 10,727.18 France\u2019s CAC: up 0.25% at 4,553.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: up 0.2% at 17,217.75 Spain\u2019s IBEX: up 0.22% at 8,928.50 Europe\u2019s STOXX: up 0.24% at 3087.06 The folks at Spreadex point out that the UK isn\u2019t the only country with PMI data coming out today. While the focus is undoubtedly on the FTSE\u2019s services PMI this Monday the Eurozone does get involved with its own surveys this morning. Already the Spanish figure has surpassed estimates, its services PMI coming in at 56.0 against the 55.1 forecast; Italy, on the other hand, is set to trickle lower, from 52.0 to 51.8 month-on-month, while the French and German readings are expected to match their initial readings at 52.0 and 53.3 respectively. The prospect of this has pushed the CAC and DAD slightly higher, the former rising nearly half a percent to near a three-week high with the latter climbing a more mild 0.2%. Don\u2019t expect any news from the other side of the Atlantic ocean though. As veteran financial pundit David Buik of stockbroker Panmure Gordon points out, it\u2019s Labor Day. That means no trading at all. While the consensus forecast is for the August services sector PMI to come in at 50, analysts at IHS Global Insight think it might have been better than that: Specifically, we forecast the services business activity index to have moved back up to 50.7 in August after plunging to 47.4 in July from 52.3 in June and 53.5 in May. This would take it back above the 50.0 level that indicates unchanged activity. Based on the experiences of the manufacturing and construction sectors, it is highly possible that services activity benefited in August from clients engaging in some of the activity and orders that were delayed in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. It isn\u2019t all sunny uplands though. Looking further ahead, IHS thinks weakness could persist in certain key areas of the services sector. This is most likely to be related to the commercial property sector and also the house market sector (housing market activity is currently muted). In addition, the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents reported in their August survey of business conditions that there was weakness in corporate transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions activity. And there may be worse to come. There are also serious uncertainties about the outlook for the services sector going forward. While the economy has seemingly held up better than expected in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, there is still the very real possibility that activity will increasing be pressurised by prolonged uncertainty (particularly once Article 50 is triggered and negotiations with the EU begin over future relationships). Additionally, the fundamentals for consumers will most likely increasingly soften with purchasing power diluted by rising inflation and muted earning growth. Unemployment also seems likely to rise. The first jobs report after the EU referendum vote did not suggest any immediate Brexit-related effect. European markets are expected to open higher today and a better-than-expected services sector PMI performance could send the FTSE100 soaring. Indeed, if the FTSE rises by as much as it did on Friday, a healthy 2.2%, the blue-chip index could break the 7,000 barrier, nearly 18 months after it did so for the first time. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll get a slightly clearer picture of how the economy is doing post-referendum today with the release of the services sector Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for August. The PMI, produced by Markit/CIPS, is one of the most closely-watched surveys of economic activity, monitoring how much life there is in UK\u2019s business sectors. Today\u2019s release covers the UK\u2019s dominant services sector - anything from entertainment to banking, retail or insurance - accounting for nearly 80% of the economy. The survey for August will be released at 9.30am, with last week\u2019s consensus forecast from analysts predicting the index will rise to 50, indicating unchanged activity. Anything above 50 means growth. Even a flat result of 50 would represent a bounceback from July, when the survey showed the biggest decline in activity since the financial crisis, falling to 47.4 from 52.3 in June. But this could have been down to post-referendum jitters and there have been signs of a rebound since then. The manufacturing sector PMI last week came in at 53.3, as factories shook off the Brexit shock. And the construction PMI released on Friday was 49.2, still a contraction but far better than expected. The resurgence in construction and manufacturing has boosted hopes that the service sector will follow suit.",

But the inflationary consequences of a <strong>weaker pound</strong> appear to be making their mark in the services sector \u2013 <strong>input prices</strong> rose at the fastest pace in 33 months.</p> <p>The strong recovery in all three CIPS surveys in August suggests that the likelihood of a <strong>recession this year is looking more remote</strong>, in line with our view. </p> <p>However, a composite PMI, which weights together the sectoral PMIs by their respective shares in the economy, points to an economy that will struggle to see much growth in Q3. </p> <p>Our expectation, allowing for the official and survey data available so far, suggests that <strong>GDP will expand by around 0.2%</strong>.

But with a separate \u201cpoor door\u201d entrance for social tenants housed on the lower floors, and private elevators for the super-rich to speed to \u00a33m penthouse apartments on the 67th floor, the new tower will revive controversy over inequality in the capital. Spire London will rise 235 metres (771ft) on a site close to Canary Wharf in London Docklands. It promises \u201cfive-star lifestyle amenities\u201d including a 35th-floor club and infinity pool with spectacular views over the city. But these will be reserved for private buyers, with one-bed \u201cluxurious suites\u201d to go on sale from \u00a3595,000. The affordable housing units will make up 96 of the 861 apartments, but the developers insist they will have equal access to other communal facilities on the third floor, including a creche, meeting rooms, games room, and a \u201cmusic/learning/cultural space\u201d. The developers are China\u2019s biggest private property company, Greenland Group, and its UK managing director said the venture was a major confidence boost for London\u2019s post-Brexit property market. \u201cThis important launch reflects the confidence that Greenland Group continues to have in both the London economy and the London property market,\u201d said Wenhao Qian. In the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum vote, prices at many tower developments stumbled, particularly in the London area. Property websites began advertising many unfinished flats below the original purchase price in an attempt to lure buyers. One agent, LondonDom.com, was advertising several properties in central London for less than the original price charged by the developer. These included a three-bedroom apartment in the Battersea Riverlight development. Separately, a flat in the super-luxe One Blackfriars development was advertised for \u201cless than the developer\u2019s price\u201d. In both cases, the agent said the sales were for personal reasons and not a result of the Brexit vote. The London office property market also stalled immediately after the referendum, with many leading investment funds forced to close their doors to withdrawals to avoid a firesale of property. However, data in recent weeks has tended to show a more robust property market emerging. House price growth picked up slightly in August, according to Nationwide. The average price of a home rose 0.6% to \u00a3206,145 between July and August, according to the Nationwide house price index \u2013 one of two monthly surveys by UK mortgage lenders. This compared with a 0.5% monthly gain in June. The annual rate picked up to 5.6% from 5.2%. Greenland Group, which is developing four of the 10 tallest buildings in the world, said Spire London would reach half its height by summer 2018, with completion in 2020.",
