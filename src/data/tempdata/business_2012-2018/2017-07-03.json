      "bodyText": "Hinkley Point C in Somerset will cost \u00a31.5bn more than planned, says developer EDF, and completion could be delayed by 15 months beyond the 2025 target date. In one sense, this news lacks any element of surprise. EDF only seems to build nuclear reactors that are late and over-budget, as witnessed in Finland and on its own patch at Flamanville in Normandy. Yet the timing of EDF\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d is a shock. It is very early in the life of this \u00a318.1bn (now \u00a319.6bn, possibly rising to \u00a320.3bn) project to be recasting the numbers. The tricky stages of construction, like pouring the right mix of concrete, lie ahead. The additional costs relate to mundane matters, such as \u201ca better understanding\u201d of UK regulators\u2019 requirements and \u201cthe volume and sequencing of work on site\u201d. These are planning areas in which EDF would surely have made allowances for uncertainties. That all that slack, and more, has been used up is puzzling. Sceptics within EDF who argued that Hinkley is too big and too financially risky will feel vindicated already. EDF\u2019s projected rate of return on the project was never high at 9%; now it is down to 8.5% and will fall to 8.2% if the delays materialise. Still, it\u2019s a French problem, right? Didn\u2019t the UK government insulate us by making EDF and its Chinese co-financier shoulder the construction risks? Wasn\u2019t that the trade-off for the UK guaranteeing to buy all Hinkley\u2019s electricity for 35 years at twice the current wholesale price? Well, yes, that\u2019s how the contract is structured, and EDF\u2019s UK boss was full of reassurance on Monday that UK taxpayers remain protected. But no contract of this size is ever so straightforward, as the National Audit Office pointed out in its blistering report last week. \u201cIf the HPC [Hinkley Point C] project or developer runs into difficulties, the UK government could come under pressure to provide more support or take on additional risk, particularly given HPC\u2019s potential importance to ensuring energy security,\u201d said the NAO. That dire circumstance remains some way off, but it can\u2019t be ignored. What if real engineering problems follow? What if EDF\u2019s projected returns fall to 7%, which would be closer to the company\u2019s cost of capital? Would EDF seek better terms knowing that Hinkley is scheduled to provide 7% of our electricity? \u201cThe [UK] government will hold a stronger negotiating position if it maintains alternative ways of ensuring energy security if HPC runs late or is not completed,\u201d said the NAO. That advice was sound last week, now it looks prescient. It is bad enough that UK consumers are locked into this \u201cexpensive and risky\u201d project, as the NAO called Hinkley. It would be calamitous if we end up being bullied into paying more. Ministers need to draw up a proper contingency plan \u2013 starting now. Ofgem plan shows May\u2019s \u2018help for millions\u2019 is off the boil This is how political U-turns are performed in the energy sector \u2013 not with a visible yank on the steering wheel but with some vague words from the secretary of state designed to disguise the manoeuvre in hand. As Ofgem announced a limited price cap that will apply only to yet-to-be-defined \u201cvulnerable\u201d customers, the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, attempted to suggest the government could yet go further. \u201cI will consider next steps when I have received Ofgem\u2019s proposed actions,\u201d he declared. Next steps? Clark, like everyone else, can see that the gap between Ofgem\u2019s proposal and Theresa May\u2019s promise of a universal price cap is huge. It won\u2019t be closed by a few steps. Ofgem\u2019s proposed \u201csafeguard tariff\u201d is modest and targeted, probably at households that qualify for warm home discounts. May\u2019s idea would have overthrown the entire regulatory philosophy of the past 20 years. What Clark is really looking forward to seeing, one suspects, is everybody forgetting that the prime minister once promised to \u201cprotect around 17 million families on standard variable tariffs\u201d by knocking \u00a3100 off their energy bills every year. Don\u2019t blame Ofgem, incidentally, for declining to live up to the Conservative party\u2019s election hype. The regulator has technical powers to propose a universal price cap, but it also knows that such a muscular approach would invite an appeal by the energy suppliers to the Competition and Markets Authority. Since the CMA last year rejected a full price cap, the appeal would probably succeed. Parliament, in other words, is the only body that can make a universal cap stick. Clark\u2019s wishy-washy response suggests the idea is virtually dead for now, killed by resistance from those Tory MPs who viewed the proposal as anti-market. Shares in Centrica, owner of British Gas, rose nearly 2%. Investors can see the political U-turn happening.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England faces the first strike at its Threadneedle Street headquarters in its history after members of the Unite union voted for four days of industrial action in a dispute over pay. Maintenance, security and the staff that look after the parlours \u2013 the central core of the Bank that contains the office of the governor, Mark Carney \u2013 will be striking for four consecutive days from 31 July. Although the action involves less than 2% of the Bank\u2019s 4,000-strong workforce, Unite said the threatened strike would make the institution \u201ceffectively inoperable\u201d. A Bank spokeswoman said talks to avert the action would take place but there were plans to ensure that the Bank continued to operate effectively. She added that Threadneedle Street, in the heart of the City of London, had never witnessed a strike, with the last industrial action affecting the Bank taking place at its printing plant in Essex in the late 1970s. Unite said the dispute has been caused by the imposition of a 1% increase in the pay pot for the year from March. The union said the amount an individual would receive was at the discretion of line managers, so that employees could receive less than 1% and some no rise at all. It balloted 84 members, of whom 95% voted for the strike. The Unite regional officer Mercedes Sanchez said: \u201cStaff at the Bank of England have made their anger clear by voting for strike action due to their employer\u2019s outright refusal to negotiate a fair pay deal for its workforce.\u201d The union warned that if the Bank failed to resolve the pay row it would consult its members across other departments as part of a plan to escalate the dispute. A Bank of England spokeswoman said: \u201cShould the strike go ahead, the Bank has plans in place so that all sites can continue to operate effectively.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 August 2017. An earlier version said the strikes would be the first industrial action affecting the Bank of England in five decades, with the last industrial action being at its printing plant in Essex in the late 1960s.

    "webTitle": "Millions betrayed by Tories\u2019 energy price cap U-turn, says Labour", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour has accused the government of betraying millions of households after the energy regulator published proposals to extend a price cap for vulnerable customers that fell well short of the Conservatives\u2019 election promises. Theresa May had pledged a price cap on energy bills for 17m families during the general election campaign, but the policy was missing from the Queen\u2019s speech. Instead, the business secretary, Greg Clark, wrote to the energy regulator asking it to safeguard \u201ccustomers on the poorest value tariffs\u201d. In response, Ofgem said on Monday that it would hold a summit in July to consider what form of \u201csafeguard tariff\u201d would be best, with one option being to extend an existing cap for the 4m households on prepayment meters to a further 2.6m vulnerable households who receive the warm home discount. Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy minister, asked Clark during an urgent question in the Commons whether he accepted that Ofgem\u2019s response \u201cfalls far short\u201d of May\u2019s promise. Whitehead said 17m households \u201cwill now feel completely betrayed by this policy U-turn\u201d. Clark said he was prepared to legislate if the final proposals did not go far enough to address consumers paying over the odds. John Penrose, a Conservative MP who has led calls for a cap, said the plans were a \u201cstitch-up\u201d by the big six suppliers and urged parliament to legislate. \u201cOfgem\u2019s proposals will not end the energy rip-off for 17m families, as we promised in our manifesto. Under this plan, fewer than 3 million customers will be helped and the remaining 14 million will see their energy bills rise as energy companies recoup the cost of the cap by milking the rest of us,\u201d said the former minister in a statement. The initial plans appear to be a long way from the prime minister\u2019s promise of a cap saving 17m families \u00a3100 each, and are confirmation that the government has bowed to industry lobbying. The share price of British Gas\u2019s owner, Centrica, climbed 1.75% after the announcement, and SSE\u2019s rose by nearly 1%. \u201cWhat is increasingly clear to us is it that an industry-wide price cap for energy bills is unlikely,\u201d said analysts at Jefferies bank. No 10 gave a lukewarm response to the Ofgem proposal but stopped short of repeating the pledge to legislate to protect 17m families with a price cap. \u201cOfgem\u2019s response is a step in the right direction,\u201d May\u2019s official spokesman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve said we need a better energy market and are committed to extending price protection currently in place to some vulnerable energy consumers to more people on the poorest-value tariffs.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe are not ruling anything out, whether that is action by the regulator or legislation.\u201d Ofgem also said it would push forward with reforms recommended by the competition watchdog, including the energy regulator\u2019s own streamlined switching site and forcing firms to tell their customers if another supplier has a cheaper deal. The regulator is also proceeding with a potentially controversial plan to make comparison sites hide tariffs that they cannot switch customers to immediately and earn commission from. Shoppers will instead have to click a button to show all deals, though sites will have to ensure visitors know they are only receiving a partial view of the market. New data from the regulator shows that British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower and Scottish Power have increased the profit margin they make on billpayers from 3.7% on average in the 2015-16 financial year to 4% in 2016-17. Ofgem also published figures revealing that, while the costs faced by suppliers in May were up 15% on the same time the year before, they had fallen 6% between February and May. In that same period, five of the six big suppliers increased their prices for customers, some by as much as 10%. Dermot Nolan, the energy regulator\u2019s chief executive, wrote in a letter to Clark: \u201cOfgem shares your concern that the market is not working well for all consumers, particularly those who do not regularly switch energy supplier.\u201d Consumer groups welcomed the prospect of the prepayment cap being widened. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cWe have been calling for the prepayment meter cap to be extended to all those eligible for the warm home discount for years and the regulator\u2019s announcement today paves the way for protecting as many as 2.6 million more who can least afford rising energy bills.\u201d However, Which? said that while more protections and easier switching were good, \u201cpeople will question whether these interventions are enough to deliver an energy market that finally works for all consumers\u201d. Price comparison sites, which had strongly lobbied against an absolute price cap, were pleased by the announcement. Ofgem said it would also help protect vulnerable households by capping the costs for people having a prepayment meter fitted under court orders at \u00a3150. Such charges can reach \u00a31,000 under the current regime. Another planned measure is a simplified switching service for people who have been on the worst-value default tariffs \u2013 known as standard variable tariffs (SVTs) \u2013 for more than three years. The regulator will automatically provide a customer\u2019s gas and electricity consumption data for them, to make the process easier. Figures released by Ofgem show that 65% of people are still on an SVT, down fractionally from the 66% when the data was first published last December.",

    "webTitle": "Mike Ashley vomited into fireplace at pub meeting, court told", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The high court has been given an extraordinary insight into the working practices of Mike Ashley, the controversial founder of Sports Direct, who it was claimed would challenge subordinates to extreme drinking competitions that once ended with the 52-year-old billionaire vomiting into a fireplace. The \u201cunconventional\u201d working life of Ashley, who controls the Sports Direct retail chain and Newcastle United football club, was laid bare in evidence on Monday in a case alleging that the retail tycoon reneged on a \u00a315m deal with a banker. The lawsuit claims the agreement was sealed during a boozy session in a London pub. Ashley allegedly held regular senior management meetings during \u201clock-ins\u201d at the Green Dragon pub in Alfreton near Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. During other meetings Ashley is alleged to have expressed his \u201cboredom and frustration\u201dwith City figures by lying under the table to \u201chave a nap\u201d. On one occasion Ashley, who is estimated to be worth \u00a32.2bn, is alleged to have challenged a young Polish analyst to a drinking competition at the Green Dragon in which they drank a dozen pints followed by vodka chasers. Jeff Blue, a former banker and colleague who is suing Ashley, said the rules of the drinking game were that whoever left the room first was to be declared the loser. \u201cAfter approximately 12 pints and chasers Pawel [Pawlowski] apologised profusely and had to excuse himself,\u201d Blue stated in written evidence submitted to the court. \u201cMr Ashley then vomited into the fireplace located in the centre of the bar, to huge applause from his senior management team.\u201d Blue\u2019s multimillion-pound legal claim stems from another boozy meeting at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Direct\u2019s Oxford Street store in 2013. Blue claims that Ashley agreed to pay him \u00a315m if he could help double Sports Direct\u2019s share price within three years. Ashley has dismissed everything discussed in the pub as \u201cbanter\u201d, denied that any such deal existed and refused to pay up. Blue, a former Merrill Lynch banker and strategic development director at Sports Direct, claimed that Ashley said: \u201cIf he [Blue] can get the stock to \u00a38 per share why should I give a fuck how much I have to pay him? I will have made so much money it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Ashley, who munched on Polo mints while listening to Blue give evidence in the high court, is said to have initially offered the banker \u00a310m if Sports Direct\u2019s share price hit \u00a38 per share but raised it to \u00a315m after he said it was a \u201chigh target\u201d and pointed out that the retailer\u2019s Sports Direct stake would be worth more than \u00a31.6bn. The retailer is alleged to have said it would be \u201cfucking unbelievable\u201d for Sports Direct\u2019s shares to hit that level, which would have meant the group was worth as much as Marks &amp; Spencer. Sports Direct\u2019s shares hit the \u00a38 price target in February 2014. The shares have since collapsed below \u00a33, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed the retailer was in effect paying staff in its warehouse less than the minimum wage. Blue said that in December 2013, when Sports Direct\u2019s shares were approaching \u00a38, he approached Ashley, who referred to him as \u201cJeffis\u201d, for confirmation of the claimed agreement. Blue said that Ashley replied: \u201cJeffis, I\u2019ve got it, I\u2019ve got it. We\u2019re cool, we\u2019re cool.\u201d Shortly after the shares hit \u00a38 at 1.04pm on 25 February 2014 Blue\u2019s wife, who was also in court, texted him to say: \u201cIt\u2019s hit 8!!!!!\u201d Ashley paid Blue a \u00a31m bonus in May 2014, but said this was discretionary and not a downpayment on the alleged \u00a315m deal agreed in the Horse and Groom. Ashley denies that any deal was made. Blue\u2019s lawyers said the payment was \u201conly explicable as a partial payment of the sum that had been agreed\u201d. Lawyers for Ashley said Blue\u2019s claims were \u201cextremely vague\u201d and pointed out that there was no contemporaneous written record of the claimed deal. They said a \u201cconsiderable amount of alcohol was drunk in the pub\u201d which led to \u201cbanter\u201d on several topics, including business and football. Speaking in court, Blue claimed that drinking copious amounts of alcohol during business meetings was not unusual for Ashley, and that the tycoon often conducted meetings \u201cin various unusual venues\u201d and agreed deals orally while under the influence. He said that during the same meeting Ashley was also on his phone finalising player transfers at his football club. \u201cNotwithstanding the venue and the consumption of alcohol, I note that Mr Ashley was able during the evening to conduct other business, including making decisions in regards to player transfers on behalf of Newcastle United,\u201d Blue said. Blue also claimed that the company\u2019s senior management meeting was held during a boozy event every Tuesday night at the Lion hotel in Worksop. The Lion is a short drive from Sport Direct\u2019s warehouse, which a parliamentary inquiry found Ashley was running like a Victorian workhouse and treating workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d. The meeting \u201ctypically commenced in the bar area at around 8pm with Mr Ashley drinking alcohol at the bar while in discussions with management\u201d. Blue alleged that dinner would be served at about 10.30pm with the gathering generally coming to a close between 1am and 3am. \u201cMeetings were like no other senior management meeting I had ever attended in all my years of investment banking experience,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was effectively a \u2018pub lock-in\u2019 with alcohol continuing to be served well beyond closing hours and fish and chips or kebabs being provided throughout the evening.\u201d Jeffrey Chapman QC, who is representing Blue, said: \u201cSports Direct senior management meetings often took place in bars where considerable volumes of alcohol were consumed while Mr Ashley made business decisions. The court must decide whether this was just a night in the pub or an important business meeting.\u201d David Cavender QC, representing Ashley, told the judge, Justice Leggatt, that Blue\u2019s claim was an \u201copportunistic try-on\u201d. The case continues, and Ashley is due to take the stand on Wednesday.",

The shares have since collapsed below \u00a33, in part because of reputational damage caused by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">Guardian investigation that revealed the retailer was in effect paying staff in its warehouse less than the minimum wage.</a></p> <p>Blue said that in December 2013, when Sports Direct\u2019s shares were approaching \u00a38, he approached Ashley, who referred to him as \u201cJeffis\u201d, for confirmation of the claimed agreement. Blue said that Ashley replied: \u201cJeffis, I\u2019ve got it, I\u2019ve got it. We\u2019re cool, we\u2019re cool.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the shares hit \u00a38 at 1.04pm on 25 February 2014 Blue\u2019s wife, who was also in court, texted him to say: \u201cIt\u2019s hit 8!!!!!\u201d</p> <p>Ashley paid Blue a \u00a31m bonus in May 2014, but said this was discretionary and not a downpayment on the alleged \u00a315m deal agreed in the Horse and Groom. Ashley denies that any deal was made. Blue\u2019s lawyers said the payment was \u201conly explicable as a partial payment of the sum that had been agreed\u201d.<br></p> <p>Lawyers for Ashley said Blue\u2019s claims were \u201cextremely vague\u201d and pointed out that there was no contemporaneous written record of the claimed deal. They said a \u201cconsiderable amount of alcohol was drunk in the pub\u201d which led to \u201cbanter\u201d on several topics, including business and football. </p> <p>Speaking in court, Blue claimed that drinking copious amounts of alcohol during business meetings was not unusual for Ashley, and that the tycoon often conducted meetings \u201cin various unusual venues\u201d and agreed deals orally while under the influence. </p> <p>He said that during the same meeting Ashley was also on his phone finalising player transfers at his football club. \u201cNotwithstanding the venue and the consumption of alcohol, I note that Mr Ashley was able during the evening to conduct other business, including making decisions in regards to player transfers on behalf of Newcastle United,\u201d Blue said.</p> <p>Blue also claimed that the company\u2019s senior management meeting was held during a boozy event every Tuesday night at the Lion hotel in Worksop. The Lion is a short drive from Sport Direct\u2019s warehouse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\">which a parliamentary inquiry found Ashley was running like a Victorian workhouse and treating workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The meeting \u201ctypically commenced in the bar area at around 8pm with Mr Ashley drinking alcohol at the bar while in discussions with management\u201d. Blue alleged that dinner would be served at about 10.30pm with the gathering generally coming to a close between 1am and 3am.</p> <p>\u201cMeetings were like no other senior management meeting I had ever attended in all my years of investment banking experience,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was effectively a \u2018pub lock-in\u2019 with alcohol continuing to be served well beyond closing hours and fish and chips or kebabs being provided throughout the evening.\u201d</p> <p>Jeffrey Chapman QC, who is representing Blue, said: \u201cSports Direct senior management meetings often took place in bars where considerable volumes of alcohol were consumed while Mr Ashley made business decisions. The court must decide whether this was just a night in the pub or an important business meeting.\u201d</p> <p>David Cavender QC, representing Ashley, told the judge, Justice Leggatt, that Blue\u2019s claim was an \u201copportunistic try-on\u201d.</p> <p>The case continues, and Ashley is due to take the stand on Wednesday. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "OK, time for a quick catch-up. Britain has missed out on a general pick-up in factory output last month. The UK manufacturing sector cooled in June, with growth hitting a three month low. Economists blamed political worries over Brexit, as the weak pound failed to prevent export order growth cooling. But some pointed out that growth over the last three months was still strong. The eurozone powered ahead, though, with growth hitting a new six-year high. Germany, Austria and the Netherlands were particularly strong, while Greece made a welcome return to growth. China\u2019s factory sector beat forecasts, with growth nudging a three-month high. The data from America is a little patchy, though. The ISM shows that US factory growth hit a three-year high, but Markit\u2019s alternative PMI report signalled a slowdown..... In other news... Stock markets have begun July with some solid gains; in London the FTSE is up 62 points at 7375, a gain of 0.86%. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has gained 1%, putting it on track for its best day in two months. The FSB has fired a warning shot at G20 leaders, urging them not to abandon efforts to reform the financial sector. And the Bank of England is facing its first strike in decades, as some staff refuse to accept real wage cuts. This is more like it. America\u2019s factory sector has posted its strongest growth in almost three years, according to The Institute for Supply Management. The ISM US manufacturing PMI has jumped to 57.8, up from 54.9 in May, and the highest reading since August 2014. That\u2019s a rather more encouraging view than Markit\u2019s rival survey. US factory bosses told ISM that new orders, production and employment levels all rose last month, in an encouraging signal. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index to 57.8 in June, from 54.9, leaves the index at its highest level in nearly three years and supports our view that annualised GDP growth has rebounded strongly in the second quarter. Here\u2019s the key points from Markit\u2019s survey of the US factory sector in June: Breaking: America\u2019s factory sector slowed last month, according to Markit\u2019s PMI survey at any rate. Markit reports that new orders growth among US manufacturers slowed last month, while production rose at the lowest rate in 10 months. That pulled Markit\u2019s US manufacturing PMI down to 52.0, from 52.7 in May. Curiously, there are two rival PMI surveys covering America - we\u2019re about to find out if ISM agree with Markit. Wall Street has started the third quarter of 2017 in a positive mood. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 120 points, or almost 0.6%, led by banks and technology companies. A cocktail of factors has pushed the gold price down to a seven-week low today. Bullion is changing hands at $1,125 per ounce, its the lowest level since the middle of May, a fall of 1.2%. Gold is being hurt by the stronger dollar, which has rallied today. Speculation that global central banks are getting closer to raising interest rates are also weighing on gold - which is a less attractive investment when you can get a higher return for holding cash instead. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: Gold\u2019s poor start to July comes after a nasty fall in June which broke its best winning streak since 2010. Nevertheless gold rallied 8% in the first half of the year as the Trump trade faded, but has stalled again as markets see central banks taking a more hawkish stance in the second half.\u201d Here\u2019s Larry Elliott on today\u2019s FSB report: The organisation responsible for monitoring the health of global financial system is urging regulators not to cave in to \u2018reform fatigue\u2019. Mark Carney, head of the Financial Stability Board, has put down his spade and hockey stick and turned his attention to the upcoming meeting of G20 leaders later this week. He says leaders risk driving up financing costs, hurting economic growth, if they fail to crack on with financial stability reforms. He warns that: In particular, giving into reform fatigue could erode the willingness of G20 members to rely on each other\u2019s systems and institutions and, in the process, fragment pools of funding and liquidity. The FSB is particularly keen that leaders agree and implement the Basel III rules, a set of tougher capital rules for lenders which some countries claim are too onerous. As the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis approaches, the FSB is also awarding itself a pat on the back, arguing that many problems have been fixed. As Bloomberg puts it: Carney, head of the Financial Stability Board, reeled off regulators\u2019 accomplishments, including better-capitalized banks, reduced risk of big public bailouts, a thorough reform of the derivatives markets and a decline in the most dangerous activities of so-called shadow banking. One of the biggest threat to all these achievements, he said on Monday, is \u201creform fatigue.\u201d Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis has reached the vaults of the Bank of England. Workers at Britain\u2019s central bank have voted to hold a four-day strike, starting on July 31, as they push for a larger pay increase. It\u2019s the first strike to hit the Bank of England in 50 years, according to the Unite union. Around 95% of Unite members backed a strike, after the BoE only offered staff a below-inflation increase in earnings (which is a little awkward, as the Bank is meant to be controlling inflation) Unite represents workers in the Bank\u2019s maintenance, parlours and security departments. Union official Mercedes Sanchez says the walkout will hit BoE operations, and urged governor Mark Carney to step in. \u201cThe result of the bank\u2019s unwillingness to negotiate fair pay will be that the bank\u2019s sites, including the iconic Threadneedle Street in the city of London will effectively be inoperable without the maintenance, parlours and security staff. \u201cMark Carney needs to get his own house in order. It is nothing short of shameful that the iconic symbol of financial services in the UK is choosing to ride roughshod over the concerns of its dedicated and hardworking staff and impose this derisory pay deal. The governor can no longer turn a blind eye to what is happening on his own patch. The Bank of England claims, though, that it will keep operating as usual: \u201cThe Bank has been informed of industrial action being called by Unite the Union. The Union balloted approximately 2% of the workforce. Should the strike go ahead, the Bank has plans in place so that all sites can continue to operate effectively. We will continue to have discussions with Unite and hope that there will be a positive outcome.\u201d Governor Carney, meanwhile, has been doing his bit at the Haven House Children\u2019s Hospice in Woodford Green, London.... He also squeezed in a spot of ice hockey at Trafalgar Square to mark his native Canada\u2019s 150th birthday: Sterling continues to drop, as traders digest this morning\u2019s PMI data. The pound has now shed 0.7 of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.2955, wiping out Friday\u2019s rally. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says traders have been reassessing the odds of a UK interest rate rise soon (for the umpteenth time): The UK\u2019s manufacturing sector activity reading fell to 54.3 in June, marking its slowest pace of growth in three months. This disappointing report has dealt another blow to sentiment and is likely to add to the horrible cocktail of soft economic releases which is slowly illustrating the impact of Brexit. This chart shows how City economists had expected British factory activity to have been much stronger in June. Many had expected a PMI in the 56-ish region, not as low as 54.3. Although UK manufacturing is obviously important, it only makes up around 10% of Britain\u2019s economy. On Wednesday, we find out how the dominant service sector fared in June. This morning\u2019s disappointing factory data may be a sign that service companies also struggled, says Andy Bruce of Reuters: Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says the slowdown in UK factory expansion last month is \u201cdisappointing\u201d, particularly as export growth slowed. \u201cThe survey indicates that not only did output slow in June, but the sector is entering the third quarter with reduced momentum with new orders at an 11-month low. This was primarily due to weaker domestic demand, but it is disappointing to see that export orders slowed. Furthermore, the slowdown in manufacturing activity is reported across all sectors \u2013 consumer, intermediate and investment goods. Backlogs of work fell in June which also points to weaker activity going forward. Additionally, confidence among manufacturers dipped to a seven-month low in June, although it was still decent, and employment growth slowed. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, agrees: \u201cThe foot unexpectedly came off the accelerator last month suggesting that manufacturers\u2019 attention was in part drawn to grappling with the uncertainty from both the general election and the start of Brexit negotiations. Encouragingly, production levels are still in positive territory but growth slowed to its lowest rate for three months and most disappointingly, given the weakness in sterling, was the slowdown in new export business. However, manufacturers have traded through challenging conditions many times before and in spite of this weaker performance, it is still the eleventh consecutive month of increasing output.\u201d In another boost for Europe, the jobless rate across the eurozone remains at its lowest level since the financial crisis began. Unemployment in the single currency region was 9.3% in May, matching April\u2019s figure, and the lowest since March 2009. Across the wider EU, the jobless rate came in at 7.8%, the lowest since December 2008. The Czech Republic and Germany enjoyed the lowest unemployment rate, below 4% while Greece and Spain still suffered the highest. City experts are disappointed to see that Britain\u2019s manufacturing growth has dipped to a three-month low in June: Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says political anxiety is hurting the sector: \u201cManufacturing activity showed signs of slowing this month, as fears that the sector would feel the impact of both the election and the start of Brexit talks materialised. \u201cWhile the sector remained in growth, a softening of new orders suggested some hesitancy from the UK to commit to new projects, which will be a worry as the domestic market has been the main driver of growth in the past two months. Apart from some orders from the US and Western Europe, exports fared little better as a continuing weak, but stable pound began to lose some of its allure. But Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, argues that factories can ride out the storm. \u201cThe PMI figures show a drop in confidence this month as manufacturers grappled with the general election result and uncertainty arising from our negotiations to exit the EU. \u201cBut manufacturers are resilient. They have a keen eye on margins and are taking steps to future-proof their business. Many are stockpiling and investing to win contracts, while others are boosting their export order books. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, blames Brexit uncertainty: \u201cThe UK\u2019s manufacturing sector is still growing but the pressures that have become almost de rigeur in UK economic data are still very much present. New business growth has slowed which is limiting the increase in new employment in the sector, confidence has slipped to a 7 month low and while price pressures are easing, supply lines are becoming stretched and are therefore slowing, extending the time taken on projects. Overall the UK manufacturing sector is an engine that is only able to fire on a few of its cylinders whilst the landscape on investment and trade remains so occluded by Brexit and the inherent uncertainty of our negotiations.\u201d Rupert Harrison of BlackRock argues that the current divergence between Europe and the UK could simplify the Brexit talks (although perhaps not to Britain\u2019s advantage...) It\u2019s not all bad news for the UK. Factory growth over the last quarter is the strongest since 2014, despite the slowdown in June. Sterling has fallen by half a cent, following the news that UK factory growth was weaker than expected last month. The pound is now trading at $1.297, away from the six-week highs struck last week. Breaking: Britain\u2019s manufacturing growth slowed last month, as UK factories failed to keep pace with their rivals across the channel. The UK manufacturing PMI has dropped to 54.3 in June, well below expectations of a reading of 56.5. This is the slowest growth in three months. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is the latest signal that Britain\u2019s economy is slowing this year. Firms reported that production and new orders did grow in June, but at a slower rate than in May. Demand from domestic and export markets both slowed - denting hopes that the weak pound will boost UK exports. In another disappointment, May\u2019s reading has also been revised down to 56.3 from 56.7. Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says the data dampens hopes that the UK economy is bouncing back, after growing by just 0.2% in January-March. He explains: \u201cNew business rose at the weakest pace for nearly a year and growth was down sharply from April\u2019s near three-year high. This slowdown was largely centred on the domestic market, where increased business uncertainty appears to have led to some delays in placing new contracts. \u201cExport orders remained disappointingly lacklustre despite the ongoing competitiveness boost of the weak sterling exchange rate. Reminder: Our new Business Today email gives you a morning shot of financial news, setting you up for the working day. You can sign up here. It\u2019s official -- the eurozone\u2019s factory sector is growing at its fastest rate in over six years. The boom in Germany, and solid expansion in France, Italy and Spain have all helped to deliver the fastest expansion since 2011. This pushed Markit\u2019s eurozone manufacturing PMI up to the giddy heights of 57.4 in June, up from May\u2019s 57.0, beating City forecasts. Firms reported a strong pick-up in new orders, which led to a surge in activity and another strong month of job creation. The expansion was broad-based too, with every country reporting faster factory growth in June. Germany, Austria and the Netherlands were especially strong, while Greece\u2019s return to growth was a welcome sign. These PMIs are \u2018soft\u2019 economic data, based on interviews with thousands of factory bosses across Europe. They may indicate that underlying growth is strengthening. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cEurozone manufacturing growth gained further momentum in June, rounding off the best quarter for just over six years. At current levels, the PMI is indicative of factory output growing at an annual rate of some 5%, which in turn indicates the goods- producing sector will have made a strong positive contribution to second quarter economic growth. \u201cExports continue to play a major role in driving the expansion, increasing in recent months at rates not seen for six years, buoyed in part by the weak euro. But it\u2019s also clear that factories are benefitting from ongoing strong demand from domestic customers. Williamson also believes that the European recovery has legs, and will continued through 2017: \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of the impressive performance ending any time soon. Optimism about the year ahead has risen to the highest for at least five years, backlogs of orders are building up at the fastest rate for over seven years and factories are reporting near-record hiring as they struggle to deal with the upturn in demand. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly in expansion mode and looks poised for continued robust growth in coming months.\u201d More reaction to follow.... Newsflash: Eurozone manufacturing growth has hit a new six-year high. Details to follow.... More good news! Greece\u2019s factory sector has returned to growth for the first time since last summer. Boom! German factory growth has hit a 74-month high. Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the sector has risen to 59.6 in June, up from 59.5 in May. That shows the fastest growth in over six years, showing that the eurozone\u2019s largest economy is strengthening. The strong performance was driven by the biggest surge in new orders since 2011, data firm Markit reports. Trevor Balchin, senior economist at IHS Markit, called it \u201canother impressive performance\u201d, and one that suggests Germany\u2019s growth is picking up pace. He adds: \u201cAlthough output growth held broadly steady and job creation eased slightly since May, the expansion in new orders accelerated further. Suppliers remained under intense pressure with input delivery times lengthening to the greatest extent since April 2011. \u201cInput price inflation slowed for the second month running to the weakest since November 2016, but remained stronger than the 21-year survey trend level. Output prices increased at the sharpest rate since February.\u201d France\u2019s factories have posted another month of solid growth too, as demand and business confidence rose. The French manufacturing PMI has jumped to 54.8 in June, from 53.8 in May - that shows a faster expansion, but not quite as pacy as expected. Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit, reports that firms took on more staff as their piles of unfinished work mounted up. He adds: \u201cA strong degree of business optimism was also a key feature of the latest survey, perhaps buoyed by reduced political uncertainty following the conclusion to June\u2019s legislative elections and robust economic conditions in the Eurozone.\u201d Just in...Italy\u2019s factory sector picked up last month, thanks to a surge of new orders. European stock markets are rallying this morning, helped by the pickup in Chinese factory growth last month. The main indices have all risen in early trading. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has jumped by 42 points, or 0.6%, to 7355. Mining companies are leading the rally, thanks to the jump in metals prices this morning. Glencore has gained 2.2%, Anglo American are up 2.1% and Antofagasta is 1.5% higher. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: It\u2019s manufacturing Monday, and with China\u2019s Caixin PMI just about climbing out of contraction territory the European indices got off to a strong start. Having neared 2 month lows last Friday there was plenty of room for the FTSE to bounce back this morning and bounce back it did, rising more than half a percent to sit just below 7350. The thrust of the UK index\u2019s growth stemmed from the commodity sector, itself boosted by the latest 0.5% jump from Brent Crude, the black stuff now trading at $49 per barrel for the first time in around a month. Breaking: Spain\u2019s factory data has missed forecasts, but still shows solid expansion. The Spanish manufacturing PMI has come in at 54.7, down from May\u2019s 55.4. Spanish factory bosses reported that output, new orders and employment all rose last June, but not as quickly as the previous month. Firms reported that their backlog of work stacked up, even though they kept hiring staff. And the good news for consumers is that raw material inflation is slowing. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cJune saw a continuation of the recent strong performance of the Spanish manufacturing sector, with growth remaining elevated. The first half of the year has been impressive, with no real sign among the latest data that rates of expansion are running out of steam heading into the second half. \u201cOne thing that is on the wane is inflation, with both input costs and output prices rising at the weakest rates since late-2016. This should help firms maintain competitive pricing, enabling them to take advantage of improving customer demand.\u201d The Russian PMI is a worry. Growth in Russia\u2019s manufacturing sector almost fizzled out last month, with its PMI dropping to an 11-month low of 50.3, from May\u2019s 52.4. Markit reports that new business from abroad continued to shrink, forcing Russian factory bosses to lay off staff at the second-fastest rate since last September. Norway\u2019s manufacturing base just posted its strongest growth in five years, according to its PMI report: Sweden factories also accelerated last month, with a PMI of 62.4 -- a level showing robust growth. Other Asian countries have followed China\u2019s lead, and reported manufacturing growth last month. Reuters has the details: Factory Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indexes for South Korea, Japan,Taiwan Vietnam and India all remained above the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis. And all of these indexes, except for Japan and India, rose from the previous month, indicating an acceleration in expansion. Metal prices have jumped this morning, following the news that Chinese factories returned to growth last month. Aluminium and copper are both rallying. China got PMI Day off to a decent start, by reporting its fastest factory growth in three months. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 index rose to 50.4 in June, better than expected. That\u2019s up from May\u2019s 49.6 - which was the worst reading in 11 months. Any PMI over 50 signals growth, so it\u2019s an encouraging sign for China\u2019s manufacturing sector after some tricky months. The details are a bit mixed, though. Chinese companies reported that their production levels rose last month, and new orders also picked up. But with demand still muted, they cut their workforce levels again and also ran down their inventories, as optimism over the business outlook hit its lowest level of 2017. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, is concerned that Chinese factories could struggle later this year. \u201cThe manufacturing sector recovered slightly in June, but based on the inventory trends and confidence around future output, the June reading was more like a temporary rebound, with an economic downtrend likely to be confirmed later.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re getting a healthcheck on the world\u2019s factories today, as data firms release their monthly Purchasing Managers Index reports. This flurry of data will show how manufacturers \u2013 from China\u2019s Pearl River Delta to Germany\u2019s Mittelstand and the US Rust Belt \u2013 fared in June, hopefully giving a new insight into the health of the global economy. Economists expect another strong month from Europe, as its recovery continue. The eurozone manufacturing PMI is tipped to hit 57.3, a level that shows the strongest growth since the debt crisis began. The British data could show a slowdown, though - with the UK manufacturing PMI forecast to fall to 56.3, from 56.7. The UK report will be closely scrutinised for signs that June\u2019s general election, and the resulting hung parliament, has hit industry. Royal Bank of Canada explain: With more hawkish noises coming from certain quarters of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee in recent days, markets are likely to be especially sensitive to the PMI surveys this month. As they were conducted mid-month in June, it should be expected that the results incorporate businesses\u2019 views about the impact of the indecisive general election result on 8 June. The Chinese data is already out, showing that growth hit a three-month high (more on this shortly). We also get new eurozone unemployment figures this morning; they may show that the jobless rate remains at its lowest level since the financial crisis, at 9.3%. European stock markets are expected to open higher, after being rattled last week by confusing signals from the world\u2019s central bankers about the path of monetary policy.

But it\u2019s also clear that factories are benefitting from ongoing strong demand from domestic customers. </p> </blockquote> <p>Williamson also believes that the European recovery has legs, and will continued through 2017:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of the impressive performance ending any time soon. Optimism about the year ahead has risen to the highest for at least five years, backlogs of orders are building up at the fastest rate for over seven years and factories are reporting near-record hiring as they struggle to deal with the upturn in demand.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fundamental reforms undertaken since the US sub-prime mortgage market triggered the deepest global recession since the second world war have created a safer, simpler and fairer financial system, Mark Carney has said. With the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis next month, Carney said the world\u2019s biggest banks were stronger, misconduct was being tackled, and the toxic forms of shadow banking were no longer a threat. Carney, as well as being governor of the Bank of England, is chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a body created by the G20 group of developed and developing nations in 2009 to recommend ways of remedying the flaws in the system highlighted by the crash. In a letter to G20 leaders before their meeting in Hamburg later this week, Carney said: \u201cA decade after the start of the global financial crisis, G20 reforms are building a safer, simpler and fairer financial system. The largest banks are considerably stronger, more liquid and more focused.\u201d The FSB chairman said there were still issues to be addressed, such as the risks posed by developments in financial technology (fintech) and the increased vulnerability of digital systems to cyber-attack. But at a press conference in London on Monday, Carney said: \u201cWe have fixed the issues that caused the last crisis. They were fundamental and deep-seated, which is why it was such a major job.\u201d The financial crisis of 2007 began in the US mortgage market but rapidly went global as it emerged that banks and unregulated shadow banks were massively exposed in the market for derivatives and did not have enough capital when losses started to mount. Public anger towards the financial system grew when the biggest banks were bailed out by taxpayers because they were deemed \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. Carney said in his letter: \u201cThe largest banks are required to have as much as 10 times more of the highest quality capital than before the crisis and are subject to greater market discipline as a consequence of globally agreed standards to resolve too-big-to-fail entities. \u201cA decade ago, many large banks were woefully undercapitalised, with complex business models that relied on the goodwill of markets and, ultimately, taxpayers. A decade on, the largest banks have raised more than $1.5tn of capital, and all major internationally active banks meet minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements well in advance of the deadline.\u201d He added that on the eve of the crisis a decade ago, \u201cenormous risks were built up outside the core banking system and away from effective supervision with devastating impact on the real economy\u201d. As a result of measures agreed four years ago to toughen up regulation, Carney said \u201cthe financial stability risks from the toxic forms of shadow banking at the heart of the crisis no longer represent a global stability risk\u201d. The FSB is monitoring the rapid growth of the asset management industry, with particular emphasis on the vulnerability of emerging and developing countries to sudden outflows of funds. \u201cDespite this immense progress, there are nascent risks that, if left unchecked, could undermine the G20\u2019s objective for strong, sustainable and balanced growth,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIn particular, giving into reform fatigue could erode the willingness of G20 members to rely on each other\u2019s systems and institutions and, in the process, fragment pools of funding and liquidity, create inefficiencies and frictions, reduce competition, and diminish cross-border capital and investment flows.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Michael Callaghan, who wrote the review of the petroleum resource rent tax, has defended his controversial recommendation to make minimal changes to the tax regime for existing oil and gas projects. He told senators that large oil and gas projects should not have their PRRT arrangements changed midway through development because it would damage Australia\u2019s reputation. But he reminded senators that he did not have a mandate, under the terms of reference, to negotiate new tax arrangements with already existing projects. He said the PRRT should be changed significantly for future projects and it was up to parliament to tell the industry that new projects might face an overhauled PRRT. \u201cMy judgment was that changes to the design of the PRRT that impacted on existing projects ... would run the very real prospect of increasing perceptions of fiscal risk in Australia, and potentially could deter future investments,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cI would place a high weight on avoiding policy changes that could potentially significantly damage Australia\u2019s attractiveness as an investment location.\u201d Callaghan, a former Treasury official and the former chief of staff to Peter Costello, had been asked to appear before a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance on Monday to explain why he thought the PRRT did not need a significant overhaul for existing projects. He was unable to appear in person in Canberra so participated over the phone. He also cut short his scheduled time to give evidence because he had a plane to catch. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson later asked a Treasury official: \u201cWhat did it cost us to do the Callaghan review? ... Do you know what Mr Callaghan\u2019s fees were? \u201cI just wanted to express my disappointment that Mr Callaghan wasn\u2019t able to be here for the whole hour and half today, considering taxpayers funded this report and it\u2019s a very important subject, and we had scheduled this [hearing] for some time.\u201d Callaghan\u2019s review of the PRRT, released in April, found Australians were not necessarily being unfairly compensated for the exploitation of their natural resources under the PRRT regime. It suggested taking a softly-softly approach to reform the tax, despite hearing evidence during inquiries that some gas projects might never pay PRRT thanks to high \u201cuplift rates\u201d for deductions that compound over the life of the projects. He also heard evidence from tax experts that the tax had failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue from existing projects. It prompted the Labor senators Sam Dastyari and Jenny McAllister to complain that they did not understand how Callaghan arrived at his conclusions, given he admitted in his report that some gas projects may never pay PRRT. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said last week that the Turnbull government accepted in-principle the 12 recommendations from Callaghan\u2019s review. He released a consultation paper on Friday \u2013 three days before this week\u2019s public hearing \u2013 suggesting ways the PRRT could be improved for future projects only. Callaghan said the Treasury discussion paper would kickstart a process that allowed the government to introduce beneficial changes. \u201cWhat is required ... and I suppose this is the way it\u2019s going with the Treasury discussion paper, the government has to say, \u2018We are going to have a new tax regime for the PRRT ... and this is what it should be seeking to achieve and we are going to consult with you about what that new regime should be,\u2019 \u201d he said.",
