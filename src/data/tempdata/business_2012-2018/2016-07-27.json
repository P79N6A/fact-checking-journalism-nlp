      "bodyText": "British car manufacturing hit a 16-year high in the first half of 2016, but the industry says future growth, jobs and investment are at risk following the Brexit vote. Almost 900,000 cars rolled off production lines at UK factories in the first six months of the year, 13% more than the same period in 2015. It was the best half-year performance since 2000, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), as billions of pounds of earlier investment in new models came to fruition. About 78% of the cars built in UK factories in the first half-year were destined for other countries, with the EU the biggest market. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said the outlook for UK car manufacturing was uncertain now that Britain had opted to pursue a future outside the EU. \u201cThe latest increase in production output is the result of investment decisions made over a number of years, well before the referendum was even a prospect. \u201cThese decisions were based on many factors but primarily on tariff-free access to the single market, economic stability and record levels of productivity from a highly skilled workforce. To ensure the sector\u2019s continued growth, and with it the thousands of jobs it supports, these must be priorities in future negotiations.\u201d The SMMT said a survey of its members \u2013 which include major car manufacturers such as Nissan, Toyota and Mini as well as smaller businesses \u2013 showed companies were worried about Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of Europe following the Brexit vote. About 60% of parts supplied for cars built in the UK are imported, mainly from the continent. Of the members the SMMT surveyed, 57% believed Brexit would have a negative impact on their business. The biggest concern was the potential negative impact of tariffs, custom charges and other barriers between the UK and the EU single market. Other major concerns included a loss of access to EU trade deals, having no say in \u2013 but being bound by \u2013 regulations in their biggest export market, and the loss of access to skilled workers from within the EU. \u201cThe UK automotive manufacturing sector has grown dramatically over the past few years and now employs 169,000 people, including many skilled EU nationals recruited to fill vacancies which the local labour force could not meet. The lack of certainty regarding the future status of these workers in the UK was cited frequently as a concern,\u201d the SMMT said. The British car industry has enjoyed a prolonged period of growth. Last month alone, car production rose by 10.4% to almost 159,000 vehicles, the highest number for June since 1998. Sales of new cars in the UK fell for only the second time in more than four years in June, in a sign that British consumers were feeling less confident about spending money on big items.",

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve decided to hold steady and not raise US interest rates for at least another two months at its latest meeting, arguing that near-term risks to the US economy have diminished. This is the fifth time that the Fed has decided against raising interest rates since December, when it raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. Federal interest rates remain unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5%. \u201cWe continue to expect the next tightening move to be in December. That said, the wording does not preclude a move in September; a lot can happen in eight weeks,\u201d Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to investors. The only dissenting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee, was Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed. George has been advocating for higher interest rates for a some time, but voted to keep them unchanged in June after a disappointing jobs report found that just 38,000 jobs were created in May. That number was later revised to 11,000. \u201cJob gains were strong in June following weak growth in May. On balance, payrolls and other labor market indicators point to some increase in labor utilization in recent months,\u201d the US central bank said in a statement. The news came as little surprise. Two different polls \u2013 one by Reuters and another by Wall Street Journal \u2013 found that economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady until after the election. The next rate hike is expected in December, if at all. \u201cRate normalization has fallen down the Fed priority list and will remain there until the dust is well settled on the financial markets and the economy,\u201d Jefferies economists predicted in a note last week. But the decision to hold off on rates once more marks a dramatic shift in the Fed\u2019s thinking from the start of the year. Originally, the Fed was expected to raise rates four times this year. In addition to low inflation, the Fed said another reason for holding off on raising interest rates was \u201csoft\u201d business investment. \u201cDespite healthy corporate balance sheets and ample access to cash, businesses remain hesitant to invest in equipment, structures and high-wage, full-time employees. The longer this trend continues, the more difficult it will be for the US economy to expand beyond this stagnant 2% growth rate and the more challenging it will be for the Fed to justify a further adjustment to policy,\u201d pointed out Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at investment banking firm Stifel. \u201cAfter all, without business investment, job creation and by extension income growth and consumer spending will remain restrained.\u201d Second quarter earnings by companies like Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle have indicated a decrease in spending by US consumers. Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald\u2019s, said that consumers were spending less because they feel uncertain about their financial stability and the upcoming presidential election. The Fed meets three more times this year \u2013 in September, November and December. The next meeting will take place on 20-21 September.",

      "bodyText": "As Sir Philip Green attempts to \u201csort\u201d the deficit in BHS\u2019s pension funds by taking his gin palace on a tour of the Mediterranean, let\u2019s not forget the minor players in the debacle. Take accountancy firm Grant Thornton, which advised Dominic Chappell, the \u201cwholly unsuitable\u201d three-time bankrupt who bought the business. The two committees of MPs were scathing in their assessment of the roles played by Grant Thornton and fellow adviser Olswang, a legal firm. These City outfits were \u201cincreasingly aware\u201d of the \u201cmanifold weaknesses\u201d of Chappell\u2019s acquisition vehicle, yet were \u201ccontent to take generous fees and lend both their names and their reputations to the deal\u201d. We don\u2019t know how generous those fees were, because neither firm will say. Indeed, they pleaded client confidentiality on several matters. The MPs took a dim view of this, too. The firms \u201cadopted a very wide interpretation of confidentiality\u201d and \u201csheltered behind these duties when their interests \u2013 and that of the public \u2013 would have been better served by full and frank disclosure to legitimate parliamentary scrutiny\u201d. Presented with such strong criticisms, you might expect Grant Thornton, in particular, to engage in some self-examination. The firm, after all, aspires to be grander than a mere bean-counter. Sacha Romanovitch, the new chief executive, is on a mission to display Grant Thornton\u2019s cuddly, inclusive side. In Director magazine in April, she described her \u201cvibrant economy\u201d initiative: \u201cAll of us in the UK, if we\u2019re going to thrive, and pass on something better to the next generation, we\u2019ve all got a responsibility to step up and drive the things that are going to create growth.\u201d Jolly nice, but how about stepping up and driving a review of the type of clients Grant Thornton is prepared to accept? A rethink on confidentiality policies would also be useful to avoid coming across as evasive in front of MPs. Neither thought was mentioned in the firm\u2019s brief and defensive response to the committees\u2019 report. Instead, Grant Thornton pleaded that it was only doing \u201cfinancial due diligence\u201d for Chappell\u2019s crew in the pre-acquisition period. Its post-deal consultancy work was undertaken because it believed it had \u201cexperience of real value to share with BHS and its management\u201d. There was no admission that Grant Thornton lost its moral compass or has lessons to learn. Note to Ms Romanovitch: if you really want to pass on something better to the next generation, try addressing the criticisms of the current generation of MPs. Skirting around the issue of executive pay Here\u2019s a gift for Theresa May as she attempts to solve the troubling question of executive pay: a 10-point plan. What\u2019s more, it comes from a panel assembled by the Investment Association, a body that carries clout because its members manage \u00a35.5tn in assets. Better still, the chair of the panel is Nigel Wilson, who in his day job as chief executive of Legal &amp; General has established a reputation as a free-thinker who doesn\u2019t tolerate waffle. But, oh dear, Wilson has become a pussycat. About eight of the 10 points are utterly mundane. \u201cRemuneration committees need to exercise independent judgment and not be overreliant on their remuneration consultants,\u201d reads one recommendation. Well, yes, but that means simply that non-executive directors should do what they are paid to do and make up their own minds. It doesn\u2019t address a broader governance problem identified by the prime minister: that, in practice, non-executives \u201care drawn from the same narrow social and professional circles as the executive team and \u2013 as we have seen time and time again \u2013 the scrutiny they provide is just not good enough\u201d. This diagnosis led May to propose putting employee and consumer representatives on boards. We wait to see if she is serious. But, if you\u2019re opining on pay and name-checking May in your introduction, surely you are obliged to address her big idea. Wilson\u2019s panel didn\u2019t. It also sidestepped the issue of the sheer size of pay packets at some FTSE 100 companies. \u201cThe working group does not feel it is their role to recommend absolute levels of remuneration; this is a matter for individual boards.\u201d So, was it OK for BP to pay its chief executive Bob Dudley \u00a314m despite the objections of shareholders expressed in an advisory vote? It\u2019s hard to tell, because the panel couldn\u2019t even make up its mind on binding votes. \u201cWe need to restore public confidence in executive pay,\u201d declared Wilson at the launch of the report. You won\u2019t succeed with a 10-point plan as limp as this one. Returning to Europe \u2013 in a manner of speaking Welcome to Standard Chartered, Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, formerly deputy governor of the Spanish central bank and a departmental head at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. But are you sure you\u2019ve chosen the right bank to chair? The press release from the IMF says you want to \u201creturn to Europe for family reasons\u201d. Standard Chartered\u2019s operations in Europe are tiny. For \u00a31.25m a year, the chairman is expected to spend a lot of time hob-nobbing with important folk in China, India and Africa.",

The firms \u201cadopted a very wide interpretation of confidentiality\u201d and \u201csheltered behind these duties when their interests \u2013 and that of the public \u2013 would have been better served by full and frank disclosure to legitimate parliamentary scrutiny\u201d.</p> <p>Presented with such strong criticisms, you might expect Grant Thornton, in particular, to engage in some self-examination. The firm, after all, aspires to be grander than a mere bean-counter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/12/bhs-philip-green-parliamentary-committee-safeguards\">Sacha Romanovitch</a>, the new chief executive, is on a mission to display Grant Thornton\u2019s cuddly, inclusive side.</p> <p>In Director magazine in April, she described her \u201cvibrant economy\u201d initiative: \u201cAll of us in the UK, if we\u2019re going to thrive, and pass on something better to the next generation, we\u2019ve all got a responsibility to step up and drive the things that are going to create growth.\u201d</p> <p>Jolly nice, but how about stepping up and driving a review of the type of clients Grant Thornton is prepared to accept? A rethink on confidentiality policies would also be useful to avoid coming across as evasive in front of MPs.</p> <p>Neither thought was mentioned in the firm\u2019s brief and defensive response to the committees\u2019 report. Instead, Grant Thornton pleaded that it was only doing \u201cfinancial due diligence\u201d for Chappell\u2019s crew in the pre-acquisition period. Its post-deal consultancy work was undertaken because it believed it had \u201cexperience of real value to share with BHS and its management\u201d. There was no admission that Grant Thornton lost its moral compass or has lessons to learn.</p> <p>Note to Ms Romanovitch: if you really want to pass on something better to the next generation, try addressing the criticisms of the current generation of MPs.</p> <h2>Skirting around the issue of executive pay</h2> <p>Here\u2019s a gift for Theresa May as she attempts to solve the troubling question of executive pay: a 10-point plan. What\u2019s more, it comes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/executive-pay-city-report-stops-short-of-backing-binding-shareholder-votes\">a panel assembled by the Investment Association</a>, a body that carries clout because its members manage \u00a35.5tn in assets. Better still, the chair of the panel is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2016/may/25/legal-general-understates-chief-executives-pay-in-annual-report\">Nigel Wilson</a>, who in his day job as chief executive of Legal &amp; General has established a reputation as a free-thinker who doesn\u2019t tolerate waffle.<br></p> <p>But, oh dear, Wilson has become a pussycat. About eight of the 10 points are utterly mundane. \u201cRemuneration committees need to exercise independent judgment and not be overreliant on their remuneration consultants,\u201d reads one recommendation.</p> <p>Well, yes, but that means simply that non-executive directors should do what they are paid to do and make up their own minds. It doesn\u2019t address a broader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-to-call-for-unity-equality-and-successful-exit-from-eu\">governance problem identified by the prime minister</a>: that, in practice, non-executives \u201care drawn from the same narrow social and professional circles as the executive team and \u2013 as we have seen time and time again \u2013 the scrutiny they provide is just not good enough\u201d.</p> <p>This diagnosis led May to propose putting employee and consumer representatives on boards. We wait to see if she is serious. But, if you\u2019re opining on pay and name-checking May in your introduction, surely you are obliged to address her big idea. Wilson\u2019s panel didn\u2019t.</p> <p>It also sidestepped the issue of the sheer size of pay packets at some FTSE 100 companies. \u201cThe working group does not feel it is their role to recommend absolute levels of remuneration; this is a matter for individual boards.\u201d So, was it OK for BP to pay its chief executive Bob Dudley \u00a314m despite the objections of shareholders expressed in an advisory vote? It\u2019s hard to tell, because the panel couldn\u2019t even make up its mind on binding votes.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to restore public confidence in executive pay,\u201d declared Wilson at the launch of the report. You won\u2019t succeed with a 10-point plan as limp as this one.</p> <h2>Returning to Europe \u2013 in a manner of speaking</h2> <p>Welcome to Standard Chartered, Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, formerly deputy governor of the Spanish central bank and a departmental head at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. But are you sure you\u2019ve chosen the right bank to chair?<br></p> <p>The press release from the IMF says you want to \u201creturn to Europe for family reasons\u201d. Standard Chartered\u2019s operations in Europe are tiny. For \u00a31.25m a year, the chairman is expected to spend a lot of time hob-nobbing with important folk in China, India and Africa.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Santander has admitted it would be able to charge some customers to hold their deposits if interest rates drop below zero, without having to send letters warning them of the possibility in the way that Royal Bank of Scotland has. The UK arm of the Spanish bank made clear that it did not intend to start implementing charges for savers, but already had the necessary \u201cterms and conditions\u201d in place to do so. RBS, and its NatWest arm, faced criticism after sending letters to small businesses warning them that they could face charges for deposits. \u201cGlobal interest rates remain at very low levels and in some markets are currently negative. Dependent on future market conditions, this could result in us charging interest on credit balances,\u201d customers were warned. The move by RBS, which is 73% owned by taxpayers, kickstarted a debate about the impact on banks and their customers from low interest rates, at a time when the major high street banks are preparing to report their results for the first time since the vote to leave the EU. The uncertainty created by the Brexit vote prompted Bank of England governor Mark Carney to warn of monetary easing over the summer, while a cut from the 0.5% historic low in UK interest rates is expected on 4 August. As the UK arm of Santander reported a 16% rise in first-half profits to \u00a31.1bn on Wednesday, chief executive Nathan Bostock said that if the bank wanted to charge larger corporate customers for deposits, new terms and conditions would be needed. But he added: \u201cWe have no current plans to charge negative interest rates.\u201d A spokesperson for Santander UK said: \u201cOur terms and conditions for personal and small business customers would already allow us to charge to hold deposits. However, we have no plans to do so.\u201d Asked about whether a cut to the 3% savings rate was planned for its popular 123 current account \u2013 advertised by Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill \u2013 Bostock said the rates were \u201ccontinually under review\u201d. Any change would be announced to customers with 60 days\u2019 notice, he added. The chief executive appeared to play down speculation that the bank was interested in buying the 300 branches being put up for sale by Royal Bank of Scotland under the Williams &amp; Glyn brand. \u201cI can only say from our point of view we are focused on organic growth,\u201d said Bostock, who joined Santander in 2014 from RBS where he was finance director. On Thursday, Lloyds Banking Group is expected to set out how it intends to rein in costs in response to pressure on its profit margins caused by a rate cut, amid expectations from analysts that this will lead to further job cuts and branch closures. Lloyds admitted in February that it was already ahead of schedule in a plan to cut costs by \u00a31bn over the three years to 2017 by cutting 9,000 jobs and closing 200 branches. Some 7,300 roles have already been lost and 150 branches shut, and analysts have said that more need to go to cope with sustained low interest rates.",

      "bodyText": "London-based brewer SABMiller has paused integration planning with Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev while it reviews its US suitor\u2019s improved takeover offer. AB InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewing company, raised its offer for SABMiller on Tuesday, to \u00a345 a share from the \u00a344 announced in November. The revised offer, which AB InBev described as final, values the FTSE 100 firm at \u00a379bn, up from \u00a371bn. The improved offer came after a sharp decline in the value of the pound since Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in late June. Sterling has tumbled 13% against the dollar. The two companies agreed a deal in November after months of negotiations. Since then, they have been drawing up plans how to integrate the two businesses, in the areas of finance, IT and procurement. It is understood that work has been halted while SABMiller\u2019s board reviews the revised offer. The brewer\u2019s chairman, Jan du Plessis, has been clear that the board wants to listen to the views of shareholders before making a decision. The merger would create a brewing giant that supplies nearly a third of the world\u2019s beer and would be the biggest foreign takeover of a British company. SABMiller owns beer brands including Fosters, Miller Genuine Draft, Castle Lager and Pilsner Urquell; while AB InBev also makes Stella Artois, Corona, Beck\u2019s and Hoegaarden. SABMiller confirmed that Du Plessis had a telephone conversation with his counterpart at AB InBev, Olivier Goudet, last Friday to discuss the terms agreed in November in light of the pound\u2019s tumble. There was no discussion or agreement about the revised offer, however. A number of activist shareholders, such as hedge funds Elliott Capital Advisors and The Children\u2019s Investment Fund, have been putting pressure on SABMiller to seek better terms. AB InBev has also amended the terms of its share-and-cash alternative to appeal to SABMiller\u2019s two biggest shareholders, tobacco firm Altria and Bevco, controlled by Colombia\u2019s Santo Domingo family, which together own 40% of SAB. The cash element has been increased to \u00a34.66 from \u00a33.78. Aberdeen Asset Management, a major SABMiller shareholder, declared the new terms \u201cunacceptable\u201d, arguing they both undervalued the company and continued to favour the company\u2019s two major shareholders. The cash-and-shares alternative is worth \u00a351.14 to those willing to hold AB InBev shares for five years, but many investors cannot accept such lock-ups. SABMiller has asked Centerview Partners to provide additional financial advice alongside its existing advisers. The brewer said on Tuesday: \u201cThe board will continue to consult with shareholders and will meet in due course formally to review, having regard to all facts and circumstances, the revised offer, and a further announcement will be made thereafter.\u201d The deal still needs to be cleared by anti-trust regulators around the world. In April, AB InBev agreed to sell SABMiller brands Peroni and Grolsch to Japanese brewer Asahi for \u20ac2.55bn (\u00a32.13bn), along with London\u2019s Meantime brewery, to help ease regulatory concerns over the merger. The deal is dependent on the completion of the SABMiller takeover. Asahi\u2019s offer includes the Peroni, Grolsch and Meantime brands, as well as SABMiller\u2019s Italian, Dutch and British operations that make and distribute the brands. It also includes the global rights to the Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime brands, except in the US.",

      "bodyText": "The co-author of a parliamentary report into the demise of BHS has called on the Serious Fraud Office to launch a formal inquiry into the actions of the department store chain\u2019s former owners. MP Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, has written to the head of the SFO asking the organisation to initiate an inquiry into whether Sir Philip Green or Dominic Chappell had broken the law. His letter comes after a joint report published on Monday by Field\u2019s committee and the business innovation and skills select committee concluded that Green had \u201csystematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS\u201d. All remaining BHS stores are expected to close by the end of August with the loss of 11,000 jobs after the business went into administration in April, 13 months after Green sold it to the former bankrupt Chappell for \u00a31. The retirement savings of 22,000 current and former workers have also been hit as the firm\u2019s pension fund was left with a deficit of \u00a3571m. In his letter to the SFO\u2019s director, David Green, Field wrote that \u201cin the light of the extraordinary evidence\u201d received by both committees, the investigatory body should examine whether money was \u201cmoved in such a way as to attempt to mislead people into believing Mr Chappell was a credible buyer for BHS\u201d. The SFO has previously confirmed receipt of material relating to BHS which it is reviewing. It has not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. A SFO spokesperson said: \u201cIf the director considers there are reasonable grounds to suspect serious or complex fraud which meets his criteria, he will open a criminal investigation.\u201d The SFO is a specialist prosecuting authority that only tackles the top level of serious or complex fraud, bribery and corruption. When deciding whether to launch an inquiry, it considers whether any apparent criminal action \u201cundermines UK PLC commercial or financial interests in general and in the City of London in particular\u201d. In weighing up whether to launch a formal investigation, it will also consider whether there is a public interest dimension and whether economic harm might be caused. MPs found that Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions failed a number of tests set by Green\u2019s retail business to determine his credibility. Nonetheless, Green arranged \u00a325m in financial assistance for Retail Acquisitions to help smooth through the deal. He also helped Retail Acquisitions with a \u00a310m contribution linked to a property deal, according to the parliamentary report. MPs concluded: \u201cSir Philip attempted to make good Retail Acquisitions\u2019 financial inadequacies to facilitate the sale. He was both sides of the deal.\u201d Field told the Guardian that it was not clear why Green had gone to such lengths to assist Chappell. He said the SFO should carry out a thorough investigation to reassure the public that \u201cno stone had been left unturned and nothing improper found\u201d in relation to BHS. Green declined to comment on Field\u2019s letter, but has previously said he believed the MPs\u2019 report was the \u201cpredetermined and inaccurate output of a biased and unfair process\u201d. Chappell told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m sure if the SFO had concerns they would be looking into it. I am totally of the belief that everything we did was accurate and correct.\u201d The former BHS boss said he was meeting his lawyers and planned a full response to the MPs\u2019 report, but that it might take \u201ca few weeks.\u201d Field\u2019s letter comes after Green threatened legal action against him over his comments to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the retail tycoon was the principal character in the collapse of BHS and \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d. Green\u2019s legal representatives say the MP\u2019s statements, which refer to the former publisher of the Daily Mirror who had plundered the company\u2019s pension fund, are defamatory and false. Green is also threatening legal action against Chappell and the other members of Retail Acquisitions. The billionaire, who controls a string of high street chains including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, alleges that Retail Acquisitions misused BHS funds and that Chappell falsely represented his business credentials. The report by MPs has fuelled calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. It found the former owner of the chain had \u201csystematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Once labelled \u201cKing Coal\u201d, Richard Budge, who has died aged 69 of prostate cancer, was the determinedly optimistic businessman who, in 1994, persuaded the Conservative government to sell the bulk of the British coalmining industry to his eponymous company, RJB Mining. But after some initial success, he found himself ejected from his faltering enterprise and his subsequent attempts to use untried technology to make a success of a single pit led to repeated disappointment and eventual bankruptcy. A larger than life character, always with a new plan up his sleeve, Budge seemed to have more in common with the dealmaking building industry from which he sprang than with the weighty calculation of the nationalised coal industry, to which he came as a contractor. But he was difficult to categorise; he showed early promise as an artist, raced classic sports cars successfully and demonstrated genuine warmth for the miners he employed. Budge was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, to Frederick, a housebuilder, and his wife, Charlotte. At Boston grammar school he discovered a profitable sideline in painting landscapes and a liking for the surrealists. But a fine arts course at Manchester University lasted only a few months before his commercial ambitions won out, and he joined his elder brother Tony\u2019s new contracting firm, AF Budge, in 1966. He started as a trainee, learning from the ground up before becoming a supervisor, then a site manager and contracts manager, working on roadbuilding projects. He married his teenage sweetheart, Rosalind White, in 1968. In 1974 he became the managing director of Budge Mining, the group\u2019s opencast coalmining arm, set up originally to make use of its construction machinery in winter. Sixteen years later the mining operation was producing a third of British Coal\u2019s opencast output and Budge raised \u00a3102m to buy it out from his brother. He relaunched in 1993 with a stockmarket float and a new name, RJB Mining, after his own initials. A year later he successfully bid for three of the five parts of nationalised British Coal offered for sale by the government \u2013 the complete English industry, which comprised 17 pits plus land and opencast interests. It was a remarkable success for a relatively small-time businessman. Budge had been active in pressuring the government for a sale, arguing to Michael Heseltine at the Department of Trade and Industry that additional markets could be found for the industry\u2019s huge stockpiles. The government, weary of constant battles over pit closures, seized the opportunity to give private industry its chance. RJB\u2019s \u00a3815m bid was \u00a3100m more than its nearest rival. But Budge faced questions both about whether he had overborrowed and paid too much or alternatively whether the government had let him have the industry on the cheap. His personal suitability was questioned as it emerged that his brother\u2019s firm had gone into receivership owing \u00a365m 10 months after Richard had resigned in 1992. The receivers found it had also invested in yachts, racehorses and armaments. Richard paid back \u00a3325,000 for loans not properly recorded. RJB Mining had paid private Budge companies for air services and hospitality shooting days. Investment managers complained about his proposed \u00a3400,000-a-year salary and it was cut to \u00a3225,000. Typically he shrugged it off. Initially things went well. Profits were \u00a3285m in the first year and the money borrowed for the purchase was paid off in 18 months. Budge built a relationship with the miners and reprieved three pits on the government closure list. A colleague commented that he was never so happy as underground talking to the men. A union representative described him as \u201chaving coal running through his veins\u201d. He supported coalfield charities including the Grimethorpe Colliery Band and was a concerned chairman of the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation. But the realities of an overstocked industry producing at above-world prices and growing environmental regulation soon made themselves felt. Demand fell. Privatisation had been sweetened by an agreement with electricity generators to take more coal, but now the government was unwilling to provide further assistance. In 2001 Budge was sacked as chief executive of RJB Mining with a \u00a31m payoff, apparently after refusing to take sufficiently drastic action to stem losses. The company was renamed UK Coal. But Budge continued his love affair with coal and his belief in potential profits by purchasing and reopening Hatfield colliery near Doncaster, with the intention of building the UK\u2019s first clean coal power station next door using unproved technology. He failed to get government funding and the business collapsed in 2003, only to be revived by the resourceful Budge in 2007 when he secured \u00a4183m (\u00a3154m) of funding from the EU and brought in Russia\u2019s second largest coalmining company as a partner. This time the plan was for carbon capture \u2013 capturing power station emissions and burying them in cavities under the North Sea. But with growing government doubts about the technology, the business went into administration in 2010, and in 2013 Budge was declared bankrupt. UK Coal continued until a restructuring in 2014. Its last deep mine, Kellingley, at Beal in North Yorkshire, closed in December 2015. Budge\u2019s last years were clouded by illness after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007, and by the fallout from the bankruptcy, which caused him to resign a series of official and trustee positions. But in April this year he was elected an honorary liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Fuellers for his \u201clifetime contribution to the coal industry\u201d. He is survived by Rosalind and their two sons, Kurt and Grant. \u2022 Richard John Budge, businessman, born 19 April 1947; died 18 July 2016",

Directors of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies have spent more than \u00a318.5m buying shares in their own firms since the 23 June vote, according to data compiled for FT Money by the broker Olivetree Financial. \u201cThis is the largest amount of individual director buys in at least 10 years,\u201d Olivetree said. The sectors that were hardest hit by the news of Brexit \u2013 banks, housebuilders, retailers and travel companies \u2013 saw the biggest director purchases. Many boardroom directors have done well out of these deals as stock markets bounced back following days of dramatic falls when tens of billions of pounds were wiped off the London stock market. The biggest share buys came in late June and early July. The largest individual transaction in the FTSE 100 was made by Hikma Pharmaceuticals\u2019 founding Darwazah family, which bought \u00a33.3m of shares in the Jordan-based drugmaker the day after the Brexit vote.

      "bodyText": "The promise of extra financial stimulus from the Japanese government set a positive tone at the start of the day, and that mostly continued into the close. Better than expected UK economic growth in the second quarter also helped lift the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 - the latter briefly regaining the level it was at before the Brexit vote. But European markets slipped back from their highs as Wall Street went into reverse after an early rise, with sentiment undermined by a sharper than expected rise in crude oil stocks. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.40 points or 0.39% higher at 6750.43, its best level since 5 August 2015 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.7% to 10,319.55 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.19% to 4446.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.99% better at 16,863.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.18% at 8661.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 569.16 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 31 points or 0.17% ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s Reuters on the rise in US crude oil stocks: Oil prices tumbled more than 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting a two-month low, after the U.S. government reported a surprise build in crude and gasoline inventories during the peak summer driving season. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude stockpiles rose 1.7 million barrels, against analysts\u2019 forecasts for a drawdown of 2.3 million barrels. \u201cA drop in refinery runs at the peak of summer driving season indicate refiners are dialing back amid faltering profit margins,\u201d said Matt Smith, analyst at New York-based oil cargoes tracker Clipperdata. Refinery crude runs fell 277,000 barrels per day last week as utilization rates fell 0.8 percentage point to 92.4 percent of capacity, EIA data showed. Oil prices are under pressure again after new figures showing a surprise increase in US crude stocks. The Energy Information Administration said crude oil stocks rose by 1.67m barrels last week to 521.1m, rather than the 2m fall which had been expected. US markets are off to a positive start, lifted by better than expected results from Apple and ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 56 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.16% and Nasdaq is 0.63% better. Earlier in the US came some evidence of economic weakness, ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Orders for durable goods - long lasting items ranging from toasters to aircraft - fell 4% month on month in June, the biggest drop since August 2014. May\u2019s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor. More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though remained negative. We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct. This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening. The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn. The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best since 20 July 2015. Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result. The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it reached on the day of the referendum. A quick recap. Fears that Britain\u2019s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts. UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest jump in industrial output since 1999. That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain\u2019s economy is 7.7% larger than before the 2008 crash. Details: Services: grew by 0.5% Industrial production: grew by 2.1% Manufacturing: grew by 1.8% Construction: shrank by 0.4% Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared that the figures show Britain\u2019s economic fundamentals are robust, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty. He can also point to plans to invest more than \u00a3300m in London City Airport. But many economists have warned that the economy is probably now shrinking. It could even fall into recession, if Britain gets a serious bout of Brexit blues. There\u2019s also concern that most of the growth occurred in April, before dropping off in May. The report has little detail on how the economy fared in the immediate run-up to the June 23 referendum either. Worryingly, UK retail sales have tumbled at the fastest rate since January 2012 this month. And Ireland\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017, due to the impact caused by the EU referendum vote. But City traders are in upbeat move, sending the FTSE up by 49 points to 6773 -- a new 11-month high. They\u2019re expecting a fresh bout of stimulus from the Bank of Japan soon, followed by a UK interest rate cut next week. Fast food chain McDonalds has just announced plans to hire thousands more workers in the UK; suggesting it is also confident about future prospects. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that Philip Hammond knows full well that Britain\u2019s economy is entering turbulent times: He writes: The Brexit result was unexpected and has, judging by the surveys since, affected the outlook for both the services and manufacturing sectors. Construction was the one sector that was already struggling in the buildup to the vote and is likely to face an even tougher winter than the rest of the economy. Growth is going to slow down markedly from now on. The length and depth of that slowdown will depend on how quickly businesses regain their equilibrium. The Bank of England knows that, which is why a big package of measures designed to boost confidence will be announced next week. More here: Here\u2019s more City reaction to the growth figures. Bad news: UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest pace in over four years in July this month. The latest survey, from the CBI, bolsters concerns that the economy is weakening fast - unravelling the solid growth in the last quarter. Some 24% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in July compared with a year earlier, while 38% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -14%. That\u2019s the weakest reading since January 2012. The CBI says: Within retail, sales by grocers, and furniture and carpets stores were the main drivers of the drop in overall volumes. But some sectors bucked the trend, with non-specialised department stores and retailers of footwear and leather goods reporting higher volumes. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says it\u2019s worrying news: Ireland\u2019s Central Bank has downgraded its forecasts for GDP growth for 2016 and 2017 citing the adverse affect of Brexit on the economy. Britain is Ireland\u2019s biggest export partner while Ireland is Britain\u2019s fifth biggest trading partner with \u20ac1.5bn in transactions a week. The Central Bank said it believed the Irish economy, which is one of the fastest growing in Europe, would continue to grow but that Brexit was negative for the economy. It cut its projections for growth in 2016 by 0.2% to 4.9% GDP growth. It also slashed 0.6% off its 2017 growth forecasts, down to 3.6%. It said it expected a prolonged period of uncertainty while the UK was negotiating its Brexit package which would damage investor confidence. In a statement Ireland\u2019s Central Bank chief economist, Gabriel Fagan, said while the economy\u2019s reliance on the British export market had weakened over recent decades. However... \u201cSome sectors, including agri-food, clothing, footwear and tourism continue to have a relatively high dependency on exports to the UK and, consequently, could be affected disproportionately\u201d. Tourism is expected to take a particular hit because of the weakened pound. Among Ireland\u2019s top 10 exports to Britain are food and drink and packaged medicines while the UK\u2019s exports to Britain including gas, cars and pharmaceuticals. Edgar Morganrath, associate research professor at Dublin\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute has said that custom paperwork could add three to four per cent on costs for exporters to the UK, in line with additional costs of exporting to non-EU territories including US and Canada. Here\u2019s the full report Britain\u2019s growth since the crisis is less impressive once you adjust for the increase in population: On a per-capita basis, the economy is only 1.3% bigger than in 2008, not the 7.7% headline increase report today. Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation shows how this is much worse than in previous recessions: Andy Bruce of Reuters has highlighted how April provided the bulk of the growth in the last quarter: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s growth figures: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that Britain\u2019s economy is entering a period of weak growth, despite the forecast-beating performance in the last quarter: \u201cThe pick up in growth in the UK in the second quarter is consistent with other data - for employment, retail sales and yesterday\u2019s CBI survey of manufacturers. \u201cHowever, we also know that the EU Referendum result has sent a shockwave through the business world and we should expect much slower growth this quarter - the main scenario in our latest PwC Economic Outlook suggests growth slowing to around 1.6% this year. 2017 is likely to see even more sluggish growth - our central view is for GDP to increase by just 0.6% next year. Once upon a time, Britain\u2019s chancellor would have celebrated today\u2019s growth figures by donning a florescent jacket and building a wall. But Philip Hammond doesn\u2019t shares George Osborne\u2019s love of hard hats; so he\u2019s decamped to London City Airport this morning. He\u2019s there to announce a \u00a3344m expansion programme for the airport, meaning more space for planes and an enlarged terminal to house extra passengers. Today\u2019s report shows that \u201cdire predictions\u201d that the economy would grind to a halt before the EU referendum were false, says Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank. In actuality, growth accelerated as business raced ahead of the uncertain vote (lead by industrial output). This unexpected read indicates that the UK economy was in stronger position ahead of the vote then originally forecasted. But Rosenstreich also fears Britain could now fall into recession: However, this preliminary estimate does not capture the post referendum fallout, which is likely to drive Q3 lower, possibly into recession. We remain bearish on the British pound as the UK economy will clearly go through a period of economic adjustment and likely BoE interest rate cuts.\u201d One decent quarter doesn\u2019t mean Britain\u2019s industrial sector has roared back, points out Ben Chu of the Independent: The chancellor has been tweeting: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also fears that the UK will contract following the Brexit vote, but might avoid a full-blown recession. He points out that today\u2019s strong growth reading is \u201calmost entirely due to the exceptional April performance\u201d [see earlier graph] That means the economy was probably weakening in June. \u201cGDP growth in Q2 looks likely to represent one last hurrah for the economy before it enters a softer and more turbulent period. The lack of momentum as the economy entered Q3 means that the chances of a negative reading for the current quarter are relatively high. However, our view remains that the extent to which the economy will slow in the second half of the year has been overplayed and that the UK may avoid a technical recession.\u201d Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, is encouraged by the 2.1% surge in UK industrial output: The UK economy shook off pre-referendum nerves to grow by a better-than-expected 0.6% in the second quarter, with a notably strong performance from the manufacturing sector. It\u2019s always difficult to tell where you\u2019re going by looking in the rear-view mirror, and as such today\u2019s GDP figures can\u2019t be taken as evidence of the current climate. However, what they do show is an absence of pre-Brexit concerns, meaning that if the forecast downturn does materialise, at least we start from a position of relative strength. However... Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons it won\u2019t last..... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, fears that Britain\u2019s economy will shrink in the current quarter, despite a better performance than expected in the last three months. He says: Preliminary GDP figures are always heavily caveated; less than 50% of the survey data is in and will likely over-represent the beginning of the quarter compared to the end..... \u201cUnfortunately we believe the overall UK economic picture is one of recession at the moment and while it is still too early to forecast we are looking for Q3 GDP to fall by anywhere 0.1-0.4%. Today\u2019s data will limit calls that the UK was slowing into the vote however.\u201d Today\u2019s GDP report is mainly based on data from April and May, as it\u2019s too early to have a full picture of the economy in June. So if Britain did suffer a dose of Brexit angst last month, it won\u2019t appear in today\u2019s data - we\u2019ll have to wait for the second estimate of GDP in August. Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, flags up that April was a particularly strong month: Britain\u2019s carmakers and pharmaceutical firms helped to drive the economy forwards, according to Joe Grice, the Office for National Statistics\u2019 top economist. The ONS also found little sign that the EU referendum on June 23rd had hurt the economy during the last quarter. Despite the surge in industrial output last quarter, the sector is *still* smaller than before the financial crisis back in 2008. Only the services sector (which makes up 70% of the economy) is larger: Britain\u2019s economy is now 7.7% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak, in the first quarter of 2008. The 0.6% growth recorded in Q2 means the UK has been growing for the last 14 quarters: Britain\u2019s new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has welcomed the news that the UK growth rate has jumped to 0.6%. He says: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures show that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong. In the second quarter of this year our economy grew by 0.6 per cent \u2013 faster than was expected. Indeed we saw the strongest quarterly rise in production for nearly twenty years, so it is clear we enter our negotiations to leave the EU from a position of economic strength. \u201cThose negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has a very good quarter, according to today\u2019s GDP report. UK industrial output jumped by 2.1% during the April-June period, the strongest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 1999. However, the service sector slowed to 0.5% growth, down from 0.6% in Q1. And construction output shrank by 0.4%. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.2% over the last 12 months - up from 2.0% three months ago. Here we go: The UK economy expanded by 0.6% in the last three months, up from 0.4% in the January-March quarter. That\u2019s faster than expected. It suggests that the UK economy was in fairly robust shape before June\u2019s EU referendum. Lots more detail and reaction to follow! Tension is mounting in the City, as traders wait for the UK GDP data to drop in 10 minutes. The pound is weakening a little, down 0.1% against the US dollar at $1.3111. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital, explains why investors are anxious: A positive figure will add to optimism that the UK economy was robust going into the vote and therefore may weather the repercussions better than previously forecasted. However, poor figures will be a blow to already fragile and worried markets, with expectations that the Brexit decision will only exacerbate problems in an already weak economy and could see weakness in Sterling as markets contemplate the prospect of an easing package from the Bank of England. London\u2019s stock market has hit a new 11-month high this morning. The FTSE 100 has risen by 20 points to 6744, a level last seen in August 2015. Shares are rallying worldwide, after Japan\u2019s prime ministers promised a stimulus package, worth around \u00a3200bn: Encouragingly, several UK companies have told shareholders this morning that they\u2019re not suffering any serious harm from the Brexit vote. Yet, anyway. Here\u2019s Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey: One month on from the EU Referendum, current trading remains in line with normal seasonal patterns. Customer interest continues to be high, with a good level of visitors both to our developments and to our website. Challenger bank Metro says: \u201cMetro Bank is in a strong position to deal with any post European Referendum uncertainty. Since the Referendum vote we have seen no change in customer behaviour or impact on business flows.\u201d Fund manager Jupiter is also upbeat: Jupiter has continued to deliver strong investment outperformance after all fees in the first half of the year. Net flows were positive despite the market backdrop and we made further targeted investments to support our strategy of diversification by product, client type and geography which continues to deliver on behalf of our clients and shareholders. Since the end of June, we have continued to see net flows into our products. It\u2019s early days, of course - Britain hasn\u2019t even triggered Article 50 to begin the formal exit from the EU. Today\u2019s second-quarter growth figures could be a \u201clast hurrah\u201d before the Brexit vote plunges the UK into recession early next year. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward, who flags up that economists expect GDP to shrink slightly over the next six months:. So, even if the growth rate does rise to 0.5%, we should still brace for trouble ahead: Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told them: \u201cThe economy had done quite well in the run-up to the referendum, but that can turn pretty quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen consumer confidence fall very sharply and all of the survey data has just collapsed over the last month.\u201d More here: British Economy\u2019s Last Hurrah Awaited Before Brexit Growth Shock And here\u2019s what a \u2018last hurrah\u2019 looks like in practice #ouch Critics often argue that GDP is a poor measure of the health of an economy. For example, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between valuable and harmful economic output, nor does it include voluntary work or unpaid activity. It also doesn\u2019t measure economic inequality, or living standards. And we have a perfect example of that today; a survey showing that UK real wages (earnings adjusted for inflation) have shrunk by 10% since the 2007 financial crisis. That dire performance is only matched by Greece, and shows why many people have felt isolated from the recovery since the crisis. Frances O\u2019Grady of the TUC (which prepared the report) says it shows the economy is still too fragile: \u201cWages fell off the cliff after the financial crisis, and have barely begun to recover,. People cannot afford another hit to their pay packets. Working people must not foot the bill for a Brexit downturn in the way they did for the bankers\u2019 crash.\u201d Phamaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline has given the British economy a boost, by announcing a \u00a3275m investment programme to expand its UK manufacturing sites. GSK swept aside worries about the Brexit vote, declaring that it was driven to invest the money by the UK\u2019s \u201cskilled workforce and competitive tax system\u201d. The money will be spent across three GSK sites: Barnard Castle in County Durham, Montrose in Angus, and Ware in Hertfordshire. Understandably, the UK government has hailed the news - as a sign that Britain is still open for business despite voting to leave the EU. Business and Energy Secretary, Greg Clark argues: \u201cAn investment of this scale is a clear vote of confidence in Britain and underlines our position as a global business leader. GSK\u2019s recognition of our skilled workforce, world leading scientific capabilities and competitive tax environment is further proof that there really is no place better in Europe to grow a business.\u201d Good morning. Britain\u2019s economy is centre-stage today, as we await the official UK GDP figures for the second quarter of this year. That report, due at 9.30am sharp, will show how well the British economy performed in the second quarter of this year. The City consensus is that the economy grew by 0.4% between April and June, matching the fairly modest growth recorded in January to March. But some fear that the growth rate may have slowed, perhaps to 0.3%. Today\u2019s report is particularly important as it covered the period running up to the June 23 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. It should show whether the UK economy was in decent shape as the nation headed to the polling booths, or already weakening. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains why the GDP report matters: \u201cIt will tell us if the referendum gave the UK economy the jitters in the lead up to the vote. \u201cThere are several indicators which have pointed to a slowdown in economic activity as the referendum approached.\u201d The report will also show how Britain\u2019s manufacturing, services, construction and agriculture all performed during the quarter. As this chart shows, Services has provided the bulk of the growth since the financial crisis - making it more dominant than ever. It\u2019s also a busy morning for UK financial results, with housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, broadcaster ITV, challenger banks Shawbrook and Metro Bank all reporting to the City. They\u2019ll doubtless be talking Brexit today.",

May\u2019s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall.</p> <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor. </p> <p>More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though remained negative. </p> <p>We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.</p> <p>We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct.</p> <p>This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5798b3cee4b02d2223d825a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-27T13:21:03.411Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 250 regains all post-Brexit vote losses</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn.</p> <p>The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best since 20 July 2015.</p> <p>Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result.</p> <p>The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it reached on the day of the referendum.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5798ae2fe4b0e0542bbb25c5\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-27T13:13:12.978Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary: Growth beats forecasts, but....</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick recap.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80#block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80\">Fears that Britain\u2019s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts</a>.</strong></p> <p>UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest jump in industrial output since 1999.</p> <p> That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain\u2019s economy is 7.7% larger than before the 2008 crash.<br></p> <p>Details:</p> <ul> <li>Services: grew by 0.5%<br></li> <li>Industrial production: grew by 2.1%<br></li> <li>Manufacturing: grew by 1.8%<br></li> <li>Construction: shrank by 0.4%<br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d0aacf683e2d0f48ca5d684babeb760b3e1183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d0aacf683e2d0f48ca5d684babeb760b3e1183/0_0_763_546/500.jpg\" alt=\"Where the growth came from:\" width=\"500\" height=\"358\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Where the growth came from:</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9#block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9\">Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared that the figures show Britain\u2019s economic fundamentals are robust</a>, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s prime minister has responded to the shock of Brexit on the country\u2019s already struggling economy by announcing that his government will deliver an economic stimulus package worth more than \uffe528tn (\u00a3200bn). In the latest attempt to boost growth and steer the world\u2019s third largest economy away from deflation, Shinzo Abe promised a range of as yet unspecified tax and spending measures to lift the economy out of the doldrums. Abe has admitted that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU last month threatens to have a negative impact on Japan because anxious investors have been buying large quantities of yen in an attempt to find a safe haven for their cash. The rising Japanese currency risks choking off exports, leading to the continuation of a period slow growth and weak inflation that stretches back a quarter of a century. Some analysts said the lack of any detail from Abe suggested that the package would prove to be less impressive than expected when the details are published next week. Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said the emergency budget would be the biggest in Japan\u2019s history, dwarfing the support provided after the Asian financial crisis in 1998, the 2009 recession and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which killed almost 16,000 people and led to the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear plant. \u201cThe absence of a major crisis at the moment already raises some question marks on whether policymakers really will press ahead with such large amounts of spending\u201d, Thieliant said. Abe had hinted that the amount of additional public spending in the current financial year was going to be relatively small, he added. Abe announced a so-called \u201cthree arrow strategy\u201d for Japan \u2013 dubbed Abenomics \u2013 in December 2012, which included action by the Bank of Japan to increase the money supply and weaken the yen, tax cuts and public spending to boost growth, and structural reform. Since taking the helm more than three years ago, Japan\u2019s central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has overseen a huge asset-buying plan that now stands at an unprecedented \uffe580tn annually but has failed to lift inflation to the government\u2019s 2% target. The latest intervention by the prime minister came as financial markets speculated that the Bank of Japan was running out of ammunition to stimulate growth and might be forced to resort to so-called \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2013 turning on the printing presses to pay for tax cuts or higher public spending. James Smith, an economist at ING bank, said Japan could be the first country to try this radical option. Kuroda has publicly ruled out helicopter money, but is expected to come up with new initiatives for increasing the supply of credit when the Bank of Japan announces its latest policy decisions later this week. \u201cFriday\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting will surely be a bigger driver for Japan\u2019s stock market and currency over the coming weeks, as it has been in the past,\u201d Thieliant said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement reduces the chances of further monetary stimulus being introduced this week, but we still think it more likely than not.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The reaction from Philip Hammond spoke volumes. Yes, the second lord of the Treasury was pleased that UK growth in the quarter leading up to the Brexit referendum had been stronger at 0.6% than anybody had been expecting. No chancellor looks a gift horse in the mouth, and this gift was unexpectedly generous. Hammond, however, knows full well that this was likely to be the best set of GDP data for some time. When he talked about a \u201cperiod of adjustment\u201d, what he meant was that the economy is going to cool \u2013 perhaps abruptly \u2013 following the decision to leave the EU. Indeed, it took only 90 minutes for the growth figures to be put into perspective. That was how long it took for the next health check of the economy to be published. The CBI\u2019s survey of retail spending canvassed opinion after the referendum and, perhaps unsurprisingly, found consumers were reluctant to part with their cash. The City wasn\u2019t fooled by the GDP data. A brief rise in the pound quickly went into reverse on the assumption, almost certainly correct, that the welcome strength of the economy going into Brexit will have zero impact on decisions taken by the Bank of England and the Treasury over the coming months. Policymakers will treat the second quarter growth numbers as a historical curiosity, which is really what they are, given that in years to come Britain\u2019s history may be divided into the BB and AB epochs \u2013 before Brexit and after Brexit. Certain aspects of the Office for National Statistics release provide glimmers of hope that the economic fallout from Brexit might be less pronounced than feared. Industry put on its best performance in almost two decades during the second quarter and now has the added advantage of a cheaper pound to make exports more competitive. Joe Grice, the ONS\u2019s chief economist, said there was no real evidence of Brexit uncertainty affecting businesses in the second quarter. On the other hand, there are clearly reasons to be cautious. Growth was concentrated in the first month of the quarter, April, before it fell back in May. The ONS relies on forecasts to assess what was happening in June and believes the economy was flat. That suggests there was little momentum when the referendum was held. The Brexit result was unexpected and has, judging by the surveys since, affected the outlook for both the services and manufacturing sectors. Construction was the one sector that was already struggling in the buildup to the vote and is likely to face an even tougher winter than the rest of the economy. Growth is going to slow down markedly from now on. The length and depth of that slowdown will depend on how quickly businesses regain their equilibrium. The Bank of England knows that, which is why a big package of measures designed to boost confidence will be announced next week.",

Yes, the second lord of the Treasury was pleased that UK growth in the quarter leading up to the Brexit referendum had been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/27/uk-economy-grew-before-brexit-vote-second-quarter-gdp-philip-hammond\">stronger at 0.6%</a> than anybody had been expecting. No chancellor looks a gift horse in the mouth, and this gift was unexpectedly generous.</p> <p>Hammond, however, knows full well that this was likely to be the best set of GDP data for some time. When he talked about a \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/PHammondMP/status/758220311221460992\">period of adjustment</a>\u201d, what he meant was that the economy is going to cool \u2013 perhaps abruptly \u2013 following the decision to leave the EU.</p> <p>Indeed, it took only 90 minutes for the growth figures to be put into perspective. That was how long it took for the next health check of the economy to be published. The CBI\u2019s survey of retail spending canvassed opinion after the referendum and, perhaps unsurprisingly, found consumers were reluctant to part with their cash.</p> <p>The City wasn\u2019t fooled by the GDP data. A brief rise in the pound quickly went into reverse on the assumption, almost certainly correct, that the welcome strength of the economy going into Brexit will have zero impact on decisions taken by the Bank of England and the Treasury over the coming months. Policymakers will treat the second quarter growth numbers as a historical curiosity, which is really what they are, given that in years to come Britain\u2019s history may be divided into the BB and AB epochs \u2013 before Brexit and after Brexit.</p> <p>Certain aspects of the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/grossdomesticproductpreliminaryestimate/aprtojune2016#main-points\">Office for National Statistics release</a> provide glimmers of hope that the economic fallout from Brexit might be less pronounced than feared.

Growth was concentrated in the first month of the quarter, April, before it fell back in May. The ONS relies on forecasts to assess what was happening in June and believes the economy was flat.

      "bodyText": "On granite cliffs overlooking the Channel is France\u2019s most famous building site. If all goes to plan, by the end of the decade this rocky outcrop will house the biggest and most powerful nuclear reactor in the world. The technology behind the European pressurised reactor (EPR) is meant to be safer than anything that has gone before. But the project is more than three times over budget and years behind schedule, and France\u2019s nuclear safety authority has found weaknesses in the reactor\u2019s steel. And the same model could soon be coming to the English coastline at an even bigger cost. France\u2019s state-controlled energy giant, EDF, is expected to announce on Thursday whether it will go ahead with its investment into the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset, where two EPR-style reactors are proposed. EDF is expected to come out in favour of the massive project, despite strong opposition from trade unionist board members, who argue the French government cannot afford it. Perhaps not since the D-Day landings will the British government have taken such a keen interest in the Normandy coast. If and when it comes online, possibly in late 2018, the Flamanville EPR will be the world\u2019s largest nuclear reactor. It will also be more efficient, using less fuel and producing almost a third less waste than older reactors, according to the technical specifics provided by EDF. The reinforced concrete core is intended to withstand plane crashes and earth tremors. But the combination of the EPR\u2019s size and its safety features have turned it into a construction nightmare. Today, not a single EPR reactor operates anywhere in the world. In Flamanville, the first concrete was poured in 2007. Since then costs have more than tripled to \u20ac10.5bn, while the project is six years behind schedule. In Finland, the location of another EPR, the picture is even worse: the Olkiluoto reactor is nearly a decade behind and three times over budget, with the added headache of legal battles over who is to blame. Less is known about two EPR reactors being built in China. What might have been just a colourful tale of shareholder angst took a different turn in 2015, when it emerged that weak spots had been found in the Flamanville reactor\u2019s steel, which is made by another French industrial champion, Areva. France\u2019s Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) said it had found \u201cvery serious anomalies\u201d in the reactor vessel. As the regulator deepened its investigation, it warned that the problems could affect other reactors in operation, although it stressed that France\u2019s reactors were safe. In its latest annual report, the ASN described the safety of the country\u2019s 58 nuclear power plants as \u201csatisfactory\u201d, but said it had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d for the future as financial pressures build on France\u2019s nuclear industry. Even before the 2011 Fukushima disaster turned some countries off nuclear power, the horizon for France\u2019s nuclear industry was clouded. It has made a dash for big, costly projects, just as electricity production is moving to a smaller, more dispersed model with the arrival of renewables. Meanwhile, demand for power has been falling in continental Europe as a result of factory efficiency drives. Martin Young, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, questions whether anyone needs to be building nuclear power stations on the scale of Flamanville or Hinkley Point C. \u201cWe should probably think about smaller, easier-to-build, more-flexible nuclear power stations,\u201d he says. Instead, the EPR prestige project has forced Areva to the brink of bankruptcy. The reactor builder is cutting 1,000 jobs and has been forced into a shotgun merger with EDF at the behest of the French government. No wonder the business newspaper Les Echos has come up with a new name for the EPR: Enormous Problems to Resolve. The EPR woes have raised the stakes over Hinkley Point C, whose two reactors are intended to supply 7% of British electricity by 2025. But the British project, to be co-funded with China, has become another enormous headache. In March, EDF\u2019s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned because he felt his warnings that Hinkley Point C could bankrupt the company were being ignored. France\u2019s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, argues that Hinkley Point C is vital to secure EDF\u2019s position in the UK, but also to promote \u201cour expertise in this major technology around the world\u201d. In May, he told Le Journal du Dimanche that if Hinkley Point C did not go ahead, \u201cwe would give up our place to our American, Chinese or Russian competitors\u201d. He also questioned where France would find the skills to renew its own ageing nuclear power stations. Some argue that savoir-faire in the French nuclear industry has already begun to wither. Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based nuclear policy analyst, accuses the industry of overestimating its capacity to build highly complex reactors, while underestimating skills gaps. \u201cIt is clear that the skills issue is part of the problem. Areva hasn\u2019t built reactors [in France] for a very long time,\u201d he says. Schneider is worried that relentless cost-cutting pressures could compromise safety, as Areva bids to save \u20ac1bn by 2017, through job cuts. \u201cTo me, it is very obvious that you will cut into safety and security and that is what makes me most nervous,\u201d he says. \u201cThe financial and economic pressure on all the stakeholders is completely unparalleled.\u201d The decision on Hinkley Point C may come down to politics. Young at RBC suggests that EDF wants a decision on Hinkley Point C while the UK has a functioning government and before possible Brexit aftershocks complicate the picture. \u201cIf you are EDF, why would you want to wait and run the risk of a snap election being called?\u201d he says. A future government could change its mind on the project, Whitehall\u2019s official spending watchdog has said, warning of a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of pressures from an impending Brexit. Patrick Fauchon, the mayor of Flamanville, is no stranger to political pressures. He recalls strong tensions in the 1970s when locals first debated plans to build two reactors. He has been in post since 1983, two years before the first Flamanville reactor went into service, followed by the second a year later. These reactors were among the 58 built by France in a rapid sprint between 1977 and 1999, spurred into action by the oil price shock. Like high-speed trains and Concorde, nuclear energy was viewed as a symbol of progress. For small towns such as Flamanville, it was a welcome source of jobs. The nuclear industry is by far the biggest employer in the region, estimated to provide one in two local jobs. The nuclear power station took over the site once occupied by the local granite mine, which closed in 1962. Once, Flamanville shipped granite all over France, including that used in Paris\u2019s Place de la Concorde. Now it supplies nearly 5% of the country\u2019s electricity. \u201cThere is a continuity of industrial life here,\u201d says Fauchon. There are dissenting voices. A poster advertising an anti-nuclear rally along the tricolour-festooned high street underlines that not everyone has fallen head over heels for nuclear. But most people are content to support the industry. \u201cThe locals are very happy to take advantage of the huge financial windfall provided by La Hague [a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant] and Flamanville,\u201d says Jacky Lebuhotel, a reporter. \u201cDelays to the EPR may raise an eyebrow, but they are also a source of significant financial return.\u201d Among the neat little yachts and cheerful summer blooms in the harbour at Di\u00e9lette, it is easy to forget the nuclear plants that surround the bay \u2013 Flamanville on one side, La Hague on the other. Several people said they gave no or little thought to the local nuclear industry. Only the steady stream of trucks trundling past the tidy granite houses give a hint of a grittier business. Unsurprisingly, nuclear workers take a close interest in the EPR\u2019s fortunes. Philippe Revel, a 51-year old foreman, is not convinced that the much vaunted next-generation nuclear model is an improvement on its \u201csimpler, more functional\u201d predecessors, or that it will play a big role in France\u2019s nuclear future. Asked whether he would recommend it to the British, he smiles wryly. \u201cPersonally, no. It is too complicated. It is too big.\u201d This piece was amended on Thursday 28 July 2016 to make clear that Mycle Schneider was referring to Areva\u2019s reactor-building experience in France.",

The reinforced concrete core is intended to withstand plane crashes and earth tremors. But the combination of the EPR\u2019s size and its safety features have turned it into a construction nightmare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2016-07-27T12:18:52.html\" data-alt=\"The location of the new nuclear reactor in Flamanville, France.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2016-07-27T12:18:52.html\">The location of the new nuclear reactor in Flamanville, France.</a> <figcaption>The location of the new nuclear reactor in Flamanville, France.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, not a single EPR reactor operates anywhere in the world. In Flamanville, the first concrete was poured in 2007. Since then costs have more than tripled to \u20ac10.5bn, while the project is six years behind schedule. In Finland, the location of another EPR, the picture is even worse: the Olkiluoto reactor is nearly a decade behind and three times over budget, with the added headache of legal battles over who is to blame. Less is known about two EPR reactors being built in China.<br></p> <p>What might have been just a colourful tale of shareholder angst took a different turn in 2015, when it emerged that weak spots had been found in the Flamanville reactor\u2019s steel, which is made by another French industrial champion, Areva. France\u2019s Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) said it had found \u201cvery serious anomalies\u201d in the reactor vessel. As the regulator deepened its investigation, it warned that the problems could affect other reactors in operation, although it stressed that France\u2019s reactors were safe. In its latest annual report, the ASN described the safety of the country\u2019s 58 nuclear power plants as \u201csatisfactory\u201d, but said it had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d for the future as financial pressures build on France\u2019s nuclear industry.</p> <p>Even before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/11/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-reactors-decommission-cleanup-japan-tsunami-meltdown\">2011 Fukushima disaster</a> turned some countries off nuclear power, the horizon for France\u2019s nuclear industry was clouded. It has made a dash for big, costly projects, just as electricity production is moving to a smaller, more dispersed model with the arrival of renewables. Meanwhile, demand for power has been falling in continental Europe as a result of factory efficiency drives.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/hinkley-point-c-no-more-than-doomed-attempt-face-saving\">Hinkley Point C is no more than a doomed attempt at face-saving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin Young, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, questions whether anyone needs to be building nuclear power stations on the scale of Flamanville or Hinkley Point C. \u201cWe should probably think about smaller, easier-to-build, more-flexible nuclear power stations,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>Instead, the EPR prestige project has forced Areva to the brink of bankruptcy. The reactor builder is cutting 1,000 jobs and has been forced into a shotgun merger with EDF at the behest of the French government. No wonder the business newspaper <a href=\"http://www.lesechos.fr/\">Les Echos</a> has come up with a new name for the EPR: Enormous Problems to Resolve.</p> <p>The EPR woes have raised the stakes over Hinkley Point C, whose two reactors are intended to supply 7% of British electricity by 2025. But the British project, to be co-funded with China, has become another enormous headache. In March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns\">EDF\u2019s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned</a> because he felt his warnings that Hinkley Point C could bankrupt the company were being ignored. <br></p> <p>France\u2019s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, argues that Hinkley Point C is vital to secure EDF\u2019s position in the UK, but also to promote \u201cour expertise in this major technology around the world\u201d. In May, <a href=\"http://www.lejdd.fr/Economie/Emmanuel-Macron-EDF-est-en-marche-782447\">he told Le Journal du Dimanche</a> that if Hinkley Point C did not go ahead, \u201cwe would give up our place to our American, Chinese or Russian competitors\u201d. He also questioned where France would find the skills to renew its own ageing nuclear power stations.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a669561aec2a85eec2b8a514a6001c849dd844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a669561aec2a85eec2b8a514a6001c849dd844/0_320_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An artist's impression of the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station could look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EDF Energy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some argue that <em>savoir-faire</em> in the French nuclear industry<em> </em>has already begun to wither. Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based nuclear policy analyst, accuses the industry of overestimating its capacity to build highly complex reactors, while underestimating skills gaps. \u201cIt is clear that the skills issue is part of the problem. Areva hasn\u2019t built reactors [in France] for a very long time,\u201d he says.</p> <p> Schneider is worried that relentless cost-cutting pressures could compromise safety, as Areva bids to save \u20ac1bn by 2017, through job cuts. \u201cTo me, it is very obvious that you will cut into safety and security and that is what makes me most nervous,\u201d he says. \u201cThe financial and economic pressure on all the stakeholders is completely unparalleled.\u201d</p> <p>The decision on Hinkley Point C may come down to politics. Young at RBC suggests that EDF wants a decision on Hinkley Point C while the UK has a functioning government and before possible Brexit aftershocks complicate the picture. \u201cIf you are EDF, why would you want to wait and run the risk of a snap election being called?\u201d he says. A future government could change its mind on the project, Whitehall\u2019s official spending watchdog has said, warning of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/21/brexit-could-force-multibillion-pound-projects-to-be-scrapped-says-nao-chief\">\u201ctidal wave\u201d of pre</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/21/brexit-could-force-multibillion-pound-projects-to-be-scrapped-says-nao-chief\">ssures</a> from an impending Brexit.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/21/brexit-could-force-multibillion-pound-projects-to-be-scrapped-says-nao-chief\">Brexit could force multibillion-pound projects to be scrapped, says NAO chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Patrick Fauchon, the mayor of Flamanville, is no stranger to political pressures. He recalls strong tensions in the 1970s when locals first debated plans to build two reactors. He has been in post since 1983, two years before the first Flamanville reactor went into service, followed by the second a year later.<br></p> <p>These reactors were among the 58 built by France in a rapid sprint between 1977 and 1999, spurred into action by the oil price shock. Like high-speed trains and Concorde, nuclear energy was viewed as a symbol of progress. For small towns such as Flamanville, it was a welcome source of jobs. The nuclear industry is by far the biggest employer in the region, estimated to provide one in two local jobs.</p> <p> The nuclear power station took over the site once occupied by the local granite mine, which closed in 1962. Once, Flamanville shipped granite all over France, including that used in Paris\u2019s Place de la Concorde. Now it supplies nearly 5% of the country\u2019s electricity. \u201cThere is a continuity of industrial life here,\u201d says Fauchon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/theresa-may-lobbyists-trident-heathrow-business\">Theresa May\u2019s first test is to stand up to the lobbyists | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are dissenting voices. A poster advertising an anti-nuclear rally along the tricolour-festooned high street underlines that not everyone has fallen head over heels for nuclear. But most people are content to support the industry. \u201cThe locals are very happy to take advantage of the huge financial windfall provided by La Hague [a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant] and Flamanville,\u201d says Jacky Lebuhotel, a reporter. \u201cDelays to the EPR may raise an eyebrow, but they are also a source of significant financial return.\u201d</p> <p>Among the neat little yachts and cheerful summer blooms in the harbour at Di\u00e9lette, it is easy to forget the nuclear plants that surround the bay \u2013 Flamanville on one side, La Hague on the other. Several people said they gave no or little thought to the local nuclear industry. Only the steady stream of trucks trundling past the tidy granite houses give a hint of a grittier business. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, nuclear workers take a close interest in the EPR\u2019s fortunes. Philippe Revel, a 51-year old foreman, is not convinced that the much vaunted next-generation nuclear model is an improvement on its \u201csimpler, more functional\u201d predecessors, or that it will play a big role in France\u2019s nuclear future. </p> <p>Asked whether he would recommend it to the British, he smiles wryly. \u201cPersonally, no. It is too complicated. It is too big.\u201d<br></p> <ul> <li>This piece was amended on <strong>Thursday</strong> 28 July <strong>2016 </strong>to make clear that Mycle Schneider was referring to Areva\u2019s reactor-building experience in France.<br></li> </ul>",

The plans include an extended terminal, more space for planes to taxi to and from the runway, and new aircraft stands that will allow bigger, more modern planes to use the airport. The project will create about 1,600 new jobs at the airport and another 500 during the construction phase, according to London City. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, and the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, gave the formal green light to the plan. It will allow more flights to and from the airport at peak times, and the extended terminal will accommodate more passengers. The airport, which is close to Canary Wharf in east London, currently serves about 4 million passengers a year. Javid said local residents affected by the increase in air traffic would be offered a generous compensation package. Hammond said it was a vote of confidence in the resilience of the UK economy. \u201cMaking it easier to visit and do business in the City of London will help drive forward our economy and further strengthen the city\u2019s status as the world\u2019s leading financial centre,\u201d he said. A consortium of investors led by the Ontario Teachers\u2019 pension fund and Borealis bought London City airport for about \u00a32bn in February. It was sold by Global Infrastructure Partners, which had bought it from the Irish businessman Dermot Desmond for \u00a3750m in 2006. Transport links around the airport will also be improved as part of the latest investment, with \u00a32.6m earmarked for more trains for the Docklands Light Railway. The airport will also spend money on a bus and taxi scheme, and on improving pedestrian and cycle routes. Boris Johnson blocked the airport\u2019s expansion when he was London\u2019s mayor. Campaigners attempting to rein in its operations because of noise and pollution concerns have previously said expansion would mean a huge increase in flights and disruption over inner north-east London.",

      "bodyText": "The CBI has blamed a post-Brexit mood of caution among consumers for the biggest fall in high street spending in more than four years. The employers\u2019 organisation said that a snapshot of retail activity taken in the period immediately after the 23 June referendum showed that individuals had kept tight control of their household budgets. The CBI said 24% of retailers questioned between 28 June and 14 July said spending was up on the same period of 2016, while 38% said it was lower. The balance of -14 percentage points was the lowest since January 2012. Concern that the tough trading environment will persist has led retailers to cut back on orders from suppliers at the fastest rate since the economy was in the depths of recession in March 2009. Supermarkets and furniture stores reported the most difficult trading conditions in the weeks after Brexit, while department stores and shoe shops said business was brisk. Online spending was also affected by the uncertainty, with the annual growth rate in sales dropping from +38 points in June to +23 points in July. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cWhile conditions in the retail sector have weakened, we should be careful about reading too much too soon, as consumers were likely to err on the side of caution in the immediate period following a vote to leave the EU. \u201cCurrent low levels of inflation and high overall employment should support consumer spending in the near term, although the impact of lower sterling is likely to feed through to higher inflation over time. \u201cWhat businesses and consumers need now is calm and decisive leadership, a clear timetable and a plan for negotiating the UK\u2019s future outside the EU to restore confidence.\u201d Sam Tombs, Pantheon Macro\u2019s UK economist, said: \u201cThe plunge in the reported sales balance in July to its lowest level since January 2012 indicates that consumers as well as businesses are immediately tightening their belts following the referendum. \u201cThe survey was undertaken in the first half of July and it is the first major retail report solely to cover the post-referendum period. Retailers\u2019 expectations for sales over the next month also fell to a four-and-a-half-year low.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK economy grew by 0.6% before Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy grew by a faster than expected 0.6% in the second quarter as businesses appeared to shrug off Brexit jitters in the runup to the 23 June referendum. Growth between April and June was stronger than the 0.4% achieved in the first quarter, boosted by the best performance from the industrial sector in almost 17 years according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists were forecasting weaker growth of 0.4% in the second quarter. They warned however this was likely to be as good as it gets for the UK economy, with a sharp slowdown predicted in the coming months. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said there was little evidence that concern about a possible Brexit vote had a negative impact on the economy before the referendum. \u201cContinued strong growth across services, particularly in retailing, reinforced by healthy growth in the manufacture of cars and pharmaceuticals, boosted output in the second quarter. \u201cAny uncertainties in the runup to the referendum seem to have had a limited effect. Very few respondents to ONS surveys cited such uncertainties as negatively impacting their businesses.\u201d The chancellor Philip Hammond said the latest official snapshot of the UK economy showed that it was fundamentally strong, adding he was ready to take action to support the economy following the Brexit vote. \u201cIt is clear we enter our negotiations to leave the EU from a position of economic strength,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThose negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence.\u201d Economists warned that growth would be lower in the coming months, with some predicting contraction in the third quarter. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the numbers represented \u201cone last hurrah\u201d for the economy before it entered a weaker and more turbulent period. The data showed the economy was performing better in the earlier part of the second quarter than the latter part. At the time of the first estimate of gross domestic product, the ONS has less than half the data content that it will ultimately rely on for the final estimate. As a result, the numbers it gives for June are a forecast and subject to revision. Beck said: \u201cThe monthly figures point to a significant loss of momentum through the quarter which means that the launchpad for the third quarter was already soft, even before we factor in any Brexit effects. \u201cThe lack of momentum as the economy entered Q3 means that the chances of a negative reading for the current quarter are relatively high.\u201d The Bank of England warned before the referendum a Brexit vote could trigger a technical recession, defined by two consecutive quarters of negative growth. It has hinted that it will unveil a package of measures designed to boost confidence among households and businesses as the UK faces a period of prolonged uncertainty following the vote. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is expected next week to cut interest rates to a new all-time low of 0.25%, from 0.5%, having disappointed expectations of a rate cut at its July policy meeting. A breakdown of the second-quarter GDP figures showed that industrial production jumped by 2.1% \u2013 the strongest growth since the third quarter of 1999 - following a 0.2% contraction in the first quarter. The manufacturing sector was the biggest driver of rise, with output rising 1.8% over the quarter. Output in the services sector, which accounts for more than three quarters of the economy, increased by 0.5%, while construction fell by 0.4%. Annual growth accelerated to 2.2% in the second quarter, from 2% in the first. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that growth strengthened in the last quarter before the referendum. The priority now is protecting growth from the fall in business confidence, and the risks to future investment, following the Brexit vote.\u201d",

The company, which supplies technology for iPhones as well as other connected equipment such as televisions and washing machines, said pretax profits rose 5% year on year to \u00a3130m on revenues up 17% at \u00a3267.6m. It said licensing revenues were up 14% year on year, and royalty revenues 11% better. Chief executive Simon Segars said: Our royalty revenue growth continues to outperform the wider semiconductor industry, driven by market share gain and the increasing adoption of ARM\u2019s latest technologies...We expect this outperformance to continue. ARM is continuing to invest in products that will support our partners\u2019 roadmaps as they develop next-generation technologies such as 5G networks, autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things. Analysts at Credit Suisse said: The second quarter results [are] slightly below expectations. ARM reported second quarter sales of $388m (-3% quarter on quarter/+9% year on year) or \u00a3268m (foreign exchange rate of $1.45) versus Credit Suisse/consensus at $392m (\u00a3274m, foreign exchange rate of $1.43)... Normalised cash generation in the second quarter was \u00a3128m driving net cash to \u00a3805m (or 57p per share); note this is down quarter on quarter due to \u00a3230m of cash paid out for acquisitions, \u00a379m for dividends and \u00a318m for buybacks. ARM has not provided its usual full year guidance given the recent acquisition announcement by SoftBank. Given SoftBank had announced an agreement to acquire ARM in an all-cash deal for 1,700p a share (on 18th July), we maintain our neutral rating and target price of 1,700p. ARM shares are currently down 1p at \u00a316.75.",

      "bodyText": "Inflation has not grown this slowly since 1999 but economists are split over whether it means the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates next week. New data from the Bureau of Statistics shows headline annual inflation is now growing at just 1%. The weak figure was partly caused by price falls in the June quarter for domestic holiday travel and accommodation (\u20133.7%), motor vehicles (\u20131.3%) and telecommunication equipment and services (\u20131.5%). But, in the past 12 months, clothing prices have fallen (-0.2%), while rents (+0.7%) and recreation and education costs (+0.8%) have barely grown. Economists say Australia is importing much of its deflationary pressure, helping to keep prices subdued. They say exceptionally low oil prices from the past year have only just begun to rise. Record low wages growth, slowing growth in rents and strong discounting in major supermarkets have contributed significantly to weak inflation, despite Australia\u2019s better than expected gross domestic product growth of 3.1% and its lower-than-expected unemployment rate of 5.7%. But economists are divided over whether the weak inflation figure means the RBA will cut interest rates to a record low 1.5% next month. They say the underlying inflation rate is 1.5% \u2013 calculated by removing items with volatile price movements \u2013 which matches the RBA\u2019s own forecast for the year to June quarter. It is still below the RBA\u2019s 2% to 3% target band \u2013 and it is expected to stay below the target band until mid-2018 \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t a surprise, some say. \u201cIs inflation low enough to justify market pricing and economist\u2019s expectations for an August rate cut? The answer is a qualified yes,\u201d the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s chief economist, Michael Blythe, wrote to clients. \u201cIt is arguable that the domestic economy is in need of any additional stimulus at this point. There is a respectable line of argument that further rate cuts may not help. And that cuts may just add fuel to the housing market.\u201d Private economist Saul Eslake told Guardian Australia: \u201cGiven that most of the incoming data on economic activity since their last meeting will have not altered their view of how economic growth is tracking, I would say on balance they\u2019re now less likely to cut rates next week.\u201d The Reserve Bank meets next week to discuss interest rates and it will be the second-last meeting for its governor, Glenn Stevens. Stevens has led the bank since September 2006 but he will be replaced by his deputy Philip Lowe in September.",

Pete Redfern, Taylor Wimpey\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhile it is still too early to assess what long-term impact the EU referendum result will have on the UK housing market, there has been no meaningful change to date, with trading in the last month at a normal seasonal range. \u201cCustomer interest continues to be high, with a good level of visitors both to our developments and to our website.\u201d The sentiments were echoed by challenger banks Shawbrook and Metro, which said there had been no change in customer behaviour since the 23 June referendum. In the runup to the vote, members of the remain camp warned the housing market was vulnerable to a shock if the UK voted to leave the EU because of weaker growth and dwindling consumer confidence. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, warned of a possible stock market and housing crash. Shares in UK housebuilders fell sharply after the result, and while they have recovered some of the losses, prices remain below pre-referendum levels. Taylor Wimpey was one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest risers on Wednesday following its confident statement, with shares up 4.2%. It said that immediately after the vote it had seen a small increase in the number of people cancelling plans to buy a new home but cancellation rates were now back to their previous low levels. It said the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme, competitive lending by mortgage providers and a shortage of homes in the UK were all helping to support the housing market. Attempts by the government and Bank of England to boost confidence among households in the aftermath of the Brexit decision had also helped, the housebuilder said. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cTaylor Wimpey isn\u2019t blinking in the face of Brexit, and its early indications show the referendum hasn\u2019t really dented business. \u201cConfidence is a key part of the housing market, and so far this seems to be holding up well in the weeks following the EU vote.\u201d Announcing results for the first half ending 3 July, Taylor Wimpey said sale completions were up 3% at 6,019 homes. The average selling price increased 5.8% to \u00a3238,000, and underlying profits were up 12.1% at \u00a3266.6m. Taylor Wimpey\u2019s order book rose 7%, to 8,683 homes. In another sign of confidence, Taylor Wimpey confirmed it would pay a special dividend of \u00a3300m \u2013 or 9.2p a share \u2013 in July 2017, as well as an interim dividend of 0.53p a share in October 2016.",

      "bodyText": "The newly privatised Port of Newcastle has launched a federal court appeal in Australia against the mining giant Glencore to maintain control over port access fees that is likely to focus further attention on the privatisation of government assets across Australia. The appeal coincides with stinging criticism of successive Australian governments\u2019 privatisation of government assets by the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims. Sims, who has long been publicly supportive of privatisation in general, warned on Wednesday that privatisation was \u201cseverely damaging\u201d the Australian economy and he singled out ports and vocational education . The Port of Newcastle was privatised by the New South Wales government in 2014 as part of a joint venture between Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants. The venture quickly increased port fees by between 40% and 60% for vessels to access the shipping channel, sparking an approach to the federal government from Glencore to seek to have the monopoly access of the port more heavily regulated. When that approach was rejected, it appealed to the Australian Competition Tribunal, which ruled in its favour. The Port of Newcastle has now lodged an appeal to that decision in the federal court. A spokeswoman for the Port of Newcastle said the matter raised \u201cimportant issues for infrastructure operators and their customers\u201d that should be clarified by the federal court. \u201cPort of Newcastle is seeking judicial review via the full federal court of the decision of the Australian Competition Tribunal to declare the service provided by the shipping channel in the Port of Newcastle,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tribunal\u2019s decision was that, for the purpose of the test for declaration, access to the service can only mean a legal right of access. Port of Newcastle is of the view that this is not the correct interpretation and this should be reviewed by the court.\u201d She said that the port\u2019s pricing remained competitive. \u201cPort of Newcastle has an obvious commercial imperative to maximise trade volumes through the port and to ensure continuing access for customers. The success of its business depends on it.\u201d Glencore Coal had previously argued before the Australian Competition Tribunal that increased fees to enter the privatised Newcastle port, which produces more than 170m tonnes of saleable coal a year, would \u201cmaterially impact on the profit margins of coal producers\u201d. The appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal concerns a decision by the then acting treasurer, Mathias Cormann, in 2015 when he ruled out \u201cdeclaring\u201d the port\u2019s fees. Had Cormann ruled in Glencore\u2019s favour, this would have allowed it to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration and potentially allow Glencore to push for the port fees to be lowered. The Australian Competition Tribunal ruled that the port should have been considered a declared service, because it would impact the future state of competition for the mining company. A spokeswoman for Glencore declined to comment on the court application.",

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline is to invest \u00a3275m at three of its UK factories with the creation of new jobs, as the pharmaceutical group insisted the country is still an attractive place to invest despite the Brexit vote. However, GSK\u2019s outgoing chief executive Sir Andrew Witty warned that if the European Medicines Agency (EMA) relocates from London as seems likely and the UK creates its own regulatory body, the company\u2019s regulatory burden would double. All new medicines have to be approved by regulators who check their safety and efficacy. \u201cJust to be blunt you would have to file two different submissions so it is obvious that you have doubled the amount of work,\u201d said Witty. \u201cMight the new UK organisation be able to do things differently and more quickly than Europe? Maybe... Those discussions haven\u2019t started yet.\u201d He warned of the \u201cphysical disruption\u201d if the EMA leaves the UK. Asked about the potential cost of Britain being an associate member of the EMA, he noted that Britain had always played an important role in setting rules. \u201cSo to what extent are we prepared to give up being a rule shaper in a space that we\u2019ve dominated historically as a country?... if we remain engaged, it really needs to be on the terms of us having a strong voice at the table on the rule set.\u201d Witty also highlighted concerns about a potential brain drain of scientists who are EU nationals from Britain following the referendum, and urged the government to quickly end the uncertainty surrounding their status. About 14% of the company\u2019s staff in the UK hail from other European countries and \u201cthey are super welcome at GSK and in the UK\u201d. The impact on UK scientists\u2019 collaborations with the rest of the EU was also a concern, he said, although so far he saw few signs that UK scientists were frozen out of projects. In a confidential survey of the UK\u2019s Russell Group universities, the Guardian found cases of British academics being asked to leave EU-funded projects or to step down from leadership roles amid doubts over the UK\u2019s ability to win future project grants. Leaving the EU will also end the free movement of researchers to and from the UK. GSK signalled its confidence in the UK economy by announcing that it would pump more money into its factories at Barnard Castle in County Durham, Montrose in Scotland, and Ware in Hertfordshire. Witty said that the investment decision had been made in the last couple of days. \u201cThis decision is not caused by Brexit. It hasn\u2019t been stopped by Brexit is probably a better way to think about it.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is testament to our skilled UK workforce and the country\u2019s leading position in life sciences that we are making these investments in advanced manufacturing here.\u201d GSK has nine manufacturing plants in the UK, employing about 6,000 people. It said the UK was still \u201can attractive location for investment\u201d, partly because it had a competitive tax system. Pharmaceutical companies developing and making products in the UK pay a lower rate of corporation tax on profits generated from UK-owned intellectual property. The company said jobs would be created but did not specify how many. Some of the jobs will be related to the construction of new facilities at the existing plants. The drugmaker published a strong set of results, posting a 4% rise in sales to \u00a36.5bn in the second quarter at constant exchange rates. Sales from new pharmaceutical products and vaccines more than doubled to over \u00a31bn, helped by a 50% rise in sales of HIV medicines. GSK now expects growth of 11-12% in core earnings per share this year, the top end of previous guidance, after posting growth of 12% to 44.3 pence in the first half of the year. Greg Clarke, the UK\u2019s new business and energy secretary, said GSK\u2019s investment was a reflection of confidence in Britain and \u201cunderlines our position as a global business leader\u201d. \u201cGSK\u2019s recognition of our skilled workforce, world-leading scientific capabilities and competitive tax environment is further proof that there really is no place better in Europe to grow a business,\u201d he said. The money will be used to increase production and support the delivery of its latest respiratory and large molecule biological medicines. GSK will invest \u00a392m in Barnard Castle, where it employs 1,100 people. It will build a new aseptic sterile plant where existing and new biopharmaceutical products will be made. At Montrose, where it employs 450 people, it will spend \u00a3110m on a new facility to make respiratory active ingredients. And in Ware it will invest \u00a374m to support the expansion of company\u2019s new Ellipta respiratory inhaler by increasing capacity there. The company employs 1,200 people at the plant. GSK\u2019s signal of confidence in the UK economy came as other companies said the Brexit vote was not having a significant impact on business. The housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and challenger banks Shawbrook and Metro suggested it was business as usual following the UK\u2019s surprise decision to leave the EU.",

    "webTitle": "Iain Wright: the MP leading the fight against BHS and Sports Direct", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Iain Wright has been a busy man. The chairman of parliament\u2019s business, innovation and skills select committee has just co-authored the 60-page report into the collapse of retailer BHS with counterparts on the work and pensions committee, as well as a similarly scathing 33-page account of the working conditions at Sports Direct. He is so pleased with the product that he refers to the BHS document as \u201cmy Sgt Pepper\u201d \u2013 quite a claim given that the Beatles\u2019 1967 long player is often hailed as a work of genius. Still, a bit like the famous album, he can point to how certain concepts run neatly through his two releases. The Sports Direct report, published last Friday, concluded that the founder and majority owner, Mike Ashley, had been running the company like a Victorian workhouse and building his success on a business model that failed to pay workers the national minimum wage and treated them \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d. BHS followed on Monday, when MPs found that the department store had been subjected to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by former owners including Sir Philip Green, who gave \u201cinsufficient priority\u201d to the BHS pension scheme that slumped to a \u00a3571m deficit. \u201cIt is coincidental,\u201d Wright says of the two reports being published almost simultaneously, \u201cbut [there are] common themes about a dominant individual who\u2019s grown a business, or certainly controls a business, and really doesn\u2019t listen to any advice. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018my way of the highway\u2019, sort of thing. I\u2019m really glad that there are different people now, whether it\u2019s the Institute of Directors [or] the new prime minister, saying that this has to be at the top of the agenda. It\u2019s not acceptable, this.\u201d Certainly the timing of the two reports looks opportune for Wright \u2013 in three ways. First, there was the Tory leadership stump speech by Theresa May which put corporate responsibility back on the Westminster agenda. Second, there was last month\u2019s referendum result, which Wright partly attributes to an increasing number of people outside south-east England viewing the economy as something that no longer works for them. \u201cThirty years ago [if I was a worker in the north east], I knew I had a job and a stable career path. I knew I could start off sweeping the factory and I could end up getting a really respectable job. Now that\u2019s gone and people are angry about that and \u2013 you know what \u2013 I can see it. I can absolutely see why ... The tragedy is [the referendum vote is] not going to change all that, is it?\u201d And third, Wright\u2019s reports have arrived at precisely the time he has begun angling to become the chairman of what is likely to become a re-jigged business committee - one that will also take in energy and industrial strategy to reflect the new scope of the government department. \u201cI\u2019ve expressed my interest,\u201d he says. The MP\u2019s ambition to continue leading the work he has started looks to stem from enjoying taking on the UK\u2019s biggest corporate names (\u201cIn both the inquiries, BHS and Sports Direct, the select committee system was on trial. I think we\u2019ve passed that\u201d), plus a genuine interest in the topic, as you might expect from somebody who began professional life as a chartered accountant. Wright says he is planning follow-up inquiries from the autumn that will focus on themes of improving corporate governance standards as well as enhancing workers\u2019 rights. \u201cI want a Labour government. But most of all I want to see the economy work for everyone, rather than just people on yachts,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do we use the rules, and how do we use corporate governance, to make sure that companies are better run in the interests not just of these dominant personalities but for the good of the entire company?\u201d He hopes that his BHS and Sports Direct reports will become part of that process. \u201cThere are two things to happen. One in our court, the other in other courts,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst is we need to make sure these [reports] don\u2019t sit on the shelf and are used by the government in order to improve the framework in which business operates ... It\u2019s a case of putting pressure on the government to say this is what is happening in Britain\u2019s economy in the 21st century. It\u2019s not acceptable. What are we going to do about it? \u201cThe second thing is ... where we are going to pass it over to the likes of [HM Revenue &amp; Customs]. We can\u2019t prosecute. We\u2019re not judges. In respect of Mike Ashley, HMRC are looking at [the retailer not paying the national minimum wage]. The Health and Safety executive should be looking at the allegations of women giving birth in toilets [at Sports Direct] and stuff like that. \u201cAnd with regards to Philip Green, there are a variety of investigations going on: the Serious Fraud Office are interested [the agency is examining if there might be a case to bring around the BHS collapse]. The Insolvency Service [which has the power to ban directors] are interested. These are two distinct things. We put pressure on at a parliamentary level. Enforcement agencies need to look at this as part of investigations to see if prosecutions are needed.\u201d The words suddenly seem quite measured, considering there have already been comments from fellow committee members that have compared Green to Robert Maxwell, the great plunderer of pensions. Wright\u2019s co-chairman on the BHS enquiry, Frank Field, described Green as \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d and Green has threatened to sue him. Does Wright agree? He ducks. \u201cWhere I agree with Frank \u2026 it\u2019s a question of scale \u2026. It all comes back to corporate governance and weak challenge \u2026 there are all these dominant individuals that just want to bulldoze their way through.\u201d So it is back to the Wright concept of challenging autocratic bosses \u2013 although it not a rule he applies universally. Apart from members of the Fab Four, the Hartlepool MP mentions one other hero, a former manager of his local football team, Hartlepool United, who he describes as \u201cfantastic\u201d. That idol is, of course, the tyrannical genius that was Brian Clough.",

The Health and Safety executive should be looking at the allegations of women giving birth in toilets [at Sports Direct] and stuff like that. </p> <p>\u201cAnd with regards to Philip Green, there are a variety of investigations going on: the Serious Fraud Office are interested [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/philip-green-threatens-to-sue-bhs-buyer-dominic-chappell\">the agency is examining if there might be a case to bring around the BHS collapse</a>]. The Insolvency Service [which has the power to ban directors] are interested. These are two distinct things. We put pressure on at a parliamentary level. Enforcement agencies need to look at this as part of investigations to see if prosecutions are needed.\u201d</p> <p>The words suddenly seem quite measured, considering there have already been comments from fellow committee members that have compared Green to Robert Maxwell, the great plunderer of pensions. Wright\u2019s co-chairman on the BHS enquiry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/philip-green-threatens-to-sue-frank-field\">Frank Field, described Green as \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d and Green has threatened to sue him</a>. Does Wright agree?</p> <p>He ducks. \u201cWhere I agree with Frank \u2026 it\u2019s a question of scale \u2026. It all comes back to corporate governance and weak challenge \u2026 there are all these dominant individuals that just want to bulldoze their way through.\u201d</p> <p>So it is back to the Wright concept of challenging autocratic bosses \u2013 although it not a rule he applies universally.</p> <p>Apart from members of the Fab Four, the Hartlepool MP mentions one other hero, a former manager of his local football team, Hartlepool United, who he describes as \u201cfantastic\u201d. That idol is, of course, the tyrannical genius that was Brian Clough.</p>",
