Prepare for more of the same if Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan is failing. Financial markets, having slumbered though the negotiations, are fully awake now. There is an interesting question of whether markets will play a role in events. Rupert Harrison, George Osborne\u2019s former adviser who now works at the asset manager BlackRock, raised the idea earlier this month. \u201cStarting to wonder if parliamentary vote will be like Tarp in the US in 2008 \u2013 voted down, markets puke, passes second time with small changes,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Tarp \u2013 the Troubled Asset Relief Program \u2013 was Washington\u2019s bailout of the banks during the financial crisis. The $700bn (\u00a3549m) plan to use federal funds to buy or insure toxic sub-prime mortgage securities was deeply unpopular but was still expected to be approved by Congress because there was no plan B. When the House of Representatives voted against, the Dow Jones fell 777 points, an enormous move. A few days later, Tarp was passed with a few tweaks. The possible analogy with Brexit is easy to see. If parliament were to vote against May\u2019s deal (assuming a vote actually takes place), the market\u2019s reaction could become properly violent. MPs might then look into the abyss of \u201cno deal\u201d and decide that, actually, they\u2019d rather not jump. The government would be hammering the \u201cnational interest\u201d line even more strongly, presenting refusal as a vote for the chaos on display in markets. The mainstream business lobby would be out in force, warning of job losses, cancelled investment and the need for certainty. A Tarp-style plot is definitely foreseeable. But there are a few important differences from that US situation. For a start, the UK government can\u2019t simply sweeten the draft withdrawal agreement to round up a few votes. The document runs to 585 pages and would require EU approval to alter. US legislators, by contrast, could adjust in days a simpler plan to let the Treasury department spend some money. More importantly, the choice isn\u2019t as stark as May\u2019s deal or no deal, a point that markets have grasped. The prime minister herself included \u201cno Brexit\u201d on her list of choices. So investors are already also weighing up the possibilities of a second referendum (good for the pound), a general election (probably bad), or delay and renegotiation. That adds a further layer of confusion to the market signals. Yet the broad point surely remains: we\u2019ve reached the point where investors, at home and abroad, will be passing cold judgment every day on the shocking state of British politics. That backdrop could help May as she tries to reheat a version of Project Fear, or it could assist the \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Either way, the level of sterling, the financial barometer most sensitive to Brexit, will be a prominent sub-plot over coming weeks. We\u2019re always told not to think of the pound as a national virility symbol, but, in the current mess, it\u2019s difficult not to. Royal Mail needs to delivery some hard numbers Royal Mail\u2019s share price was one of those overwhelmed by the Brexit action \u2013 it fell 6% \u2013 but investors will not have missed confirmation of the group\u2019s self-inflicted mistakes. The chronology runs as follows. In March, Royal Mail secured a wide-ranging deal with unions covering pay and pensions. In May, chief executive Moya Greene, just before her departure, said the deal meant \u00a3230m could be saved in the current financial year via \u201ccost avoidance\u201d measures. In October came the big profits warning from her successor, Rico Back: forget about \u00a3230m, only \u00a3100m will be saved this year because productivity gains haven\u2019t happened. So Back had one big question to answer with Thursday\u2019s half-number numbers: is the \u00a3230m figure merely delayed, or permanently lost in the post? He fudged it: come back in March for \u201ca strategy update\u201d and detail on \u201cour direction for the next five years\u201d. Back is new in the job so some vagueness is allowable. Even so, as he\u2019s been a senior executive at Royal Mail for 18 years, he ought to have some idea of how much of the lost ground can be recovered, and how quickly. He\u2019s changed the UK divisional chief and is now promising \u201ca clearer focus on financial performance and management accountability\u201d. That\u2019s a start, but until he puts some hard numbers on savings, investors won\u2019t know how severely Greene let things slip at the end.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The United Nations\u2019 expert on extreme poverty and human rights has said he is considering whether to brand the UK\u2019s benefits sanctions regime \u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d, following a two-week audit into the impact of austerity in Britain over the last decade. The UN rapporteur, Philip Alston, is preparing what is expected to be a hard-hitting report following a months-long investigation of poverty in Britain which ended with a 10-day tour of some of the poorest areas of the UK. It follows previous audits by Alston in Ghana, Mauritania, China and the United States. He visited some of the poorest neighbourhoods in Newcastle, Glasgow, Belfast, Essex and London and met people who had seen their benefits sanctioned under welfare reforms, some of whom had been left without enough money for food and heating. \u201cWhether I characterise it as cruel and inhuman, I will see how I feel on Thursday night when I am finishing writing my statement,\u201d he told an audience of fellow human rights lawyers and activists at his final public event this week. \u201cI am aware that many of the people who have experienced those sanctions have characterised them in that way.\u201d Alston said he heard \u201csome pretty horrendous stories\u201d about how disabled people are faring under the new universal credit system, and described the poor as \u201ceasy victims\u201d. \u201cAttacking the poor is easy and they as a result suffer highly disproportionately in terms of their civil and political rights,\u201d he said. Alston is considered one of the world\u2019s leading legal experts in the field of economic and social rights and is expected to spell out his view on the impact of austerity, local government cuts, universal credit and the possible impact of Brexit on poverty in Britain. He will also report on automation within the benefits system, aided by new technologies such as artificial intelligence. He has a reputation as a strident critic, becoming embroiled last year in a public row with the Trump White House which he accused of pursuing policies that deliberately forced millions of Americans into financial ruin while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy. The UN rapporteur has no direct power, but is considered an influential voice by many supporters of human rights. \u201cIf the report is weak it will disappear and sink like a stone,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens in this case.\u201d Koldo Casla \u2013 policy director of Just Fair, which campaigns for economic and social rights in the UK \u2013 said the visit was already a success because it has \u201ccreated unprecedented interest in media and civil society and, more importantly, among people with direct experience of living in poverty\u201d. \u201cWe are eager to read and use his final report in a few months, but the most significant contribution is that Alston has listened carefully and has been a loudspeaker for hundreds of people that are too often paid very little attention to,\u201d he said. Alston held meetings with government ministers in London who told him \u201cthere wasn\u2019t austerity\u201d, he said. He met Esther McVey, who resigned as work and pensions secretary on Thursday. He asked what Theresa May was talking about when she said she wanted to end austerity if it didn\u2019t exist. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a particularly good answer to that,\u201d he said. He also said he had received \u201cvery surprising responses on the part of government to food banks\u201d. Alston appears likely to make clear that austerity has been a political choice and highlight how Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told him the devolved government in Edinburgh has been spending \u00a3125m to mitigate the effects of cuts. In 1976, the UK signed a UN treaty agreeing to protect economic and social rights, but has proved hostile to enshrining it in law. Alston described himself as a \u201cfanatic\u201d who believes economic and social rights \u201care of the utmost importance\u201d. If they were incorporated into law, as they are in Sweden and Germany, it would require a radical rebalancing of public service finance, probably in favour of more taxes and higher spending. He said there would be \u201chilarity or disbelief\u201d in government if he suggested incorporation into law, so he is unlikely to push for that. He will issue a short report of about 10 pages on Friday before making a fuller report to the UN\u2019s human rights council in Geneva in June.",

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is understood to have been in touch with stock exchanges, bigger banks, and asset management companies regarding market volatility. An FCA spokesman said: \u201cAs you would expect in this type of situation we have regular contact with firms and will continue to engage with them.\u201d Investors were offloading shares in FTSE-quoted companies with large domestic businesses and UK currency holdings in an effort to reduce their exposure to the British economy. Royal Bank of Scotland was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, with shares closing down 9.6% at 224p. The market value of the bank, still 62% owned by the government, fell by \u00a32.8bn in Thursday\u2019s sell-off. Housebuilders Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments all closed down more than 7%, with Berkeley Group falling more than 6%. The four FTSE 100 housebuilders lost \u00a31.6bn collectively from their market capitalisations. The pound also took a tumble against major international currencies, dropping from above $1.30 to less than $1.28 against the US dollar by Thursday afternoon, a drop of 1.9%. Against the euro, sterling fell by 2% to just under \u20ac1.13. Sterling was on course for its biggest one-day drop against the dollar since October 2016 and versus the euro since shortly after the Brexit vote in June that year. Other financial indicators suggested the drama in Westminster was making investors more nervous about the UK\u2019s economic prospects. Nerves among British government bond investors forced the UK debt agency to accept low bids for a 20-year bond at auction to an extent not seen since March 2009, while the cost of insuring exposure to Britain\u2019s sovereign debt rose to its highest level in almost two years. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders. \u201cThese sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices.\u201d He said the weaker pound was helping buoy the FTSE 100, as the relative strength of foreign currencies tends to boost the share price of international firms whose revenue largely comes from overseas. The FTSE 100 closed flat on the day, with gains among mining and oil companies offsetting losses in more UK-focused businesses. The FTSE 250 index of smaller, more UK-oriented companies closed down 1.3%. \u201cHowever, if sustained, a weaker pound spells bad news for a retail sector which is already struggling, as it raises the price of imported goods and at the same time squeezes consumer incomes,\u201d Khalaf said. Markets were reacting to chaos on the government benches, as senior Brexit-backing ministers objected to a draft withdrawal agreement with the EU that the prime minister presented to the cabinet on Wednesday after months of negotiations between British and EU officials. Khalaf said a lack of certainty around Brexit would mean further pain for markets. \u201cWe can expect continued volatility in financial markets while political uncertainty swirls around Westminster.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Retail sales fell in October, adding to the gloom on the British high street as official figures showed that shoppers kept a tight rein on spending amid growing Brexit uncertainty. Sales volumes dropped by 0.5% from September, in contrast to forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists for a rise of 0.2%. The figures came amid more bad news from big retail names this week, with Debenhams posting another poor set of figures and House of Fraser announcing the closure of four more department stores. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in the three months to October, which smooths out some monthly volatility, sales growth slowed to 0.4% from 1.2%, the weakest growth since April. Annual growth slowed to 2.2% from an upwardly revised 3.3% in September. Analysts said shoppers held off winter clothing purchases due to mild weather and cut back on other goods after a heavy-spending summer. They added that the prospect of the Black Friday sales next week and the need to save for Christmas may also have played a role in shoppers keeping their wallets closed last month. Rising prices at the pumps have also pushed petrol and diesel sales to their weakest year-on-year growth since March 2017. But after months of falling consumer confidence, the looming prospect of Britain crashing out of the European Union appears to have played the biggest role in dampening sales. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cOctober\u2019s fall in retail sales is the first real sign that consumers are tightening their purse strings due to uncertainty about Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that consumers postponed major purchases until the Black Friday discounting period in November more than in previous years. But this new seasonal pattern should now be accounted for in the adjustment procedure, as Black Friday was widely adopted as long ago as 2014,\u201d he said. The decline was led by a 1.3% fall in non-food sales, which the ONS blamed on a reluctance by shoppers to spend on homeware. Household goods sales fell by 3%; clothing sales dropped by 1%. The government\u2019s statistics agency said the long-running trend for strong growth on the internet and falls on the high street was maintained. Philipp Gutzwiller, head of commercial banking for retailers at Lloyds Bank, said shops were hoping for the recent rise in wages to feed into higher spending. This week, the ONS said total pay, including bonuses, was growing at an annual rate of 3% in the three months ending in September \u2013 the fastest growth rate in three years. \u201cAll retailers will be hoping that consumers soon show signs of not only feeling they have a bit more to spend this year, thanks to rising real wages and record employment, but more importantly that they have the confidence to spend it,\u201d Gutzwiller said. Britain\u2019s economy has slowed since June 2016\u2019s Brexit vote but had a solid summer, with household spending growing by 0.5% in the three months to September. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said a fall in oil prices could give shoppers extra cash and trigger a rebound in sales volumes during November. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, with inflation continuing to fall back and pay growth on the up, there should be scope for consumer spending growth to gather some momentum further ahead,\u201d said Pugh. \u201cIf a Brexit deal is struck and the UK enters into a transition period or, indeed, if there is no Brexit at all, then we think that annual consumer spending growth will pick up from its current rate of 1.6% to 2% in 2020.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail\u2019s new chief executive has promised action to boost the group\u2019s performance including a review of its UK postal network as it revealed first-half profits had more than halved. Rico Back, who has come under increasing pressure since being handed the top job in June, said the company was examining its organisational structure, management roles, investment spending and central costs, amid an ongoing decline in sending of letters. The group said pre-tax profits for the six months to 23 September more than halved from \u00a377m to \u00a333m. Royal Mail said it was testing new methods to deliver letters and ways of automating some deliveries in the UK to increase efficiency and cut costs. It also said it was changing prices in UK business mail and many international markets, and intended to make more of potential synergies between Royal Mail and its GLS parcels business. Back said it had been a challenging past few months, and he was disappointed with the performance of the group, which employs 140,000 people. Pledging to improve Royal Mail\u2019s performance, he said: \u201cThere will be a greater emphasis on how we connect customers, companies and countries through our domestic and international businesses. \u201cThere will be a clearer focus on financial performance and management accountability. In short, we as a management team are focused on pulling all the short and medium-term levers at our disposal to improve our performance.\u201d He will update on the overhaul plans in March. The company\u2019s attempts to reduce costs have failed to progress at the rate initially expected, which Back said was partly attributable to the lingering effects of an industrial dispute and the complexity of implementing an agreement with trade unions. Royal Mail signed an agreement with the Communication Workers Union in February on new working conditions, pay increases, pensions, a shorter working week, technology and digitisation. Productivity slipped by 0.2% in Royal Mail\u2019s first half to 23 September. Back said it would improve in the second half but declined to say if it would meet the original target of hitting the upper end of its 2-3% range for 2018-19. Royal Mail shares rose more than 2% in early trading on Thursday but were down 6.5% at 325.4p by late afternoon. Shares in the formerly government-owned company, which floated at 330p in 2013, have lost nearly a quarter of their value this year. Shareholder dissatisfaction has also been stoked by executive pay levels, with investors overwhelmingly rejecting senior management pay packages in July. The group has been struggling to stem falling letter volumes and more recently warned that the new European data privacy law could reduce traditional marketing mail. Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cAn organisational restructure looks like it\u2019s on the cards as the group tries to get back on track \u2013 and that kind of thing is expensive and risky.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The pound has had a shocker of a day, thanks to the resignation of two cabinet ministers and countless rumours over the future of Brexit, Theresa May and the economy. Sterling is down 2% against the euro, on the biggest one-day fall since 27 June 2016 - four days after the Brexit vote. It is trading at \u20ac1.1256. It has suffered a similar sell-off against the dollar, down 1.9% at $1.2745. The FTSE 100 had a late flurry and closed in positive territory, up 4 points or 0.06% at 7,038.01, having earlier hit a low of 6,979.57. Here are the closing scores elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 11,353.67 France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% at 5,033.62 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% at 18,905.36 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 9,073.50 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -1.1% at 358.45 Meanwhile roughly \u00a31.6bn was wiped off the value of UK house builders, and \u00a32.8bn off RBS as UK focused firms were sold off by nervous traders. The UK-focused FTSE 250 closed down 1.3% or 248 points at 18,662.21. That\u2019s all for today - a dramatic one for UK politics and the markets. Thanks for reading and commenting, and please join us again tomorrow. S&amp;P says Britain\u2019s agreement in principle on the draft withdrawal treaty does not immediately affect its UK rating (AA/A-1+ with a negative outlook). However, it could lower the rating if a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit becomes a reality: We could lower the ratings under a scenario in which the likelihood of a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit appears more apparent. We define a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit as one which would either significantly limit UK manufacturing and services access to key European markets, or subject them to tariffs and non-tariff barriers high enough to reduce their ability to compete. Capital Economics has published a note titled: Trying to make sense of another day of Brexit chaos. Oliver Jones at the consultancy says the market reaction to events today gives a good indication of what might happen in the event of a no deal scenario: Sterling has once again been the biggest casualty. And Gilt yields have fallen \u2013 investors are clearly not paying any heed to Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion that the Bank of England might have to raise rates in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d. Most interestingly, the FTSE 100 has not fared that badly in local currency terms. But this reflects the fact that it is packed full of multinationals who benefit from a weaker currency. Indeed, in another re-run of 2016, the more domestically focused mid-cap FTSE 250 has performed a lot worse. Second, Prime Minister May\u2019s apparent failure to garner support for her deal has arguably also increased the likelihood of the opposite \u201cextreme\u201d Brexit outcome, a second referendum with an eventual vote to remain in the EU. Clearly, investors have focused more on the possibility of \u201cno deal\u201d, given the fall in sterling. And there are significant political and procedural hurdles standing in the way of another referendum. That said, there is still a sense that all bets could be off if today\u2019s Cabinet resignations and rumours of a challenge to May\u2019s leadership spell the end of her deal (and her time in Number 10). Demand for options protecting against moves in sterling in either direction has jumped to its highest in more than a year and a half. Time for a market recap, in what has been a volatile day so far for the pound and UK shares as traders fear what lies ahead for Brexit, Theresa May and the wider economy. The pound is on course for its biggest one-day fall, down 1.8% against the euro and the dollar at \u20ac1.1282 and $1.2767 respectively. European markets are a sea of red, with all major indices in the red. The FTSE 100 \u2013 which often benefits from a weaker pound - is now below 7,000, down 0.6% or 43 points at 6,991. The FTSE 100 firms hardest hit today are those which are heavily exposed to the UK economy, housebuilders and banking stocks. Housebuilders are set for their biggest one-day fall since the Brexit vote. The UK-focused FTSE 250 is down 2.1%. Wall Street losses have widened, with the Dow Jones off 0.8% at 24,888. The City watchdog says it is staying in touch with firms during this period of market volatility. A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority: As you would expect in this type of situation we have regular contact with firms and will continue to engage with them. US markets are down after the opening bell: Dow Jones: -0.4% at 24,983 S&amp;P 500: -0.5% at 2,688 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 7,113 Back in Europe, all major indices are in the red: Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, says that despite the 0.8% rise in US retail sales in October, spending growth has started to slow: Looking beyond the 0.8% surge in headline retail sales, which was boosted by a price-related surge in gasoline prices, there are signs that underlying spending growth has begun to slow. Even accounting for the boost to real incomes from the more recent drop in oil and gasoline prices, we expect consumption growth to slow further in 2019. The plunge in oil prices in recent weeks will boost households\u2019 real disposable incomes by close to $40bn, with surging natural gas prices likely to offset only a small fraction of that improvement in purchasing power. With consumer confidence still high, much of this extra cash is likely to filter through to spending on other goods and services. But we doubt that will be enough to replace the boost from the earlier fiscal stimulus or offset all of the headwind from tighter monetary policy. Accordingly, consumption growth still looks set to slow next year, which we expect will contribute to an eventual slowdown in overall GDP growth to below its 2% potential rate by mid-2019. Sticking with the US, the number of Americans filing new jobless claims rose unexpectedly last week according to the Labour Department. Initial claims were 216,000 for the week ended 10 November, up from 214,000 a week earlier. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 212,000. Here\u2019s how traders at the spread-betting firm IG are expecting Wall Street to open: Over in the US, data just out showed US retail sales rose 0.8% in October. It was stronger than the 0.5% increased forecast by economists, and a big improvement on September when sales dipped 0.1%. The Commerce department said car sales boosted the figures, as did sales of building materials, likely driven by rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. It is not just the pound that is being hammered. Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders are on course for their biggest one-day fall since the UK voted to leave the EU. Persimmon: -9.6% Taylor Wimpey: -9.2% Barratt Developments: -8.4% Berkeley Group: -7.1% Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders. These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices. We can expect continued volatility in financial markets while political uncertainty swirls around Westminster. Jacob Rees-Mogg has dealt a fresh blow to the pound, as he prepares to submit a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. The pound has suffered a fresh blow after a spokesman confirmed the planned move by the Conservative MP. It sent the pound down 1.7% against the euro, putting it on course for the biggest one-day fall in over a year. In other news, the UK\u2019s key scheme for ensuring the lights stay on during the winter months has been suspended after a the European court of justice ruled that it constitutes illegal state aid. Payments under the \u201ccapacity market\u201d scheme will be stopped as the government seeks to win permission from the European commission to restart it. Full story to follow. Fears over political instability hit a sale of UK government bonds this morning, with the country\u2019s debt agency forced to accept lower than usual bids, to an extent not seen since 2009 in the depths of the financial crisis. Reuters reports: The Debt Management Office said in a statement that it sold \u00a32bn of the 1.75% 2037 conventional gilt at auction. While bids received outstripped the amount on offer by 1.75 times, the makeup of the bids showed the DMO had to accept some unusually low bids to sell the full amount of the bond. The gap between the average yield accepted in a bid by the DMO and the highest stood at 5.1 basis points - the biggest since March 2009, at the depths of the financial crisis. By contrast, the average yield tail for conventional bond auctions over the last 10 years stands at just under 0.6 basis points. Gilt yields plunged along with sterling on Thursday after Brexit minister Dominic Raab and work and pensions minister Esther McVey resigned in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s draft deal for leaving the European Union. Germany\u2019s BDI industry association has given a gloomy assessment of the current state of play, warning that firms should still prepare for a chaotic Brexit. A hard Brexit would be disastrous. It would put tens of thousands of companies in Europe and hundreds of thousands of employees on both sides of the Channel in big difficulty. While talk of Theresa\u2019s May\u2019s Brexit agreement may rapidly date as the day goes on, here is the reaction from the UK car industry, which has repeatedly argued that thousands of UK jobs would be at risk without frictionless trade in Europe. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders: For the automotive industry, Brexit is about damage limitation. The outline agreement is a positive step in avoiding the devastating consequences of \u2018no-deal\u2019 and securing a transition period. It is, however, only a first step and business seeks certainty and ambition when it comes to securing a competitive future. Truly frictionless trade is the only way to ensure the industry\u2019s future success, and this should be the objective for all parties as we move into negotiating the permanent UK-EU relationship. What started out as a sea of green across European markets this morning has turned into a sea of red. When traders arrived at their desks this morning, there was a sense of relief after Theresa May survived a crucial cabinet meeting on Thursday with ministers backing her draft Brexit plan. By 10am the sense of relief had evaporated after the resignation of Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and fellow cabinet minister Esther McVey. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 is currently down 0.5% at 361. Craig Erlam, analyst at currency firm Oanda, says the \u201ccrazy\u201d trading we\u2019re seeing is likely to persist today: It\u2019s been a crazy start to trading already this morning and with the Brexit headlines likely to continue throughout the day, I don\u2019t expect that to change. What was meant to be a day of celebration for Theresa May after she received backing from her cabinet for the Brexit deal could quickly turn into a day of hell. The pound is coming under considerable pressure in response to the resignations and a potential leadership challenge, plunging around 1.5% against the dollar, euro and yen and looking vulnerable to further declines. The old saying that it never rains but it pours couldn\u2019t be more true this morning, with the October retail sales data providing the icing on the cake, recording a second consecutive decline and falling well short of expectations. I don\u2019t expect any easing up in sterling volatility today, with the resignations potentially coming thick and fast. If the pound breaks 1.27 against the dollar, things could get very messy indeed. Here\u2019s what happened to the value of the pound against the dollar when Dominic Raab tweeted his resignation at 8.53am: What now for the pound? As Garry White from Charles Stanley points out, ING have a few thoughts: The FTSE 100\u2019s earlier gains have been wiped out after Esther McVey became the second cabinet minister to resign this morning over the draft Brexit agreement. McVey said in her resignation letter: We have gone from no deal is better than a bad deal to any deal is better than no deal. The index is off 3 points or 0.1% at 7,031. Investors have been dealt another blow to confidence this morning, after the latest figures showed UK retail sales fell unexpectedly in October Sales were down 0.5% last month, easily missing expectations of a 0.2% rise and another sign of how slowing consumer confidence is hitting the sector. In slightly better news, the Office for National Statistics revised up the figure for September, to show a 0.4% fall - not quite as bad as the 0.8% fall in the first estimate. Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS: Retail sales slowed after a buoyant summer with the mild autumn hitting winter clothes sales. Household goods sales also fell in October following two consecutive months of strong home improvements sales. Consumers chose to purchase goods from many stores\u2019 websites as online sales continued to increase. Neil Wilson from Markets.com says the drop in the pound is as drastic as it might be, given the circumstances: The UK-focused FTSE 250 is down 0.9% after the Brexit secretary Dominic Raab resigned, just hours after Theresa May secured the backing of the cabinet for her draft agreement. Investors are feeling edgy now, as they digest the latest Brexit twist and consider it a negative for UK firms as it creates greater uncertainty. The FTSE 100 - comprising the UK\u2019s largest firms who make a large proportion of earnings abroad - is still in positive territory, up 0.4% at 7,059. But the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 are all firms with a major UK focus: Barratt Developments: -6.9% Persimmon: -6.5% RBS: -6.4% Taylor Wimpey: -6.3% Marks &amp; Spencer: -5.8% Royal Mail: -5.4% Berkeley Group: -5.3% Lloyds Banking Group: -4.7% ITV: -4.6% Follow our politics blog for all the latest reaction to Raab\u2019s resignation: Here is Raab\u2019s resignation letter: Those losses have just widened significantly after news breaks that Dominic Raab has resigned. Backlash starts here? Sterling is off 1% against the euro and the dollar at \u20ac1.1377 and $1.2864. Currency traders are wary this morning, putting the pound under pressure as investors digest the considerable challenges that still lie ahead for Theresa May. The pound\u2019s earlier gains against the dollar have been erased, and it is now down 0.3% at $1.2952. It looks worse against the euro, down 0.5% at \u20ac1.1423. There are no wobbles across Europe\u2019s key markets this morning, including the FTSE 100 which is up 37 points. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,071 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 11,465 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 5,094 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.6% at 19,199 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 9,171 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 363 The major business lobby groups have welcomed the news that Theresa May clinched the support of her cabinet, but acknowledged it was a compromise agreement and some key risks remain. Here are some of the key responses: Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the cliff-edge. The UK has had many months of discussion and division. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors: We urge all politicians to think long and hard about how they react to this first-stage agreement. Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal. Our members will adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but they must be allowed to do this in as smooth and orderly manner as possible. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce: Businesses will recognise the huge efforts made by the Prime Minister and across government to reach this milestone. After two and half years of uncertainty, this may be end of the beginning \u2014 but not yet the beginning of the end. Our firms need clarity and precision on the specific terms of trade they will face in future, many of which are still to be agreed. The avoidance of sudden or multiple changes to trading conditions is crucial to business investment and confidence. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound received a slight boost this morning as traders, firms, politicians and commentators consider what lies ahead after Theresa May gained cabinet backing for her draft Brexit plan. Sterling edged above $1.30 after it became clear the prime minister had averted the threat of a major rebellion - for now at least. It is now roughly flat at $1.2992. Business groups cautiously welcomed the news of cabinet approval for the draft agreement, with the CBI describing it as \u201ca step back from the cliff edge\u201d. However, Michael Hewson from CMC Markets says the pound is likely to face more volatility as events play out: Sterling traders had to endure another turbulent session on Wednesday as Prime Minister Theresa May tried to pull together the various disparate views of her cabinet in trying to sell the agreement with the EU over the thorny issue of the Irish border, as well as the outlines of the future trading relationship. While she was able to achieve what she called collective approval from her cabinet to accept the deal, the gritted teeth consensus could well be tested in the coming days, and appeared to be reflected in her tired demeanour, almost as if to brace for the whirlwind that is about to come her way in the next few days, as various cabinet members come under pressure to resign. The Prime Minister herself could well also find herself subject to a leadership challenge if reports of letters going into the 1922 committee, are anywhere close to being accurate and come to a total of 48. Having cleared this particular hurdle, the deal will now have to go to a special EU summit, later this month, before being put before the House of Commons in early December when the real fun is likely to begin, as the 585-page agreement is put before MP\u2019s to vote on. Stick with us for all the reaction from markets and business.

Most interestingly, the FTSE 100 has not fared that badly in local currency terms. But this reflects the fact that it is packed full of multinationals who benefit from a weaker currency. Indeed, in another re-run of 2016, the more domestically focused mid-cap FTSE 250 has performed a lot worse.<br></p> <p>Second, Prime Minister May\u2019s apparent failure to garner support for her deal has arguably also increased the likelihood of the opposite \u201cextreme\u201d Brexit outcome, a second referendum with an eventual vote to remain in the EU. Clearly, investors have focused more on the possibility of \u201cno deal\u201d, given the fall in sterling. And there are significant political and procedural hurdles standing in the way of another referendum. That said, there is still a sense that all bets could be off if today\u2019s Cabinet resignations and rumours of a challenge to May\u2019s leadership spell the end of her deal (and her time in Number 10).

Paul May, who ran the cake shop\u2019s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, resigned on Thursday with immediate effect, and has been replaced by Stephen Francis. However, Luke Johnson, the company\u2019s multimillionaire executive chairman, who faced criticism from investors during the stormy shareholder meeting earlier this month, will stay in his job. The company said Francis had engineered four business turnarounds since 2005, of Tulip, a farming business and producer of pork; Danwood Group, a print services firm; Vion Food Group and Vita Group, a manufacturer of foam and plastics. He has also held a number of senior roles at Barclays Capital, PricewaterhouseCoopers and McKinsey. Johnson said: \u201cHe has a strong track record of restoring value in turnaround situations, especially in the food industry, and the board looks forward to working with him in the revival of the business.\u201d To placate investors, Johnson has waived his \u00a360,000 annual salary and pledged to give up some of his jobs at other companies as he tries to save the cake shop chain after an accounting scandal that brought it close to collapse. He sits on the board of at least 17 operating companies, more than half of which he chairs. The firm managed to raise more than \u00a325m in cash through discounted share placings and an emergency loan from Johnson, the company\u2019s largest investor with a 37% stake. Johnson, who made his name with the purchase and rapid expansion of Pizza Express, last month agreed to lend \u00a320m of his own money to keep Patisserie Valerie afloat. Its finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested after the company revealed it had found \u201csignificant, and potentially fraudulent\u201d, accounting irregularities that meant it was nearly \u00a310m in debt instead of having \u00a328m in the bank, as it had last reported.",

      "bodyText": "Aston Martin is ready to fly car parts into the UK and switch to new supply routes across the channel to ensure it can keep production going if the Brexit agreement collapses. Presenting the luxury carmaker\u2019s first results since it floated on the London stock exchange in October, Andy Palmer, the chief executive, saidthe Warwickshire-based business had already increased stockpiles of car components from three days\u2019 supply to five as a precaution for a \u201cno deal\u201d outcome. He cautiously welcomed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement, which she presented to parliament on Thursday, saying it \u201cseems to tick the boxes\u201d and has allayed the car industry\u2019s concerns by guaranteeing continued free trade and frictionless borders. But Palmer noted that it still needs to be ratified by parliament, amid a number of government resignations. Aston Martin is pushing ahead with contingency plans if the UK leaves the EU without a deal next April. It is looking at switching from Dover as its main supply port to other hubs, such as Cardiff, Southampton or Sunderland. As a last resort, it is also making plans to fly in components if motorways to and from Dover get blocked. Its engines and gear boxes are made in Germany and 3,900 parts used by its production line have to be brought in from abroad. \u201cWe can\u2019t have car parts sat on the motorway around Calais or Dover,\u201d Palmer said. He said he came away feeling \u201crelieved\u201d after a phone call with the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, on Wednesday night, \u201cthat we had an alternative to a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. A \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit is a disaster. Nothing good can come of that in terms of jobs in the car industry.\u201d But he also noted that sterling would crash if there was no deal, which would make Aston Martin\u2019s exports cheaper. Other carmakers have also prepared for the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement. Bentley, another luxury brand which is owned by Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, said last month it was stockpiling components ahead of Brexit and switching from the port of Dover to Immingham to bring in certain parts. Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the sector could be lost. Aston Martin\u2019s maiden results showed that it sold 1,776 cars in the three months to September, almost twice as many as in the same period a year ago. It sold 490 in the UK, a 66% increase. Growth rates were even faster in the Americas and Asia Pacific, with sales in China doubling. The US has become the firm\u2019s biggest market. Aston Martin made revenues of \u00a3282m, up 81%, and a pretax profit of \u00a33.1m, a jump from \u00a3300,000 a year earlier. The average selling price was \u00a3136,000 in the quarter, down 7%. The luxury brand expects full-year sales to come in at the top end of expectations, at up to 6,400 vehicles. The company\u2019s shares, which floated at \u00a319, fell 7.5% to \u00a314.91 as analysts at the investment bank Jefferies said revenues had come in below expectations. Palmer noted that the the entire car industry had seen share price declines in recent weeks, due to worries over the shape of Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ve launched into rocky times, into a storm,\u201d he said of the recent stock market flotation. It valued the company at just above \u00a34bn, below its initial hopes for a price tag of over \u00a35bn. Aston Martin is in the process of opening a new factory in St Athan in South Wales, which will build the DBX, the first of seven planned new models, along with the DBS and Lagonda. The factory will spearhead the firm\u2019s electric push and will be able to produce 7,000 cars a year once it is fully up and running, similar to its existing plant in Gaydon, Warwickshire.",

      "bodyText": "Asda has come out on top in the annual festive mince pie taste test carried out by Which?, but the consumer group said overall standards are down this year as retailers opted for cheaper ingredients to keep prices down. In a blind taste test of more than 100 premium pies from 11 UK supermarkets, Asda\u2019s Extra Special mince pies were ranked first, with judges declaring a winning combination of \u201csubtle spicing\u201d and tasty pastry. Priced at \u00a31.50 for a box of six, Asda received a 71% score, with the panel scoring each pie out of 40 for taste, 20 for aroma, 20 for texture and 20 for appearance. Languishing at the bottom of the supermarket league table were the Waitrose 1 all butter mince pies, scoring 51% after being described by the panel as \u201cbeige-tasting\u201d and \u201cdevoid of any notable flavours\u201d. These were the joint most expensive pies in the supermarket test, costing \u00a32.50 for six. In bad news for consumers, the judging panel said standards had dropped this year, partly due to the rising cost of ingredients such as dried fruit and butter, which had prompted supermarkets to use cheaper, lower quality ingredients to keep prices low. \u201cNothing smells or tastes more festive than delicious mince pies warm from the oven,\u201d said Harry Rose, editor of Which? Magazine. \u201cDespite concerns over falling quality in recent years, our research shows that there are still great pies on offer this year, at a range of price points.\u201d German discount chain Lidl came second after Asda in the supermarket category, with its deluxe luxury mince pies earning a 69% score. A box of six costs \u00a31.79 and judges described a \u201cpleasantly fruity taste\u201d. The retailers included in the supermarket test were Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Iceland, Lidl, M&amp;S, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Spar, Tesco and Waitrose.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s labour market has experienced stronger than expected employment growth, allowing the unemployment rate to remain at 5%. It means the economy has met the Reserve Bank\u2019s definition of \u201cfull employment\u201d for two months in a row, despite the existence of a large cohort of workers who say they want to be working more hours. However, the strong figures come as the RBA deputy governor, Guy Debelle, warns the recent decision by major banks to clamp down on lending to residential property developers risks overshooting and contributing to a \u201cprotracted\u201d downturn in the housing market. Debelle has told a business audience in Melbourne that he thinks the tightening in lending to developers is \u201ca higher risk to the economic outlook\u201d than the clampdown on lending to homebuyers, which has ameliorated risk. It means news of the strength of the labour market must be weighed against the risks in the housing market, which are many. New figures show Australia\u2019s unemployment rate remained steady at 5% in October, matching September\u2019s unemployment rate which was the lowest level in six-and-a-half years. The unemployment rate was 5.3% in August. In seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 a statistical technique that removes the effects of seasonal variation in employment \u2013 the number of employed persons increased by 32,800 last month, after full-time jobs increased by 42,300 and part-time jobs decreased 9,500. Economists say labour market conditions are clearly robust, with the bulk of the jobs growth coming from fulltime positions \u2013 since October 2017, fulltime employment has increased by 238,800 persons, while part-time employment has increased by 69,400 persons. \u201cFulltime roles have accounted for 83% of employment growth throughout 2018, after accounting for three-quarters of growth last year,\u201d economist Callum Pickering said. \u201cAustralia is creating high-quality roles and that, more than anything, is eating into labour market slack across the country.\u201d The vast majority of jobs growth is coming from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. \u201cOf the 20,300 average monthly increase in employed fulltime persons over the past 25 months, New South Wales contributed 35.9%, Victoria 30.5%, Queensland 16.5% and Western Australia 12.1%,\u201d the ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said. \u201cThe contribution of the other states and territories was largely flat.\u201d However, even though the headline unemployment rate is a relatively low 5%, the level of \u201cunderemployment\u201d is still stubbornly high, at 8.3%. It brings the \u201cunderutilisation\u201d rate (unemployment rate + underemployment rate) to 13.3% \u2013 revealing the degree of spare capacity in the labour market that is keeping wage pressures contained. Economists say the level of underutilisation will need to decline significantly, and the headline unemployment will need to fall closer to 4%, before wage pressures build. \u201cThe still large amount of labour market slack means wage inflation pressures will remain weak,\u201d the AMP Capital chief economist, Shane Oliver, said. \u201cMeanwhile, the Australian consumer continues to face headwinds due to the ongoing housing market correction and a savings rate that is already extremely low. \u201cAs result we remain of the view that the RBA won\u2019t start raising interest rates until 2020 at the earliest and given the housing related downturn there is a significant chance that the next move could turn out to be a rate cut \u2013 although this would be unlikely before second half next year as it will take a while to change the RBA\u2019s relatively upbeat thinking on the economy and rates.\u201d In Melbourne, Debelle noted that Australia\u2019s property prices had fallen by almost 5% from their late 2017 peak, while the pace of housing credit growth had slowed over the past couple of years. He said the fall in housing prices was a combination of multiple factors, including the \u201cvery large increase\u201d in the supply of houses and apartments both now and in prospect. \u201cIt also reflects a reduction in foreign demand, which has been affected by a tightening in the ability to shift money out of China and an increase in stamp duty in some states,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have attributed the slowing in housing credit solely to a tightening in the supply by banks in response to regulatory actions. Others have suggested there has been a weakening in housing demand and so demand for credit, including because of the high level of and weaker outlook for housing prices. \u201cTo me, reductions in both the demand and supply of credit have been at play and it is hard to separate their effects.\u201d However, Debelle said recent regulatory measures had \u201csignificantly reduced the riskiness of new housing lending\u201d. \u201cThe available evidence suggests [recent regulatory measures] have meaningfully reduced vulnerabilities associated with riskier household lending and so increased the resilience of the economy to future shocks,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a decade of heartwarming tearjerkers starring a menagerie of lovable furry animals, John Lewis has resorted to old-fashioned star power to sell Christmas this year with a star turn from Sir Elton John singing his Your Song anthem. The department store chain\u2019s festive adverts have become entwined in the Christmas tradition thanks to its marketeers\u2019 ability to spin gold with a back catalogue of emotional ads that has included Monty the penguin, the sad tale of a lonely man on the moon and Moz the monster. This year the ad men and women sifted through 300 scripts before alighting on one that unites two national treasures to spur Christmas shoppers into action at a time when the high street is under mounting pressure. The number of empty retail premises in UK town centres climbed by more than 4,400 in the first six months of this year. According to the British Retail Consortium, about 85,000 retail jobs have been lost this year as 1,000 retail business entered administration \u2013 ranging from big chains such as Maplin and Poundworld to small independent traders. The John Lewis advert is bookended by the singer performing Your Song at his first piano in what is supposed to be the sitting room of his London home. The two minutes 20 seconds in the middle chart his path from school and pub gigs in the London suburb of Pinner to pop megastardom, complete with technicolour outfit changes that include a stars and stripes sequinned suit and pink mohican. With a little poetic licence the ad traces the singer\u2019s musicianship back to the Christmas gift of a piano in the early 1950s, when the then Reginald Dwight was growing up under the watchful eye of his mother and grandmother. One scene, which re-enacts him nervously playing at a school recital, is expected to bring tears to the eyes of thousands of parents of would-be musicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing John Lewis Christmas ads for some time now and what\u2019s on my mind is how we move it on creatively but hold on to the heart of what makes them special,\u201d said Craig Inglis, the customer director at John Lewis &amp; Partners. \u201cI hope audiences will watch this and really enjoy the national treasure that is Elton John.\u201d The cost of this year\u2019s extravaganza, which the retailer hopes will boost sales and sprinkle a little glitter on the John Lewis brand, is about \u00a37m. The star is thought to be receiving a six-figure fee, with the lion\u2019s share of the cash going on buying slots on TV and social media. John Lewis, which is part of the employee-owned partnership that also owns Waitrose, has had a tough year with its stores making a loss in the first six months. Some analysts have questioned the logic of pressing on with grandiose brand-building after the annual staff bonus fell to the lowest level in 64 years. Against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence going into Christmas, retailers have taken a more Scrooge-like approach this year with total spending on TV advertising expected to decline by \u00a344m to \u00a31.43bn, according to Advertising Association/Warc figures. Cash is instead being diverted to ads on social media. Struggling rival Marks &amp; Spencer has changed direction after last year\u2019s advert, starring Paddington Bear, failed to move the dial on sales. Instead its ad, featuring the TV presenter Holly Willoughby, is designed to shift party outfits and knitwear rather than make Britons feel warm inside. Ellen Hammett, a reporter at Marketing Week, said John Lewis had stuck with the big emotional storytelling that is its calling card but that it felt \u201cmore like a biopic of Elton John\u2019s life\u201d. She added:\u201cI liked it, but that\u2019s probably more to do with the fact I like Elton John than anything to do with Christmas or John Lewis. It will be interesting to see how it goes down with the general public.\u201d John Lewis says it blockbuster Christmas ads are an important investment and thus far have been among the \u201cmost effective marketing campaigns in the industry\u201d. With a \u00a3300m fortune, John \u2013 who is on a 300-date retirement tour \u2013 can afford to shop in luxury stores, but he professes to be a John Lewis regular, with some Dartington crystal glasses his most recent purchase. The superstar, who has two young sons with his husband, David Furnish, described the ad as \u201cabsolutely fantastic\u201d. \u201cThe John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family. I\u2019ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u201d John Lewis\u2019s ads have traditionally reworked a classic tune, and it is the second time Your Song has been used \u2013 the 2010 ad used a cover version by Ellie Goulding. But this time we get John singing his first major hit. Other songs featured this year include his Step Into Christmas, which is being used in a series of shorter product-focused ads. The main ad, which airs on ITV at 9.15pm on Thursday, does not rely on product placement. Shoppers will not be able to buy his embroidered silk dressing gown or tinted glasses, but John Lewis is rising to the occasion with a range of pianos. Prices start at \u00a3150 for a keyboard but if there is a really promising musician in your family there are upright pianos costing more than \u00a3800.",

According to the British Retail Consortium, about 85,000 retail jobs have been lost this year as 1,000 retail business entered administration \u2013 ranging from big chains such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/maplin-63-head-office-workers-made-redundant-administration\">Maplin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/07/last-days-poundworld-bargain-chains-econonomic-downturn-close-stores\">Poundworld</a> to small independent traders.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d60f711727500a14cc3468649d24df4a00a1d1d4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d60f711727500a14cc3468649d24df4a00a1d1d4/118_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ad depicts a young Elton John receiving a piano for Christmas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ad depicts a young Elton John receiving a piano for Christmas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lewis &amp; Partners/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The John Lewis advert is bookended by the singer performing Your Song at his first piano in what is supposed to be the sitting room of his London home. The two minutes 20 seconds in the middle chart his path from school and pub gigs in the London suburb of Pinner to pop megastardom, complete with technicolour outfit changes that include a stars and stripes sequinned suit and pink mohican.</p> \n<p>With a little poetic licence the ad traces the singer\u2019s musicianship back to the Christmas gift of a piano in the early 1950s, when the then Reginald Dwight was growing up under the watchful eye of his mother and grandmother. One scene, which re-enacts him nervously playing at a school recital, is expected to bring tears to the eyes of thousands of parents of would-be musicians.</p> \n<p><strong>\u201c</strong>We\u2019ve been doing John Lewis Christmas ads for some time now and what\u2019s on my mind is how we move it on creatively but hold on to the heart of what makes them special,\u201d said Craig Inglis, the customer director at John Lewis &amp; Partners. \u201cI hope audiences will watch this and really enjoy the national treasure that is Elton John.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a891baacd946717713bb17c4eced2557eb201d3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a891baacd946717713bb17c4eced2557eb201d3/117_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A school recital scene in the Elton John advert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The budding performer is then shown nervously playing at a school recital.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lewis &amp; Partners/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The cost of this year\u2019s extravaganza, which the retailer hopes will boost sales and sprinkle a little glitter on the <a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fchristmas%2Fc5000025%3Frdr%3D1&amp;id=114047X1572903\">John Lewis brand</a>, is about \u00a37m. The star is thought to be receiving a six-figure fee, with the lion\u2019s share of the cash going on buying slots on TV and social media.</p> \n<p>John Lewis, which is part of the employee-owned partnership that also owns Waitrose, has had a tough year with its stores making a loss in the first six months. Some analysts have questioned the logic of pressing on with grandiose brand-building after the annual staff bonus fell to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonuses-as-profits-dive-77-percent-weaker-pound-waitrose\">lowest level in 64 years</a>.</p> \n<p>Against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence going into Christmas, retailers have taken a more Scrooge-like approach this year with total spending on TV advertising expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/14/festive-advertisers-dump-tv-for-online-media\">decline by \u00a344m to \u00a31.43bn</a>, according to Advertising Association/Warc figures. Cash is instead being diverted to ads on social media.</p> \n<p>Struggling rival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> has changed direction after last year\u2019s advert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/ms-christmas-ad-paddington-bear-marks-spencer-john-lewis\">starring Paddington </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/ms-christmas-ad-paddington-bear-marks-spencer-john-lewis\">Bear</a>, failed to move the dial on sales. Instead its ad, featuring the TV presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/08/ms-to-air-low-key-christmas-ad-in-attempt-to-drive-sales\">Holly Willoughby</a>, is designed to shift party outfits and knitwear rather than make Britons feel warm inside.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"656d900ce44374b4c2a970472c5914243be91660\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/656d900ce44374b4c2a970472c5914243be91660/121_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene showing a pub gig in the Elton John ad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The route to stardom plotted by the ad includes pub gigs.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lewis &amp; Partners/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ellen Hammett, a reporter at Marketing Week, said John Lewis had stuck with the big emotional storytelling that is its calling card but that it felt \u201cmore like a biopic of Elton John\u2019s life\u201d. She added:\u201cI liked it, but that\u2019s probably more to do with the fact I like Elton John than anything to do with Christmas or John Lewis. It will be interesting to see how it goes down with the general public.\u201d</p> \n<p>John Lewis says it blockbuster Christmas ads are an important investment and thus far have been among the \u201cmost effective marketing campaigns in the industry\u201d.</p> \n<p>With a \u00a3300m fortune, John \u2013 who is on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/elton-john-announces-retirement-touring-final-tour-50-year-career\">300-date retirement tour</a> \u2013 can afford to shop in luxury stores, but he professes to be a John Lewis regular, with some Dartington crystal glasses his most recent purchase.</p> \n<p>The superstar, who has two young sons with his husband, David Furnish, described the ad as \u201cabsolutely fantastic\u201d. \u201cThe John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family. I\u2019ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46cb5e144b8de41c029191abfb825c79947c5d6f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46cb5e144b8de41c029191abfb825c79947c5d6f/121_68_3168_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elton John playing a stadium concert in the ad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This sequinned stars and stripes jacket as seen at a stadium gig will sadly not be available to buy in John Lewis stores.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lewis &amp; Partners/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>John Lewis\u2019s ads have traditionally reworked a classic tune, and it is the second time Your Song has been used \u2013 the 2010 ad used a cover version <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0zZScVSMEw\">by Ellie Goulding</a>.
