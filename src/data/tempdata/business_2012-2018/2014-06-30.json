      "bodyText": "BNP Paribas, France\u2019s biggest bank, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to pay a record-breaking penalty of nearly $8.9bn on Monday for dealing with countries that were the subject of US sanctions. Prosecutors said the bank had engaged in a \"long-term, multi-jurisdictional conspiracy\u201d involving currency trades for clients in Sudan, Iran and Cuba that was known at the highest levels at the company. The Department of Justice and New York state prosecutors confirmed the agreement minutes after a lawyer for the bank appeared in a Manhattan courtroom to answer one count of falsifying business records, and one count of conspiracy. The bank will appear in a federal courtroom later in the week. At a press conference, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, aclled the bank's actions a \"tour de fraud\". The bank's general counsel, Georges Dirani, told the judge that BNP\u2019s sanctions violations took place between 2004 and 2012. Prosecutors said senior executives at the bank knew of the activities. \u201cThis conduct, this conspiracy was known and condoned at the highest levels of BNP,\" assistant district attorney Ted Starishevsky told the court. The New York state banking regulator said it was banning BNP\u2019s office in New York from conducting US dollar clearing operations for a year from 1 January 2015. The unprecedented sanction, imposed by the New York State Department of Financial Services, will largely affect BNP's oil and gas finance business. The regulator also said 13 individuals will leave the bank as part of the settlement, including chief operating officer Georges Chodron de Courcel. His intention to leave after 42 years was announced in June without any mention of the discussions with US regulators. Other staff face demotions and bonus cuts. The fine is particularly bruising for BNP Paribas, which escaped the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed and unlike many rival banks has not paid any fines or other penalties related to the crisis. But after months of discussion and and an intervention by French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the bank agreed to plead guilty to the offences. The allegations centred on $190bn in transactions that BNP's trade-finance arm in Switzerland processed for countries under US sanctions between 2004 and 2012. In 2006, Bush administration officials warned foreign banks doing business in the US that they would be punished if they helped the sanctioned countries do business in dollars. In 2007, BNP's president told employees that the bank would stop doing business with Sudan, Iran and Cuba, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Yet regulators allege that BNP continued to deal with the blacklisted countries, and employees hid the transactions using satellite banks as fronts. The bank \u201cplaced its financial network at the service of rogue nations to improve its bottom line,\u201d said assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell on Monday. The nearly $9bn fine is a sizable one compared to BNP's profits \u2013 the bank made $6.5bn in 2013. Caldwell said the fine reflected the transactions that prosecutors believed they could prove were criminal. The penalties are in line with a stronger approach taken more recently by the US attorney general Eric Holder, who said that no bank was \u201ctoo big to jail,\u201d although no BNP employees in this case are going to prison. FBI and Department of Justice officials said at Monday's press conference that BNP\u2019s penalty was harsher because the bank \u201chindered\u201d their work. It was \u201can unprecedented penalty for unprecedented conduct\u201d, Bharara said. James Cole, deputy attorney general, said BNP shareholders had a responsibility to take a more active role: \u201cThe $9bn that\u2019s walking out the door today is your money. Until shareholders demand from their boards [of directors] that those boards choose leaders that create a healthy culture of compliance, the money will keep walking out the door.\u201d The temporary ban on dollar clearing means that BNP's clients must engage rival banks to send transactions through the financial system in the US. The sanction drew mixed reaction from analysts. RBC\u2019s Anke Reigen warned it could send ripples through the banking industry. \u201cIn our view, a harsh decision on BNP will not come without consequences for financial markets and the banks that still have to go through the same investigation as BNP,\u201d Reigen wrote, mentioning France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Germany\u2019s Commerzbank and Italy\u2019s UniCredit. Others maintained that the ban will not have a dramatic effect. Jean-Pierre Lambert, analyst at Keefe Bruyette and Woods, said it would be \"operationally feasible; likely to be invisible for [clients]; with limited financial cost for BNP.\" Lambert estimated the direct cost of the ban on BNP to be about 40m euros a year, though he did estimate that the indirect cost may include lost clients. \u201cThere is a residual risk that some clients may opt to diversify their business away from BNP.\u201d The fine was the latest against a number of foreign-owned banks in the US but, unusually, the deal included a guilty plea. Swiss bank Credit Suisse was fined $2.6bn in May 2014 for helping US citizens evade tax, offences to which it also pleaded guilty. The latest fine surpasses the $1.9bn penalty imposed on HSBC in December 2012 for sanctions-busting and money laundering offences, largely involving Mexican drug barons. US banks have also faced a number of heavy penalties, including JP Morgan, which reached a record $13bn settlement with the US authorities in November over the sale of home loan bonds. But that sum included $9bn of compensation to settle federal and civil claims over the sale of the bonds. The BNP Paribas investigation, thought to have begun as long ago as 2007, involved a number of US regulators including the Justice Department and Benjamin Lawsky, the head of the New York department of financial services, which took action against Standard Chartered in 2012. The fine will be split between the agencies. At the height of the talks, Hollande wrote to Barack Obama to complain that the fine would be disproportionate, and in June, France\u2019s foreign minister Laurent Fabius said the fine was not \u201creasonable\u201d. There have been concerns that the scale of the fine could weaken the bank by lowering its all-important capital ratios, although Michel Barnier, the European commissioner for financial services, was quoted as saying that he bank \u201ccan handle\u201d the fine. The bank appears to have underestimated the scale of the penalty after taking a provision of $1.1bn only a few months ago to cover the cost of the action by the US authorities, which has already knocked 15% off its share price. BNP head Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said: \"we deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement,\" but he also stressed the French bank's commitment to remaining in the US where it has a branch network on the West coast. BNP is setting up a new department in the US called Global Financial Security to ensure it complies with US rules, and will send all dollar transactions through its branch in New York.",

      "bodyText": "\"It could be one of the biggest and best turnarounds in corporate history,\" says Steve Murrells as he contemplates the Co-operative Group rising phoenix-like from the ashes of controversy and financial mismanagement. Murrells, who runs the group's \u00a37bn food retail empire, could be as significant a figure in the recovery of the Manchester institution as Paul Flowers, the disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman, was in its shaming. His mission to lead a turnaround of the Co-op's ailing supermarket division started in 2012, long before the black hole in the Co-op bank's balance sheet was laid bare. \"The brand was a sleeping giant that had lost its way,\" he says of his decision to join the Co-op, quitting a happy berth at Danish bacon co-operative Tulip. \"To be part of a turnaround team that could reconnect with a nation was a challenge I found compelling.\" That is lucky \u2013 because the Co-op has even more need to reconnect with its members as a result of the financial and management chaos that has shredded its ethical reputation. Despite the near-meltdown, Murrells has been quietly getting results at its food business, which accounts for 80% of group turnover \u2013 and is now floating some radical ideas as it looks to get back to practising what the Rochdale pioneers preached. \"Stores don't have to be a profit centre,\" he suggests as one avenue the grocer could go down. \"You could put everything back into a community and create a virtuous cycle.\" Murrells is looking at is the extended warranties sold by its electricals business. \"We need to find a way of getting ourselves off the drug of warranties,\" he says. \"We should be trying to provide different solutions that are in the interest of customers. You might do warranties at cost.\" That would be bad news for the likes of newly floated AO.com, which makes considerable profits from the dark art of warranties. Last year Murrells set out a five-year plan to double the Co-op's convenience chain to 4,000 stores. In that time profits are to double from the \u00a3288m Murrells inherited. At the same time it will shed most of the supermarkets acquired as part of the ill-fated \u00a31.6bn acquisition of Somerfield in 2008 as well as its farms and pharmacies businesses. With the working title \"True North\", his plan is a straightforward one that involves refurbishing stores, improving product ranges and sharpening prices. \"There was too much flip-flopping of initiatives that sat in Manchester,\" he says of a situation that had paralysed the business. \"This is a strategy from the shelf edge.\" The new job forced Murrells and his family to move \"north\" to Prestbury, Cheshire, from the sunnier climes of Stratford-upon-Avon. \"It rains a lot,\" he says of the north-west. When Murrells, a former Sainsbury's and Tesco executive, joined in the summer of 2012, trading was dire, with like-for-like sales down 5%. The picture is much healthier today with the chain seeing growth of 1% in the year to date and the convenience business at underlying growth of 4%. \"That feels like the start of the turnaround,\" he says. As price competition heats up between the big supermarket chains, Murrells has pledged to invest \u00a3100m in prices this year, \"which as a proportion of our business is more than the 'bazooka' others (like Morrisons) have announced\", he says. On a tour of a refurbished branch in the trendy Shoreditch area of London, Murrells points to upmarket new products, ranging from Ventricina salami, buffalo mozzarella and roquito pear-topped pizzas to wild Pacific pink salmon and pollock fish pie. By the end of this year 1,000 stores will have the new look or elements of it. Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts is \"very impressed\" by the refurbished stores but says makeovers are in some cases long overdue. \"The historical shortcomings of the Co-op were on range and price, and Murrells seems to be making progress in these areas,\" he says. Last week Tesco boss Philip Clarke remarked that if the market leader was just an internet and convenience store retailer, \"we would be shooting the lights out\". Murrells says while the Co-op's size relative to the big four means it will never be the cheapest, it can be the best when it comes to convenience. \"I think we are ahead in our understanding of how convenience works. Our understanding would be equal to Tesco and better than many of the others.\" Murrells, who spent 15 years at Tesco including running its One Stop convenience chain, says he is similarly alive to the threat posed by the German discounters Aldi and Lidl \u2013 and Sainsbury's recent decision to get into bed with Netto. Aldi and Lidl combined are now bigger than the Co-op, which now has just 6% of the UK grocery market \u2013 down from 25% in its heyday. \"You have to be aware of any business that has suddenly connected with the nation,\" he says. \"It's taken many years but the discounters have changed the landscape of shopping in this country and it will never go back.\" The Netto-Sainsbury's tie-up is an interesting deal he says, but \"time will tell whether it's the right decision\". \"Having another player in the market isn't helpful,\" he says. Murrells believes the mutual's darkest hours are now behind it, with a calm settling over the organisation since the decisive agm in May. \"Our members have voted for change and reform, and we now have a framework for change that will make the business stronger. You look for the good things to come out of these challenging times and during the darkest eight to nine months the food business had actually started to reconnect with customers again.\" The mutual's weakened financial state has been bad news for its 8 million members, who missed out on their annual \"divvi\", and Murrells admits there has been a slowdown in shoppers using their cards while the future shape of the scheme is being debated internally. \"Membership is critical,\" he says. \"But we have to think more smartly about it other than just the payout. We've got to provide a suite of benefits that are relevant to peoples' reasons for becoming a member. \"Those plans are being worked through right now \u2013 the alchemy of that will be very exciting.\"",

      "bodyText": "The size of French bank BNP Paribas's fine for busting US sanctions \u2013 $8.9bn (\u00a35.2bn) \u2013 has left many people, and not just President Hollande, feeling queasy. Inflation in these penalties is running wild, they cry. Are these US regulators competing with one another to generate headlines? Where's the methodology to calculate a fair fine? It's certainly true that many banks have been luckier than BNP Paribas. HSBC, it now appears, got a bargain when it agreed a $1.9bn settlement in 2012 for a \"blatant failure\" of money-laundering controls that was exploited by Mexican drug cartels. HSBC even escaped with a deferred prosecution agreement, despite the fact that its Mexican offences were hardly a momentary lapse: they ran from 2006-10. Maybe BNP Paribas had HSBC in mind when it originally set its provision at just $1.1bn. The allegations against the French bank, after all, did not involve murderous drug gangs. Rather they related to the concealing of transactions for clients in Sudan, Iran and Cuba, countries where the US had economic sanctions in place. Yet, just because HSBC got lucky, it does not follow that BNP Paribas is being harshly treated. Viewed through the lens of the sums of money involved, the French bank is in a league of its own. US investigators cite $30bn of illicit transactions, a volume that massively exceeds other cases. Paying a fine of 30 cents in the dollar for every dodgy transaction doesn't seem over the top. BNP Paribas can also afford it. The bank is being fined slightly less than last year's profits. Settling the bill may mean capital ratios have to be strengthened, but so what? Fines are not meant to be painless and shareholders' dividends are not meant to be sacrosanct. Another argument, promoted by French politicians, was that a big fine for BNP Paribas would cause lending to the French, and even the wider European, economy to be harmed. That always seem far-fetched. The only penalty that would have permanently damaged BNP Paribas would have been a ban on clearing dollar transactions. On that score, a pragmatic fudge seems to have been agreed. Culpable units within BNP will be barred, but the suspension will be temporary and BNP will have been given time to put alternative arrangements in place. A final commonly heard objection is that the US is engaged in extra-territorial reach in jumping on transactions that were merely routed through New York and did not involve US entities and would be legal in, say, France. But there's a simple answer to this point. The US has made no secret of its desire to enforce financial sanctions. If you're using the US banking system, even just as a transit point for a dollar transaction, you had better be sure you are on safe ground. BNP Paribas can have no complaints.",

      "body": "<p>The size of French bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/30/bnp-paribas-fine-us-justice-department\" title=\"\">BNP Paribas's fine for busting US sanctions</a> \u2013 $8.9bn (\u00a35.2bn) \u2013 has left many people, and not just President Hollande, feeling queasy. Inflation in these penalties is running wild, they cry. Are these US regulators competing with one another to generate headlines? Where's the methodology to calculate a fair fine?</p> <p>It's certainly true that many banks have been luckier than BNP Paribas. HSBC, it now appears, got a bargain when it agreed a $1.9bn settlement in 2012 for a \"blatant failure\" of money-laundering controls that was exploited by Mexican drug cartels. HSBC even escaped with a deferred prosecution agreement, despite the fact that its Mexican offences were hardly a momentary lapse: they ran from 2006-10.</p> <p>Maybe BNP Paribas had HSBC in mind when it originally set its provision at just $1.1bn. The allegations against the French bank, after all, did not involve murderous drug gangs. Rather they related to the concealing of transactions for clients in Sudan, Iran and Cuba, countries where the US had economic sanctions in place.</p> <p>Yet, just because HSBC got lucky, it does not follow that BNP Paribas is being harshly treated. Viewed through the lens of the sums of money involved, the French bank is in a league of its own. US investigators cite $30bn of illicit transactions, a volume that massively exceeds other cases. Paying a fine of 30 cents in the dollar for every dodgy transaction doesn't seem over the top.</p> <p>BNP Paribas can also afford it. The bank is being fined slightly less than last year's profits. Settling the bill may mean capital ratios have to be strengthened, but so what? Fines are not meant to be painless and shareholders' dividends are not meant to be sacrosanct.</p> <p>Another argument, promoted by French politicians, was that a big fine for BNP Paribas would cause lending to the French, and even the wider European, economy to be harmed. That always seem far-fetched.</p> <p>The only penalty that would have permanently damaged BNP Paribas would have been a ban on clearing dollar transactions. On that score, a pragmatic fudge seems to have been agreed. Culpable units within BNP will be barred, but the suspension will be temporary and BNP will have been given time to put alternative arrangements in place.</p> <p>A final commonly heard objection is that the US is engaged in extra-territorial reach in jumping on transactions that were merely routed through New York and did not involve US entities and would be legal in, say, France.</p> <p>But there's a simple answer to this point. The US has made no secret of its desire to enforce financial sanctions. If you're using the US banking system, even just as a transit point for a dollar transaction, you had better be sure you are on safe ground. BNP Paribas can have no complaints.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Luxembourg operations of Barclays, through which of much of the bank's controversial tax planning services are channelled, generated \u00a31.4bn of profits in 2013 \u2013 \u00a3100m for each of the 14 people employed there. In published details about the turnover, tax and headcount of the main countries in which its operates, Barclays also revealed it paid just \u00a320m of tax in Luxembourg. Barclays' chief executive, Antony Jenkins, pledged in February 2013 to close down the bank's tax avoidance unit, known as structured capital markets (SCM), as part of his efforts to clean up the reputation of the bank. However, he said the process would take several years. Much of the SCM activity was driven through Luxembourg. Lord Lawson, the former Conservative chancellor, described the business as orchestrating tax avoidance on an \"industrial scale\". The data was published by Barclays to comply with a new European Union directive and refers to the 2013 calendar year. Barclays said its turnover in Luxembourg for 2014 should be lower. \"Whilst Luxembourg will continue to be an important location for our investment banking business, our operations there are changing following the closure of the structured capital markets unit. Those changes mean the 2014 snapshot is expected to show significantly reduced turnover,\" the bank said. Barclays reported profits of \u00a32.8bn for 2013, a total headcount of 140,282 and turnover of \u00a336bn. Its new \"country snapshot\" shows Luxembourg was the most profitable country after the UK, where it reported \u00a34.9bn of profits. But Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, calculated that the UK operations of Barclays, which employs 54,595 people, made a \u00a31.4bn loss. The bank said the total figure for the UK included \u00a33bn dividends paid by other countries and \u00a32.4bn gains on internal reorganisations were stripped out. \"This is why we have not made a larger corporation tax payment [in the UK] in 2013,\" Barclays said. Barclays paid \u00a355m of corporation tax in the UK \u2013 less than the \u00a3226m of corporation tax it paid in South Africa and the \u00a3215m it handed over in the United States. The bank, which said it paid \u00a31.4bn of tax in the UK if all taxes were included, said it had an obligation to shareholders not to pay more tax than it owed: \"Tax influences decisions about how we organise and run our businesses, and about where we base our operations or hold assets. \"Making these decisions is an integral part of running a commercial organisation and where tax is a factor in deciding where or how we do business, we ensure there is a genuine substance to the activity we conduct in each country\". \"We do not seek to avoid paying our share and are proud of the contribution we make,\" Barclays added. Globally Barclays paid \u00a3830m of corporation tax, \u00a3730m of social security payments and other items to give a total tax bill of \u00a33.4bn. The bank lists Jersey, with 285 staff, as having the fifth-highest turnover of \u00a3972m, profits of \u00a3801m and paying corporation tax of \u00a39m. Singapore is next with 4,000 employees, turnover of \u00a3866m but profits of \u00a3141m and corporation tax of \u00a36m.",

Merrill moved from neutral to underperform and slashed its price target from \u00a318 to \u00a311.50. The downgrade helped push easyJet's shares 94p lower to \u00a313.65. The 6% decline made the airline the worst performer in the FTSE 100. Merrill said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We believe the consensus earnings per share upgrade story is over at easyJet, as negative yield momentum will cause confidence in the upgrade cycle to shatter.

      "bodyText": "EasyJet shares have been on the slide for a few weeks on worries about whether the budget airline can keep its growth rates sky-high. The latest pessimist to hop aboard is Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, which issued a sell note and speculated the company might have to issue a profit warning. Merrill moved from neutral to underperform and slashed its price target from \u00a318 to \u00a311.50. The downgrade helped push easyJet's shares 94p lower to \u00a313.65. The 6% decline made the airline the worst performer in the FTSE 100. Merrill said: We believe the consensus earnings per share upgrade story is over at easyJet, as negative yield momentum will cause confidence in the upgrade cycle to shatter.

      "bodyText": "Ahead of the manufacturing PMIs on Tuesday and the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday - not to mention the US non farm payroll figures the same day - markets have made a fairly quiet but mixed start to the week, writes Nick Fletcher. The fact that eurozone core inflation edged up suggested to some analysts that the ECB was unlikely to take further action in the short term, following last month's rate reduction. The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 13.83 points lower at 6743.94 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.37% to 9851.64 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.07% lower at 4433.82 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.17% down at 21,283.03 \u2022 Spain's Ibex edged down 0.33% to 10,923.5 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 13 points or 0.08% lower. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Good news for Cyprus. The IMF has confirmed the country is on track with the conditions of its bailout programme and has released the latest \u20ac84m payment. On those Fitch forecasts... (see earlier), they've actually hiked their growth forecast for the UK this year to 3%, from 2.5% back in March. On the upside, Greece is pulling in the holidaymakers, as this photo of tourists watching changing of the guard in front of the Greek parliament building shows: Greece is expecting a record 21.2 million tourists this year with the capital experiencing a particular renaissance. The travel website Tripadvisor recently estimated that international holidaymakers left around \u20ac100m to employees in the Greek tourism sector last year, Helena adds. Back to Athens.... and Greece has marked the end of its successful EU presidency by suggesting it will reinstate the wages of austerity-hit civil servants to pre-crisis levels. That could send a few tremors through Brussels. This, as Helena Smith reports, follows a decision by the Council of State, the country\u2019s highest administrative court, to restore monies lost through internationally-mandated cuts to the armed forces, emergency services and more recently the judiciary. Helena adds: Government officials have signaled they will meet representatives from the police and armed forces tomorrow to begin talks on how both can be compensated for monies lost. Economists reckon it could cost prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition as much as \u20ac650m \u2013 once again derailing the deficit and fiscal targets the government has already met under its stringent adjustment program. We can expect the outcry to grow when inspectors representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF fly into Athens for their quarterly review of the economy later this week. Good news, holidaymakers - the pound just hit $1.7085 against the US dollar, it's highest level since October 2008. Ratings agency Fitch has lowered its forecasts for global growth this year and next year, and warned that \"risks are weighted to the downside\". In a new report, Fitch cut its projection for global GDP growth this year to 2.7%, down from 2.9% in March. It also trimmed its 2015 forecast to 3.1% from 3.2%. The agency said it expects that global growth will accelerate gradually, but pointed to four key threats: \"deflation in the eurozone is a meaningful risk, the Fed's path towards normalising monetary policy could trigger heightened financial market volatility, global trade growth could slow further, and higher oil prices could hurt growth in most regions\". Fitch has cut its forecast for growth in the US this year to just 2%, from 2.8%, having seen the unexpectedly deep fall in GDP in the first three months of the year. In the eurozone, it warned that \"The recovery remains fragile\", with growth of just 1.1% in 2014, followed by 1.5% in 2015 and 1.6% in 2016. Germany and Spain are expected to outpace France and Italy in the next quarters, in contrast to the previous core-periphery dichotomy. Recovery will become more balanced as domestic demand benefits from an easing in the pace of fiscal consolidation, improved confidence and normalisation of financial conditions. But high unemployment will persist and remain above 11% until 2016. Fitch expects Europe to avoid deflation, thanks to \"rising output, anchored inflation expectations\" and the ECB's ability to do more if needed. Nonetheless, deflation or very low inflation is a meaningful risk that could raise real interest rates and debt burdens, and add to the costs of periphery rebalancing. And Fitch expects strong growth of 3% in the UK this year, slowing to 2.5% ion 2015 and 2.3% in 2016. Back to the US, and new housing data - just released - show that house sales have hit an eight month high. The index of pending home sales (stripping out new properties) rose by over 6% month-on-month in May, to its highest level since last September. That's the biggest increase since April 2010, and smashes Wall Street forecasts of a 1.5% increase in the number of house sale contracts being signed. Greece's EU presidency ends And over to Greece where the country\u2019s EU presidency has been formally wrapped up. Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: Officially concluding Athens\u2019 six-month stint at the helm of the rotating EU presidency, the deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos said debt-stricken Greece had managed to prove it was a \u201cnormal country.\u201d Without a trace of sarcasm or irony, Venizelos who oversaw much of the day-to-day workings of the presidency in his role as foreign minister said Greece\u2019s stewardship had also strengthened its place in the 28-nation bloc. He declared: \u201cThis six-month period was a six-month confirmation of the primary surplus that our country succeeded in achieving with everything that means for the completion of fiscal adjustment and the time-table of exiting the crisis,\u201d. At the helm of the union for a fifth time, Greece said Venizelos had pulled off the presidency in an \u201corganized, effective, professional and ultimately successful way.\" Venizelos added: \u201cAnd that highlights a different Greece, a Greece of orderliness, of normalcy, a Greece that can direct the EU procedures at the level of the commission.\u201d Greece had made deepening of the EU \u2013 especially in areas of economic cohesion \u2013 a top priority of its tenure along with formulating a common migration policy to help stem the flow of irregular migration into the bloc from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Athens' assumption of the six- month stint had originally been seen as a huge irony given how close Greece had come to euro exit not that long ago and the shockwaves it has sent through the European zone. The Wall Street Journal has done a handy piece on the situation in Bulgaria. Here's a flavour: This is not a mainstream coverage area for most analysts. But among those who do look at the country, most are reasonably confident that this won\u2019t precipitate a crisis for the country\u2019s central bank and its currency, which is pegged to the euro. Should Investors Worry About Bulgaria? It also points out that Bulgaria managed to sell \u20ac1.49bn of euro bonds last week at a yield, or interest rate, of just over 3%. That's pretty low for a country facing jitters (however ill-founded) over its banks. As Nomura analysts commented: \u201cFor us, this was the ultimate triumph of global investors buying simply on yield level and not fundamentals.\u201d Includes a handy pie chart showing the Bulgaria's banking sector -- there's more competition than in the UK. Back to Bulgaria - and Reuters flags up another sign of renewed confidence today. A bond issued by its fourth-largest bank has rallied in value this morning, after the EC stepped in and approved the credit line sought by the Sofia government: The dollar bond of Bulgaria's troubled Corporate Commercial Bank rallied by around 10 cents in the dollar on Monday after the European Commission sanctioned a credit line worth $2.3 billion for the country's banking sector. The bond which matures Aug 8, fell almost 25 cents last week after a run on the bank, Bulgaria's fourth biggest, fuelled worries about repayment. There's better news from Ireland, though. A border town that was once one of the UK's leading unemployment hotspots has received a massive boost with a financial technology firm creating 484 jobs. Henry McDonald, Ireland Correspondent, reports: The new posts will be in Newry which is close to the border with the Irish Republic and located partly in South Armagh - one of the most dangerous areas of Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Newry based First Derivatives currently employs about 900 people, mostly in the town but also has offices in New York, Shanghai and Sydney. It makes financial analysis software used by investment banks all over the world and also provides consultancy services. Invest Northern Ireland - the state agency that promotes new jobs and tries to entice industrial investment into the region - has offered \u00a33.9m to support the company's expansion and creation of the new posts. The firm was founded by Brian Conlon in 1996 and floated on the stock market in 2002. At that time it had just 26 employees and turnover of less than \u00a32m. Based on its current share price, the firm is worth about \u00a3188m. Politicians hailed the news: Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson said the jobs would generate more than \u00a322m a year to the local economy. Martin McGuinness, the deputy First Minister, said the new investment and jobs proved that the power sharing executive's industrial strategy was working. Disappointing growth data from Canada.. The Canadian economy grew by just 0.1% in April, half as fast as expected. The mining, construction and utilities sector all reported falling growth. Canada's economy is the 11th biggest in the world, and like the United States its economy was hit by bad weather last winter. So economists had been hoping to see a bounce-back this quarter Correction, that last photo is a different bank branch in Sofia. It's that bank again: No it's not And here's a chart showing how the UK economy has probably broken through the '08 peak (assuming other data isn't also amended), via the FT's economics editor, Chris Giles. Britain's economy appears to have finally burst through its pre-crisis peak to a new record level. It's not completely official, yet, but new data from the Office for National Statistics show that the recession that hit Britain six years ago was not as deep as previously thought. The ONS has recalculated economic growth since 1998. And one conclusion is that the Uk economy shrank by around 1 percentage point less than expected in 2009. So instead of shrinking by over 5% (the blue line) the economy actually lost just over 4% of national output (shown in purple). Growth since means the UK GDP probably hit its 2008 peak in the first three months of this year. Another milestone in the recovery. But, it's not really a reason to hang out the bunting -- Britain has still been through its slowest recovery from a recession in decades, and it doesn't help to push real wages higher. Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg Bank, agrees that the big picture is unchanged: The recession was still huge even if it has now gone from perhaps 10 to 9.9 on the Richter scale. That makes sense. To put it bluntly, the financial crisis was very bad.... The ONS now estimate the UK economy shrank 4.1% in 2009, compared to the previous estimate of a 5.2% fall. That still marks a truly disastrous period in UK economic history. The big question remains -- why has Britain's productivity stalled since the crash? Wood again: Output per hour is more than 15% below where it would have been had productivity continued growing at its average rate in the 40 years before the crisis. Upward revisions to GDP, to the extent that they represent better measured output, could lower than puzzle. Today\u2019s changes cut a little under 1 percentage point from it. In other words, they are notable but do not change the big picture. There is still a huge productivity puzzle. Just in - a photo from a branch of Bulgaria's First Investment Bank in Sofia this morning. As flagged up earlier (8.34am), Reuters reports there were \"dozens of depositors\" outside the branches, although this photo only shows the first eight in the queue: After several grim years, there is a sign today that Greek retail sales may have turned the corner. Elstat has reported that turnover across the Greek retail sector in April jumped by 8.6% compared with March, and was 3.9% higher than a year ago. And if you strip out the impact of deflation, the rise was more pronounced. In volume terms (it, in constant prices), retail sales jumped 7.5% month-on-month. This means Greek shops shifted more goods than any time since autumn 2012, excluding the last two Christmases. But still, the sector is still much smaller than before the country's deep recession began: The European Central Bank will probably be relieved that the eurozone inflation rate didn't dip even lower this month. But as Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight, inflation in Germany did strengthen this month (to 1%), but was balanced by flat prices in Spain, and inflation of just 0.2% in Italy He adds: Eurozone consumer price inflation has been stuck in a 0.5-0.7% range since February, having first dipped to 0.7% in October 2013. This suggests that while Eurozone consumer price inflation remains markedly too low for the ECB\u2019s comfort, it has been stuck at a very low rate rather than headed towards deflation. Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole predict that 'core' eurozone inflation will remain worryingly low this year, and in 2015: There's nothing in today's eurozone inflation data to force more action from the ECB on Thursday, reckons Jeremy Cook of World First: Food, drink, and tobacco prices across the eurozone have actually fallen by 0.2% this month compared with June 2013. That helped to pin the wider inflation rate down at a four-year low of just 0.5%. The price of manufactured goods were flat, year-on-year, and energy prices crept higher. But inflation in the service sector picked up, to 1.3% in June compared to 1.1% the previous month. Eurozone inflation remained unchanged at 0.5% in June, according to the flash estimate from Eurostat, as food and drink prices keep falling. It's the ninth month running that eurozone inflation has been below the target of just below 2%, as the area remains mired in a low-inflationary environment There is one sign that the eurozone is clawing away from deflation, though -- core inflation (stripping out volatile measures) crept up to 0.8%. But it also underlines that the European Central Bank was right to announce new stimulus measures earlier this month. Details and reaction to follow.... Back in the UK, the number of mortgages approved has dropped to an 11-month low. Just 61,707 home loans were approved in May, suggesting that tougher mortgage approves tests and talk of higher interest rates may be cooling the market. Analysts at Nomura reckon that Bulgaria's currency board -- which pegs the lev in the foreign exchange markets - is probably not at risk, yet... Heads-up, we get the first estimate of eurozone inflation for June in 15 minutes. That will show whether the cost of living has crept up, having slipped to just 0.5% annually in May. With technical default looming, Argentina has taken its message straight to the readers of the FT and the Guardian. It has placed full-page adverts in both papers today, insisting that it has paid the bond coupon due today - and lambasting the US courts for blocking it on Friday night. The advert, headlined \"Argentina Pays\", accuses the US Supreme Court of being \"biased\" in favour of the vulture funds which are demanding to be repaid in full. Today's $832m payment is owed to creditors who restructured their debt after the 2001 default, and who Argentina insists it really, really wants to remain loyal too. But it refuses to accept the \"absurd\" ruling that it must also repay $1.5bn to the vulture funds. If that payment is missed (as seems inevitable after it was blocked), then Argentina will be declared in technical default. BUT it would then have a month to haggle a deal with the vultures. In the UK, people are digesting yesterday's warning from Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean that interest rates could hit 5% within a decade. Could you cope? Let us know in this poll. Shares in Bulgarian banks are soaring this morning, as confidence returns to the stock market. First Investment Bank, which was hit by last week's bank run, jumped over 30% in early trading. Other shares posted double-digit gains. Traders say that the EC's new credit line, and the pledge from the Bulgarian president that deposits are safe, have helped to restore trust As this chart shows, Bulgarian bank stocks are leading the risers: This pushed the main stock index, the SOFIX, up over 5%, reversing some of its recent losses. Reuters reports that queues are forming again outside bank branches in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, this morning, despite president Plevneliev's call for calm. But the lines are shorter than on Friday, their reporter Angel Krasimirov, reckons. And many people may not have heard about the EC credit line yet (only announced 90 minutes ago) Krasimirov reports: At one branch about 30 people were queuing, about half the number seen at midday on Friday. Bulgaria's No. 3 bank says it has enough capital to meet customers' demand. \"I am here because I remember what happened nearly 20 years ago,\" said a 60-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Gergana, referring to a financial crisis in 1996-7 which sparked hyperinflation and the collapse of 14 banks. \"I trust the president but I think he was misled by the bankers,\" she said. Another customer, Ivan, said he would move his savings to a foreign-owned bank. This new \u00a31.35bn credit line from the EC will give Bulgaria's banks an extra source of funding to tap; designed to reassure Bulgarians that their deposits are safe. The announcement came hours after the country's president, Rosen Plevneliev, urged people to remain calm. Plevneliev told a press conference that the queues outside branches were caused by malicious rumours: \"There is no cause or reason to give way to panic. There is no banking crisis, there is a crisis of trust and there is a criminal attack,\" \"These need to be overcome and those responsible prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" He had earlier met with politicians and central bankers yesterday, to discuss the situation As flagged in the opening post, five people were arrested over the weekend \u2013 suspected of stirring up the panic. The European Commission has offered Bulgaria's banking system its assistance, to prevent the country's banking system sliding deeper into trouble, after last week's bank runs. It announced this morning that it has approved a request from Bulgaria to extend a credit line of 3.3 billion levs (or \u00a31.35bn), to support its banks. The EC explained: \"The Commission concluded that the state aid implied by the provision of the credit line is proportionate and commensurate with the need to ensure sufficient liquidity in the banking system in the particular circumstances.\" The authorities in Brussels also tried to calm savers' worries, having seen the queues that built up outside branches of two major Bulgarian banks in recent days. It insisted that Bulgaria's banking system was: \"well capitalised and has high levels of liquidity compared to its peers in other member states. For precautionary reasons, Bulgaria has taken this measure to further increase the liquidity and safeguard its financial system\". The Bulgarian authorities have blamed the bank runs on people spreading mis-information. But there's no doubt people are worried On Friday, many depositors at First Investment Bank, the country third-largest lender, dashed to withdraw their savings - forcing it to shut until this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. (and commiserations to our regular readers in Greece after last night's football). Coming up today: We'll be watching Bulgaria, which was hit by a spate of bank runs last week amid speculation that its banking sector was wobbling. Over the weekend, five people were arrested, suspected of plotting to destabilise the system. The government has urged people not to panic when branches re-open today. Argentina is likely to enter 'technical default' today, having refused to comply with a US court ruling to pay 'hold-out' creditors. This will trigger a 30-day grace period, so there's still time for an agreement to be hammered out..... Plus there's the usual sprinkling of corporate news -- the most eye-catching is that Merlin, the theme park firm, is opening a Legoland in Japan. I'll be tracking all the key points through the day...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McBride, a supplier of own-label household cleaning products, is to axe a quarter of its UK workforce as the supermarket price war and tough grocery market take a toll on profits. The Manchester-based company said it had begun a consultation about 400 redundancies at its four British manufacturing plants in an attempt to save \u00a312m a year by 2016. The restructuring, which will affect jobs in Barrow, Middleton, Bradford and Hull, will also lead to the writedown of \u00a321m of assets and \u00a36m of goodwill this year. Chief executive Chris Bull said the company faced \"the most competitive period I have ever seen in the UK market\", and that the cuts were aimed at helping to restore profitability at its British business, which makes up about a third of sales. While the company supplies fast-growing discounters such as Aldi as well as the major supermarkets, those newcomers are still a relatively small part of the market and McBride's customer base. Bull said McBride's profit margins had come under pressure as retailers cut prices. \"The biggest retailers are the ones having the biggest challenges,\" he said. \"There is weak overall demand, a weak retail environment and players are fighting for market share.\" The \"big four\" supermarkets have all been forced into a tit-for-tat price war as they have begun to lose market share to discounters including Aldi and Lidl in the past year. The battle stepped up a gear in May when Bradford-based Morrisons said it was cutting the price of 1,200 products by an average 17% in a bid to stem falling sales. McBride continues to see growth in other European markets \u2013 even in France, where the economy is weaker than the UK \u2013 but the combination of weak consumer demand and price competition mean sales in its home market are falling back. Full year revenues at the group are expected to decline by 3%. \"The overall retail environment is tough for most participants and there is a high degree of promotional activity particularly in our categories,\" Bull said. A sustained period of big promotional campaigns by international household cleaning brands as well as cheap new brands coming into the market has hit sales of own-label washing powders, floor cleaning fluids and air fresheners. Bull said some brands were selling for lower than half price, putting their prices on a par with retailers' own-label alternatives. McBride plans to exit or reduce its range in some non-core unprofitable categories, such as air fresheners, Bull said. Darren Shirley, an analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers, said McBride was \"a company not in charge of its own destiny, sitting uncomfortably between under-pressure retailers, aggressive and promotional (grocery) branded operators and a potentially volatile crude oil price.\" He said the costs of the restructuring would lead to significant losses and an increase in debts, that net debt was likely to rise to \u00a3110m by June next year \u2013 up from \u00a360m in 2010 \u2013 while he expected sales to be flat on a constant currency basis.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's recession was not as deep as feared and the economy has already returned to its pre-crisis strength, official growth estimates suggest. Using updated statistical rules coming into force later this year, the Office for National Statistics said the drop in output in 2009 was probably not as deep as previously thought. Instead of shrinking 5.2%, GDP contracted by 4.1%. The changes, which will be revealed in full in the autumn, come on the back of planned improvements in measuring the size of the economy. The ONS had already said Britain's economy could be as much as \u00a365bn bigger \u2013 almost 5% \u2013 when new GDP figures are published in September that incorporate items such as prostitution and drug dealing under the new rules. Monday's revelation probably meant that the economy had already returned to its previous peak during the early months of 2014, economists said, slightly earlier than expectations that the milestone would be reached during the current April to June quarter. The ONS said last week that the economy in the first quarter was 0.6% below the pre-crisis peak. But Rob Wood, chief UK economist at the German private bank Berenberg, cautioned against over-interpreting the small change in timing. \"The revisions do not change the big picture,\" he said. \"The recession was still huge even if it has now gone from perhaps 10 to 9.9 on the Richter scale. To put it bluntly, the financial crisis was very bad.\" The UK has taken longer than other advanced economies to regain its pre-recession strength, and because of population growth it has still not regained the peak in terms of GDP per capita. But its growth rate has outstripped other advanced economies, prompting upgrades to outlooks from the International Monetary Fund and other forecasters. The credit ratings agency Fitch became the latest to revise its outlook for the UK higher yesterday, forecasting that the UK economy will grow 3% this year, up from a forecast of 2.5% made in March. That puts the UK ahead of Fitch's growth forecast for the global economy of 2.7% in 2014 and ahead of the US on 2.0%. The agency forecasts UK growth will slow to 2.5% in 2015 and to 2.3% in 2016. The UK's relative strength compared with other big economies has prompted speculation that the Bank of England will raise interest rates well before its central bank counterparts in the US and eurozone. This has seen the pound strengthen against other major currencies, bringing cheer to UK holidaymakers heading overseas but dampening the mood of exporters. Optimism about the UK outlook and worries that the US will struggle to shake off a difficult start to the year helped lift the pound to its highest level against the dollar since October 2008 yesterday. Sterling pushed through $1.71 to a high of $1.7114 as the dollar was under pressure from weaker than expected business activity figures. The pound also gained against the euro, as the European single currency dipped 0.1% to 80.04p.",

      "bodyText": "The number of mortgages approved in the UK fell to the lowest level for almost a year last month, suggesting that tighter lending rules may be taking some of the heat out of the property market. The Bank of England said 61,707 mortgages were approved in May, down from 62,806 in April and broadly in line with expectations in a Reuters poll of economists. It was the lowest monthly total since June 2013. Mortgage approval numbers are closely followed by economists as a timely indicator on housing market activity, which some surveys suggest has come off the boil in recent months. The dip in May approvals follows the introduction of new lending rules in April under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR), which force banks and building societies to undertake tough affordability checks before they grant loans. The Bank of England has been closely monitoring property prices for signs of a bubble but has so far held off from imposing any of its own forceful policies to rein in the market. Last week its financial policy committee introduced measures that will only bite if house prices rise more than 20% by early 2017. Paul Hollingsworth at the thinktank Capital Economics said the latest data provided more evidence of the housing market recovery losing steam. \"Given that the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) refrained from introducing any measures to sap the housing market recovery of its current momentum last week, the latest money and credit figures may come as a welcome sign that the housing recovery is losing some steam of its own accord,\" he said. \"This was the fourth successive fall in approvals, and leaves them at their lowest level since June last year, and 19% below this January's peak.\" Rob Wood, UK economist at German private bank Berenberg, said house prices would still shoot up this year even if recent changes by the BoE and the mortgage market review might have a short-term influence on buyers' behaviour. \"After the temporary disruption from tighter regulations has passed, we expect approvals to return to their upward trend and we look for house prices to gain 10% in 2014 and 2015,\" he said. The BoE's data on the amount of mortgage lending showed it rose more than expected by \u00a31.99bn in May \u2013 the biggest increase since July 2008. Unsecured lending to consumers also rose faster than expected, up by \u00a3740m in May, well above forecasts for \u00a3600m. There were some reassuring signs for business groups who have complained that a lack of access to bank loans has been stopping companies from making the most of the economic recovery. Lending to businesses rose by \u00a33.41bn in May, the biggest increase since records began in May 2011. But the numbers should only get a cautious welcome, said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. He pointed out that net lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) fell by \u00a3152m in May, although that was a much smaller drop than in March and April. \"While a welcome development, it remains to be seen if May's marked increase in lending to businesses is the start of an improving trend. There have been false dawns before,\" he said. \"With the UK sustaining a decent level of economic activity and prospects currently looking pretty bright, business demand for credit seems likely to pick up appreciably over the coming months. And it is vitally important for sustained, balanced UK growth that all companies who are in decent shape and who do want to borrow \u2013 whether it be lift investment, explore new markets or generally support their operations \u2013 can do so, and at a non-punishing interest rate. This applies to all companies, whatever their size.\"",

And rather than talk just about increasing in temperatures in these regions, it talks about the impact of those temperatures on people\u2019s livelihoods.<b><br></b></p> <p>While the sole focus on the US and its specific regions may seem like typical American insularity, it is more about acknowledging that all politics is local.<b><br></b></p> <p>As Upton Sinclair noted, \u201cIt is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\u201d<b><br></b></p> <p>And if that person is a corn farmer in Iowa, telling him about the impact of climate change on the Pacific Islands is unlikely to do the trick (important though it is).<b><br></b></p> <p>President Obama noted the need to address this aspect in his speech, saying, \u201cPeople don\u2019t like gas prices going up. They don\u2019t like electricity prices going up. And we ignore those very real and legitimate concerns at our peril, so if we\u2019re blithe about saying this is the defining issue of our time but we don\u2019t address people\u2019s legitimate economic concerns, then even if they are concerned about climate change they may not support efforts to do something about it.\u201d<b><br></b></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://riskybusiness.org/uploads/files/RiskyBusiness_PrintedReport_FINAL_WEB_OPTIMIZED.pdf\">Risky Business report </a>addresses these impact by noting the increase in temperatures across the continental US under various scenarios:<b><br></b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-97fd52e5-d971-4e68-abb1-fd287edecfc9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/30/1404098841132/0af7ea6e-47b3-4906-b62e-04f563b1dd42-365x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Days over 35 degrees US \" width=\"365\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Projected and historical days over 37 degrees US. Photograph: Risky Business report/Rhodium</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it notes that these increased temperatures will drive an increase in electricity consumption owing to more people using air conditioners more often. The report argues that higher peak demand for electricity \u201cwill likely require the construction of up to 95 GW of additional power generation capacity over the next five to 25 years, the rough equivalent of 200 average-size coal or natural gas power plants\u201d.<br></p> <p>It argues \u201cconstructing these new power-generation facilities will, in turn, raise residential and commercial energy prices\u201d. Thus, \u201cclimate-driven changes in heating and cooling will likely increase annual residential and commercial energy costs nationally by $474m to $12bn over the next five to 25 years and $8.5bn to $30bn by the middle of the century.\u201d</p> <p>The report also notes the impact of the increased temperatures on industry \u2013 with an especially harsh impact on crop yields. It asserts that some states \u201clike Missouri and Illinois, face up to a 15% likely average yield loss in the next five to 25 years, and up to a 73% likely average yield loss by the end of the century\u201d.<b><br></b></p> <p>It also forecasts the humid heat stroke index (HHSI) in each region. The index measures the point at which people who work outdoors would be unable to do so without significant risk to health and potential death.<b><br></b></p> <p>The report notes that \u201cthe only place in the world that has ever reached the unbearable HHSI of 95\u00b0F (37C) was Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 2003. At the time, the outside temperature was 101\u00b0F (38.5C) and the dew point was 90\u00b0F (32C)\u201d.<b><br></b></p> <p>But such temperatures are headed to the US midwest. It forecasts that on the current path of temperature rises \u201cthe average midwesterner could see an HHSI at the dangerous level of 95\u00b0F two days every year by late century, and that by the middle of the next century she or he can expect to experience 20 full days in a typical year of HHSI over 95\u00b0F\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-bedde4af-50e9-4255-b3b2-3a1317bb0d20\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/30/1404091790431/5bd90348-0253-4989-9aa7-f98b9254ea63-414x420.png\" alt=\"Humid heatstroke index\" width=\"414\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humid heatstroke index for the US.

And we ignore those very real and legitimate concerns at our peril, so if we\u2019re blithe about saying this is the defining issue of our time but we don\u2019t address people\u2019s legitimate economic concerns, then even if they are concerned about climate change they may not support efforts to do something about it.\u201d The Risky Business report addresses these impact by noting the increase in temperatures across the continental US under various scenarios: But it notes that these increased temperatures will drive an increase in electricity consumption owing to more people using air conditioners more often. The report argues that higher peak demand for electricity \u201cwill likely require the construction of up to 95 GW of additional power generation capacity over the next five to 25 years, the rough equivalent of 200 average-size coal or natural gas power plants\u201d. It argues \u201cconstructing these new power-generation facilities will, in turn, raise residential and commercial energy prices\u201d. Thus, \u201cclimate-driven changes in heating and cooling will likely increase annual residential and commercial energy costs nationally by $474m to $12bn over the next five to 25 years and $8.5bn to $30bn by the middle of the century.\u201d The report also notes the impact of the increased temperatures on industry \u2013 with an especially harsh impact on crop yields. It asserts that some states \u201clike Missouri and Illinois, face up to a 15% likely average yield loss in the next five to 25 years, and up to a 73% likely average yield loss by the end of the century\u201d. It also forecasts the humid heat stroke index (HHSI) in each region. The index measures the point at which people who work outdoors would be unable to do so without significant risk to health and potential death. The report notes that \u201cthe only place in the world that has ever reached the unbearable HHSI of 95\u00b0F (37C) was Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 2003. At the time, the outside temperature was 101\u00b0F (38.5C) and the dew point was 90\u00b0F (32C)\u201d. But such temperatures are headed to the US midwest. It forecasts that on the current path of temperature rises \u201cthe average midwesterner could see an HHSI at the dangerous level of 95\u00b0F two days every year by late century, and that by the middle of the next century she or he can expect to experience 20 full days in a typical year of HHSI over 95\u00b0F\u201d. But American climate change politics does have one similarity with Australia \u2013 the opposition to it. Republicans in congress reacted to the EPA\u2019s new rules by suggesting the Obama administration was waging a \u201cwar on coal\u201d and they were likely to try and block the new rules. Economist Paul Krugman responded to Henry Paulson\u2019s op-ed in the New York Times launching the Risky Business report by noting that the Republican party which \u201crespects science and is willing to consider even market-friendly government interventions like carbon taxes, no longer exists\u201d. Given our government has dismantled a carbon tax, during which time Australia\u2019s economy grew among the fastest of all OECD nations, Krugman\u2019s comment might just as well be targeted at the Liberal party: At least with reports like Risky Business politicians the world over have pretty much run out of the excuse of saying they weren\u2019t aware of the risks.",
