But, even so, the Rothschild story was not meant to turn out like this.</p> <p>Having worried his family with his exploits during his school and university days at Eton and Oxford, the playboy partygoer transformed his image into that of a workaholic, jet-setting financier who drank cola instead of cocktails and would fly anywhere on his private jet to seal a deal.</p> <p>While he clearly started with considerable advantages in life, he managed to earn respect in financial circles by being seen to have made money by using his wits, work ethic and family name, and not simply by exploiting the vast fortune generated by his forebears.</p> <p>Still, Rothschild is thought to have initially attempted to rope his father, Lord (Jacob) Rothschild, into the Vallar deal via his $2bn investment trust RIT Capital Partners. When Rothschild <em>p\u00e8re</em> declined, the son decided to take somebody else's idea and run with it himself.</p> <p>In February 2010 the British entrepreneur Hugh Osmond had raised \u00a3400m by floating a cash shell called Horizon in order to acquire indebted companies and restructure them. Rothschild called Osmond's bankers at Credit Suisse to ask if they might do the same for him.

A valedictory communication with investors as the fund was effectively closed in 2009 recorded that Atticus Global was up 19% annually, after fees, compared with a gain of 3.9% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. Rothschild was a massive winner personally too: <em>Alpha</em>, a hedge fund industry magazine, estimated his 2007 earnings to be $250m.</p> <p>None the less, the full Atticus story is not an entirely glowing one. As the financial system imploded in 2008, Atticus clients became some of the crisis's most high-profile victims. Investors were withdrawing funds at an alarming rate, and Atticus's asset base shrank from a peak of around $20bn to around $5bn, which it returned to clients in 2009. Investors wer riled by the fund's treatment of a $1bn investment in Deutsche B\u00f6rse, which Atticus separated from its main funds: clients argued that this limited their ability to withdraw their money.</p> <p>A further $1.2bn was briefly run as a separate European fund called Attara Capital; it closed this year after assets shrank again.

But Vallar and Vallares \u2013 the cash shell that became Genel \u2013 were undoubtedly his creations. Rothschild's pitch was that he would use the funds raised to acquire natural-resources assets in emerging markets, impose western standards of governance on these companies, and thereby unearth hidden gems.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron proudly announced in Brazil last week that he had helped British businesses to bring in \u00a3100m in contracts. That's great news; but since UK plc ran up a trade deficit of \u00a310bn \u2013 one hundred times that \u2013 in a single quarter earlier this year, it barely registers as a drop in the ocean. Encouraging foreigners to buy British is just part of the coalition's effort to rebalance the economy, away from unsustainable asset bubbles and buy-now-pay-later consumer spending, towards manufacturing, which tends to create more jobs, and more export earnings. The logic of George Osborne's argument about instigating a \"march of the makers\", spelled out in last year's budget, was impeccable. But the picture of Britain that emerged from the balance of payments numbers published last week showed that transforming an economy is much tougher than crafting soaring rhetoric \u2013 or shaking hands with a few Brazilian businessmen. Britain's current account deficit with the rest of the world \u2013 the trade deficit, plus the losses UK plc makes on its overseas ventures \u2013 has hit its highest level ever, at \u00a321bn, above 5% of GDP. In other words, we're living well beyond our means. Back in the days before Britain struck oil in the North Sea and opened up the City to allcomers, a poor set of balance of payments statistics was political dynamite. If the country couldn't pay its way in the world \u2013 because it wasn't exporting enough to afford the foreign goods consumers wanted to buy \u2013 it was a severe blow to national pride, which risked triggering a sterling crisis; a recurring nightmare for 20th century British politicians. Those days disappeared with the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and the overseas earnings that came from North Sea oil. During Labour's 13 years in office, it was de rigueur to claim that, just as boom-and-bust was a thing of the past, the dull old trade figures, measuring the value of the aircraft and machine tools we had flogged abroad, were no longer a critical indicator of economic success. A slowly increasing surplus on services such as the banking, law and management consultancy in which the Brits so excel also helped to fuel the idea that in the \"knowledge economy,\" a rapidly widening deficit in old-fashioned tangible exports didn't matter. At the same time, a credit splurge and a house-price boom convinced us our buying power was increasing. But with oil and gas extraction in the UK's mature fields now well past its peak, that era is over. The US economist C Fred Bergsten argued in a 2002 paper that industrial countries \"enter a danger zone of current account unsustainability when their deficits reach 4\u20135% of GDP \u2026 At these levels, corrective forces tend to arise either spontaneously from market forces or by policy action.\" Jim Leaviss, of City investor M&amp;G, pointed out that each time in the past 50 years the current account deficit has exceeded 3% or so, it has precipitated a steep slide in sterling. A devaluation would not be a wholly bad thing \u2013 it would help to make our goods cheaper on international markets, and smooth the transition to a more externally focused, less skewed economy. And there are some thriving pockets of industry (albeit largely foreign-owned), such as car-making, that could benefit relatively quickly. But by driving up the price of imports, a depreciation would also bring a surge in inflation, hammering consumers' spending power; and what the past four years of non-recovery helps to show is that there is nothing automatic about rebalancing. As Vince Cable has recognised \u2013 though business groups doubt his power to match promises with actions \u2013 fitting the economy to compete in the world will take a conscious industrial strategy from government. We can't assume that an army of vibrant exporters will spring up unbidden from the depths of a double-dip recession. If it is serious about aligning the rhetoric up with reality, the coalition will have to do battle with an army of well-documented problems facing the UK's out-of-kilter economy: the perceived inferiority of vocational education; the lack of in-work training and career paths through lower-skilled industries; the short-termism of the financial institutions on which firms rely for financing; and the tendency to cut investment to the bone when times are tough. Ed Miliband has listed some of these as areas he hopes to tackle as part of his new-found philosophy of \"pre-distribution\", which we may hear more about at this week's Labour conference. In truth, they are blunt instruments when it comes to narrowing the gap between rich and poor, and ensuring a fairer share of the economy's resources between those at the top and bottom of the income scale. A more direct approach \u2013 taboo to modern Labour, and impossible for Miliband to countenance \u2013 would be to work towards strengthening workers' bargaining power, and ditching the dogma of \"flexible labour markets\", which is effectively a claim to create jobs by driving down wages, undermining aggregate demand in the process. But that doesn't mean all these problems aren't worth tackling, in a bid to make Britain work better, particularly if, as the latest official data suggest, productivity across the economy has been hit hard by the crisis. Both sides of the political spectrum should be looking again at the tax treatment of debt and equity financing, for example, and whether capital allowances are generous enough to spur investment. Nick Clegg said in his conference speech last week that rebuilding a new economy from the \"rubble\" of the old would be a \"gargantuan task\". Judging by the scale of the current account deficit, he's not kidding.",

      "bodyText": "Spain Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has battled for months to avoid the indignity of applying for a formal bailout from his European partners. With Spain much closer to the single currency's heart \u2013 both geographically and politically \u2013 than laggardly Greece, Rajoy has received plenty of support, including the promise of a \u20ac100bn injection of funds directly into the bombed-out banking sector. After Friday's announcement of the results of an audit of the sector revealed a \u20ac60bn black hole, those funds will be essential. But with borrowing costs for Spain climbing close to the 6% level that has repeatedly signalled danger throughout the crisis, most euro-watchers expect Rajoy to be forced to accept a package of aid, along with the strict list of terms and conditions that would imply. Meanwhile, Moody's is expected to deliver its verdict on Spain's sovereign debt rating in the coming days, and a downgrade could just be the catalyst the markets need to drive up Madrid's borrowing costs to dangerous levels. Last week's Spanish budget, which contained numerous new spending cuts and reform measures and won the approval of the European commission, was widely seen as a bid to pre-empt any extra austerity measures that Spain's creditors might be likely to impose. A bailout would allow European Central Bank president Mario Draghi to deploy his \"outright monetary transactions\" and make unlimited purchases of Spain's bonds. But going cap in hand to the troika \u2013 the ECB, European commission and International Monetary Fund \u2013 would still be a deep political humiliation for Rajoy, at a time when Spain's regional leaders are jockeying for independence and sky-high unemployment of more than 25% is imposing an excruciating cost on the population. Even if Rajoy can drive through the measures needed to secure a bailout in the face of mass public opposition, hold the Spanish state together despite growing separatist sentiment and rebuild the country's battered banks, the road back to prosperity looks like a long, hard one \u2013 and that's already a lot of ifs. Greece Rumour has it in Brussels that eurozone politicians have sworn not to push Greece out until after Barack Obama is safely back in the White House. But few analysts believe it has a long-term future in the single currency. After fraught negotiations that stretched on all summer, the coalition government, led by Antonis Samaras, appeared last week to have reached agreement on a new package of cuts, which it hopes will satisfy the demands of the troika. But Greece's economy remains in a wrenching recession, and it looks likely they will continue to miss the goals set by international lenders, even if the next \u20ac31bn (\u00a324.7bn) disbursement from its bailout fund is released. Eventually, Greece's partners may decide to let it go \u2013 especially if they believe they have elected a solid firewall that would prevent a \"Grexit\", as it's known, creating a devastating chain reaction in financial markets. And Greece could yet decide to leave of its own accord, if domestic political pressure becomes too intense. With Samaras elected on a promise he would exact concessions from the country's creditors, the political reaction to a fresh round of cuts from a population already scarred by the downturn is likely to be furious. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails at riot police at a protest during last week's general strike, the latest of many as the workforce has endured cuts in benefits, wages, pensions and public services to meet the troika's deficit targets. In theory, the \"internal devaluation\" Greece is going through is aimed at making the country's goods more competitive on world markets by cutting the cost of production. But there is little sign that growth is about to be restored. \"If you look at what Greece is going through, it's comparable with the Great Depression,\" says Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research, pointing out that economic output has already plunged an extraordinary 20% since the start of the crisis. \"The US Great Depression didn't end because of austerity, it ended because they left the gold standard and they had a massive devaluation, and because fiscal policy was moving in the right direction.\" Hardliners One of the things that most alarmed Europe's financial markets last week was the outcome of an obscure meeting in Helsinki that suggested the single currency's paymasters have decided to play hardball. Finance ministers from the Netherlands, Germany and Finland \u2013 the eurozone's paymasters, and also its most hardline members \u2013 gathered for talks in the Finnish capital and issued a statement clarifying the eurozone rescue deal that was reached after make-or-break talks in June. At the time, the agreement appeared to mark a positive departure in the crisis, helping to sever the connection between the balance sheets of sickly banks and the finances of states. It was agreed \u2013 or so it appeared \u2013 that the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), would be allowed to inject money directly into ailing banks in eurozone countries. That would prevent their governments from having to apply for a full-blown bailout, with all the attendant misery of troika inspections, and halt the vicious circle in which bank bailouts shift losses onto the public finances and weaken public finances by depressing the value of the government bonds that are the banks' main source of capital. However, after last week's discussions in Helsinki, the canny northern Europeans spelt out their conditions. Before the ESM can bail out banks, they insisted that the eurozone-wide banking union must be \"established\" and its \"effectiveness\u2026 determined\" \u2013 which is a tough hurdle, since the plan so far remains a glint in Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso's eye. More importantly, they insisted that \"legacy assets\" \u2013 that is, all the dodgy loans from the credit crisis era, must remain \"the responsibility of national authorities\". At a stroke, they seemed to dash Ireland's hopes of receiving help from its eurozone neighbours for the cost of its massive banking bailout and undermine Spain's hopes of repairing its financial sector without Madrid going cap in hand to the troika. But most damagingly, the announcement from Helsinki underlined the fact that, in the long-running eurozone crisis, the devil is always in the detail. Italy With Spain still firmly in the markets' crosshairs, Italy's moment of danger appeared to have passed, at least for the time being. But after 30,000 strikers forced the closure of the Colosseum on Friday as they marched in Rome against the government's public sector cuts, political support for austerity in the eurozone's third-largest economy is looking increasingly fragile. A year into a deep recession, the technocratic prime minister Mario Monti, installed last November after intense pressure from the markets and eurozone politicians helped force Silvio Berlusconi out of office, is struggling to meet his budget goals. His support is also fading \u2013 though he said last week that he might agree to stay on if elections, due to be held in the spring, failed to yield a definitive result. He has acknowledged the concerns of protesters, saying his austerity policies have subjected the public to an \"unprecedented amount of sacrifices\". When the ECB president Mario Draghi announced his policy of \"outright monetary transactions\" \u2013 or OMT \u2013 the expectation in financial markets was that Italy would follow Spain in asking for an official EU bailout so that it could benefit from the scheme, which is designed to bring down weaker governments' borrowing costs by buying their bonds. But that would be a severe political humiliation \u2013 and, what's worse, it is not even clear that Europe has the money. As Karen Guinand of the bank Lombard Odier put it in a research note last week: \"If and when Spain does appeal for help, another problem will then emerge: much of the EFSF/ESM [bailout fund] resources would probably be used up \u2026 leaving little for Italy.\" Once a Spanish bailout happens \u2013 and most analysts now believe it is a case of when, not if \u2013 attention will inevitably turn to Italy, just as the country gears up for a general election in which Berlusconi and his supporters are expected to run on an anti-euro ticket. The former prime minister last week described the single currency as a \"big swindle\"; staying inside the euro will require more painful sacrifices, and Italians may decide that they have had enough. Growth Even if all the other pieces fall into place \u2013 the Spanish bailout, the latest tranche of the Greek rescue, Mario Draghi's bond-buying splurge \u2013 there remains the question of whether the widely diverging fortunes of the eurozone's economies can be brought closer together. Europe's statistical agency, Eurostat, expects the eurozone economy to contract by 0.3% in 2012, and expand by a paltry 1% next year. But that average disguises a sharp divide: while the powerhouse of Germany continues to expand \u2013 though at a less healthy pace than in the last 12 months \u2013 much of the rest of the single currency area is trapped in a deep recession, unable to compete with the wealthy economies of the north, where, certainly in Germany's case, falling real wages over a number of years have created a super-competitive manufacturing sector. \"The bigger issue for us always is: does any of this address the underlying problems?\" says Jonathan Loynes, European economist at Capital Economics. \"Even if the ECB comes out with all guns blazing, all it's doing is dealing with one of the symptoms: it's not reducing anyone's debts.\" He fears that while Europe's politicians may be able to paper over the cracks with emergency bailouts in the short term, voters in Germany and the other \"core\" economies in the currency bloc may not be willing to countenance the large-scale financial transfers that would be necessary if Greece, Portugal and Spain were to be brought up to speed with the rest of the eurozone. Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research warns that public opinion in all the struggling economies \u2013 Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy \u2013 is likely to become increasingly impatient if the universally prescribed recipe of austerity fails to improve people's lives. \"You can't continue with no growth indefinitely: these are democracies.\"",

But there is little sign that growth is about to be restored.</p> <p>\"If you look at what Greece is going through, it's comparable with the Great Depression,\" says Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research, pointing out that economic output has already plunged an extraordinary 20% since the start of the crisis. \"The US Great Depression didn't end because of austerity, it ended because they left the gold standard and they had a massive devaluation, and because fiscal policy was moving in the right direction.\"</p> <h2>Hardliners</h2> <p>One of the things that most alarmed Europe's financial markets last week was the outcome of an obscure meeting in Helsinki that suggested the single currency's paymasters have decided to play hardball.</p> <p>Finance ministers from the Netherlands, Germany and Finland \u2013 the eurozone's paymasters, and also its most hardline members \u2013 gathered for talks in the Finnish capital and issued a statement clarifying the eurozone rescue deal that was reached after make-or-break talks in June.</p> <p>At the time, the agreement appeared to mark a positive departure in the crisis, helping to sever the connection between the balance sheets of sickly banks and the finances of states. It was agreed \u2013 or so it appeared \u2013 that the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), would be allowed to inject money directly into ailing banks in eurozone countries.</p> <p>That would prevent their governments from having to apply for a full-blown bailout, with all the attendant misery of troika inspections, and halt the vicious circle in which bank bailouts shift losses onto the public finances and weaken public finances by depressing the value of the government bonds that are the banks' main source of capital.</p> <p>However, after last week's discussions in Helsinki, the canny northern Europeans spelt out their conditions. Before the ESM can bail out banks, they insisted that the eurozone-wide banking union must be \"established\" and its \"effectiveness\u2026 determined\" \u2013 which is a tough hurdle, since the plan so far remains a glint in Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso's eye.</p> <p>More importantly, they insisted that \"legacy assets\" \u2013 that is, all the dodgy loans from the credit crisis era, must remain \"the responsibility of national authorities\".</p> <p>At a stroke, they seemed to dash Ireland's hopes of receiving help from its eurozone neighbours for the cost of its massive banking bailout and undermine Spain's hopes of repairing its financial sector without Madrid going cap in hand to the troika.</p> <p>But most damagingly, the announcement from Helsinki underlined the fact that, in the long-running eurozone crisis, the devil is always in the detail.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>With Spain still firmly in the markets' crosshairs, Italy's moment of danger appeared to have passed, at least for the time being. But after 30,000 strikers forced the closure of the Colosseum on Friday as they marched in Rome against the government's public sector cuts, political support for austerity in the eurozone's third-largest economy is looking increasingly fragile.</p> <p>A year into a deep recession, the technocratic prime minister Mario Monti, installed last November after intense pressure from the markets and eurozone politicians helped force Silvio Berlusconi out of office, is struggling to meet his budget goals. His support is also fading \u2013 though he said last week that he might agree to stay on if elections, due to be held in the spring, failed to yield a definitive result. He has acknowledged the concerns of protesters, saying his austerity policies have subjected the public to an \"unprecedented amount of sacrifices\".</p> <p>When the ECB president Mario Draghi announced his policy of \"outright monetary transactions\" \u2013 or OMT \u2013 the expectation in financial markets was that Italy would follow Spain in asking for an official EU bailout so that it could benefit from the scheme, which is designed to bring down weaker governments' borrowing costs by buying their bonds.</p> <p>But that would be a severe political humiliation \u2013 and, what's worse, it is not even clear that Europe has the money. As Karen Guinand of the bank Lombard Odier put it in a research note last week: \"If and when Spain does appeal for help, another problem will then emerge: much of the EFSF/ESM [bailout fund] resources would probably be used up \u2026 leaving little for&#xa0;Italy.\"</p> <p>Once a Spanish bailout happens \u2013 and most analysts now believe it is a case of when, not if \u2013 attention will inevitably turn to Italy, just as the country gears up for a general election in which Berlusconi and his supporters are expected to run on an anti-euro ticket. The former prime minister last week <a href=\"http://euobserver.com/political/117689\" title=\"\">described the single currency as a \"big swindle\"</a>; staying inside the euro will require more painful sacrifices, and Italians may decide that they have had enough.</p> <h2>Growth</h2> <p>Even if all the other pieces fall into place \u2013 the Spanish bailout, the latest tranche of the Greek rescue, Mario Draghi's bond-buying splurge \u2013 there remains the question of whether the widely diverging fortunes of the eurozone's economies can be brought closer together.</p> <p>Europe's statistical agency, Eurostat, expects the eurozone economy to contract by 0.3% in 2012, and expand by a paltry 1% next year.</p> <p>But that average disguises a sharp divide: while the powerhouse of Germany continues to expand \u2013 though at a less healthy pace than in the last 12 months \u2013 much of the rest of the single currency area is trapped in a deep recession, unable to compete with the wealthy economies of the north, where, certainly in Germany's case, falling real wages over a number of years have created a super-competitive manufacturing sector.</p> <p>\"The bigger issue for us always is: does any of this address the underlying problems?\" says Jonathan Loynes, European economist at Capital&#xa0;Economics.</p> <p>\"Even if the ECB comes out with all guns blazing, all it's doing is dealing with one of the symptoms: it's not reducing anyone's debts.\"</p> <p>He fears that while Europe's politicians may be able to paper over the cracks with emergency bailouts in the short term, voters in Germany and the other \"core\" economies in the currency bloc may not be willing to countenance the large-scale financial transfers that would be necessary if Greece, Portugal and Spain were to be brought up to speed with the rest of the eurozone.</p> <p>Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research warns that public opinion in all the struggling economies \u2013 Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy \u2013 is likely to become increasingly impatient if the universally prescribed recipe of austerity fails to improve people's lives. \"You can't continue with no growth indefinitely: these are democracies.\"</p>",
