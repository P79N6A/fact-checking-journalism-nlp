Stepping inside, B&amp;M has all the charm of a hospital \u2013 you don't want to be there, but sometimes you may need to go. With plastic blue floors and faded white walls, with the odd ceiling tile appearing to come loose, supermarket aisles greet you as you enter. Going for the pound shop vibe that has swamped the high street, shelves are packed high with a vast and eclectic mix of goods. There are tea bags next to toys, wash baskets above wine, and cat food opposite glittery toilet seats.

Over at the pets section an array of nearly 20 varieties of dog bones awaits, followed by at least 100 different bedspreads, cushions, pillows, curtains and towels.

With one nod to Woolworths, the store has a pick 'n' mix, while the music choice is from an old fashioned collection of 1950s R&amp;B \u2013 a welcome relief from the looping Christmas songs dominating rival stores.

    "webTitle": "FTSE 250 falls back from record high as markets react badly to US fiscal cliff impasse", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "While much of the attention during the week was focused on whether the FTSE 100 would move through the 6000 barrier - in the end it didn't - one record which was broken, to little fanfare, was a new peak on the FTSE 250. The mid-cap index closed at 12,293.25 on Tuesday, its highest level since 2007 and over the next two days broke the record again, rising to 12,422.77 on Thursday. Traders said its outperformance compared to the senior index was partly due to the influence of overseas stocks on the latter. Angus Campbell at Capital Spreads said: The FTSE 250 is a little more UK orientated than the FTSE 100, which is also heavily weighted in banks and miners so subject to headwinds on the macro front. Even though things aren't all that rosy in the UK, investors are relatively optimistic in terms of 2013 for corporate UK as there are signs that the economy might rebound. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The FTSE 250 has outperformed the benchmark index on a pretty constant basis over the last few year. A great number of stocks in the 100 index aren't what I would call UK centric stocks whereas the 250 has a good deal more quality stocks with greater transparency from a governance point of view and I think investors prefer that. But on Friday both indices fell back, following a further setback in the US discussions to resolve the fiscal cliff - the combination of tax rises and spending cuts which is due to come into force next month. Not only have the two rival US political parties failed to come to an agreement so far, the Republicans appeared to be unable even to put on a united front among themselves. That overshadowed more positive news from the eurozone, including Greece seeing its credit rating raised from selective default to B- by Standard &amp; Poor's. So the FTSE 100 finished down 18.35 points at 5939.99 while the mid-cap index lost 51.37 points to 12371.40. With investors shying away from risk, utility companies were in demand, helped by news that regulator Ofwat had seemingly compromised on some of its contentious licence change proposals. Severn Trent added 41p to \u00a316.10 while United Utilities rose 8p to 682p. An exception was Pennon, which lost its coveted FTSE 100 place at the close of play, and fell 2p to 634p. Mining companies lost ground, with Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation down 3.9p at 276.9p. Goldman Sachs analysts moved from buy to reduce and cut their target price from 398p to 292p. The bank said: Despite our bullish outlook for iron ore (ENRC's key commodity), we believe the stock may trade sideways until the market regains confidence in ENRC's execution (Democratic Republic of Congo assets, cost control in Kazakhstan) and capital allocation decisions, particularly cash returns to shareholders. We believe the stock's recent underperformance can be attributed to concerns over a possible breach of debt covenants. In our view, this risk is mitigated by the potential to renegotiate covenants with its largest creditor, Sberbank. To meet the liquidity requirement to maintain inclusion in the FTSE-100, the company must make a share placement in 2013, raising cash but also creating an overhang risk that may cap near-term share price performance. Kazakhmys, which unveiled a $1bn debt facility, closed 8p lower at 758.5p. Aviva slipped 1.3p to 382.7p after finally disposing of its unwanted US business at a hefty loss, as part of its strategic review following the ousting of chief executive Andrew Moss. The insurer is selling its US life and annuities operations, which it bought in 2006 for \u00a32bn, to American insurer Athene Holdings for $1.8bn (\u00a31.1bn). It will receive cash proceeds of $1.55bn after repaying external debt. It will keep the north American asset management business of Aviva Investors. Lloyds Banking Group has been the best performer in the FTSE 100 so far this year, but it fell 0.925p to 48.325p on Friday after the sector was hit by concerns the UK could introduce legislation to break up banks. Carnival recovered 51p to \u00a324.42 after Thursday's falls in the wake of the cruise company's cautious outlook. Alexia Dogani at Liberum Capital issued a buy note, saying: Despite disappointing 2013 yield guidance, it is really too early in the booking cycle to conclude on the pace of the yield recovery, and indeed we are encouraged by the $2.2-$2.4 earnings per share guidance.

      "body": "<p>While much of the attention during the week was focused on whether the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> would move through the 6000 barrier - in the end it didn't - one record which was broken, to little fanfare, was a new peak on the <strong>FTSE 250</strong>.</p> <p>The mid-cap index closed at 12,293.25 on Tuesday, its highest level since 2007 and over the next two days broke the record again, rising to 12,422.77 on Thursday. Traders said its outperformance compared to the senior index was partly due to the influence of overseas stocks on the latter. Angus Campbell at Capital Spreads said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The FTSE 250 is a little more UK orientated than the FTSE 100, which is also heavily weighted in banks and miners so subject to headwinds on the macro front. Even though things aren't all that rosy in the UK, investors are relatively optimistic in terms of 2013 for corporate UK as there are signs that the economy might rebound.</p> </blockquote> <p>Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The FTSE 250 has outperformed the benchmark index on a pretty constant basis over the last few year. A great number of stocks in the 100 index aren't what I would call UK centric stocks whereas the 250 has a good deal more quality stocks with greater transparency from a governance point of view and I think investors prefer that.</p> </blockquote> <p>But on Friday both indices fell back, following a further setback in the US discussions to resolve the fiscal cliff - the combination of tax rises and spending cuts which is due to come into force next month. Not only have the two rival US political parties failed to come to an agreement so far, the Republicans appeared to be unable even to put on a united front among themselves. That overshadowed more positive news from the eurozone, including Greece seeing its credit rating raised from selective default to B- by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p> <p>So the FTSE 100 finished down 18.35 points at 5939.99 while the mid-cap index lost 51.37 points to 12371.40.</p> <p>With investors shying away from risk, utility companies were in demand, helped by news that regulator Ofwat had seemingly compromised on some of its contentious licence change proposals. <strong>Severn Trent</strong> added 41p to \u00a316.10 while <strong>United Utilities</strong> rose 8p to 682p. An exception was <strong>Pennon</strong>, which lost its coveted FTSE 100 place at the close of play, and fell 2p to 634p.</p> <p>Mining companies lost ground, with <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> down 3.9p at 276.9p. Goldman Sachs analysts moved from buy to reduce and cut their target price from 398p to 292p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite our bullish outlook for iron ore (ENRC's key commodity), we believe the stock may trade sideways until the market regains confidence in ENRC's execution (Democratic Republic of Congo assets, cost control in Kazakhstan) and capital allocation decisions, particularly cash returns to shareholders. We believe the stock's recent underperformance can be attributed to concerns over a possible breach of debt covenants. In our view, this risk is mitigated by the potential to renegotiate covenants with its largest creditor, Sberbank. To meet the liquidity requirement to maintain inclusion in the FTSE-100, the company must make a share placement in 2013, raising cash but also creating an overhang risk that may cap near-term share price performance.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong>, which unveiled a $1bn debt facility, closed 8p lower at 758.5p.</p> <p><strong>Aviva </strong>slipped 1.3p to 382.7p after finally disposing of its unwanted US business at a hefty loss, as part of its strategic review following the ousting of chief executive Andrew Moss.</p> <p>The insurer is selling its US life and annuities operations, which it bought in 2006 for \u00a32bn, to American insurer Athene Holdings for $1.8bn (\u00a31.1bn). It will receive cash proceeds of $1.55bn after repaying external debt. It will keep the north American asset management business of Aviva Investors.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> has been the best performer in the FTSE 100 so far this year, but it fell 0.925p to 48.325p on Friday after the sector was hit by concerns the UK could introduce legislation to break up banks.</p> <p><strong>Carnival</strong> recovered 51p to \u00a324.42 after Thursday's falls in the wake of the cruise company's cautious outlook. Alexia Dogani at Liberum Capital issued a buy note, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite disappointing 2013 yield guidance, it is really too early in the booking cycle to conclude on the pace of the yield recovery, and indeed we are encouraged by the $2.2-$2.4 earnings per share guidance.

The stakes could never be as high as they were when Khrushchev and Kennedy were on the hot line in October 1962, but there would be serious consequences were the talks between President Obama and John Boehner, the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives to end in failure. George Osborne is just one of the finance ministers keen to see the impasse ended. The latest news from the UK economy was disappointing, even if there were one or two bright spots. Growth in the third quarter was less strong than originally believed at 0.9% while a year in which the economy has stagnated has taken its toll of the public finances.

Officials in Washington have calculated that the budget tightening involved would wipe out all the expected growth in the US economy next year and result in a 0.5% contraction instead. Despite the rapid growth of China, the US is still the world's biggest economy and accounts for one fifth of global output. A recession there in 2013 would lead to much slower growth in China, intensify the downturns in Japan and the eurozone, and make a triple dip in Britain a nailed-on certainty. Both sides in the Washington talks know the risks. Markets have started to fray at the edges in recent days as hopes have been dashed that a deal would be signed before Christmas. The expectation is that just as in 1962 mutual assured destruction will be avoided, and it probably will be. But time is getting short and damage \u2013 in the form of delayed investment decisions and the blow to consumer confidence \u2013 is already being caused.

A recession there in 2013 would lead to much slower growth in China, intensify the downturns in Japan and the eurozone, and make a triple dip in Britain a nailed-on certainty.</p> <p>Both sides in the Washington talks know the risks. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/21/eurozone-crisis-live-fiscal-cliff-markets\" title=\"\">Markets have started to fray at the edges in recent days</a> as hopes have been dashed that a deal would be signed before Christmas. The expectation is that just as in 1962 mutual assured destruction will be avoided, and it probably will be. But time is getting short and damage \u2013 in the form of delayed investment decisions and the blow to consumer confidence \u2013 is already being caused. In its current state, it is damage the global economy could do without.</p>",

Thanks for the comments and have a good weekend and a merry Christmas. European stock markets have closed, mostly ending the week on a negative note following the lack of progress in resolving the US budget problems, the fiscal cliff of tax rises and spending cuts. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished down 18.35 points at 5939.99, a 0.31% decline \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.47% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.15% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has fallen 0.4% \u2022 But Spain's Ibex is up 0.32% \u2022 The Athens market has added 1.84% \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 176 points or 1.33% More details on the Italian budget vote, courtesy of Reuters. The chamber of deputies approved the bill by 309 votes to 55, Prime minister Mario Monti is due to hold a cabinet meeting and is then expected to tender his resignation to president Giorgio Napolitano. An election is likely to take place on 24 February. And here, courtesy of electionista, are the key dates leading up to the election once Mario Monti resigns later, as expected: \u2022 December 23 - Monti expected to give end of year press conference. \u2022 December 22-24 - parliament formally dissolved. \u2022 December 31 - election date (Feb 24-25) expected to be formally announced. \u2022 From January 9 - par condicio kicks in (equal time on television). \u2022 By January 13 - coalitions, manifestos and names of coalition leaders (PM-candidates) need to be submitted. \u2022 By January 21 - names of parliamentary candidates need to be submitted. \u2022 No more polls can be released after February 9. \u2022 February 24-25: General Election. My colleague Dominic Rushe has written an update on the US markets in the wake of the fiscal cliff problems, which can be found here. And here it comes. Mario Monti is preparing to hand in his resignation to the Italian president, the prime minister has said. Italy's parliament approves the 2013 budget law, according to a Reuters snap. Over to you, Monti. Se\u00e1n FitzPatrick, the former chairman of the now nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, has appeared in court to face 12 new fraud charges. He was accused in Dublin's district court on Friday of making false, misleading or deceptive statements relating to loans of almost \u20ac300m (\u00a3244m). Full story from Henry McDonald here. To follow the latest developments with the fiscal cliff, my colleague Richard Adams is live blogging here. More on Cyprus. Mario Monti's government has won a vote of confidence on the 2013 budget in Italy's lower house. Final approval is expected later today. That could trigger Monti's resignation as prime minister, with much speculation as to his next move. He is reported to be holding a press conference on Sunday, at which no doubt his future plans will be revealed. Wall Street has opened and in early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 144 points, following the concerns that the fiscal cliff discussions had broken, with time running out for a resolution. Ahead of Wall Street's opening, some US data to digest from @Reuters: US consumer spending up 0.6% in November, biggest rise since August 2009 Personal income up 0.6% in November (durable goods orders, up 0.7%) With that I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. If you haven't already seen this, the Guardian's booming world series went live this week: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/the-booming-world Economist Ha-Joon Chang argues today for a more restrained approach to looking at developing world economies. \"Asia shouldn't overexcite people,\" he says, arguing that the commodity price boom has given a short-lived boost to these countries. He makes a strong case for a slowdown in the Chinese economy and says that \"rapid growth\" in emerging markets is not sustainable. More impressive than the developed world of course, but still not galloping ahead. GfK, the market research group, has reported that German consumer morale has dropped for the fourth consecutive month to its lowest level in more than a year. Its survey of 2,000 Germans showed that consumer sentiment registered a rating of 5.6 heading into January, down from 5.8 in December. The willingness to make purchases has fallen to its lowest level since May 2010. But Germany's love for a bargain should keep things ticking over. This Financial Times piece on the German love for Primark is an interesting read. Needs a subscription, mind. Crudely, the eurozone could do with Germany exporting less and consuming a bit more. Another tangential guest entry, but Spanish conglomerate Ferrovial \u2013 a grandee of European infrastructure \u2013 has confirmed the sale of a 10% stake in Heathrow airport to the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. Heathrow's investment roster is now dominated by the Chinese, Qatari and Singaporean governments. Another sign of the shifting balance in power. Not that it means sovereign wealth funds will be paying for Europe's new roads and airports. Investors tend to prefer investing in assets after they have been built. So Europe's taxpayers still need to stump up the cash to get projects started. Now this won't be many people's idea of a new year resolution, but the resurrection of Bob Diamond's career could be one of the surprise events of 2013. This piece on Reuters says that while the Libor scandal was bad for Barclays, it was ultimately much worse elsewhere. A bit of obligatory Friday reading from our own Larry Eliiott, on the latest ONS data. Fitch, the ratings agency, expects the eurozone to \"stagnate\" in 2013 after contracting 0.5% in 2012. It expects Emerging Europe, which includes the likes of Latvia, to grow by 2.9%, up from 2.3% in 2012. With deference to the festive season, we ought to inject some optimism into the fiscal cliff issue. Let's call it a fiscal ha-ha. The American economy will not implode on 1 January and the tightening will be gradual. One financial professional told Reuters this morning that it was more of a \"slope\" than a cliff - the latter term was coined by Ben Bernanke at the US Federal Reserve. This piece by the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities offers a less hyperbolic perspective. Still, it does use the phrase \"mild recession\", which is never as reassuring as they would like it to sound. According to some informed commentary, including Peter Boone and Simon Johnson in the Atlantic Monthly recently, Japan could be the source for the next major financial panic - its gross debt is 236% of GDP and it is underpinned by fallible demographics. The piece is worth reading. Once you have done that, square it with this piece from Business Insider. There is more debate to be had on the Japan scenario, evidently. European finance ministers will discuss the perilous state of Cyprus early next year, says Merkel official. Reuters is reporting widespread selling in most major stock markets and strong demand for safe assets such as German bonds in the wake of the failed Boehner meeting. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European stocks fell 0.6% by mid-morning, while the dollar, yen, and US and German government bonds all rose. Ian Williams, strategist at Peel Hunt, said: The recent performance of key benchmarks has priced in a satisfactory outcome to the US fiscal discussions, which is far from a done deal. If the unelected Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, sheds his technocratic cloak and runs in elections next year, it could have a positive impact. If the US does indeed tumble off the fiscal cliff, automatic spending cuts kick in and will take $109bn per year from the federal budget \u2013 annually \u2013 over the next 10 years. Of that total, $54.7bn will come from defence and that could have an impact on BAE Systems, Britain's largest defence contractor and a major player in the US market. For instance, it is helping build the F-35 fighter. Here is Dan Wasserbly, Americas editor for IHS Jane's Weekly, who plays down the impact nonetheless: Indiscriminate cuts will cause problems, but will not have the chaotic impact predicted by some of the nation's top military leaders. A 10% cut isn't going to lay to waste the most powerful military in the world. The biggest immediate impacts could hit Pentagon's plans to buy new planes, ships, helicopters, drones, missiles submarines, ammunition, radios and more. This is a bit of a guest-editor comment, but it is worth noting confirmation yesterday that Siemens of Germany has reached a commercial agreement on the \u00a31.4bn Thameslink trains contract for more than 1,000 train carriages that will run in London - but will be built in Germany. On a basic level, this reflects a UK manufacturer, Bombardier's Derby factory, being beaten by a European competitor for a domestic contract. It underlines the competitive pressures that UK-based manufacturers and would-be exporters face as we try to tilt the economy away from services. Olli Rehn, the Finnish European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, has some guiding words for French politicians this morning. In an interview with Le Monde he says that France must carry out labour market reform and extend pension reforms. But that additional French budget savings are not essential. The Economist would disagree. The British Chambers of Commerce, which represents 100,000 businesses in the UK - SMEs account for about six out of 10 people in private sector employment - says there were some pearls in the ONS data. But exports need a boost, notwithstanding this morning's BAE contract. Some of the additional detail, revealed by the new estimates, are however positive. Business investment has shown good growth in the third quarter, and there has been a strong improvement in net trade with exports up 1.2%, and imports down 0.4%. This reverses some of the deterioration in net trade that we saw in the first half of the year. Notwithstanding these positive developments, it is clear that economic growth remains much too weak, and more effective measures are needed to enable businesses to drive recovery by strengthening the growth in exports and jobs. It is a brief YouTube clip admittedly, but the Daily Show's reference to, and coverage of, the fiscal cliff situation as \"Cliffpocalypsemageddonacaust\" rather nails it. If the UK is a services-dominated economy, then there is evidently still much to be done to stoke consumer demand... The FTSE retreat is gathering pace, just shy of -1% now at 56 points down. According to the US futures market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will follow when it opens this afternoon, with the prediction that it will open 151 points down. The circumstantial evidence that we might be heading for a triple-dip recession has gathered further weight this morning after the Office for National Statistics posted data showing a deterioration in the public finances since last year, meagre growth in the all-important services sector and a downward revision in third quarter GDP. Merry Christmas. Public sector net borrowing excluding financial sector interventions - the government's preferred measure - rose to \u00a317.5bn in November, up from \u00a316.3bn in the same period last year.

The last revision of Q3 GDP - the economy grew 1% in the three months to September - and the latest government borrowing numbers. These will be coming out at 9.30am. The boot is on the other foot... A few dry asides in the newsroom this morning about the fact that the world hasn\u2019t ended despite the anticipated arrival of the apocalypse on a tide of Mayan fire \u2013 but it appears to have brought turmoil to trains running into Paddington. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets UK has picked up on the theme, warning that if Boehner and his fellow Republicans cannot even agree a solution to the fiscal impasse among themselves, we might be in serious trouble. Given that today is supposed to be the end of the world I suppose we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised at the lack of progress, but most market participants are by now probably losing the will to live as we head into the Christmas break. As you would expect, the FTSE 100 has fallen this morning on the back of the Boehner meeting, slipping 48 points or 0.8% to 5909. On the blue-chip European indices, Germany's DAX lost 0.3% and France's CAC-40 was 0.1% lower in early trading. Fears over the US fiscal cliff have hit the euro and are weighing on investors this morning, bringing some unfestive jitters to the start of the holiday season. The euro fell 0.3% to $1.3210, away from an eight-month high of $1.33085, after the House of Representatives speaker, John Boehner, was rebuked by fellow Republican lawmakers over his plan to avoid a tumble over the fiscal cliff \u2013 a combination of tax rises and spending cuts that will kick in automatically in January if US politicians fail to agree a federal budget.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was bad news for chancellor George Osborne as official figures showed growth in the UK economy was slower than initially thought in the third quarter, along with a deterioration in public finances last month. The Office for National Statistics had said the UK economy grew by 1% in the third quarter but that was revised down to 0.9% on Friday. Separate figures from the ONS show the government borrowed more than expected in November, as spending rose but tax receipts fell from a year earlier. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"The disappointing November public finance data fuel mounting expectations that at least one of the credit rating agencies will strip the UK of its triple A rating in 2013.\" Archer also said it \"looks touch and go\" as to whether the economy can avoid renewed contraction in the fourth quarter. Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, slammed the government for \"failing on the one test they set themselves \u2013 to get the deficit and debt down. \"As a flatlining economy and rising long-term unemployment has sent the welfare bill soaring and tax revenues down the government is borrowing billions more simply to pay for the cost of their economic failure. \"By squeezing families and businesses too hard, choking off the recovery and so pushing borrowing up not down, David Cameron and George Osborne's economic plan has completely backfired. And they have decided that millions of striving working families will pay the price for this economic failure with cuts to tax credits and benefits while millionaires get a tax cut.\" Data from the ONS showed the key services sector \u2013 which accounts for three quarters of GDP \u2013 grew by just 0.1% in October, suggesting a weak start to the last three months of the year. Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said activity has been much weaker and the UK economy may well have shrunk in the fourth quarter. She notes that real consumer spending is now estimated to have risen by 0.4% rather than 0.6% in the third quarter. \"So without the Olympics boost, spending may well have fallen.\" The UK emerged from recession in the third quarter, when the economy was lifted by London hosting the Games, providing a boost to consumer spending. But economists fear that effect is now fading and output could fall again in the final quarter. Another quarter of contraction early in the new year could see the UK falling into a 'triple-dip' recession. Public sector borrowing, meanwhile, came in at \u00a317.5bn, considerably higher than the \u00a316.3bn in November 2011, and way above forecasts for a total of \u00a316bn. That brings borrowing for the fiscal year to \u00a392.7bn \u2013 excluding the transfer of Royal Mail pension assets \u2013 up from \u00a384.4bn this time last year. The chancellor's preferred forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, now expects borrowing to hit \u00a3108.5bn this year, almost 7% of GDP. Redwood said: \"Although a number of temporary factors flattered the OBR's new forecast for borrowing this year, the underlying picture is that the weak economy is preventing the deficit from falling.\" There was one bright spot in the figures, which showed the current account deficit narrowed from \u00a317.4bn to \u00a312.8bn in the third quarter.",

      "bodyText": "Consumer confidence slumped in the runup to Christmas as households held out little hope the economic situation would pickup anytime soon, according to a forecaster. GfK's consumer confidence index slipped seven points in December to -29, compared with a month ago. In four of the five questions asked about their personal financial situation or the general economy, respondents were more downbeat than in November. Consumers, for instance, thought their household finances had got worse over the past year and they expected the wider economy to get worse in the year ahead. The only indicator that held steady was that consumers expected the financial situation in their own homes to remain broadly unchanged over the coming year. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the marked relapse in consumer confidence in December \"is particularly worrying news for retailers given the importance of sales over Christmas, and it is also worrying for hopes that consumers can play a leading role in helping the economy develop sustainable growth.\" The survey fits into the overall picture of low consumer spending and confidence reports since the start of the financial crisis in 2008, despite the occasional blip fuelled by a public holiday or a special event like the Olympics. Households are worried about job security, while many face below-inflation wage rises as well as rising energy bills. GfK's managing director of social research, Nick Moon, said: \"While such a dramatic drop in consumer confidence over the last month might seem like very bad news, it must be seen in the context of a massive eight-point rise in November \u2013 the seventh highest increase since the index began in 1974.\" He said November's rise might have suggested a turning point, but this time, as on previous occasions, \"the surge disappeared as fast as it arrived\". Moon added: \"Despite last month's rise, the index is now only one point higher than it was in October, indicating consumer sentiment is still fragile despite the fact Christmas is less than a week away.\"",

      "bodyText": "Don't unpick a consensus, pleaded George Osborne. Too late. The parliamentary commission on banking standards has taken a look at the chancellor's ringfencing proposals and concluded they are not tough enough. It wants a ringfence that can \"stand the test of time\" and clearly regards the government version as too flimsy, too ill-defined and too vulnerable to the lobbying power of banks. Well done, the commissioners. Somebody had to acknowledge that ringfencing is an experiment that may not work and that more radical reform, including full separation of retail banking from investment banking, should remain an option. Given this body is a commission established by the chancellor, the criticisms will be hard to brush aside. The need for safeguards should be obvious to anyone who has \"read the book,\" as commission chairman Andrew Tyrie puts it. He means the history of the gradual dismantling of the 1930s Glass-Steagall legislation in the US. Big banks, tempting governments with promises of good behaviour and higher tax revenues, chipped away at the principle of separation and won themselves freedoms to mix any financial cocktail they wished. That story ended badly. In time, today's ringfencing legislation could suffer the same fate, implies the commission. Its solution is an \"electrified\" ring fence, which sounds like vacuous jargon but is not. The Bank of England would have powers to force full separation on a bank that dragged its heels on ringfencing or disobeyed the spirit of reform. That idea is a direct challenge to Osborne's proposals: the Bank would be the regulator, not the Treasury, that would call the shots. (There's an open question about whether the Bank is sufficiently accountable to parliament to exercise such powers, but that's another debate entirely.) Second, parliament would have to re-examine the implementation of ringfencing after four years. That sounds like common sense since, to repeat, the reforms are an experiment and it seems highly unlikely that a perfect regulatory regime could be achieved at the first attempt. The fact that Sir Mervyn King, the Bank governor, has argued for periodic reviews adds weight to the commission's case. Third, the commission wants stricter limits on banks' leverage ratios. Here, Osborne finds himself out on a limb. The chancellor, seemingly overwhelmed by the grumbles of mortgage-dominated banks, opted for a leverage cap of 33 times. The Vickers commission, which produced the original ringfencing proposals, had argued for a more conservative ratio of 25 times. Tyrie's crew is firmly on the side of conservatism, even if it rubbishes the methodology behind the Vickers commission's calculations. Osborne will have to explain why he wants to allow banks to be so aggressive. He will also have to state why he thinks he is qualified to make judgments about banks' balance sheets. The commission thinks the Bank of England financial policy committee is better placed to do the job and should not be forced to operate with one hand tied behind its back. Fair point: the world of risk-weighted assets is deeply technical and there is an obvious temptation for governments to deem their own debt to be so safe banks should stockpile vast quantities of the stuff. There are, of course, areas where the commission is singing in harmony with the chancellor; and, ultimately, it has stayed with the consensus that backs ringfencing as the best first step in structural reform of the banking system. But the criticisms are stinging. In short, the commission thinks its ringfence is stronger and more likely to succeed than Osborne's construction. It is right.",
