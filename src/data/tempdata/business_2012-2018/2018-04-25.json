      "bodyText": "Car production in Britain has experienced a double-digit slump amid concern over falling diesel sales and the impact of Brexit on exports. The performance last month, which was partly weather related, prompted the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) to repeat its call for continued membership of the EU customs union. The number of cars built in UK factories in March fell 13% from a year ago to 141,471, the SMMT reported. Manufacturing for the domestic market tumbled 17.7% last month, while the number of vehicles made for export fell 11.9%. Eight in 10 of the cars produced in the UK, which hosts factories owned by a range of manufacturers including Nissan and BMW, are exported. Some companies were hit by the bad weather in March when the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d brought large parts of the UK to a standstill. Blizzards and freezing temperatures disrupted car production because some staff were unable to get to work, and the supply of parts was also affected. Production in the first quarter of the year fell by 6.3% compared with the same period in 2017, with 440,426 cars rolling off production lines. While demand from overseas customers fell 4% between January and March, this was dwarfed by the 14.1% decline in manufacturing for the UK market. Mike Hawes, SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cA double-digit decline in car manufacturing for both home and overseas markets is of considerable concern. \u201cAfter recent announcements on jobs cutbacks in the sector, it\u2019s vitally important that the industry and consumers receive greater certainty, both about future policies towards diesel and other low emission technologies, and our post-Brexit trading relationships and customs arrangements.\u201d Repeating the car industry\u2019s demand for access to the customs union, Hawes said: \u201cMaintaining free and frictionless trade is an absolute priority - it has been fundamental to our past success and is key to our future growth.\u201d Carmakers are responsible for 13% of the UK\u2019s exports in goods. The customs union is a particularly sensitive issue because some car parts cross the channel multiple times as part of the manufacturing process. However, this week Downing Street reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to leaving the customs union.",

      "bodyText": "The UK-listed drugmaker Shire, known for its ADHD hyperactivity drug Adderall, has recommended a \u00a346bn takeover deal by Japan\u2019s biggest pharma company, Takeda. If approved by investors, it would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals deals ever, ranking behind Pfizer\u2019s $112bn takeover of Warner Lambert in 2000. The stock and cash offer values Shire at \u00a349 a share, about \u00a35 more than Takeda\u2019s initial bid. After rebuffing several offers, the Shire board said \u201cit would be willing to recommend the revised proposal to Shire shareholders subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the possible offer, including completion of reciprocal due diligence by Shire on Takeda\u201d. The FTSE 100 company set a new deadline of 8 May for the negotiations to be concluded, although this could be extended further. Shire shareholders would own about half of the combined company, whose shares would be listed in Japan and the US. Atsushi Seki, pharma analyst at UBS, said: \u201cWith Shire board\u2019s willingness to recommend, Shire\u2019s acquisition becomes realistic. That said, to complete the acquisition, there are still several hurdles, including no other bidder(s) emerging and a special resolution at a shareholder meeting (two-thirds supportive vote required), and the long journey to completion now begins.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker GSK ruled itself out of bidding on Wednesday. The US company Allergan, which makes Botox, dropped out of the running earlier this month. Shire shares in London closed down 2.8% to \u00a338.20, well below the offer price, suggesting scepticism in the market about the deal. Takeda shares tumbled more than 7% on the Tokyo stock exchange, reflecting fears that a deal of this size could put too much pressure on the Japanese firm\u2019s finances. A deal would give Takeda Shire\u2019s lucrative rare diseases portfolio and propel the Japanese firm, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. Shire, founded above a shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1986, is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. It has scaled back its presence in the UK and most of its operations are in the US.",

      "bodyText": "How did the housebuilder Persimmon get away with paying their chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, a \u00a375m share bonus? One answer is that too few City fund managers are willing to follow the example of Euan Stirling, of Aberdeen Standard Investments, and state the bleedin\u2019 obvious \u2013 that a chief executive of a public company sometimes has to put the interests of the business ahead of his personal desire to become immensely rich. Stirling\u2019s address to Persimmon\u2019s annual meeting was admirably furious. The reduction in Fairburn\u2019s bumper payday from \u00a3110m to \u00a375m \u201cdoes not even get close to acceptable\u201d, he said. Company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the long-term interests of the employer, he argued but Persimmon\u2019s executives were endangering success by linking the company\u2019s name with \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d pay. Note Stirling\u2019s wider point, too: executives grumble about interfering regulators and politicians but they invite attention when they breach their duty to do the right thing for their own businesses. This will affect \u201call their corporate peers\u201d. He\u2019s completely right, of course. The Persimmon saga has been a shambles from start to finish. A technically flawed incentive scheme should never been proposed or approved in 2012. When it spat out figures that were obviously absurd, even by modern standards of boardroom pay, the lucky trio at the top of Persimmon should have known that trousering \u00a3200m between them would be damaging. Yes, the company has been successful but the chairman had just resigned out of shame and embarrassment over the pay debacle. The voluntary reductions that eventually followed from Fairburn and his two top colleagues came too late and, as Stirling suggests, were too small. Fairburn sat in silence at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, presumably in the knowledge that the vote itself was in the bag. The company\u2019s remuneration report was duly approved by 74.5m votes to 70.1m, or a 51.5% majority. Look at the number of active abstentions, though \u2013 64.8m. What were those \u201cno opinion\u201d box-tickers thinking? They will probably tell themselves, and their clients, they were registering a protest and fulfilling their stewardship role. Get real: fund managers are paid to have an opinion and they justify their princely fees on that basis. If you can\u2019t get off the fence when boardroom greed reaches Persimmon levels, you don\u2019t deserve to be managing other people\u2019s money. Whitbread\u2019s Brittain should stay grounded Whether Whitbread \u2013 a hugely successful company since it stopped brewing beer in 2001 \u2013 really needs to demerge Costa is a debating point in itself. The coffee shops are doing fine and the self-serve vending machines have returns on capital that are off the charts. There isn\u2019t obviously a business problem that needs to be fixed. But, yes, it\u2019s true that Premier Inn, Whitbread\u2019s bigger operation, and Costa have little in common. The former requires lots of upfront capital and is expanding in Germany. The latter is light on assets and is growing in China. Now that Costa is generating enough cash to fund its own expansion, a split is a reasonable idea if Whitbread\u2019s share price is labouring under a \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d \u2013 which it probably is. The real debate, then, is about timing. The chief executive, Alison Brittain, reckons up to two years sounds about right and knows she will be booed for taking so long. Elliott \u2013 the US activist hedge fund that has been the chief lobbyist for a demerger \u2013 thinks six months, max, would be more like it. There will be trouble. Brittain\u2019s argument for taking her time, though, sounds fair. Renegotiating bonds, attributing pension assets and liabilities, recruiting a new board and rewiring the IT are fiddly jobs. Sure, they could been done faster if there was an urgent need. But there isn\u2019t, especially as Costa in China is still a young operation. The only reason to rush would be to suit the short-termist agenda of Elliott and its hedge fund co-traveller, Sachem Head. Brittain should ignore them. Two bossy agitators\u2019 demand for instant action \u2013 and a pop in the share price that may or may not materialise \u2013 is not her lookout. Concentrate on what\u2019s best for the business. TSB\u2019s wonky wording As TSB\u2019s computers have gone wonky, so has the ability of the chief executive, Paul Pester, to make sense. \u201cThe challenge we are facing at the moment is that while we know everything is working, one of the main ways that our customers see everything is working \u2013 through our internet banking and mobile app \u2013 isn\u2019t functioning as well as it should be,\u201d he opined on Wednesday. Eh? Surely the website and the app are important components of this \u201cupgrade\u201d. If they\u2019re on the blink, you can\u2019t claim \u201ceverything\u201d is working.",

There isn\u2019t obviously a business problem that needs to be fixed.<br></p> <p>But, yes, it\u2019s true that Premier Inn, Whitbread\u2019s bigger operation, and Costa have little in common. The former requires lots of upfront capital and is expanding in Germany. The latter is light on assets and is growing in China. Now that Costa is generating enough cash to fund its own expansion, a split is a reasonable idea if Whitbread\u2019s share price is labouring under a \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d \u2013 which it probably is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The real debate, then, is about timing. The chief executive, Alison Brittain, reckons up to two years sounds about right and knows she will be booed for taking so long. Elliott \u2013 the US activist hedge fund that has been the chief lobbyist for a demerger \u2013 thinks six months, max, would be more like it. There will be trouble.</p> <p>Brittain\u2019s argument for taking her time, though, sounds fair. Renegotiating bonds, attributing pension assets and liabilities, recruiting a new board and rewiring the IT are fiddly jobs. Sure, they could been done faster if there was an urgent need. But there isn\u2019t, especially as Costa in China is still a young operation.</p> <p>The only reason to rush would be to suit the short-termist agenda of Elliott and its hedge fund co-traveller, Sachem Head. Brittain should ignore them. Two bossy agitators\u2019 demand for instant action \u2013 and a pop in the share price that may or may not materialise \u2013 is not her lookout.

      "bodyText": "In the run up to the May budget, Australia\u2019s economy continues to show little sign of retuning to normal levels of inflation growth. Demand throughout the nation \u2013 and especially in the west \u2013 keep prices growth low. And whereas as once a boom in tax revenue was a sign of a need to put a lid on inflation, now the treasurer might be thinking of using it to speed things up. The March inflation figures, which were released the day before Anzac Day, might well have caused some to lapse into a moment of remembrance \u2013 such as, does anyone remember when rising inflation was a concern? The ABS estimates that across Australia, the consumer price index and the RBA\u2019s trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation grew by just 1.9% of the past year: Given the RBA\u2019s target range of annual inflation is between 2% and 3% this continues the now more than two-year run of underlying inflation being below that target range. The quarterly figures show little sign of any shift up either. In the March quarter, CPI grew by 0.4% (annualising out at a mere 2.6%), and while underlying inflation grew by 0.5%, which is at the lower end of the RBA\u2019s target, the low quarterly growth last year in September and December suggest the annual growth figure should remain low for another three to six months at least: The reality is that no one is expecting prices to take off. The big driver of prices is demand \u2013 the demand for primary products to make things, and the demand to consume the products that have been made. And we haven\u2019t had much demand since the global financial crisis: Since the economy exited the GFC in 2010, annual demand in Australia has grown by just 1.7% on average \u2013 compared to 3.7% during the mining boom. This is why you can expect to see the government in next month\u2019s budget try to get things going. As I noted earlier this month, the budget looks set to get a nice revenue boost via company taxes. Such boosts (though much larger) occurred during the pre-GFC mining boom years. But they occurred while companies where investing in massive numbers, and hiring workers \u2013 so the tax revenue increases reflected an overall speeding up of the economy. It meant Peter Costello really needed to try to keep a lid on things by running larger surpluses. That inflation growth kept rising and actually reached 5% is a good sign the budget surpluses were actually too small. By contrast, the company tax boost that Scott Morrison looks set to receive is not reflective of increased investment and employment, but rather come via exports \u2013 and thus rather than being a sign of the need to keep a lid on things, it\u2019s more the case that the increased revenue can be used to increase demand, either through infrastructure, other government spending or tax cuts. The problem, as ever, is that the nation\u2019s economy has an annoying way of not being uniform. In Sydney, inflation grew by 2.1%, but in Perth, prices rose by just 0.9%: The good news is that across all cities, inflation growth has picked up over the past year: But even in Melbourne and Sydney, where employment growth has been strongest, inflation growth remains at historically low levels. A big driver of the difference across the nation is food and housing costs, and to a lesser extent education and health (both of which are growing faster than overall inflation): The difference in housing costs are reflected best with the changes in rental prices. Rent prices are a good indicator of economic activity because if an area\u2019s economy is doing well, people will move there for the work and thus increase the demand for housing. This certainly happened in Perth during the mining boom \u2013 where rent prices rose by nearly 14% in 2008. But the end of the mining boom has seen an exodus of workers such that rents are now on average 6.3% cheaper in Perth than they were a year ago. By contrast, in Sydney and Melbourne, rent prices have been growing faster than they have for some time \u2013 but even here the growth rates in both cities remains well below previous heights: But the biggest driver of housing costs at the moment is electricity and gas. Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra \u2013 all of which have an overall inflation rate higher than the national average \u2013 have experienced faster growth of electricity and gas prices than the rest of the nation: But while Adelaide has had the largest electricity price increase in the past year, and prices in Brisbane have actually fallen on average, over the past five years Brisbane actually has seen the highest electricity price growth by some way. Over the past decade, Sydney and Melbourne are top, with Adelaide behind Brisbane, and only marginally ahead of Perth: Ahead of next month\u2019s budget there will invariably be talk of cost of living pressures, and certainly the increase in rents, electricity and gas, as well as health and education costs mean this remains an issue. But the reality is the treasurer would be very much hoping for an end to this run of inflation growth below the RBA\u2019s target band. With low inflation growth the impetus for wages growth to improve remains weak. And unlike in the past, where a boom of tax revenue meant the need to keep a lid on economic growth and inflation, next month expect to see the treasurer do all he can to get growth back to normal levels.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The TSB chief executive was forced to admit on Wednesday that problems persisted with the firm\u2019s mobile and online banking for a sixth day \u2013 after confidently declaring only hours earlier that services were back up and running. TSB said internet banking was operating at 50% of capacity, which means that for every 10 customers only five will be able to access this service. Mobile banking was operating at around 90% of capacity, the bank said in a statement issued at about 4pm. Paul Pester, the TSB chief executive, said the bank\u2019s teams were working \u201caround the clock to fix the problems that some of our customers are having in accessing their TSB accounts\u201d. He said the engine room of the bank was working as it should. \u201cThis means that for the vast majority of our five million customers everything is running smoothly.\u201d He said direct debits, standing orders, payments including salary credits and transfers going in and out of accounts were working as normal. \u201cThe challenge we are facing at the moment is that while we know everything is working, one of the main ways that our customers see everything is working \u2013 through our internet banking and mobile app \u2013 isn\u2019t functioning as well as it should be, and for this I\u2019m truly sorry,\u201d he added. \u201cI can appreciate how frustrating this must be for our customers.\u201d He reiterated that no one would be left out of pocket. Regulatory scrutiny of the IT crisis, one of the biggest for years in Britain\u2019s banking sector, has intensified. The Financial Conduct Authority said it had a small team in place at TSB, \u201cassessing the situation\u201d. As the crisis rumbled on, a number of TSB\u2019s 1.9 million mobile and internet customers continued to vent their anger on social media. Some said that although they could access the TSB app, their mortgages seemed to have disappeared. Stacey Kavanagh was one of several who complained on Twitter that her mortgage had vanished. \u201cThe incompetence of TSB continues; the app now works, but it would appear that I no longer have a mortgage. I assume that means you won\u2019t be taking any money from me on payday?\u201d she asked. Pester had suggested in a tweet early on Wednesday that problems with the botched IT migration were solved. Some customers who had been locked out of their accounts for days were still unable to get into them on Wednesday, as TSB limited access to internet and mobile banking in an attempt to manage the scale of traffic. A spokesperson for TSB said customers who were having trouble accessing the mobile app should shut it down completely and then reload. The bank is facing a potential multimillion-pound compensation bill and regulatory fines for the crisis, which began on Friday night when TSB started a long-planned move of 1.3bn customer records from its former parent company, Lloyds Banking Group, to a platform built by TSB\u2019s Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell. Customers had been told the transfer would be completed by 6pm on Sunday. Small businesses were unable to pay salaries or manage transactions, while some account holders found all their direct debits had disappeared and others reported that their cards were declined when shopping. Multimillion-pound bonuses to the chief executive and 30 other senior TSB staff were linked to the IT overhaul and are now under threat. The payouts include a potential \u00a31.6m bonus for Pester. They were frozen after TSB was forced to delay the move from Lloyds to Sabadell last year.",

Now there is, instead, an obsession with maintaining high land and house prices \u2013 what some land economists call homeownerism \u2013 which has created a vicious class system, whereby at one end of a Midland village you have young couples paying \u00a3800 a month in house rent, and at the other older people profiteering from the rents of six such houses. No movement concerned with social justice can ignore this scam. It is corrupt because people are bribed by continuously rising untaxed capital gains into voting for rightwing parties. It deprives the young of spending power forgone in rents and high mortgages which, as Henry George showed, prevented people from moving where there was new work and affording any more than the basics. DBC Reed Northampton \u2022 You report (24 April) that Finland\u2019s experiment with a universal basic income is coming to an end. The headline to an earlier article (10 December 2015) when the trial started asked whether it was too good to be true. It appears that it was. Unfortunately, the concept of \u201cmoney for nothing\u201d is hard to sell \u2013 and hard to sustain. This is why the progressive left especially should now consider the idea of the job guarantee. On Thursday 26 April at 6.30pm, Fadhel Kaboub \u2013 of Denison University, Ohio and the Binzagr Institute \u2013 will be speaking at City University of London on a proposal for a job guarantee scheme for the UK. Because it is not \u201cmoney for nothing\u201d, it should appeal to the right and centre, while still being acceptable to the left, since it is not the same as \u201cworkfare\u201d. Mike Ellwood Abingdon, Oxfordshire \u2022 Philip Hammond implies that public finances are already in good shape, but economists are right to question \u201cthe strength of the UK economy\u201d (Drop in deficit by \u00a33.5bn could herald public spending rise, 25 April). What matters is not the budget but the trade deficit, which, at its largest since 2010, widened to 2.2% of GDP in 2016, when the current account deficit, at 5.9% of GDP, was widest in the G7 and the largest on record. Such deficits are feared because they have to be financed by external borrowing, so Hammond\u2019s low-borrowing boast may be short-lived. Additionally, in May 2015 the UK slipped into deflation for the first time in over 50 years, a state it has barely escaped from. Globally the threat of debt-deflation prompted U-turns in 2016 by the IMF and OECD, and governments were urged to use \u201cpublic investment to support growth\u201d \u2013 advice not substantially heeded then by Hammond. Economist Ann Pettifor\u2019s concern is that deflation inflates the value of debt and interest rates which, together with a Bank of England rate rise to its \u201ctarget\u201d 4%, would, author and economist Steve Keen worries, \u201ccause the economy to tank\u201d. Spending that \u00a3112m current budget surplus could be too little too late. David Murray Wallington, Surrey \u2022 What Stefan Collini (Education, 24 April) omits is the complicity of academics in the demise of academic freedom. I can only write of a subject with which I am familiar: economics. There was a purging in the 1980s of the alternative voices to the dominant free-market economics. I was informed by one former economist that to teach Keynesian or an economics contrary to the mainstream was academic suicide. Not only would such lecturers be denied preferment, but they would be unable to have their \u201calternative views\u201d published in any respected academic journal. In a time of performance management, when the number of published articles counted towards a satisfactory assessment of one\u2019s performance, such alternative economics rapidly disappeared from the curriculum. Modern languages seem to have followed a similar path, where \u201cvalue for money\u201d criteria demanded the closure of many modern language courses. Since the quality needed by university chancellors and their senior management is the ability to adapt quickly to the ever-changing dictates of central government policies, it is not surprising that these people are poor defenders of academic freedom.

      "bodyText": "Persimmon shareholdershave revolted against the \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d and \u201ctotally and utterly unjustifiable\u201d \u00a375m bonus handed to the housebuilder\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Fairburn. Several shareholders took to their feet at Persimmon\u2019s annual meeting in York on Wednesday to express their outrage at the \u201cenormous sums\u201d awarded to Fairburn and other senior managers at Britain\u2019s second biggest housebuilder. Some 64% of shareholders failed to support the huge payout and just 36% voted in favour of the housebuilder\u2019s renumeration policy in one of the biggest expressions of investor frustration in recent years. However, despite huge investor anger the pay policy was approved because nearly a third of shareholders abstained from the vote and of those who voted, 51.5% cast in favour and 48.5% against. Euan Stirling, the head of stewardship at Aberdeen Standard Investments, one of Persimmon\u2019s biggest shareholders with a 2.3% stake, said the payment of \u201csuch excessive amounts\u201d had tarnished Persimmon\u2019s brand. Stirling said that Fairburn\u2019s offer to reduce his bonus from his legally entitled \u00a3110m to \u00a375m \u201cdoes not even get close to acceptable\u201d. He said being the chief executive of a FTSE 100 company \u201crequires a personal motivation that goes beyond simply amassing a fortune\u201d. \u201cRegardless of any moral or societal duties, company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the best long-term interests of the company that employs them,\u201d Stirling said. \u201cToday\u2019s remuneration results suggest that the executive directors at Persimmon have lost sight of that because the long-term success of the company is being endangered by the reputational damage associated with grossly excessive pay.\u201d Andrew Engleby, a private shareholder, told Persimmon\u2019s board that he was sad, disappointed and angry that the \u201ctotally and utterly unjustifiable\u201d awards were being paid. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this as someone who has worked in private sector all my life, but that is the case,\u201d Engleby said. \u201cEven the 40% that has vested already is totally unjustifiable.\u201d Fairburn collected the first \u00a350m worth of bonus shares on New Year\u2019s Eve and will collect the remainder of his long-term incentive plan share award on 1 July. He had been due to collect a total of \u00a3110m worth of bonus shares, but has agreed to forgo 50% of the second half of the award following intense criticism. Fairburn has also said he is setting up a charitable foundation, but has refused to reveal how much he will be donating, or the causes that might benefit. The huge bonus has been attacked by politicians, charities and corporate governance experts, who described it as \u201cobscene\u201d, \u201ccorporate looting\u201d and a reward based on \u201ctaxpayer subsidies\u201d. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the \u201cscale of this bonus is obscene\u201d and built on a \u201cgovernment subsidy\u201d. \u201cIt is reminiscent of the worst excesses of corporate greed that helped to create the financial crisis, when short-termism was heavily incentivised and long-term planning ignored.\u201d Persimmon is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government\u2019s help-to-buy programme, which has lifted sales and boosted house prices across the UK. Fairburn did not respond to the shareholder outrage to his bonus, leaving Persimmon\u2019s interim chairman, Nigel Mills, to field the criticism. He repeatedly apologised to shareholders for the flawed bonus scheme. Mills took on the interim chairman position after former chair Nicholas Wrigley resigned over his role in overseeing the bonus scheme, which was not capped to prevent an excessive payout. However, Mills said the board was powerless to force Fairburn and other senior managers to give up a greater proportion of their bonuses because of \u201ccontractual entitlements\u201d. He added: \u201cPlease let me take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly to our shareholders. This could have all have been handled better. Indeed it should have been. It is a matter of profound regret that we got to the position where we had a company with an exceptional management team, delivering exceptional, market-beating performance , that has been overshadowed by a row over pay.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The IT crisis engulfing TSB has entered a sixth day, with customers still experiencing problems accessing their accounts despite assurances from the bank that its internet and mobile services are now up and running. Guardian readers affected by the banking fiasco have been writing in to share their experiences. Matt from South Wales is on holiday in the Canary Islands and has been unable to pay for goods and services: I arrived on Saturday for a five-night break and this has totally ruined my holiday. My card was declined in a restaurant I went to and I had to walk 50 mins back to my hotel as I didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for a taxi. I tried to contact TSB via email and on the phone but after waiting for 40 minutes I couldn\u2019t wait any longer. I feel for everyone that\u2019s having these problems and I can\u2019t wait to get home to speak to someone in person. They are not keeping their customers updated and they will lose a lot of customers due to this terrible service. How can we trust them after this?\u201d Jules Hawkins, 54, who owns a Bristol-based leather lingerie brand, Lux Tenebrae, has been unable to pay her staff: I\u2019m going to have to pay them out of my First Direct personal account, which will look to HMRC like I\u2019m paying myself a huge amount of money when I eventually manage to reimburse myself. My staff don\u2019t have TSB accounts so why should they have to bear the brunt of this mess by going overdrawn and having to wait to claim back? It\u2019s the end of the month and they have rent and bills to pay. Also, are my automated payments still going out? Did I just pay my tax? Don\u2019t even get me started on trying to input my end-of-year tax return. Angela from Kent is concerned about her upcoming holiday: We are going away on Saturday and can\u2019t transfer money from our savings to buy holiday clothes and travel money. We didn\u2019t bother trying to contact TSB as their phone call waiting time is more than an hour! Mark, 54, from Birmingham was left on hold for three hours after seeing his account was showing in US dollars: My account is showing \u00a340k in arrears against my mortgage and the whole account shows in dollars. I can live with all of that but yesterday my son couldn\u2019t eat as I couldn\u2019t transfer funds to his Parent Pay account. Everybody can have issues but the true measure is how you rectify them. TSB\u2019s contingency has been very poorly thought out and will undoubtedly cost them long-term loyal customers. Jos is on a low income, with no credit cards or savings accounts and is unable to use his debit card: I have \u00a33.14 in my pocket, my wife is disabled and we can\u2019t shop for food. I\u2019ve been able to see my account details twice on the app since Sunday \u2013 both times the balance was wrong with credits and debits to the account missing. I have been particularly infuriated by TSB\u2019s claims of \u201cintermittent\u201d problems, which is entirely untrue. Sue Capener, 69, is disabled and lives on her own in Liverpool. She was expecting her online food shop to be delivered but her order was cancelled because of a declined payment: I usually get a shop in on Monday but TSB wouldn\u2019t release the funds. I can\u2019t go out and I have no family to help me. Instead I\u2019m sitting here answering calls about my bills not getting paid. Thankfully my four chihuahuas have enough food for the moment. I also saw the man next door and he was able to get me a loaf of bread from the shop but I\u2019m getting stressed out and I\u2019m at breaking point to be honest. Samantha from Doncaster logged into her account on Monday only to find the account she was looking at was not her own: I could see I had \u00a3200 more than I should have. After logging off and then on again I could see the transactions were completely different to mine \u2013 one was for WHSmith. I\u2019ve never shopped there in my life. By the evening my accounts had vanished. My council tax was due and they called saying the payment had bounced. Thankfully, when I told them I was with TSB they were fine about it. Luckily I took cash out on Friday but it is disgusting! All I can do is hope that someone is not looking at my account like I was looking at theirs. I tried to call TSB and got an automated person speaking and then the phone went dead. Andrew, a 44-year-old financial company director from Selby has had enough and is looking at moving his accounts: Both my current account and savings accounts are held with TSB and not having access to these funds is both frustrating and very disappointing. Having been a loyal customer for more than 15 years, despite various campaigns from other banks offering better products and services, this latest problem is the final straw and I\u2019ve completed the paperwork to move my accounts to First Direct. I\u2019m optimistic there won\u2019t be any problems with the switch.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Whitbread is to spin off its Costa Coffee chain from the rest of the business, which includes Premier Inn hotels, after pressure from activist investors. The company said the demerger of the UK\u2019s biggest coffee chain would be completed within two years, allowing shareholders to invest in \u201ctwo distinct, focused and market-leading businesses\u201d. Activist investors have built up stakes in the group over the past year and argued that Whitbread would be best split into its two component parts, Costa, and the Premier Inn hotel and restaurant chains \u2013 the latter including restaurant brands such as Brewers Fayre and Beefeater. Whitbread shares have underperformed the wider stock market in recent years, reflecting the fact that the two businesses are distinct and would be better off as separate entities, according to some investors. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cCoffee shops and hotel rooms don\u2019t make natural bedfellows, so splitting off Costa Coffee from Premier Inn makes sense for Whitbread. \u201cThe breakup will provide each of the two emerging companies with greater strategic focus on their own goals, and will allow investors to choose which of the two distinct brands they actually want exposure to.\u201d It is thought that Costa, which has 2,400 coffee shops, could be valued at about \u00a33bn. Whitbread has a market value of about \u00a38bn and employs 50,000 people. Alison Brittain, the Whitbread chief executive, said that while the discussion about a potential separation had been around for years, the time was now right, partly because both businesses had established good growth prospects abroad. She conceded that pressure from two investors, the US hedge funds Elliott Advisors and Sachem Head, had encouraged the board to bring forward the announcement about the demerger, to provide clarity for shareholders and employees. \u201cGiven the significant strategic progress that has been made and the momentum in the delivery of the plan, the board is confident that both Premier Inn and Costa will soon be businesses of sufficient strength, scale and capability to enable them to thrive as independent companies,\u201d she said. Costa will be a separate listed company, while Whitbread will remain the owner of Premier Inn, the UK\u2019s largest hotel chain. Brittain said the two-year timeframe reflected the enormously complex process of separating the two businesses, which share, among other things, IT systems, a pension deficit and \u00a31.8bn of loan facilities with banks and bondholders. \u201cIf it can happen before April 2020, then that\u2019s great, but we want to make sure we have the businesses in the strongest possible position,\u201d she said. Whitbread has expanded both businesses internationally, with Costa in China, Costa Express in other overseas markets, and Premier Inn in Germany, where it will have 31 hotels in 15 cities by 2021. Mark Brumby, the chief executive of the leisure analyst Langton Capital, said: \u201cMuch will ride on Germany if Whitbread ex-Costa is to remain an exciting growth company. The early signs are hopeful, but it is still early days.\u201d Whitbread also published results for the year to the end of February 2018. Revenue rose 6.1% to \u00a33.3bn, with pre-tax profit up 6.4% at \u00a3548m.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has cheered a \u201cresilient\u201d UK economy as its first-quarter profit rose, despite taking another \u00a390m hit from the payment protection insurance scandal. The bank reported a 6% increase in underlying pre-tax profit to \u00a32bn for the three months to 31 March. Bottom-line profit jumped 23% to \u00a31.6bn, although this fell slightly short of analysts\u2019 expectations. But Lloyds added \u00a390m in costs for PPI mis-selling claims, taking its total bill for the issue to \u00a318.8bn. Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe have made a strong start to 2018 and have begun implementing the strategic initiatives which will further digitise the group, enhance customer propositions, maximise our capabilities as an integrated financial service provider and transform the way we work. \u201cThe UK economy continues to be resilient, benefiting from low unemployment and continued GDP growth. We expect the economy to continue to perform along these lines during 2018.\u201d Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Lloyds had made a good start to 2018, with the bank benefiting from rising interest rates and its \u00a31.9bn acquisition of MBNA from Bank of America in 2016. However, while the bank has rebuilt profit and delivered steady returns to investors, share price gains have proved more elusive, Khalaf said.",

      "body": "<p>Lloyds Banking Group has cheered a \u201cresilient\u201d UK economy as its first-quarter profit rose, despite taking another \u00a390m hit from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/19/animatronic-arnie-ppi-complaints-four-year-high\">payment protection insurance scandal</a>.<br></p> <p>The bank reported a 6% increase in underlying pre-tax profit to \u00a32bn for the three months to 31 March. Bottom-line profit jumped 23% to \u00a31.6bn, although this fell slightly short of analysts\u2019 expectations.</p> <p>But Lloyds added \u00a390m in costs for PPI mis-selling claims, taking its total bill for the issue to \u00a318.8bn.</p> <p>Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe have made a strong start to 2018 and have begun implementing the strategic initiatives which will further digitise the group, enhance customer propositions, maximise our capabilities as an integrated financial service provider and transform the way we work.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK economy continues to be resilient, benefiting from low unemployment and continued GDP growth. We expect the economy to continue to perform along these lines during 2018.\u201d </p> <p>Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Lloyds had made a good start to 2018, with the bank benefiting from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/uk-interest-rates-bank-mark-carney\">rising interest rates</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/20/lloyds-snaps-up-mbna-for-19bn\">\u00a31.9bn acquisition of MBNA</a> from Bank of America in 2016. <br></p> <p> However, while the bank has rebuilt profit and delivered steady returns to investors, share price gains have proved more elusive, Khalaf said.</p>",
