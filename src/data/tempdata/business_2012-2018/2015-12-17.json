      "bodyText": "Brooklyn bad boy Martin Shkreli has never been far from controversy and that\u2019s just the way he likes it, normally. The 32-year-old became a Wall Street gambler at 17, received his first lawsuit at 24, was worth an estimated $100m shortly after turning 30 \u2013 and at this year achieved the title of \u201cthe most hated man in America\u201d. When the banker-turned-pharmaceutical-entrepreneur acquired his latest title, felony suspect, and felt the cold steel of federal handcuffs on Thursday, he may have been the only one who was surprised. Known as much for his insolent grin, flame-thrower interviews and bizarre publicity antics as his business activities, Shkreli looked unusually subdued after being arrested, his gray hoodie matching his pallor outside a courthouse in Brooklyn on a damp day. The charges against him relate to insider trading, not the more recent tactic by his company of alleged price-gouging of life-saving drugs that earned him the \u201chated\u201d label, and opprobrium from Congress. And a quick look back shows that notoriety has followed Shkreli like his own shadow from the start of his tumultuous career. He recently proudly described himself as \u201chot tempered\u201d and ascribed it to his background as a scrappy kid of immigrant Albanian and Croatian forebears, growing up in a tough street scene in the gritty working class Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn. Shkreli studied at the utilitarian Baruch College in New York and, while a 17-year-old student in 2000, he began working as a clerk at a hedge fund, Cramer, Berkowitz &amp; Co. One of his earliest known moves was to recommend shorting the stock of a biotech company (bet against the shares by selling them, anticipating and perhaps precipitating a fall in the price, then buying them back after the dive). The hedge fund made money but the suspicious trade earned Shkreli his first investigation by regulators, who ruled there was no wrongdoing. In 2006 the 23-year-old entrepreneur struck out with his own hedge fund, Elea Capital Management. But in July 2007, at the age of 24, Shkreli and his firm were sued by the not-long-for-this-world US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, for failing to pay up after placing a bet that the stock market (a put option) would fall when it, in fact, rose. A judge ordered Elea to pay $2.3 million. Shkreli then created a new hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, and focused mainly on shorting healthcare stocks. Even in the brash casino world of hedge funds and speculative trading, Shkreli was gaining a reputation as a ruthless upstart. But in 2011 he made what has come to be known as his \u201cdisastrous trade\u201d when a misjudged deal with Merrill Lynch cost MSMB $7m and left it virtually bankrupt. This was the deal that would come back to haunt Shkreli a few years later. But at the time he thrust onwards, seeking out the new path that would eventually bring him to the attention of the mainstream \u2013 and not in a good way. He started a pharmaceutical company in 2011 called Retrophin, operating in an arcane but growing financial niche. Relatively small companies buy up the rights to long-established but obscure drugs that treat rare illnesses, with little or no competition in the drugs market \u2013 ie a virtual monopoly \u2013 and then increase the prices. With a mix of fresh marketing and pricing of unchanged drugs and efforts to develop improved versions of older drugs, Shkreli recast himself as both a Wall Street wizard and a medical pioneer. Retrophin was quickly making multimillion-dollar sales with a handful of niche drugs and went public on the NASDAQ exchange in New York in January 2014. But Shkreli was ousted from his own company just a few months later, forced out in the fall of 2014 amid allegations that he floated Retrophin in order to provide stock to reimburse MSMB investors who lost out when the hedge fund became insolvent. And he was accused in court documents of harassing a former Retrophin portfolio manager over a debt by allegedly threatening the man\u2019s wife and son via Facebook, pledging to make the family homeless. Shkreli claimed Retrophin owed him $50 million in severance. Retrophin has since sued him in federal court in New York and filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing the company\u2019s founder of using its funds to pay legal settlements with former investors and passing off the payments as consultancy agreements. Shkreli was not on the sidelines or out of the floodlights for long. In February 2015 he started another pharmaceutical company that was to become his most notorious yet, Turing Pharmaceuticals. As chief executive he shot to infamy in September when it emerged that he had bought the drug Daraprim, which treats the rare but fatal infection toxoplasmosis, and increased the price 50-fold overnight. After taking flak he pledged to reduce the price, but then reneged on that and then said he should have raised it even higher. He has lived in a febrile atmosphere of controversy from that point until earlier this month, when he was simultaneously excoriated for price-gouging by a congressional committee in Washington and revealed as the $2 million buyer of the one-off copy of a new Wu-Tang Clan album. Throughout, Shkreli has answered his critics in a multitude of media interviews, social media posts and YouTube appearances with a mix of unabashed aggression, lewdness and verve. Some believe he is a genius, some that he is spoiled and twisted, many that he is both. In one of his most recent, expletive-peppered interviews, he offered to bail a rapper out of jail in Brooklyn and pay for his legal defense \u2013 if he would make music especially for him, and offered to play his exclusive Wu-Tang Clan album for Taylor Swift \u2013 if she would give him a blow job.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The decision to raise US interest rates for the first time in seven years could have negative effects on established startup businesses, investors have said, marking the start a new era of more cautious investment. \u201cThe historically low interest rates over the past few years have fueled asset growth in the public markets and real estate, as well as strong consumer and business spending,\u201d says Kyle Lui, principal at DCM Ventures, a Menlo Park-based venture firm that specialises in early stage tech investments including BitTorrent, YikYak and Tiebaobei. \u201cWe could see companies across the board \u2013 from startups to large companies, start to feel the impact on normalized interest rates.\u201d Announcing the change on 16 December, Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said the US economy was strengthening, and that the rate had helped ease the financial hardship of millions of Americans. \u201cThis action marks the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression,\u201d she said. While the US recession officially ended in June 2009, those low rates have stayed in place. In addition to helping the economy rebuild, they have spawned a generation of well-funded startups. The federal funds rate has been increased from a range of 0% to 0.25% to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Many have speculated that the higher rates will stunt the growth of some startups, working as a mini \u201cbubble\u201d of sorts. \u201cI think the effects are actually upstream, and the greater effect is the uncertainty in the market around later stage funding,\u201d says Jeff Lee, also a principal at DCM. \u201cWhile in the longer term, higher interest rates will pull some of the late stage capital out of the venture game and into more traditional asset classes, this actual effect is likely to be slow particularly given the expected measured pace of interest rate hikes. \u201cMore importantly, the general fear that the market is slowing down, coupled with the fact that a lot of funds are likely to be fundraising in the beginning of 2016, will probably slow down the pace in Q1 as well as increase volatility.\u201d Companies that are looking for late-stage financing are often getting those funds from investors who are looking for a faster return on their cash. Those investors ultimately might move to investing elsewhere. \u201cSome of the reason that there\u2019s a lot of availability of capital later in the curve is there\u2019s just a lot of capital looking for return,\u201d says Scott Kupor, partner at Menlo Park-based venture firm Andreessen-Horowitz, which has backed Airbnb, Slack, Facebook and Pinterest. \u201cInvestors haven\u2019t been able to find that in the stock market because yields are so low, therefore they have to move to riskier assets in order to achieve the kind of return that they want.\u201d Now that they have other options, some of those late-stage investors might choose to put their money elsewhere. It\u2019s an idea echoed by Aaref Hilaly, partner at Sequoia Capital, which has invested in DropBox, Square and Vulcun. \u201cHigher interest rates will be another brake on a late-stage financing market that is already slowing down,\u201d he says. \u201cSome companies will be slow to adjust, and it will take some painful experiences before they realize the high burn, go-go days are \u2013 at least for now \u2013 behind us.\u201d Solid, early stage companies are less likely to be affected, says Kupor, because investors are looking at the prospects for seven to 10 years away. \u201cWhat the macro environment looks like today is largely irrelevant for early-stage financing, because obviously the time frames in which we\u2019re thinking about potentially exiting these companies are so long,\u201d says Kupor. \u201cPeople are making decisions largely based on their view of what the seven to 10 year trends are from a broader technology perspective, as opposed to what the macro or stock market considerations might be on those investment.\u201d That\u2019s an idea echoed by Christine Tsai, founding partner at 500 Startups, a Silicon Valley-based incubator that works with a number of early-stage companies. 500 Startups has backed Twilio, Mayvenn and Ipsy. \u201cWe have told our companies that it will likely be harder to raise money next year, but we\u2019ve been saying this for a while. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a direct result of the interest increase,\u201d says Tsai. Investors, she says, are going to be looking for companies who have created sustainable business models, rather than those that have an idea but haven\u2019t quite figured out how they\u2019re going to grow and monetize it. It\u2019s yet more good news for firms that are on the way to building sustainable businesses, and likely to flush out some of Silicon Valley\u2019s more frothy startups.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a direct result of the interest increase,\u201d says Tsai. </p> <p>Investors, she says, are going to be looking for companies who have created sustainable business models, rather than those that have an idea but haven\u2019t quite figured out how they\u2019re going to grow and monetize it. </p> <p>It\u2019s yet more good news for firms that are on the way to building sustainable businesses, and likely to flush out some of Silicon Valley\u2019s more frothy startups.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An initial stock market surge after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade ran out of steam after an opening fall on Wall Street. European shares managed to end the day in positive territory, but closed off their best levels as the US central bank sanctioned a 0.25% rise in borrowing costs, signalling an end to the low interest rate environment which has prevailed since the financial crisis in 2008. On the whole, investors welcomed the rise because it removed the uncertainty that had been clouding the markets ever since the Fed unexpectedly kept rates on hold in September. They were also placated by Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments that any future rises would be gradual and dependent on future economic data. The FTSE 100 finished up 41.35 points or 0.68% at 6102.54, having climbed to 6,160 earlier in the day. Germany\u2019s Dax ended up 2.57% at 10,738 after reaching 10,829, while France\u2019s Cac closed 1.14% higher at 4677.54, down from its peak of 4,748. But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped nearly 225 points after Wednesday\u2019s interest rate decision, was down 153 points, or 0.86%, by lunchtime, partly due to another drop in commodity prices. The decision to raise interest rates pushed the dollar higher against other major currencies, with the pound down nearly 1% at $1.4877, its lowest level since mid-April. Despite better than expected UK retail sales, economists believe the Bank of England is in no hurry to follow the Fed by raising interest rates in the immediate future. The rise in the US currency helped push commodity prices lower, with Brent crude falling to $36.94, before it recovered to $37.26, down 0.35%. Investors continue to be concerned about oversupply, with the prospect of Iranian oil coming onto the market as sanctions are lifted. In turn, this put pressure on energy companies, with Chevron one of the biggest fallers on Wall Street. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: \u201cThe announcement by the Fed was certainly well received in the short term, but sentiment started to turn a little as the session drew to a close. Yes, the decision by Janet Yellen to make the move is a sign of confidence in the economy, but equally this has pushed the dollar higher, adding yet more pressure to commodity prices. \u201cGold is threatening to settle at its lowest level in six years, whilst crude oil is once again eyeing $35 a barrel. Although Euroepan markets may be closing ahead, Wall Street is tracking lower and rather than being the catalyst for what some would try to claim as being a Santa rally \u2013 despite starting from a low base \u2013 Ms Yellen is increasingly looking like she might be seen by some as the central banker who stole Christmas.\u201d The Fed\u2019s rate decision, partly based on the strengthening employment market, was backed by figures showing that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit fell last week, to 271,00 \u2013 11,000 fewer than the previous week.",

      "bodyText": "Many families look set to spend the festive season feasting on smoked salmon and gin while they play with a toy train set, judging by the latest official figures on popular winter spending. A bowl of soup, followed by a whisky over a jigsaw puzzle, on the other hand, appears to have fallen out of fashion. There is also potentially good news for turkeys in the analysis from the Office for National Statistics, if last year\u2019s drop in sales turns out to be a developing trend. Here are six key trends that emerge from the timely number-crunching of sales, at home and abroad, of winter-related products coming out of UK factories: 1. Baubles and tinsel lose their shine After two years of growing sales from 2011, sales of festive products such as baubles, tinsel and artificial Christmas trees dropped almost a third last year. The ONS said sales declined between 2013 and 2014 by 31.4% to \u00a339.7m. 2. Smoked salmon soars but turkey tumbles UK manufacturers\u2019 sales of fresh or chilled whole turkeys also fell abruptly last year, down 21% from 2013 to to \u00a329.9m. In contrast, sales of processed or preserved game such as venison, rabbit and hare, jumped 60% in a year to \u00a318.2m. The ONS cites reported that game has been boosted for several years by growing demand for leaner meat. \u201cOverall, there has been a noticeable gain in UK manufacturers\u2019 sales of this product, up 379.1% since the 2008 estimate of \u00a33.8m,\u201d it added. The was also a 25% leap in UK manufacturers\u2019 sales of processed or preserved smoked salmon between 2013 and 2014, to \u00a3279.3m. Sales are up an average 34% a year since 2009. Statisticians say the trend echoes a report from the Scottish Whisky Association that highlighted the growth of the salmon industry and rising global demand for the British variety, making it the country\u2019s second most exported food after chocolate and confectionery. 3. Soup sales have cooled The ONS highlights how warmer winters may have slowed demand for some weather-related products such as de-icer for cars and central heating boilers and it seems soups have not escaped the effects of milder temperatures. UK manufacturers\u2019 sales of soups and broths fell 16% between 2012 and 2014 to \u00a3473.4m \u2013 but sales are still 13% higher than in 2008. 4. Gin enjoys a renaissance but whisky dips After five years of growth, whisky sales dipped last year, knocking it out of UK manufacturers\u2019 top 10 selling products \u2013 ranked by value. With sales of \u00a33.07bn it was 11th in the table. Between 2008 and 2013, the average annual growth in sales of whisky by UK manufacturers was 6% but there was a drop of 1.6% in 2014. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s \u201cgin renaissance\u201d continues, said the ONS. The price of UK manufactured gin per litre of pure alcohol overtook whisky for the first time last year. The price per litre of gin has risen for each of the past six years, while the price per litre of whisky has been falling for the past two years. It has helped the value of gin sold by UK manufacturers almost double since 2008, going from \u00a3130.2m million to \u00a3254.4m last year. \u201cThis increase in sales may reflect increased UK exports, the emergence of micro-distilleries and the introduction of premium products or more exotic varieties to match evolving consumer demand,\u201d the ONS said. 5. Toy trains and construction toys in demand UK toy manufacturers have enjoyed rising demand in general and sales of construction sets and model trains have grown particularly strongly in recent years. Sales of electric model trains and accessories, as well as other scale models and construction toys trebled between 2008 and 2014, from \u00a38.6m to \u00a326.9m. The ONS sees a link with a toys and games study commissioned by its European couterpart, Eurostat. That found parents play an important role in the choice of toys and \u201cthey consider construction toys to stimulate creativity and can be used differently each time a child plays with them\u201d, the ONS said. That is bad news for jigsaw puzzles, it would appear. Sales edged up in 2014, to \u00a310.5m from \u00a39m the year before, but were down from \u00a311.6m in 2008. Overall, UK manufacturers\u2019 sales of products from the games and toys industry were \u00a3316.2m in 2014 up 55% from 2008. 6. Warmer weather unravels winter knits The winter of 2010-11 was the coldest for more than a century, but since then, UK winters have been milder. As temperatures have risen, glove sales have unravelled. UK manufacturers of knitted or crocheted gloves reported a 21% drop in sales between 2013 and 2014, down from \u00a32.5m to \u00a32.0m, the ONS said. Makers of leather gloves reported a 12% drop. Sales of knitted or crocheted scarves and shawls also edged down in 2014.",

The price per litre of gin has risen for each of the past six years, while the price per litre of whisky has been falling for the past two years. It has helped the value of gin sold by UK manufacturers almost double since 2008, going from \u00a3130.2m million to \u00a3254.4m last year.</p> <p>\u201cThis increase in sales may reflect increased UK exports, the emergence of micro-distilleries and the introduction of premium products or more exotic varieties to match evolving consumer demand,\u201d the ONS said.</p> <h2>5.

      "bodyText": "Over in Athens there has been some commotion this afternoon between Greece and its creditors. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: In a highly embarrassing move, the leftist-led government has had to withdraw its much-touted \u201cparallel economic program\u201d - outlining measures to ease the debt-stricken country\u2019s humanitarian crisis \u2013 under threat of having its next aid disbursement withheld. The program had been central to prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 promise that while his government had been forced to swallow the bitter pill of austerity \u2013 the price of being bailed out to the tune of \u20ac86bn this summer - harsh reforms would be offset with assistance for the most needy. Almost immediately there was uproar. Zoe Konstantopoulou, parliament\u2019s erstwhile president, one of 25 MPs who broke away from Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party this year, tweeted that Greece had a \u201cpuppet government\u201d that was \u201cdancing to the tune of lenders.\u201d Others said it was yet another example of the leftist-led coalition being boxed into a corner. Eurozone officials, who provisionally approved the \u20ac1bn aid instalment after the social measures were rescinded, said the funding would likely be disbursed Friday night. The disputed program would be reviewed in early January, they said, clarifying that Greece had failed to inform lenders of the cost of such measures. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With the Federal Reserve removing the uncertainty clouding markets by finally raising US interest rates, European markets responded favourably to the news. But an opening fall on Wall Street - which had surged in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s Fed move - took some of the shine off, and European shares ended off their best levels. The rise in the US dollar following the announcement of dearer borrowing costs hit commodity prices, with Brent crude down 0.5%, and left energy shares lower. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 41.35 points or 0.68% to 6102.54 having earlier risen as high as 6160 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.57% to 10,738.12 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.14% higher at 4677.54 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.48% to 21,523.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.72% at 9878.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 3.5% to 622.23 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 130 points or 0.7%. The IMF has commented on the Christine Lagarde situation: IMF Communications Director Gerry Rice:\u201cAs we have said before, it would not be appropriate to comment on a case that has been and is currently before the French judiciary. However, the Executive Board continues to express its confidence in the Managing Director\u2019s ability to effectively carry out her duties. The Board will continue to be briefed on this matter.\u201d Here\u2019s the early take on Christine Lagarde facing trial: Wall Street continues to decline, following its immediate rise on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates and promised only gradual increases in future. After a near 225 point increase in the wake of the Fed announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 61 points or 0.35%. The US fall has taken (some of) the shine off European shares. The FTSE 100 is now 0.9% higher at 6116, down from the day\u2019s peak of 6160. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.8% at at 10765 having earlier touched 10829. Christine Lagarde\u2019s lawyer has told Reuters that he will recommend she appeals the decision to try her over the Bernard Tapie affair. It looks like French journal Mediapart got the scoop about Christine Lagarde facing trial. Here\u2019s their story: French judges send IMF chief Lagarde for trial French media are reporting that the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, is to face trial over the Tapie financial scandal that had dogged France. Bernard Tapie is a businessman who received \u20ac403m in compensation from the French government, over the sale of Adidas in 1993. Tapie, an ally of former president Nicholas Sarkozy, claimed to have been defrauded by the now-defunct Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais bank over the affair. Sarkozy\u2019s administration agreed the payment; Lagarde was finance minister at the time. She has consistently denied any wrong-doing. In August 2014 the IMF chief was played under investigation by magistrates, over charges of \u201csimple negligence\u201d. That didn\u2019t last long... the Dow is now down 30 points. Ding ding! Shares are inching higher on Wall Street as traders returned to their desks in New York after yesterday\u2019s excitement. The Dow has gained 45 points (+0.25%) in the first few minutes of trading. The latest weekly US unemployment figures are out. And they don\u2019t suggest that the Fed made a catastrophic error by raising borrowing costs last night. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit fell last week, to 271,00. That\u2019s 11,000 fewer than last week (which was a five-month high). The initial jobless claims figure has been below 300,000 every week since early March, suggesting the labour market has been strengthening. Janet Yellen may not receive Christmas cards from many gold bugs this year. The gold price has dropped by over 1% today to $1,058 per ounce, hit by the stronger dollar following the rise in US interest rates. This chart shows how the peso has caught up with reality... Argentina\u2019s currency has just slumped by 30% against the dollar as the government lifts foreign exchange controls that had kept it artificially high. The peso is changing hands at 14 to the US dollar, from around 10 last night. That\u2019s broadly in line with the black market rate; a scarcity of US dollars has meant Argentines have had to pay much more than the official exchange rate. The decision to allow the peso to float free is one of the first moves by the new Buenos Aires government. Finance minister Alfonso Prat-Gay said it was an important step towards revitalising the country\u2019s economy and encouraging foreign investment: His message was: \u201cHe who wants to import will be able to do so, and he who wants to buy dollars will be able to buy them.\u201d The bulls are out on the Frankfurt stock exchange today: Germany\u2019s DAX index is galloping ahead today, up over 3%. That\u2019s a nine-day high, clawing back some of the losses since the European Central Bank disappointed investors with its latest stimulus package. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says European traders are embracing last night\u2019s Fed rate hike: The decision to raise rates for the first time following almost a decade of crises and unconventional policy measures is being welcomed as much for its end to uncertainty as its vote of confidence in US economic recovery. Has Yellen fired the starting pistol for a return to conventional policy and a delayed Santa Rally? Investors are pushing up the prices of eurozone government bonds today, in another sign that the Fed rate hike is being taken well. This has pushed down the yield (or interest rate) on debt issued by every major eurozone country, and also the UK: The mini-rally shows traders aren\u2019t panicking that central banks are going to tighten monetary policy aggressively. Eric Vanraes, fixed income portfolio manager at EI Sturdza Investment Funds, explains (via Reuters) \u201cThere were fears of a mistake from the Fed if it were too confident or too hawkish.\u201d But it was good news ... so phew! We can go on the Christmas holiday. We can have a small rally everywhere.\u201d James Hughes, chief market analyst at trading company GKFX, captures the mood in the City: Bloomberg is reporting that Martin Shkreli, the entrepreneur who attracted global opprobrium after he raised the price of an anti-infective drug by more than 5,000 percent, has been arrested on securities fraud charges: Details are a little scarce, but here\u2019s what they know so far: Prosecutors charged him with illegally taking stock from Retrophin Inc., a biotechnology firm he started in 2011, and using it pay off debts from unrelated business dealings. He was later ousted from the company, where he\u2019d been chief executive officer, and sued by its board. In the case that closely tracks that suit, federal prosecutors accused Shkreli of engaging in a complicated shell game after his defunct hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, lost millions. He is alleged to have made secret payoffs and set up sham consulting arrangements. More here: Spread-betting firms are predicting that the US stock market will hold onto yesterday\u2019s gains. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to open 58 points higher, according to IG. That would add to Wednesday\u2019s 224-point jump, suggesting Wall Street is getting into the festive spirit. The huge Christmas tree outside the New York stock exchange may help..... Photographers have been hard at work across Asia, capturing today\u2019s market rally: RBS has produced a handy chart showing how the markets are expecting US interest rates to rise much slower than in the past: They also warn that emerging markets could be threatened if the Fed hikes aggressively, as they have built up higher debts in recent years. [That\u2019s partly because \u2018hot money\u2019 has flooded out of the US in search of high returns] But there\u2019s also a danger that the Fed might be forced to cut rates if growth and inflation are weaker than forecast. Here\u2019s the full research note. After two hours of trading, European markets are holding onto their early gains. The rally is particularly strong in Frankfurt and Paris; traders are welcoming the Federal Reserve\u2019s confidence in the US economy, and its pledge to only raise rates gradually. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, says the Fed chair\u2019s upbeat but sober pronouncements last night have gone down well: A sigh of relief swept across financial markets as Janet Yellen confirmed months of speculation and hiked interest rates by 0.25% for the first time in nine years. A very measured statement proceeded, with an almost academic approach of both positivity and caution. Here\u2019s the picture: FTSE 100: up 86 points at 6147, + 1.4% German DAX: up 293 points at 10762, +2.8% French CAC: up 118 points at 2.55% But commodity prices continue to suffer from the weaker dollar. Here\u2019s a surprise.... UK retail sales smashed expectations last month, as shoppers gorged on Black Friday bargains via the internet. Retail sales jumped by 1.7% on the month, beating forecasts of 0.6%. They were 5% higher than in November 2014. The Office for National Statistics reports that online sales jumped sharply. The value of online sales increased by 12.7% in November 2015 compared with November 2014 and by 4.9% compared with October 2015. Shoppers also benefitted from falling prices, as retailers tried to drum up business: Average store prices (including petrol stations) fell by 3.3% in November 2015 compared with November 2014, the 17th consecutive month of year-on-year price falls. Breaking away from the Fed briefly, the latest survey from Germany shows that businesses are less optimistic this month. The business climate index produced by the IFO institute fell to 108.7 points, down from 109. The measure of the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d slid to 112.8 points, down from 113.4 in November, meaning firms are finding conditions a bit tougher this month. Today\u2019s market rally may not last long, argues Michael Holland, managing director of ratings and research firm FE Trustnet: After the pain of recent weeks, the current market rally will please many \u2013 but one suspects this is a bit of dead cat bounce. It should be seen more as a sigh of relief that something that was predicted actually followed through, rather than the markets are happy that the rate has been hiked. Typically, interest rates going up is viewed negatively by the equity markets \u2013 because historically this means that they will see greater outflows as higher interest rates lure investors away. The first Fed hike is the most exciting, but it still leaves borrowing costs very low in historical terms: Commodity prices are hitting fresh 17-year lows this morning, as the impact of the Fed rate hike ripples through the market. Copper, zinc and oil are all suffering, pushing Bloomberg\u2019s broad measure of commodity prices down towards record low levels: This is partly due to the stronger US currency, which means you need fewer dollars to buy the same quantity of metal or crude. It also reflects the impact on emerging market economies, who could suffer capital outflows as traders chase higher rates of return from US assets. The US dollar is strengthening this morning, sending it up against all the major currencies. Last night\u2019s rate hike makes the dollar more attractive to investors, as it offers a higher rate of return. This has sent the British pound sliding by 0.5%, or nearly three quarters of a cent, this morning to $1.4925 - a two-week low. Kit Juckes, global currency expert at french bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, says a stronger dollar may actually allow the Fed to raise rates more cautiously in 2016: The overnight reaction to the Fed rate hike has seen equity markets rally, oil prices remain very soft, commodity currencies fall back, and the dollar rally across the board. I wanted a dollar dip to buy and so far, it\u2019s just gone up. The focus will now be on the timing of the next Fed move, the pace thereafter, and the implications for commodity prices, capital flows out of emerging markets and China\u2019s currency policy. If the Fed raises rates by 1% next year - in line with the path implied by the FOMC\u2019s forecasts - the dollar will be significantly stronger by December 2016. In practise, they\u2019ll tighten less, in part because of further dollar strength. European stock markets are a sea of green: The fabled \u201cSanta Rally\u201d may be getting underway, now that the Fed rate decision is behind us. But it\u2019s still not been a vintage year. The FTSE 100 is down 6.3% since the start of 2015. The French stock market has jumped by 2%, as the wave of post-Fed relief reaches Paris. Germany\u2019s DAX is close behind. gaining 1.8%. This is partly because the euro is losing ground against the US dollar, which is a boost to eurozone exporters: Hearing the words \u201cFed hikes rates\u201d is a new experience for anyone who joined the financial world after the crisis began: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cAn interest rate rise is a new experience for much of Wall Street. A whole generation of traders have never known anything but the post-crisis world of ultra-low interest rates and, for the most part, rising asset prices. An estimated two-thirds of traders have never seen a full Fed tightening cycle. Of course, some of us are old enough to have seen it all before.... Boom! European stock markets are open, sending traders rushing to buy shares in the post-Fed rally. In London the FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip share jumped 97 points, or 1.5%, at the start of trading. Every share was positive, as a pre-Christmas spirit broke out across the City. Nearly every economists and analyst had expected a rate hike last night, so there\u2019s relief that the Fed hasn\u2019t dashed expectations. And investors are also taking comfort in Janet Yellen\u2019s pledge to only raise borrowing costs \u201cgradually\u201d Robert Craig, private client investment manager at MB Capital, says this promise has delighted Wall Street and the City: \u201cWhile the equity markets are supposedly not the Fed\u2019s primary concern, for the board to deliver anything other than a raise would have caused mayhem. \u201cAs it was the expectedly dovish hike, and Janet Yellen\u2019s frequent use of the word \u2018gradual\u2019 to describe the pace of future rises, came as a blessed relief to anxious stockwatchers. \u201cWith the Dow rising steadily from the moment she first opened her mouth, the rosy picture she painted of the US economy and the absence of major overseas threats has sent markets surging with relief. \u201cIn a press conference that was short on precision and long on pragmatism, the Fed left the door wide open to future changes in direction. \u201cBut what is clear is that there will be no sudden spiral of further rate rises \u2013 and for stocks, Christmas has come early.\u201d When might the Fed raise rates next? The financial markets suggest that the next hike, from 0.5% to 0.75% might not come until June: However, the people actually setting US interest rates are more hawkish. Last night\u2019s forecasts show they expect interest rates to be 1.4% by the end of next year - implying four quarter-point rate hikes. The Guardian\u2019s editorial writers aren\u2019t impressed by last night\u2019s rate hike, calling it \u201crisky and premature\u201d. Here\u2019s why: It is reassuring for America to feel like it is back in familiar waters \u2013 until it transpires that it is not. The quarter-point rate rise addresses one potentially serious problem, but does so in the wrong way. QE dollars have puffed up the price of some assets, and if that puffing goes unchecked, the next bubble and bust could begin. The right way to tackle speculative investment, however, is through targeted regulatory curbs on lending for speculative purposes, not by raising borrowing costs for all investments, including those that America needs. The justification for higher rates should be a real economy moving at an unsustainable pelt. There\u2019s no sign of that. We\u2019re not alone either - the Financial Times\u2019 front page calls it a \u201chistoric gamble\u201d: Apart from anything else, traders are simply relieved that the long prevarication over when US interest rates will rise has ended. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The quarter-point increase in borrowing costs could hardly be called a spur of the moment decision. On the contrary, the Fed has shown Hamlet-like indecision this year as it has weighed up the pros and cons of abandoning the zero interest rate policy that has been in force for the past seven years. Now, as Julius Caesar said when he crossed the Rubicon (with rather less dithering), the die is cast. The move is intended to signal that interest rates in the US will eventually return to normal. But not for some time, for this was \u2013 in the jargon of Wall Street \u2013 a dovish hike in interest rates. That sounds like an oxymoron, but means that the US central bank will take its time before moving again. Asian markets have picked up the baton from Wall Street, with shares jumping in Tokyo, Shanghai and beyond. Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped strongly, closing 1.6% higher, as investors took the long-awaited quarter-point rate hike in their strike. China\u2019s main market gained almost 2%, in a wide relief rally: FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Confidence in the global economy received an uplift last night following the Federal Reserve\u2019s unanimous decision to finally raise US interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The Dollar was installed with some bullish momentum across the global currency markets, however it was repeated on several occasions as expected that future rate rises will be gradual. But the Fed hasn\u2019t brought any relief to the oil market - crudes price dipped overnight, with Brent crude hovering around $37.30 per barrel Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. What was all the fuss about, eh? After all the speculation and angst about higher US interest rates, financial markets are taking last night\u2019s historic move in their stride. Shares have jumped in Asia overnight, and Europe is heading for a strong open in an hour\u2019s time. Spread-betting firm IG predicts that the main indices will all gain at least 1%. This follows a strong day\u2019s trading on Wall Street last night, where the Dow Jones closed up 224 points. The end of the \u201cextraordinary period\u201d of near-zero interest rates is being welcomed by investors. Crucially, Janet Yellen\u2019s pledge that future rate rises will be gradual (a word she repeated many times last night) is calming traders\u2019 nerves. Yellen\u2019s optimism over the prospects for the US economy is also cheering investors; the mood in the City is turning away from the Fed and towards Christmas. Except, of course, its not that simple. Fed policymakers are still forecasting that rates will rise faster than the markets expect - which could create uncertainty in 2016. Rhys Herbert, senior economist for Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: Whilst the Fed has reinforced its message that subsequent rises will take place gradually, the FOMC\u2019s interest rate forecasts continue to point to a faster rate of tightening than is implied by market pricing, leaving room for considerable asset price volatility if economic developments continue along the lines that the FOMC currently expect. How this gap between market and FOMC expectations closes will determine how financial markets behave over the coming year.\u201d It will take weeks for capital markets and foreign exchange rates to adjust to to the end of the ZIRP era (zero interest rate policy), and possibly years until we know whether Janet Yellen and colleagues made an astute call or a serious blunder yesterday. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate, has already called it \u201cBad News For Working Families\u201d. Commercial banks have wasted no time in raising their borrowing rates, meaning Christmas will be a little tighter for some... Also coming up today... There could be drama in Argentina, as the government ends currency controls. The peso is likely to plunge sharply, as finance minister Alfonso Prat-Gay tries to stimulate the economy and encourage foreign investment. And in Europe, we get the latest UK retail sales figures (at 9.30am GMT), plus the IFO survey of German business confidence (at 9am).",

The program had been central to prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 promise that while his government had been forced to swallow the bitter pill of austerity \u2013 the price of being bailed out to the tune of \u20ac86bn this summer - harsh reforms would be offset with assistance for the most needy. </p> <p>Almost immediately there was uproar. </p> <p>Zoe Konstantopoulou, parliament\u2019s erstwhile president, one of 25 MPs who broke away from Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party this year, tweeted that Greece had a \u201cpuppet government\u201d that was \u201cdancing to the tune of lenders.\u201d Others said it was yet another example of the leftist-led coalition being boxed into a corner. </p> <p>Eurozone officials, who provisionally approved the \u20ac1bn aid instalment after the social measures were rescinded, said the funding would likely be disbursed Friday night. The disputed program would be reviewed in early January, they said, clarifying that Greece had failed to inform lenders of the cost of such measures. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7545b42c1c5822f65d0cc3c6e257cb6bfe1a7889\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7545b42c1c5822f65d0cc3c6e257cb6bfe1a7889/123_456_2786_1886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Konstantopoulou and Tsipras in happier times earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Konstantopoulou and Tsipras in happier times earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yannis Behrakis/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening.

      "bodyText": "The government has won EU approval to compensate steel producers for the cost of green taxes, but unions warned that the concession was not enough to save the industry. British energy-intensive industries such as steel paid 80% more for electricity in the first half of 2015 than the EU average, which is itself about twice as high as in the US. High energy costs have contributed to thousands of job losses at British steelmakers, including 2,200 at Redcar in north-east England. Business secretary Sajid Javid said: \u201cThis is very welcome news and meets a commitment we made to deliver energy compensation for the steel industry by the end of the year. Relief from energy costs will save our steel industry hundreds of millions of pounds.\u201d But the industry and unions called for more action to stop alleged Chinese dumping of cheap steel and to put in place a procurement policy for big state projects. Alex Flynn, of the Unite union, said: \u201cThe government has dragged its heels on this and it\u2019s all very late, too late for those 2,000 workers at Redcar who face a very uncertain christmas and new year.\u201d SSI, the Thailand-based company that owned the steelworks in Redcar, went into administration in October. \u201cThe only reason the government felt forced to do anything was because of the collaboration between the unions and the steel industry bodies,\u201d added Flynn. The industry body UK Steel has been working with unions and the government to try to rescue the industry, setting up working groups to look at how best to influence government on buying British on infrastucture projects and how best to attack the problem of steel being dumped in the market by lower cost producers. \u201cThis is a hugely significant and welcome announcement, but this is far from job done. The dumping of Chinese steel continues and must be stopped. The business secretary has done well to deliver this first stage of the state aid package,\u201d,\u201d said Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel. \u201cBut the government cannot afford to let up on ensuring that all major procurement projects, from rail to tidal barrages and airports, all use British steel to give this vital UK industry confidence for the long term. And ministers can do more by reforming business rates to exclude some of the penalties steel companies and others face if they invest in plant and machinery.\u201d The British government promised in October that it would start refunding the costs of green taxes as soon as it received EU approval. The state aid request relates to the so-called renewables obligation, the government\u2019s main incentive mechanism for large-scale renewables projects.",

      "bodyText": "The former JJB Sports chief executive Chris Ronnie has been ordered to pay nearly \u00a3633,000 after being convicted of fraud last year. Ronnie was sentenced to four years in prison and banned from being a company director for eight years after a jury unanimously found him guilty of taking about \u00a31m in backhanders, then trying to cover up his crime. His early release date is likely to be 9 December 2016. In a hearing at Southwark crown court on Thursday morning, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said Ronnie, who watched proceedings via videolink from prison, would have to pay within three months or have an additional five years added to his sentence. Mark Thompson, the head of the Serious Fraud Office proceeds of crime division, said: \u201cThe SFO is committed to ensuring that fraudsters do not retain the benefit of their crimes. We will take steps to make sure the order is satisfied within the period set by the court.\u201d A schedule of assets from which Ronnie will need to secure his payment under the confiscation order includes a home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, which is already on the market, and a 50% share in a house in Marbella, Spain, as well as a Range Rover and a 258CR registration number, worth \u00a34,000. A Rolex Cosmograph Daytona worth \u00a35,000 and a Panerai Luminor Marina watch valued at \u00a33,000 are also listed among his assets. At the time of his conviction, the judge said Ronnie was guilty of a \u201cvery greedy\u201d fraud and had not shown \u201cany sign of remorse or even embarrassment about what you have done\u201d. On Thursday, Loraine-Smith said Ronnie, looking slim and dressed in a dark blue T-shirt, was \u201calmost unrecognisable\u201d from the time of his conviction. He was found guilty of three counts of fraud over three six-figure cash payments made to him by suppliers during his tenure as JJB chief executive. He also was found guilty of two charges of providing false information. The payments to Ronnie, which he partly used to buy a luxury holiday home in Florida that has since been sold, were not disclosed to the JJB board. Ronnie, a former executive at Sports Direct under Mike Ashley, ran JJB between August 2007 and March 2009, during which time its share price collapsed from more than \u00a32 to less than 3p. JJB never recovered from the period of decline under Ronnie and went on to collapse in September 2012, with the loss of thousands of jobs. The following month, it was announced that Sports Direct had purchased part of the business, including 20 stores, the brand and its website, for \u00a324m.",

We have also reviewed our recruitment and remuneration processes to ensure that Cabinet Office and HM Treasury requirements are adhered to in future.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Value of fines imposed by City's financial regulator drops 40%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The value of fines imposed on City firms and individuals has fallen by almost 40% this year, with a marked slowdown in the last six months of the year. The \u00a3905m of fines by the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 down from a record \u00a31.5bn in 2014 \u2013 is almost double the \u00a3474m for 2013, previously the second biggest year. Lawyers were divided over whether this meant the FCA was taking a more lenient approach after the sudden departure of the chief executive, Martin Wheatley, which was announced in July when the chancellor did not renew his contract. \u201cThere is a view in the market that the atmosphere has changed since the election. Martin Wheatley was very focused on where he perceived to see poor behaviour and his departure may see a change in approach including a reduction in fines. On this view the fall off in fines is possibly an indication of this already,\u201d said Peter Snowdon, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright. But Marcus Bonnell, regulatory counsel at the law firm RPC, said: \u201cClearly the financial services industry cannot breathe a sigh of relief.\u201d He pointed to record fines imposed for certain rule breaches, such as the \u00a372m levied on Barclays for potentially facilitating financial crime through an \u201celephant deal\u201d. The 2014 tally was bolstered by the \u00a31.1bn of fines for rigging foreign exchange markets imposed on major banks. Swiss bank UBS received the biggest fine, at \u00a3233m, followed by the Citibank and JP Morgan in the US, which were fined \u00a3225m and \u00a3222m respectively. Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland was fined \u00a3217m and HSBC \u00a3216m. But there was a marked slowdown in the second half of this year with only 15 fines worth a total of \u00a380m. In the first half of 2014 there were 24 fines worth \u00a31.3bn. The reduction means George Osborne has less to spend on good causes, after he changed the law in 2012 following the outcry caused by the fine imposed on Barclays for Libor rigging. Until then, the fines went back to the regulator to reduce the annual levy paid by firms to fund the regime. During 2015, Barclays was fined twice, not only for the elephant deal that might have been used to facilitate finance crime, but also \u00a3284m for rigging foreign exchange markets. It was not part of the settlement with other banks in 2014 and was handed a record fine for rigging the currency market. Another bank to receive a record fine was bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, which had a \u00a3117m penalty imposed for mishandling payment protection insurance claims. RPC said the proportion of fines the FCA levied against individuals this year rose to 51%, up from 33% in 2014. There were 21 fines against individuals this year compared with 13 in 2014. There were six fines for market abuse, up from two in 2014. Bonnell said: \u201cBy imposing more than half of all fines against individuals the FCA is demonstrating that financial services workers will be directly accountable for their actions.\u201d The FCA has not yet taken action against any of the individuals involved in rigging foreign exchange markets while any criminal actions are considered. The Swiss authorities, however, on Thursday announced a series of measures against six former UBS employees for rigging currency and precious metals markets. The local regulator, Finma, said it had imposed bans of between one and five years on the individuals, who were not named. Eleven individuals had originally been investigated and proceedings against one are continuing. \u201cWhile four enforcement proceedings were discontinued in August 2015, Finma proceeded with a further six, coming to the conclusion that those concerned bore significant responsibility for the serious organisational shortcomings and improper conduct at UBS,\u201d the regulator said.",

Andrew Grech, Slater &amp; Gordon\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cWe have previously advised the market that the performance of our UK operations during the first half has not been in line with expectations. It is now clear to us that the slower rate of case resolutions in the first half has had a larger impact than previously thought, and that this may well flow through to a reduced profit for the full year. \u201cFor this reason, we have withdrawn our full-year guidance and we are conducting a review of our forecasting methods so that we can provide the market with greater clarity moving forward.\u201d Slater &amp; Gordon\u2019s UK operation is one of the country\u2019s biggest law firms, with solicitors in 27 locations across England, Scotland and Wales. It has expanded aggressively, especially in no-win, no-fee personal injury claims. It increased its presence in the UK \u2013 and its exposure to controversy \u2013 by buying the professional services arm of Quindell earlier this year. Quindell is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over its \u201cbusiness and accounting practices\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has made sweeping changes to its senior management team as it attempts to cut costs and overhaul its culture following the diesel emissions scandal. The German carmaker has almost halved the number of senior managers reporting directly to Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive, and brought in several new faces. M\u00fcller has pledged to transform the notoriously unwieldy structure of VW after the company admitted that the emissions scandal had occurred because of a \u201cwhole chain\u201d of errors and a corporate mindset that tolerated rule-breaking. He said the management changes would \u201cspeed up the decision-making process, reduce complexity and increase efficiency\u201d. VW has admitted installing defeat devices in 11m of its vehicles worldwide. The carmaker faces the prospect of having to pay tens of billions of euros in fines and compensation to customers. The woes it faces worsened this week when the European Union\u2019s anti-fraud office, Olaf, confirmed it is investigating loans that VW received from the European Investment Bank to develop cleaner engines. In total VW received an estimated \u20ac9.5bn (\u00a36.9bn) in loans from the EIB. The management changes at VW include Ulrich Eichhorn becoming head of research and development. He replaces Ulrich Hackenberg, who left the company earlier this month after being suspended for two months as part of the investigation into the emissions scandal. Eichhorn previously worked for VW and its brands, including Bentley, for more than a decade until he left in 2012 to take up a position with an industry trade body in Germany. Other changes include Fred Kappler, the head of group services, becoming head of sales, while Porsche veteran Michael Mauer takes over group design and former Seat executive Wolfram Thomas takes charge of production. M\u00fcller said: \u201cOur new lean structure will enable us to develop the considerable potential of our company, its brands and employees to great effect. We will see faster decision-making and more efficient action.\u201d VW plans to begin work on repairing the 8.5m cars in Europe affected by the diesel emissions scandal in January. The German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has given the company the green light to install software and a flow transformer device, part of the air intake system, into the diesel engines that contain software designed to cheat emissions tests. VW will begin the process of repairing vehicles early next year by sending letters to motorists. This letter will advise customers that their vehicles are scheduled to be repaired but to await further instructions. A second letter will then tell affected motorists to contact a local engineer in \u201cgood time\u201d to fix their vehicle. Vehicles with a 1.2-litre or 2-litre engine will be fixed with a software update that can be installed in less than 30 minutes. However, 1.6-litre cars will require a new part to be placed in the vehicle, which will take less than an hour. The recall will begin with 2-litre cars in the first quarter of 2016, followed by 1.2-litre cars in the second quarter and 1.6-litre cars in the third quarter. VW has said it will provide compensation for customers for any fall in the residual value of their car, but the German company is yet to announce its plans. Customers will be provided with a free hire-car while their vehicle is being repaired.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Black Friday discounts helped drive a surprise jump in UK retail sales last month, as shoppers splashed out online and in department stores. Official figures showed retail sales volumes were up 1.7% from the month before, beating forecasts for growth of 0.5% in a Reuters poll of economists. On the year, sales volumes were up 5%, defying the 3% growth forecast. While much of the volume growth was down to discounting, the amount spent was also up on the year, by 1.4%. Economists said the figures suggested the overall UK economy would end the year on a strong note. The Office for National Statistics said the figures included Black Friday sales on 27 November but not Cyber Monday, on 30 November this year, when online retailers offer discounts. Going up The buoyant figures were at odds with reports from business groups suggesting sales were strong again for the US-style Black Friday event but that trade earlier in the month was soft, partly because mild weather had hurt winter clothing sales. Experts warned that Christmas could still be tough for retailers and that it remained to be seen if November\u2019s sales surge would come at December\u2019s expense. \u201cRetailers will be pleased with the sales growth achieved in November, but analysts and retailers should really wait until the Christmas season has run its course before drawing any firm conclusions,\u201d said Ian Gilmartin, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the sales growth in the last two months added to signs that the economy had enjoyed a strong end to the year, with GDP looking to have risen by 0.6% in the final quarter. \u201cRetailers may see some payback after the Black Friday promotions led shoppers to pull forward spending that would otherwise have taken place in December, but the underlying sales trend looks set to remain strong as we head into 2016,\u201d Williamson added. \u201cAs well as discounts \u2013 store prices were 3.3% lower than a year ago in November amid aggressive Black Friday promotions \u2013 consumer spending is being driven by a host of other tailwinds. Households are benefitting from improved job security ... low inflation and falling energy prices, the latter helping free-up more income to boost retail sales, as well of course from ultra-low interest rates.\u201d The ONS also highlighted the role of discounts in the latest sales increase, the 31st straight month of annual growth. \u201cA continued fall in prices as well as promotions in the run-up to Christmas have helped to boost the amount shoppers bought in November, both on the high street and online, with the biggest increases coming from department stores and household goods retailers,\u201d said Melanie Richard, ONS head of retail sales. Despite the government\u2019s plans to rebalance the economy away from over-reliance on consumers and towards more manufacturing and exports, spending has been the main driver of economic growth this year. Retail sales have benefited as shoppers are left with more spare cash for luxuries thanks to a drop in petrol and food prices. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank highlighted the 14% year-on-year rise in fuel sales, contrasting with only muted growth in food store sales. \u201cWhile cheap fuel makes people drive more, cheaper food hasn\u2019t boosted sales of food \u2013 there is only so much a person can eat. Instead, the savings on the weekly food shop appear to have been spent in department stores and on household goods. This is a decent demonstration of good deflation,\u201d he said. The latest retail figures further fuel the debate over when UK interest rates will start rising from the record low of 0.5% where they have been since early 2009. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates in the US on Wednesday, in the first rise for almost a decade. The Bank of England has insisted it will not take its cues from the US and wants to see more established wage growth. The latest earnings data suggests pay growth has levelled off and financial markets are not pricing in a rate rise until late 2016. \u201cWith the latest data showing pay growth slowing rather than accelerating, the first hike still seems a long way off,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cHowever, if this strong consumer spending trend continues, it\u2019s hard to see how some policymakers will be comfortable with holding off with rate hikes next year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Space has been in the news this week thanks to British astronaut Tim Peake and now it is the turn of satellite communications group Inmarsat. The FTSE 100 company has climbed 33p or 3% to \u00a311.18 after analysts at Morgan Stanley issued an overweight recommendation and raised their target price from \u00a310.80 to \u00a314 on the basis on new growth opportunities for the company, including in the aviation sector and from a fourth satellite. Inmarsat recently successfully launched its third satellite to get its Global Xpress service up and running, allowing it to start striking deals with airlines to supply broadband services. Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Tsui said: The shares have enjoyed 37% performance year to date, but we still believe they offer potential upside in two areas. We think the satellite launches due in 2016 could be the catalyst for a further re-rating. (1) Aviation \u2013 very early days, but could be of significant value. Inmarsat is targeting two segments of the passenger aircraft connectivity market: (i) long-haul through its Global Xpress (GX) product and its agreements with Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, and potentially other airliners to come; and (2) short-haul through its air-to-ground agreement with Deutsche Telekom. Using the example of Gogo in North America, but considering Inmarsat\u2019s superior spectrum position and capacity (30 MHz versus 5 MHz), our indicative model suggests that this could be a near $150m per annum revenue opportunity, or around 12% of group sales, worth a net present value of $1.3bn or 190p a share. The bull case could be worth another 260p on top. However, 2016 will likely see higher costs associated with the rollout (our earnings per share fall 14%) and the full opportunity may not be realised until the next decade. (2) Optionality from upcoming satellite launch. Much of the attention has been on Inmarsat\u2019s three satellite launches since December 2013 to get GX services up and running. This is understandable given the launch failures experienced by the Russian vehicle Proton (which at the time was carrying other satellites, not Inmarsat\u2019s). However, in October 2013, Inmarsat announced the purchase of a fourth satellite as a backup and has even secured a launch slot through the US SpaceX vehicle in mid-2016. We await more details on the revenue opportunities for this satellite in March, but the company has already acknowledged that \u201ccustomers in different regions [are] vying to have the [fourth GX] satellite placed over their areas of interest\u201d. From 2017, we model $100m per annum of incremental revenues, worth 130p to our price target. We raise our price target by 320p to \u00a314 to reflect the upside in aviation and the fourth satellite, which we expect to be more visible with the upcoming satellite launches. On our estimates, the shares trade on 10 times 2017 estimated EBITDA and 20.8 times earnings, and offer a dividend yield of 3.4%.",

Among the risers, AstraZeneca has added 41p to 4457.5p after it splashed out $4bn for 55% of privately owned biotech group Acerta Pharma. Earlier in the week, AstraZeneca had said it was looking at strategic options with Acerta, which is based in California and the Netherlands. The move gives AstraZeneca access to a new treatment for blood cancers, and chief executive Pascal Soriot said: [The deal gives AstraZeneca] a potential best-in-class medicine that could transform treatment for patients across a range of blood cancers. AstraZeneca will pay $2.5bn initially, with a further $1.5bn due depending on first regulatory approval for the new drug, acalabrutnib. Acerta shareholders have the option to sell the remaining 45% of the company for around $3bn, once approval is reached in both the US and Europe. The deal comes a day after AstraZeneca announced it was buying global rights to a portfolio of respiratory drugs from Japan\u2019s Takeda. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently 71.25 points higher at 6132.44, helped by better than expected UK retail sales. The news boosted the pound, on the basis that it adds to the idea that the UK could be the next to raise rates after the Fed\u2019s move on Wednesday. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 has bounded higher at the open, supported not only by the fact that Janet Yellen drew a line under the financial crisis \u2013 at least on the other side of the Atlantic \u2013 by hiking interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, but also accompanying this with a dovish call. Yes, more rate hikes will follow, but they will be gradual - and there\u2019s no real expectation of the US hitting inflation targets before 2018. Benefiting from the buoyant mood was South African investment groups Old Mutual, up 12.2p at 177.2p and Investec, up 34.7p at 487.7p, after gains in the local market following the Fed news. Supermarkets are also in demand, with Sainsbury up 12.7p at 260.9p and Morrisons 5.8p better at 153p. Among the fallers, housebuilder Berkeley is down 154p at \u00a336.03 after its shares went ex-dividend while United Utilities was down 1.5p at 936p for the same reason. A strong dollar hit commodities again, leaving Glencore 0.32p lower at 84.03p. Among the mid-caps, chemicals company Elementis has dropped 15.4p to 221.3p after it said full year earnings per share were likely to be at the lower end of market expectations, due to \u201cchallenging\u201d markets.",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets cheered the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to increase interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. In London, the FTSE 100 index jumped nearly 100 points in the first minute of trading, rising 1.6% to 6,158, with all stocks making gains. It is still down 6% this year, however, and down 3% this month. The Dax in Frankfurt rose 1.9% while the CAC in Paris rallied 2.3% and the Ibex in Madrid was up 2% in early European trading. This is partly because the euro lost ground against the US dollar, providing a boost to eurozone exporters. Investors were cheered by Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s pledge to raise borrowing costs only gradually. \u201cChristmas has come early\u201d for stock markets, said Robert Craig, private client investment manager at MB Capital. Yellen\u2019s promise came \u201cas a blessed relief to anxious stockwatchers\u201d, he said. \u201cWith the Dow rising steadily from the moment she first opened her mouth, the rosy picture she painted of the US economy and the absence of major overseas threats has sent markets surging with relief.\u201d Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, told Reuters: \u201cWith the Fed out of the way and only a couple of trading sessions left before Christmas, we could now see a traditional year-end rally. The new year will once again prove to be quite volatile as markets will start to anticipate the next rate hike.\u201d Stock markets across the Asia Pacific region also rallied, with the Nikkei index in Japan closing up 1.6% while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.5%. In China, the main Shanghai Composite index finished 1.8% higher and the smaller Shenzhen Composite gained 2.7%. The Australian stock market ended the day 1.5% higher. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cAn interest rate rise is a new experience for much of Wall Street. A whole generation of traders have never known anything but the post-crisis world of ultra-low interest rates and, for the most part, rising asset prices. An estimated two-thirds of traders have never seen a full Fed tightening cycle.\u201d Governments and central bankers breathed a sigh of relief when stock markets rallied following the rate rise, which had been widely expected. The South Korean vice-finance minister Joo Hyung-hwan said: \u201cIt is a relief that even despite the Fed rate hike, turbulence in global financial markets has not been large.\u201d The Fed raised the target range for its fed funds rate by 25 basis points, to between 0.25% and 0.50%, the first increase since 2006. Its rate-setting committee said there had been \u201cconsiderable improvement\u201d in labour market conditions this year and added that it was now \u201creasonably confident\u201d that inflation would climb back to the 2% target in the medium term. It made clear that the increase was the tentative start of a \u201cgradual\u201d series of hikes and that it would closely monitor inflation. Financial markets suggest that the next hike, to 0.75%, might not come until June. Although the decision by Yellen and her colleagues provided greater certainty for markets, there was some concern about the longer-term impact of the rate rise. The move pushed up the dollar, raising questions about whether investors would pour money into higher-yielding US debt at the expense of emerging economies. Copper fell 0.9% to $4,569 (\u00a33,062) a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. Hong Kong\u2019s top central banker, who was obliged to immediately match the Fed\u2019s hike under the Chinese-run territory\u2019s peg to the US dollar, said he expected only a modest outflow of capital as a result of the Fed\u2019s move, but added that outflows would depend on the pace of US rate hikes and the interest rate differential between the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar. The fall in the price of oil, which has weighed on markets for several weeks, continued on Friday. Brent crude slipped 0.3% to $37.27, while New York light crude edged down 0.2% to $35.46. Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics, noted: \u201cConfounding the expectations of many, the Fed did little to take the sting out of that hike by significantly lowering its projections for the pace of future rate hikes. Looking at the new projections, there was surprisingly little change. The vote to raise rates was unanimous, which could also be interpreted as hawkish.\u201d",

It made clear that the increase was the tentative start of a \u201cgradual\u201d series of hikes and that it would closely monitor inflation.</p> <p>Financial markets suggest that the next hike, to 0.75%, might not come until June.</p> <p>Although the decision by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/janet-yellen\">Yellen</a> and her colleagues provided greater certainty for markets, there was some concern about the longer-term impact of the rate rise.<br></p> <p>The move pushed up the dollar, raising questions about whether investors would pour money into higher-yielding US debt at the expense of emerging economies. Copper fell 0.9% to $4,569 (\u00a33,062) a tonne on the London Metal Exchange.</p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s top central banker, who was obliged to immediately match the Fed\u2019s hike under the Chinese-run territory\u2019s peg to the US dollar, said he expected only a modest outflow of capital as a result of the Fed\u2019s move, but added that outflows would depend on the pace of US rate hikes and the interest rate differential between the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar.</p> <p>The fall in the price of oil, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/ftse-three-year-low-oil-price-rattles-markets\">which has weighed on markets for several weeks</a>, continued on Friday. Brent crude slipped 0.3% to $37.27, while New York light crude edged down 0.2% to $35.46.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics, noted: \u201cConfounding the expectations of many, the Fed did little to take the sting out of that hike by significantly lowering its projections for the pace of future rate hikes. Looking at the new projections, there was surprisingly little change. The vote to raise rates was unanimous, which could also be interpreted as hawkish.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Governments and central bankers across Asia Pacific have breathed a collective sigh of relief after stock markets rallied rather than recoiled at the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates. The region\u2019s main stock markets saw impressive gains on the back of the first Fed rise since 2006, with the Nikkei index in Japan up 1.54% at 6am GMT and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rising 0.56%, while the ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia closed up 1.5%. Futures trading suggested European stock markets would also open in the black on Thursday, following on from Wednesday\u2019s gains. South Korean vice-finance minister Joo Hyung-hwan said: \u201cIt is a relief that even despite the Fed rate hike, turbulence in global financial markets has not been large.\u201d But although the decision by the Fed\u2019s chair, Janet Yellen, and her colleagues had provided greater certainty for markets, there was some cause for concern about the longer-term impact of the rate rise. The US dollar rose 1% in Asian trading against a basket of currencies, raising questions about whether investors would redirect capital to higher-yielding US debt and undermine shaky emerging economies. The fall in the price of oil, which has discomfited markets for several weeks, continued on Thursday. Brent crude fell 21c to $37.18 while West Texas crude was down 12c to $35.40 because of unexpectedly large US inventories. \u201cLast night\u2019s inventory data from the US was clearly unsettling,\u201d said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. \u201cWe are now seeing signs of the US dollar getting stronger, following on from the Fed.\u201d Chris Weston, chief market strategist at online trading firm IG in Melbourne, said: \u201cTraders seem to be rejoicing at the mere certainty provided by the Federal Reserve, although I would temper that by saying we have potentially entered a new realm of increased uncertainty. \u201cThe question is whether this rally continues, making tonight\u2019s US trade very important. In an event like this, the first move might not be the right move.\u201d Analysts at Citibank\u2019s Asian economic team agreed that while equities and credit market had perked up, the response of commodity market suggested caution. \u201cWe have long argued that early signs of growth in emerging markets would be seen in commodity markets, so we take heed that neither energy nor metal prices shared the optimism of the equities and credit markets,\u201d the analysts said in a report. Hong Kong\u2019s top central banker, who was obliged to immediately match the Fed\u2019s hike under the Chinese-run city\u2019s peg to the US dollar, said he expected only a modest outflow of capital as a result of the Fed\u2019s move. China\u2019s central bank also added to the reassuring mood, pencilling in economic growth of 6.8% for next year in a working paper released on Wednesday, down only slightly from an expected 6.9% this year. A senior researcher at an official Chinese think-tank chimed in, saying the hike would not lead to major economic disruption. Zeng Gang, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences banking research division, told the official People\u2019s Daily paper that as the rate rise had been widely expected, it had been priced into markets and the announcement impact was limited. Data showing drops in exports from Japan and Singapore, including big falls in shipments to China, sounded some other sour notes on Thursday but it was expected that the Fed move would allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding its own stimulus at the year\u2019s final BOJ rate review on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "For Kensington and Chelsea, read Walthamstow and Forest Gate. London\u2019s booming housing market has created a new breed of east London property millionaire, according to a new study which reveals that more than 200 Britons a day are waking up to find their home is now worth a seven-figure sum. Across Britain, more than 620,000 people now own a house or flat worth \u00a31m or more, which is an increase of 75,000 on January\u2019s total, said researchers at Zoopla, the property website. Outside London, it is east England, Yorkshire and the Humber that have seen the largest increases in million-pound properties \u2013 up 28% and 24% respectively since the start of this year. Scotland is the only region where there are now fewer property millionaires than there were in January \u2013 which may reflect the impact that a new Scottish property tax introduced in April has had on the upper end of the market. The list of areas that have seen the biggest increases in the numbers of million-pound properties this year is dominated by east London boroughs such as Barking and Dagenham, Newham and Waltham Forest. Up until a few years ago, even the most enthusiastic estate agent might have struggled to describe some of these areas as \u201chighly sought-after residential locations\u201d. However, the ripple-out effect of surging prices in other already-expensive parts of London, plus factors such as \u201cthe Olympic effect\u201d, have pushed property values to record highs in many once-unloved boroughs. The top six London boroughs with the largest increases in the numbers of million-pound properties between January and December this year are all in the east of the capital, said Zoopla. Redbridge \u2013 which includes areas such as Wanstead, Woodford and Ilford \u2013 and Waltham Forest, which includes the districts of Walthamstow and Chingford, each notched up a 56% increase over the past year, and are now home to 1,771 and 1,330 property millionaires respectively. Newham, which contains most of the Olympic Park, saw an 88% rise, from 121 to 227. Barking and Dagenham topped the table with a 288% increase. However, this reflects the finding that there are now 10 \u00a31m properties there \u2013 up from just three at the start of the year. Walthamstow, at the end of the Victoria line on the London Underground, is an area that has nudged into million-pound territory relatively recently \u2013 albeit only a small handful of properties in certain hotspot locations. Foxtons, an estate agent, cemented Walthamstow\u2019s \u201cup-and-coming\u201d status by opening an office there in March. The company is marketing a double-fronted four-bedroom house in \u201cWalthamstow village\u201d for \u00a31.35m. The suburban area of Wanstead is, generally, pricier, with property website Rightmove listing several homes for sale at \u00a31m-plus. Meanwhile, a five-bedroom detached period house in Forest Gate, Newham, is currently on the market for \u00a32m. It is a grade-two listed property built in the Queen Anne style in 1878. Daren Haysom, Foxtons\u2019 area director for north-east London, said some of these areas had in the past been on the receiving end of \u201cprejudice\u201d. An area such as Stratford was almost a \u201cswear word\u201d until the 2012 Olympic Games, when people realised it had good parks and open spaces, \u201clovely\u201d housing stock and great transport links, he added. However, with much of London now out of the reach of many buyers, some campaigners are talking about a gentrification crisis. There are concerns about the widening gap between rich and poor in some \u201cnewly affluent\u201d parts of London. The number of property millionaires in Barking and Dagenham may have risen sharply but at the same time, government figures issued in September show that the borough has gone from being the 20th most deprived local authority in England in 2010 to the ninth in 2015. There was also more bad news for those hoping to buy a home soon when two leading property bodies issued a report predicting UK house prices would increase by half (50%) their current value by 2025, rising from an average of around \u00a3280,000 to \u00a3419,000. The Housing 2025 report from the Association of Residential Letting Agents and National Association of Estate Agents claimed London house prices were expected to nearly double over the next decade, rising from a typical \u00a3515,000 to \u00a3931,000. The report, compiled with the help of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said that for those planning to enter the rental market in the next few years, \u201cthe news is just as bleak\u201d: rents were predicted to increase by 27% from a current UK average of \u00a3134 per week to \u00a3171 in 2025. Currently around 62% of the working population owns their own home, said the report, which predicted this would fall to 55% over the next 10 years.",
