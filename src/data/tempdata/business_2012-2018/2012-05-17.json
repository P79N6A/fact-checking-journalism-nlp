      "bodyText": "Taxpayers face losses of at least \u00a32bn on the continued state ownership of Northern Rock, the National Audit Office (NAO) has concluded as it raises questions about the decision by the Treasury to split the Newcastle-based bank in two in 2009. The lender was split into Northern Rock plc, which resumed lending and was sold to Virgin Money at the start of this year, and Northern Rock Asset Management, the \"bad bank\" which remains in public hands. The NAO agrees the sale to Virgin was the best way to prevent more losses and concludes that UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which controlled Northern Rock from 2010, had handled the sales process well. But it said the Treasury, when Labour's Alistair Darling was chancellor, \"would have benefited from more effective arrangements for internal challenge of its plans in 2009\" to split the bank up. Under the terms agreed with the European Commission to split the bank, at least 50% of Northern Rock plc had to be sold by a by a \"confidential deadline\" of 31 December 2013, the NAO said. But while the spending watchdog points out that the Treasury did not consider alternatives to splitting Northern Rock, it acknowledges that decision to create a new mortgage lender was taken at a time when lending was falling and that the rejuvenated lender provided 22% of all net lending on mortgages during 2010-11. It said: \"The alternative of selling the deposits and closing down the business was, however, unlikely to have been significantly better in financial terms and would not have delivered mortgage lending.\" Amyas Morse, the auditor general, said: \"Amidst the serious economic turmoil of 2009, it was a reasonable to create Northern Rock plc to support mortgage lending. No alternative was likely to have been significantly better, but the Treasury committed itself before looking in detail at the possible consequences for the taxpayer. \"A sale of Northern Rock plc at the earliest opportunity was the best option to minimise losses on the \u00a31.4bn of public money invested in the bank.\" However, he said the continued state ownership of the \"bad\" bank would present costs for the taxpayer: \"Most of the former Northern Rock's assets will be in public ownership for many years to come and there could be a net cost for the taxpayer of some \u00a32bn by the time these assets are finally wound down.\" This is based on assumptions that a private investor would demand a higher return on its investment of the 3.5% to 4.5% which UKFI has assumed would be a return for the Treasury. \"Applying a higher discount rate of 6% a year to the cash flows implies that there may be a net present cost for the taxpayer of some \u00a32bn by the time the assets are fully wound down,\" the NAO report says. Margaret Hodge, the MP who chairs of the public accounts committee, said: \"Given the scale of the crisis, we are fortunate that the net present cost to the taxpayer is potentially not more than \u00a32bn. But this is perhaps more by luck than good judgement. \"Although forced to act swiftly at a time of great financial instability, the Treasury took a big risk with taxpayers' money by going ahead with the decision to split the bank without undertaking due diligence or carrying out a proper analysis of the potential consequences for the taxpayer.\"",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Moss is gone and so is the bounce in Aviva's share price \u2013 down 10% or so since the chief executive quit last week. That, of course, is the eurozone crisis taking its toll on the valuations of all big holders of sovereign bonds. But there's also a reminder there that there's no quick way to revive Aviva's share price. Deputy chairman John McFarlane, obliged also to fill the chief executive's shoes until a permanent successor is found, is talking a good game. \"Frank and open communication with shareholders,\" is an excellent place to start since the non-executives seemed to have been the last people to understand how unpopular Moss had become with investors. In time-honoured fashion, a strategic review is also promised. Its crux may be the pledge to \"exit sensibly\" businesses that are not part of the group's future. That's easier said than done, though. Finding buyers for life assurance assets during a financial storm is a challenge and a half.

It was arranged by a senior executive who no longer works for the group.\" However, the chief executive of Champneys, Stephen Purdew, said: \"Of course they bloody paid for it.\" He declined to state how much the event cost, but similar stays start at \u00a3995 per person. According to the event programme, available on the Guardian website here, the bankers arrived at Champneys' Tring resort, set in 170 acres of Hertfordshire parkland, on 3 November \u2013 the day after Lloyds' chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, took a month's sick leave owing to fatigue. The next day they rose at 6am for a \"dawn-breaker exercise class\", and after breakfast attended a \"build before you burn\" class encouraging them not to rush into heavy workouts. After a gruelling day's exercise they were invited to \"de-stress or detox in our top-rated spa\" where they could pick from \"over 100 relaxing, energising and rejuvenating spa treatments\". Lloyds, Champneys and Bean declined to identify any of the employees on the trip, but Bean described them as an \"executive team from Lloyds\". He added: \"I'm not sure how much more I can tell you. We offer our clients a pretty comprehensive NDA [non disclosure agreement] \u2013 it's about half an inch thick.\" Champneys has attracted attention for offering high-profile figures freebies at the resort. Sir Paul Stephenson resigned as commissioner of the Met after it was revealed that he had accepted \u00a312,000 of free hospitality from the spa, which was then using Neil Wallis, the former deputy editor of the News of the World arrested in connection with the phone-hacking scandal, for public relations work. Purdew is also a close friend of Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of the NoW and chief executive of News International. Brooks was a guest at Purdew's wedding at Claridges in 2009, along with Liam Gallagher, Piers Morgan, the EastEnders actor Samantha Janus, the late Stephen Gately from Boyzone, several ex-Arsenal footballers, Frank Bruno and Jimmy Savile.",

That's got to change.\" Martin said the liquidation process was helped by the collaborative approach to asset recoveries taken by Deloitte and counterparts responsible for liquidating BCCI operations overseas.That position is in marked contrast to the legal feuding which has characterised the early years of the Lehmans insolvency process, which in Europe is being carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers. While Lehman was not infected with widespread criminality in the same way as BCCI, some of its investment banking activities represent a much greater challenge in terms of their complexity.",

It should be closer to 100%, he says, because that implies a much more sustainable and widespread local manufacturing base. \"Cheering every factory that wins a contract is not coming to terms with the problem,\" he says. Williams adds that we need a high-end parts maker such as France's Valeo, a maker of stop-start systems, in order to produce a \"pure British content car\". David Bailey, a car industry expert at Coventry University, agrees: \"We are not maximising the benefits of car assembly in the UK if we are importing components.\" The government is making available a \u00a3125m fund for potential Ellesmere Port suppliers. But if we extend the experts' concerns to the UK's entire manufacturing base, it will require the creation of a new ecosystem of small to medium sized manufacturers. The march of the makers is a long haul.",

      "body": "<p>Cookson has become the latest UK business to suffer a shareholder revolt over pay as nearly a third of investors rebelled against the industrial material group's boardroom pay policy \u2013 which has awarded \u00a320m in shares to the group's three most senior executives.</p> <p>The group's annual general meeting on Thursday saw 31.8% of investors vote against a pay scheme that has been strongly criticised by shareholder advisory groups. It was backed by 68% of investors.</p> <p>Cookson's chairman, Jeff Harris, said the award was justified. \"There is no suggestion whatsoever that this is in some way an example of reward for failure,\" he said.</p> <p>Under the terms of the scheme the chief executive, Nick Salmon, was given shares worth around \u00a37m, with the finance director, Mike Butterworth, receiving shares worth \u00a33.6m and the head of the ceramics division, Fran\u00e7ois Wanecq, being awarded stock worth \u00a39.3m.</p> <p>The Association of British Insurers had issued a red-top alert \u2013 its highest level of objection \u2013 over the report while Pirc, another advisory service, called for a vote against the reappointment of the board. The proxy votes showed that every director was voted back on with a majority of 94% or higher. However, including abstentions, around 13% of shareholders failed to back the re-election of three board members who sat on the remuneration committee: Jan Oosterveld; Peter Hill; and Jeff Hewitt. The committee chairman, John Sussens, was not backed by 14% of shareholders once abstentions were included.</p> <p>In statement issued after the AGM, Harris said: \"The board continues to listen very carefully to views expressed by shareholders and will be taking these into account along with the result of today's vote on the remuneration report, as remuneration policy is formulated going forward and we develop future policies.\"</p> <p>Cookson joins the ranks of big pay protest votes this year, which include ballot rebellions at Barclays, Xstrata and William Hill, as well as the enforced departures of chief executives at Trinity Mirror, Aviva and AstraZeneca.</p> <p>Cookson also addressed wider shareholder concerns about its growth by raising the prospect of a demerger. It announced a strategic review that will consider separating its two major divisions: engineered ceramics, which makes products for the glass, steel and solar industries; and performance materials, which supplies to the electronics and automotive markets. Scott Cagehin, an analyst at Numis Securities, said: \"We believe that this strategically makes sense, especially given the individual nature of the divisions.\"</p> <p>A 4.3% shareholder in Cookson said the demerger could allow a revamp of the group's remuneration structure. Gavin Morris, a partner at Governance for Owners, which describes itself as a \"responsible activist shareholder\", said: \"They are looking at the demerger option. In a demerged entity there is an opportunity to look at the remuneration structure.\" GfO backed the remuneration report, saying that Cookson had a \"good remuneration process\".</p>",

The group's annual general meeting on Thursday saw 31.8% of investors vote against a pay scheme that has been strongly criticised by shareholder advisory groups. It was backed by 68% of investors. Cookson's chairman, Jeff Harris, said the award was justified. \"There is no suggestion whatsoever that this is in some way an example of reward for failure,\" he said. Under the terms of the scheme the chief executive, Nick Salmon, was given shares worth around \u00a37m, with the finance director, Mike Butterworth, receiving shares worth \u00a33.6m and the head of the ceramics division, Fran\u00e7ois Wanecq, being awarded stock worth \u00a39.3m. The Association of British Insurers had issued a red-top alert \u2013 its highest level of objection \u2013 over the report while Pirc, another advisory service, called for a vote against the reappointment of the board. The proxy votes showed that every director was voted back on with a majority of 94% or higher. However, including abstentions, around 13% of shareholders failed to back the re-election of three board members who sat on the remuneration committee: Jan Oosterveld; Peter Hill; and Jeff Hewitt. The committee chairman, John Sussens, was not backed by 14% of shareholders once abstentions were included. In statement issued after the AGM, Harris said: \"The board continues to listen very carefully to views expressed by shareholders and will be taking these into account along with the result of today's vote on the remuneration report, as remuneration policy is formulated going forward and we develop future policies.\" Cookson joins the ranks of big pay protest votes this year, which include ballot rebellions at Barclays, Xstrata and William Hill, as well as the enforced departures of chief executives at Trinity Mirror, Aviva and AstraZeneca. Cookson also addressed wider shareholder concerns about its growth by raising the prospect of a demerger. It announced a strategic review that will consider separating its two major divisions: engineered ceramics, which makes products for the glass, steel and solar industries; and performance materials, which supplies to the electronics and automotive markets. Scott Cagehin, an analyst at Numis Securities, said: \"We believe that this strategically makes sense, especially given the individual nature of the divisions.\" A 4.3% shareholder in Cookson said the demerger could allow a revamp of the group's remuneration structure. Gavin Morris, a partner at Governance for Owners, which describes itself as a \"responsible activist shareholder\", said: \"They are looking at the demerger option. In a demerged entity there is an opportunity to look at the remuneration structure.\" GfO backed the remuneration report, saying that Cookson had a \"good remuneration process\".",

      "bodyText": "National Grid, the company that operates most of England's energy pylons and pipelines, has turned in a strong financial performance for 2011 but seen its debt levels reach almost \u00a320bn. Profits were up by 5% to \u00a32.6bn and earnings per share reached 51.3p, higher than the City has generally anticipated. National Grid is a key business as the UK tries to modernise its ageing power infrastructure and connect up dozens of smaller wind farms and other low-carbon generation. There have been fears that National Grid will struggle to deal with the more than \u00a330bn of new investment needed to replace old equipment over the next eight years. Steve Holliday, the chief executive of National Grid \u2013 much of whose business operates under regulatory price restraints \u2013 gave an upbeat message to investors on Thursday morning. \"On the back of a solid all round performance in 2011/12, and reflecting the revenue growth that our regulatory arrangements provide, we maintain a positive outlook for 2012/13, and expect to deliver another year of good operating and financial performance,\" he said. But the company also acknowledged that it had lost \u00a3116m over the year in Britain and in its smaller US business due to the weather. Hurricane Irene and the 2011 October snow storm together impacted operating profit by \u00a3116m, it revealed. National Grid said that debt levels had risen by nearly \u00a31bn to \u00a319.6bn but it has still raised the full year dividend by 8% to 39.28p. Under the government's recently announced electricity market reform plans, the company is to take on responsibility for administration of both the new \"capacity mechanism\" and the feed-in tariffs that will replace the existing framework for renewable and low carbon power generation payments. There have been fears that this will be an unwelcome burden on the National Grid but the company denied this. It said on Thursday: \"This additional responsibility is not expected to have a direct material financial impact on National Grid but recognises our central role in delivering the UK's energy future.\"",

      "bodyText": "The British government is making urgent preparations to cope with the fallout of a possible Greek exit from the single currency, after the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, warned that Europe was \"tearing itself apart\". Reports from Athens that massive sums of money were being spirited out of the country intensified concern in London about the impact of a splintering of the eurozone on a UK economy that is stuck in double-dip recession. One estimate put the cost to the EU of Greece making a disorderly exit from the currency at $1tn, 5% of output. Officials in the United States are also nervously watching the growing crisis: Barack Obama on Wednesday described it as a \"headwind\" that could threaten the fragile American recovery. In a speech in Manchester before flying to the United States for a summit of G8 leaders, the British prime minister, David Cameron, will say the eurozone \"either has to make up or it is looking at a potential breakup\", adding that the choice for Europe's leaders cannot be long delayed. \"Either Europe has a committed, stable, successful eurozone with an effective firewall, well capitalised and regulated banks, a system of fiscal burden sharing, and supportive monetary policy across the eurozone, or we are in uncharted territory which carries huge risks for everybody. \"Whichever path is chosen, I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect this country and secure our economy and financial system.\" Officials from the Bank, the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority are drawing up plans in the expectation that a Greek departure from monetary union \u2013 increasingly seen as inevitable by financial markets \u2013 could be as damaging to the global economy as the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. With a second election in Greece called for 17 June, King dropped a strong hint that the Bank would take fresh steps to stimulate growth if policymakers in Europe failed to deal with the sovereign debt crisis. \"We have been through a big global financial crisis, the biggest downturn in world output since the 1930s, the biggest banking crisis in this country's history, the biggest fiscal deficit in our peacetime history and our biggest trading partner, the euro area, is tearing itself apart without any obvious solution,\" he said. Doug McWilliams, of the Centre for Economic and Business Research, said a planned breakup of the single currency would cost 2% of EU GDP ($300bn) but a disorderly collapse would result in a 5% drop in output, a $1tn loss. \"The end of the euro in its current form is a certainty,\" he added. Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer under the former Labour administration, said: \"This has the seeds of something disastrous. It is madness. If it spreads to bigger countries, this could be really disastrous for Europe. It could consign us to years of stagnation.\" Capital flight from Greece has increased since it became clear that a coalition government could not be formed after the election earlier this month. The Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, said citizens were withdrawing their money amid \"great fear that could develop into panic\" at the risk of a debt default and exit from the euro area, according to minutes of their meetings posted on the presidency's website. In little more than a week following the election on 6 May, \u20ac3bn was withdrawn from bank accounts. The central bank reported that \u20ac800m was taken out in a single day earlier this week. The head of the International Institute of Finance banking lobby, Charles Dallara, said money was leaving Greece at a growing pace due to political uncertainty. \"There has been a pickup of deposit flight from Greece, but I think that is stabilisable once you get a new government in place, if that government reaffirms its intention to remain in the eurozone.\" The damage to the rest of Europe if Greece were to leave the euro would be \"somewhere between catastrophic and armageddon\", he said. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, told parliament that his country faced trouble financing itself as borrowing costs shoot up to \"astronomic\" levels. The Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Dublin's plan to return to capital markets in late 2013 might not be achievable because of the uncertainty. The first meeting between French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel helped to calm nerves in the markets at one stage, with suggestions that Berlin might be amenable to initiatives to boost growth in Greece and the other austerity-stricken nations of the eurozone. But the jittery mood was underlined by a fall in European shares and the single currency late in the day amid reports that the European Central Bank was cutting off its funding lifeline to Greek banks that had failed to amass enough capital to protect them from future losses. The ECB later said it expected the Greek central bank to use part of the \u20ac130bn bailout from the EU and IMF to ensure that the country's banks were safeguarded from collapse, and that they would receive additional help from Frankfurt only once this had happened. Already delayed by the political uncertainty in Greece, \u20ac18bn is now expected to be released to recapitalise the banks. Sony Kapoor, of the Brussels-based Re-Define thinktank, said: \"The high-stakes game of chicken between Greek and other EU politicians must end now. Those saying that a Greek exit from the eurozone will not be a big deal either don't know what they are talking about, or have some ulterior motives. The social, political and economic damage to the EU from a Greek exit is potentially incalculable.\" At the G8 summit, which starts on Friday, Obama will press Merkel to lean more towards a growth package for Europe, instead of pressing so hard for the austerity measures that were rejected by Greek voters. But foreign affairs analysts said that Obama's leverage with the European leaders is minimal. Although the US has the economic muscle to help Europe out of its mess, the Obama administration has taken the strategic decision not to become involved directly. Instead, Obama is to use the Camp David summit for some quiet diplomacy, hoping to sway Merkel to endorse some immediate actions to help growth. King, speaking at the publication of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report, said growth in Britain was weaker and inflation higher than Threadneedle Street had expected three months ago. It would take until 2014 for output to return to where it was in 2008, when Britain's deepest post-war recession began. \"What is so depressing about it is that this is a rerun of the debates in 2007/08 \u2013 these are not liquidity problems, they are solvency problems,\" King said. \"Imbalances between countries in the euro area have created creditors and debtors and at some point the credit losses will need to be recognised and absorbed and shared around,\" he said. \"Until that is done, there will not be a resolution. That is why just kicking the can down the road is not an answer. The European Central Bank has performed heroically in trying to buy time but that time hasn't been used to put in place fundamental underlying solutions.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2012. The orginal said a estimate put the cost of a disorderly collapse of the euro at 5% of eurozone GDP, about $1tn. That has been corrected to 5% of EU output.",
