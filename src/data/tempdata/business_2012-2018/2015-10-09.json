      "bodyText": "The House of Representatives voted on Friday to lift a 40-year ban on the export of crude oil, delivering on a top legislative priority for the oil industry and setting the stage for a new clash with the White House over energy. The 261-159 vote seeks to end a ban put in place during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. Twenty-six Democrats voted with Republicans in support of the measures. The bill now moves to the Senate where its prospects are uncertain because of White House threats to veto any measure that ends the crude export ban. But the main oil industry lobby declared victory on Friday, and said the measure would help US oil producers hold their own on global markets against Russia and Iran. \u201cToday\u2019s vote starts us down the path to a new era of energy security,\u201d the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s Jack Gerrard said in a statement. \u201cAmerican producers would be able to compete on a level playing field with countries like Iran and Russia, providing security to our allies and accelerating the energy revolution that has revitalized our economy.\u201d The oil export ban controversy marked the second time the Republican-controlled Congress sought a showdown over energy with Barack Obama, after voting to fast track the Keystone XL pipeline at the start of the year. In the current showdown, Republicans and oil producers had argued that the export ban was a relic from another era, out of sync with the boom in domestic oil and gas production over the past seven years with the development of new techniques such as fracking and horizontal drilling. The US now produces about 9.3m barrels of oil a day. Lifting the ban, Republicans argued, would end a growing glut of domestic oil. Ted Poe, a Republican from Texas, argued that Obama would rather Iran help sell its oil abroad, through the nuclear deal, than US domestic oil producers. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense to me: help the Iranians sell their excess crude abroad, but prevent Americans from selling our excess crude oil.\u201d Democrats and environmental campaigners said lifting the ban amounted to a giveaway for oil companies, and would lead to job losses in the refinery sector. \u201cWe\u2019re passing a bill to help oil companies make more money,\u201d Lois Capps, a Democrat from California, told the House. Campaign groups, meanwhile, argued that lifting the ban would hurt Obama\u2019s efforts to fight climate change. The Obama administration has taken some modest steps to ease the glut, and last year allowed limited export of ultra-light crude oil to Mexico. The US is also exporting 500,000 barrels of crude a day to Canada.",

      "bodyText": "Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s attempted \u00a365bn takeover of SABMiller is a story of beer, billions and blue blood. Behind the two brewers sit three private shareholder groups worth more than $100bn (\u00a365bn) between them. AB InBev was formed in 2004 by an unlikely alliance between three Brazilian dealmakers, led by a former national tennis champion, and the Belgian brewing dynasties that controlled Stella Artois. Now they are trying to force SABMiller, which makes Peroni and Grolsch, to sell out and form a brewing mammoth that would produce one-third of the world\u2019s beer. Blocking their path, at least for now, is the young and dashing head of Colombia\u2019s Santo Domingo brewing family, who is about to marry into the highest echelons of the British aristocracy. This airport novel of a tale will reach its denouement on Wednesday when AB InBev\u2019s aggressive dealmakers have to make a firm bid or walk away. Here are the multibillionaire players involved. The Colombian eligible bachelor The Santo Domingo family, Colombia\u2019s richest, owns a 14% stake in SABMiller and is standing in the way of a deal being done. The brewing dynasty, which was founded by Julio Mario Santo Domingo, who died in 2011, is led by 38-year-old Alejandro Santo Domingo. Regularly listed as one of the world\u2019s most eligible and best-dressed men, he became engaged to Lady Charlotte Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington\u2019s daughter, in July. Now he has emerged as the ultimate kingmaker in the bid talks, as the family he represents engages in brinkmanship designed to extract the highest possible offer. The SAB Miller shareholder register comprises two large blocks, with the remainder of the shareholder base consisting of smallish institutional holdings. The largest block is owned by Altria, the tobacco group that owns the Marlboro and Benson &amp; Hedges brands, which owns 27% of the group and supports a takeover. However, the Santo Domingos, who have two representatives on the board, have the power to thwart a deal because the bidder doesn\u2019t appear to want to go hostile. For decades, the family has controlled a web of businesses, including a television channel, a newspaper and radio station. Its interest in SABMiller stems from the merger of Bavaria Brewery, in which it held a majority stake, and SABMiller in 2005. The family\u2019s holdings are now said to be valued at $14.8bn, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. The Santo Domingo family was represented in the boardroom discussions earlier in the week that ended in a rejection of the latest offer. A close follower of the negotiations said on Friday: \u201cIt is notable that people who are as well-informed about the brewing industry as they are felt the revised terms weren\u2019t full enough to accept.\u201d Those who know the family say they have a knack for holding out for the best possible price, with experience of keeping an interest in a business, as they did with SABMiller. The family is not believed to be hostile to the industrial logic of a deal but does think the current terms need sweetening. The boys from Brazil With the chief executive, Carlos Brito, running the show, the men behind the rampaging growth of AB InBev are three Brazilian financiers worth more than $45bn between them. Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who own almost 23% of the brewer, have been doing deals together for more than 40 years, first by advising investment banking clients on acquisitions and then by building an empire run through 3G Capital, the private equity firm they established in 2004, which also controls Burger King and Heinz. Their leader is Lemann, Brazil\u2019s richest person with a fortune of $23bn, according to Forbes. Lemann, 75, was Brazil\u2019s national tennis champion five times and played at Wimbledon but after juggling tennis and investment banking during the 1960s he realised he was not going to become a global star on court and concentrated on business. In 1971, Lemann bought a small stockbroker, Banco Garantia, and hired Sicupira, whom he met on a fishing trip, and Telles to turn it into Brazil\u2019s version of Goldman Sachs. They sold Garantia to Credit Suisse in 1998 for $675m. By this time the three men had started buying non-financial businesses, including the Brazilian brewer Brahma, acquired in 1989 for $50m. Brahma bought Brazilian rival Antartica in 1999 to form AmBev, giving it 70% of the country\u2019s beer market. It expanded in Argentina before combining in 2004 with Interbrew, the Belgian maker of Stella Artois and Beck\u2019s, to form the world\u2019s biggest brewer. The deal was structured as a takeover by Interbrew but Lemann and co remained the driving force. They installed Brito, Lemann\u2019s protege, as chief executive of the new company, InBev, which in 2008 bought Anheuser-Busch, the US maker of Budweiser, to form AB InBev. AB InBev is the main component of the trio\u2019s fortunes \u2013 Sicupira is worth $10.4bn and Telles has $11.9bn \u2013 but it is only part of their empire. Through 3G they own Burger King, whose $11bn purchase of Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons was criticised as a tax-avoidance ploy. Their most spectacular deal was the 2013 purchase of Heinz, financed by Warren Buffett, who became an admirer of Lemann when they were on the board of Gillette in the late 1990s. In a further piece of joint dealmaking, Lemann and Buffett combined Heinz with Kraft Foods last year. Lemann dislikes publicity. He moved his family from Brazil to Switzerland after a failed kidnap attempt on his three children in 1999. To his colleagues, Lemann\u2019s lateness to the office that day was the only sign that something was amiss. He retains the lean build of a tennis player but a relentless fitness and business regime took its toll in 1994 when he suffered a heart attack. Nevertheless, the deals have kept coming. The Belgian brewing clans The other big shareholders in AB InBev are three Belgian brewing dynasties. With a combined fortune estimated at about \u20ac42bn (\u00a331bn) they are jointly ranked as the richest families in Belgium. The de Spoelberch, Van Damme and de Mevius clans hold a combined 28.6% of the giant beermaker after Interbrew, the company they controlled, bought AmBev. Like Lemann, the aristocratic clans like to keep a low profile and have taken a back seat at the company since joining forces with the Brazilians. The de Spoelberchs merged their Artois operation with the Van Damme family\u2019s Piedboeuf brewery in 1987 to form Interbrew, which then went on its own acquisition spree by buying Labatts in Canada, Bass in the UK and Germany\u2019s Beck\u2019s. In 2002, the families appeared to use their majority stake in Interbrew to veto a mooted bid for South African Breweries, now SABMiller, that failed to materialise. The de Spoelberchs are represented on the AB InBev board by Gregoire de Spoelberch, the nephew of the family\u2019s patriarch Philippe. The family has the biggest shareholding in AB InBev of the Belgian clans but its interests are spread far beyond brewing. Alexandre Van Damme, who spent many years working in the family business, including as strategy head of Interbrew, has a powerful voice and is closer to the Brazilians, sitting on the board of Restaurant Brands, which is the parent of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Reports have suggested that the families disagreed over InBev\u2019s aggressive pursuit of family-led Anheuser-Busch, with Van Damme siding with the Brazilians to force the US brewer into a deal.",

In 2002, the families appeared to use their majority stake in Interbrew to veto <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/aug/04/theobserver.observerbusiness9\">a mooted bid for South African Breweries</a>, now SABMiller, that failed to materialise.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The de Spoelberchs are represented on the AB InBev board by Gregoire de Spoelberch, the nephew of the family\u2019s patriarch Philippe. The family has the biggest shareholding in AB InBev of the Belgian clans but its interests are spread far beyond brewing. Alexandre Van Damme, who spent many years working in the family business, including as strategy head of Interbrew, has a powerful voice and is closer to the Brazilians, sitting on the board of Restaurant Brands, which is the parent of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Reports have suggested that the families disagreed over InBev\u2019s aggressive pursuit of family-led Anheuser-Busch, with Van Damme siding with the Brazilians to force the US brewer into a deal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wikileaks has released what it claims is the full intellectual property chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the controversial agreement between 12 countries that was signed off on Monday. TPP was negotiated in secret and details have yet to be published. But critics including Democrat presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, unions and privacy activists have lined up to attack what they have seen of it. Wikileaks\u2019 latest disclosures are unlikely to reassure them. One chapter appears to give the signatory countries (referred to as \u201cparties\u201d) greater power to stop embarrassing information going public. The treaty would give signatories the ability to curtail legal proceedings if the theft of information is \u201cdetrimental to a party\u2019s economic interests, international relations, or national defense or national security\u201d \u2013 in other words, presumably, if a trial would cause the information to spread. A drafter\u2019s note says that every participating country\u2019s individual laws about whistleblowing would still apply. \u201cThe text of the TPP\u2019s intellectual property chapter confirms advocates warnings that this deal poses a grave threat to global freedom of expression and basic access to things like medicine and information,\u201d said Evan Greer, campaign director of internet activist group Fight for the Future. \u201cBut the sad part is that no one should be surprised by this. It should have been obvious to anyone observing the process, where appointed government bureaucrats and monopolistic companies were given more access to the text than elected officials and journalists, that this would be the result.\u201d Among the provisions in the chapter (which may or may not be the most recent version) are rules that say that each country in the agreement has the authority to compel anyone accused of violating intellectual property law to provide \u201crelevant information [...] that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls\u201d as provided for in that country\u2019s own laws. The rules also state that every country has the authority to immediately give the name and address of anyone importing detained goods to whoever owns the intellectual property. That information can be very broad, too: \u201cSuch information may include information regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement,\u201d the document continues, \u201cand regarding the means of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved in the production and distribution of such goods or services and of their channels of distribution.\u201d TPP is now facing a rough ride through Congress where President Obama\u2019s opponents on the right argue the agreement does not do enough for business while opponents on the left argue it does too much. Obama has pledged to make the TPP public but only after the legislation has passed. Michael Wessel was one of the advisers who was asked by the US government to review what he said were woefully inadequate portions of the document. Wessel said the thrust of the TPP does nothing for Americans. \u201cThis is about increasing the ability of global corporations to source wherever they can at the lowest cost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not about enhancing or promoting production in the United States,\u201d Wessel said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t enforcing today\u2019s trade agreements adequately. Look at China and Korea. Now we\u2019re not only expanding trade to a far larger set of countries under a new set of rules that have yet to be tested but we\u2019re preparing to expand that to many more countries. It would be easier to accept if we were enforcing today\u2019s rules.\u201d Wessel said that ultimately, the countries currently benefiting from increased outsourcing of jobs by American firms aren\u2019t likely to see wages rise above a certain level. \u201cIf you look in other countries, Mexico and India and others \u2013 there\u2019s been a rise in the middle class but there\u2019s been stagnation for those we\u2019re hoping to get into the middle class,\u201d Wessel said. \u201cCompanies are scouring the globe for countries they can get to produce most cheaply.\u201d That, he said, results in constant downward pressure on American wages. \u201cCompanies are not invested here the way we\u2019d like them to; they\u2019re doing stock buybacks and higher dividends,\u201d Wessel continued. \u201cThey may yield support for the stock-holding class but it\u2019s not creating jobs.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 has recorded its biggest weekly rise for nearly four years, buoyed by optimism that central banks would continue to support the struggling global economy. The leading index recorded its eighth consecutive daily rise as the minutes from the US Federal Reserve\u2019s September meeting released overnight suggested the US central bank was unlikely to raise interest rates this year as many had expected. Investors had been concerned the Fed was about to end its cheap money policy and an interest rate rise had been widely expected at last month\u2019s meeting. But worries about continuing low inflation and slowing growth in China have stayed the Fed\u2019s hand for the moment. Since the September meeting, a poor set of US employment numbers has added to the general uncertainty about the effect of a slowdown in emerging markets on the rest of the global economy. Markets shrugged off comments on Friday from the Atlanta Fed president, Dennis Lockhart, that an October or December rate-hike lift-off was \u201clikely appropriate\u201d. A run of disappointing data from Germany during the week \u2013 including falling output and exports \u2013 added to the gloom about global growth but prompted speculation the European Central Bank could extend its quantitative easing programme. There was also talk of a new stimulus programme from China. The FTSE 100 finished at 6416.16 on Friday, up 41.34 points or 0.65% on the day and 4.7% on the week. It was the biggest weekly rise since the 7.5% gain during December 2011 at the height of the eurozone crisis, when a brief burst of optimism that the region\u2019s problems were close to resolution lifted markets, albeit temporarily. Commodity companies were among the main gainers on Friday, partly on hopes that the Chinese economy would be supported by the central bank and partly by a dip in the dollar \u2013 in which metals and oil are priced \u2013 as the prospect of a US rate rise faded. A decision to cut zinc production by the world\u2019s biggest producer, Glencore \u2013 up 7% on the day to 129.1p \u2013 gave a sharp lift to the metal\u2019s price and gave renewed support to mining shares. Meanwhile, oil made its best weekly gains for more than six years despite a late dip on Friday, with the conflict in Syria causing a lift in prices, along with forecasts from the US of falling output heading into 2016. European markets also moved higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax adding more than 1% on Friday and France\u2019s Cac closing 0.5% higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2% by midday, on course for a near 4% rise on the week and back above the 17,000 level. The surge in the FTSE means the index is at its highest level since 18 August, and has recovered from its a disastrous third quarter, when it recorded its worst three-monthly performance since September 2011 as investors feared a serious slowdown in the Chinese economy.",

The retailer\u2019s current scheme, Price Promise, hands shoppers a voucher to spend on future purchases if their whole basket of goods could have been bought more cheaply at Asda, Morrisons or Sainsbury\u2019s. Under the new Brand Guarantee scheme customers will only get money back if branded goods such as Heinz baked beans or Cadbury\u2019s chocolate could have been bought at lower prices from its three major rivals. Shoppers who buy at least 10 items including one or more branded product will get an instant discount on their shopping. Tesco said: \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at ways to make the shopping trip that little bit easier for customers, including improvements in customer service, updating our product ranges and continuing to offer everyday low prices on the products that matter most.\u201d Tesco\u2019s latest move comes just days after chief executive Dave Lewis promised further price cuts over the next six months. Revealing that profits had more than halved in the six months to the end of August, he said: \u201cI think there is more deflation to come \u2013 some we have to do as we invest ourselves and I don\u2019t see the market changing.\u201d The company said profits had partly been dented by a near \u00a3200m drop in prices at its stores compared with the same period a year ago. Supermarkets have been competing fiercely on price as they try to win back shoppers from the fast-growing grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl. Price-matching schemes have played a prominent role in the battle, with all of the major chains offering some form of discount if goods could have been bought more cheaply elsewhere. But, with profits under pressure, schemes have undergone a flurry of changes. Next month, Morrisons will rejig its loyalty scheme, just over a year after it launched. The supermarket currently awards points if branded or own-label goods could have been bought more cheaply at its big three rivals or Aldi or Lidl. From November, it will become a straightforward points collection scheme based on the total amount spent in its stores.

      "bodyText": "With the US Federal Reserve minutes released on Thursday adding fuel to the suggestion the central bank will not raise rates this year, markets have moved higher once more. Commodity companies again led the way as metal prices climbed on the back of Glencore\u2019s decision to cut zinc production. Oil remained close to recent highs despite edging lower on the day. So the final scores showed: the FTSE 100 finished up 41.34 points or 0.65% at 6416.16, and recorded its biggest weekly rise since December 2011 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.04% to 10,096.60 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.54% to 4701.39 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.46% to 22,257.89 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.26% at 10,309.6 In Greece the Athens market dipped 0.17% to 676.93 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently pretty flat, down just 6 points or 0.04%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thank\u2019s for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. Greece\u2019s debt has become unsustainable and the country needs debt relief, according to the International Monetary Fund. Reuters reports: Greece cannot deal with its public debt through reforms alone and needs a significant extension of grace periods and longer maturities from its European creditors, the head of the IMF\u2019s European department said. The European Commission has forecast in May that Greek debt would reach more than 180% of its gross domestic product this year and euro zone governments, the main creditors of Greece, have promised to start debt relief talks later this year, once Athens implements agreed reforms. \u201cWe think that Greek debt... has become highly unsustainable,\u201d Poul Thomsen told a news conference in Lima, on the sidelines of a meetig of the IMF. \u201cWe think that Greece cannot deal with its debt without debt relief. Greece cannot deal with debt just through reforms and adjustment,\u201d he said. Thomsen said that the discussion on how to provide debt relief to Greece has shifted from a nominal haircut on the stock of its debt to capping gross financing needs. The G20 has taken another step towards tackling multi-national tax avoidance. AP reports: Finance officials from the world\u2019s 20 biggest economies have committed to toughening laws and boosting cross-border cooperation to prevent multinational companies from avoiding as much as $250 billion a year in taxes. The unanimous agreement was announced Friday in Peru\u2019s capital on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting. The plan, to be presented to heads of state for approval next month at a Group of 20 summit in Turkey, seeks to address concerns about whether large companies such as Apple and Google are paying their fair amount of taxes. The 15-point action plan was drafted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in consultation with more than 100 countries. It seeks to eliminate so-called \u201ctax shopping\u201d for most-favorable rates, profit shifting and a host of other strategies estimated to cost between 4 and 10 percent of global corporate income tax annually. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about whether you have high taxes or law taxes, it\u2019s about whether you\u2019re paying your taxes,\u201d said British Finance Minister George Osborne. Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD, said the plan\u2019s implementation will be key given the wide range of capacities and resources of tax authorities around the world. To that end, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the U.S. is doubling funding to help developing countries improve their technical expertise. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just to ensure sustainability of public finances but recover the trust of our citizens who are coping with economic hardship,\u201d said Gurria. Here\u2019s the full IMF statement on Iceland repaying all its obligations ahead of schedule: Iceland Repays All of Its Remaining Obligations to the IMF Ahead of Schedule One of the factors supporting the market in recent days - and responsible for the recovery seen since China\u2019s devaluation sent tremors around the world - is the idea that the US Federal Reserve may not after all raise interest rates this year. The theory goes that the slowdown in China, the subsequent market volatility and uncertainty about inflation would combine to stay the Fed\u2019s hand. On Thursday one Fed member even suggested a cut in rates could be in order, while the latest minutes issued shortly afterwards showed the Fed\u2019s concerns about inflation and a global economic slowdown. Still, there are always dissenting voices, and Atlanta Federal Reserve president Dennis Lockhart has said in a speech today that a rate rise is still probable in October or December. He said the global slowdown and last week\u2019s week US jobs data - a catalyst for the recent optimism in global markets - meant there was \u201ca touch more downside risk\u201d to the US economy. But overall he said the economy remained on a satisfactory track and he saw a \u201cliftoff decision\u201d at the October or December meetings as \u201clikely appropriate.\u201d Crude oil prices have edged lower after traders said that fears about the conflict in Syria - one of the driver for higher prices - was overblown. Brent crude is 0.3% lower at $52.85, which has taken some of the shine off shares. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 5 points while the FTSE 100 is just about holding on to the 6400 level, up 27 points at 6402. Sports Direct shares are now down 5.5% and are the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 after the Guardian\u2019s Simon Goodley reported chief executive Dave Forsley had been charged with a criminal offence over the pre-pack administration of USC. Full story here: Meanwhile, Iceland has repaid, ahead of schedule, all of its remaining obligations to the International Monetary Fund, totalling about $332m, the IMF said. Iceland has staged a remarkable recovery since its banking collapse in 2008 when it secured a $6bn IMF-led rescue package. Some headlines have flashed on Reuters: George Osborne is speaking at the IMF/World Bank meetings in Lima, Peru. He said there are growing risks in the global economy and Britain can\u2019t be immune. He highlighted risks from the Greek debt crisis and falling commodity prices and worryingly high debt levels in some countries. This is all the more reason, he argued, to deliver his economic plan to fix the UK\u2019s public finances, improve productivity and invest in infrastructure. He said the IMF sees the UK going from having the second-worst public finances in the G-7 to the second best by 2020. The UK chancellor is backing Christine Lagarde in her bid to serve a second five-year term as managing director of the IMF. Osborne believes that the UK is in much better position than five years ago to handle whatever the global economy throws at it. He also said that 250,000 British citizens have registered their interest in taking part in Lloyds\u2019 \u00a32bn share sale next spring. Guardian exclusive: David Forsey, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 retailer Sports Direct, has been charged with a criminal offence relating to the group\u2019s controversial pre-pack administration of its fashion retailer USC. The 49-year-old businessman is accused of failing to notify authorities of plans to lay off warehouse staff in Scotland, around 200 of whom were given just 15 minutes notice by the administrator in January that they were losing their jobs. Forsey was sent his summons in July and his case is scheduled to be heard at Chesterfield magistrates\u2019 court next week. Read the full story here. Here are some comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi at the IMF/World Bank meetings in Lima. He flagged up fresh risks from slowing emerging markets to the eurozone, which has been resilient so far, he said. Faced with a more challenging external environment than six months ago, the euro area economy has shown signs of resilience. However, developments surrounding the slower growth in emerging market economies are posing renewed risks to the euro area outlook.\u201d In the light of renewed risks that have emerged on the back of recent developments in global and in financial and commodity markets, we are closely monitoring all relevant incoming information.\u201d He added that policymakers are ready to use all the instruments available within our mandate to act, if warranted, in particular by adjusting the size, composition and duration of the asset-purchase programme.\u201d Draghi called for a \u201cmore complete\u201d economic and monetary union in Europe. It is also necessary for the euro area to move towards completing banking union in order to create a truly single banking system and achieve its objectives of breaking the bank-sovereign nexus, making the financial system more resilient, and protecting the interests of taxpayers. In parallel, the authorities will need to decisively deal with remaining crisis legacies to create a better foundation for bank lending to the real economy.\u201d Here is the statement in full. Here is our full story on the UK trade figures. The August trade in goods deficit narrowed to \u00a311.1bn from \u00a312.2bn in July as reported earlier, but was bigger than expected despite record car exports. This means the UK is heading for a huge shortfall in the third quarter. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: Even if the trade deficit held steady in September, this would still leave the deficit in the third quarter as a whole at around \u00a311bn, far higher than the \u00a33.5bn deficit recorded in the second quarter.\u201d Standard Chartered\u2019s new boss Bill Winters plans to cut up to a quarter of the bank\u2019s most senior staff to reduce costs \u2013 a loss of about 1,000 jobs \u2013 Reuters is reporting, citing a memo sent to staff. The memo shows that Winters plans to reduce the number of staff who are graded in bands 1-4 by a quarter. They cover bankers from director level upwards, and include about 4,000 people. The former investment banker was hired by the embattled bank in February to turn it around after a damaging Iran sanction-busting scandal and a series of profit warnings. He has been awarded \u00a36.7m in shares, most of which is intended to compensate him for quitting the hedge fund he was previously running. Winters, who took over in June, told staff at the troubled bank: Our situation requires decisive and immediate action. Each member of the management team has a mission to drive through improvements in our returns and part of this will be further streamlining of our organisation, eliminating management layers and duplication of roles.\u201d As part of his review, the bank will also sell off some assets and reduce the number of clients, he said, according to Reuters. Winters is expected to set out his plans to shareholders and staff in November or December. Standard Chartered has had a tough three years, following fines from US regulators, weakness in many of its key emerging markets and growing losses from bad loans in India and China. The bank was fined more than $1bn for breaching US sanctions and still faces further investigations. Winters said in the memo: We lost some discipline during that time, leading to our recent problems with loan impairments and relatively high expenses.\u201d Shares in the bank rose 4% to 778.3p on the news. Winters halved Standard Charterd\u2019s dividend in August and said the bank would tap investors for cash if needed. At the time, it said it had cut 4,000 staff since the start of the year, taking the global workforce to 88,000. Returning to the markets, oil is enjoying a good week, and is set for its biggest weekly rise since 2009. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is up 1.4% at $53.81 a barrel, putting it on track for a 12% gain this week. US crude has risen by 2.4% to $50.60 a barrel. In the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal, it has emerged that about 3.6m VW diesel cars in Europe with 1.6l engines will need hardware changes to ensure they comply with emissions standards. News agency Reuters cited a spokesman for the German transport ministry. Police raided the embattled German carmaker\u2019s offices and several employees\u2019 homes yesterday as prosecutors stepped up their investigation into the scandal that has rocked the group and the global car industry. VW shares are trading 2.4% higher at the moment, while the Dax in Frankfurt is 1.1% ahead. In the beer battle, South African brewer SABMiller has announced a drastically accelerated cost-cutting plan today after rebuffing a $100bn (\u00a365bn) takeover approach from rival Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewer. SABMiller, which makes Grolsch, Coors and Peroni, has announced that it is aiming for annual cost savings of $1.05bn by 2020. The previous target was $500m by 2018. SABMiller\u2019s management is meeting shareholders today. AB InBev boss Carlos Brito has called on SABMiller shareholders to force the company\u2019s chairman, Jan du Plessis, to discuss the terms. A takeover would create a brewing giant that would produce a third of the world\u2019s beer. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has looked at the UK trade figures: The July trade release had been dire so there was always a good chance that there would be some payback in the August data. However, the scale of the rebound was underwhelming, with the trade deficit narrowing from \u00a34.4bn in July to \u00a33.3bn in August; this kept it much wider than the average of the past six months (-\u00a32.5bn). The monthly data has been hugely volatile lately, with July\u2019s collapse in goods exports being followed by a rebound in August. But the underlying picture is one of a weakening export performance, with the official data moving closer to the story that has been conveyed by business surveys for some time. The geographic breakdown of exports shows an interesting turnaround compared to earlier in the year. Previously exports to EU countries had been very weak, reflecting the relatively slow recovery in the Eurozone and the appreciation of the pound against the euro. While trade with the EU has now picked up, exports to non-EU countries have weakened. This suggests that the impact of the slowdown in China and other emerging markets is beginning to bite, with exports to China down 16% over the three months to August compared with the previous three months. These figures suggest that net trade is likely to exert a sizeable drag on GDP growth in Q3. And more bad news came from the construction figures, with output slumping by 4.3% on the month in August. Our short-term model suggests that we are likely to see construction output fall by more than 2% in Q3. With manufacturing output also likely to have fallen, Q3 growth will have been almost entirely reliant on the services sector. There is now some downside risk to our forecast that the preliminary estimate \u2013 due at the end of the month \u2013 will show GDP growth of 0.6%.\u201d Zinc has surged 10% and other base metals also jumped after commodities giant Glencore said it would slash its zinc output by a third. Glencore said it would cut 500,000 tonnes of annual zinc production, equivalent to 4% of global supply. Glencore shares are now up 7.3% at 129.5p, the top riser on the FTSE 100 index. The price of zinc on the London Metal Exchange hit $1,837, its highest level in a month. Lead leapt 6% at one stage to $1,774, copper and aluminium both rose 4% and nickel gained more than 5% to hit a one-month high. The rally brings some relief to commodities after their recent slump, just as members of the metals industry are heading to London for the annual LME Week celebrations which start on Monday. The London Metal Exchange wants to buy the Baltic Exchange, also in London, and has made an informal approach, Reuters reported, citing two sources. One said: The LME has made strong overtures to the Baltic.\u201d The LME is the world\u2019s oldest and biggest market for trading industrial metals such copper and aluminium. The Baltic Exchange produces daily benchmark rates and indices that are used to trade and settle freight contracts. Sterling dipped after the poor construction numbers and the bigger-than-expected trade deficit, which cast some doubt on the strength of Britain\u2019s economic recovery. The pound slipped 0.4% to 73.72p per euro. The official trade figures were a bit better. They showed Britain\u2019s deficit in trade in goods narrowed in August, to \u00a311.1bn from \u00a312.2bn in July, but it was still larger than expected and is also set to weigh on economic growth in the third quarter. This reduced the trade in goods and services gap by \u00a31.2bn from July to \u00a33.3bn. Exports of goods went up \u00a3800m to \u00a323.6bn in August, as exports of cars hit a record high of \u00a32.4bn, up \u00a3600m, while chemicals increased by \u00a3500m. Imports declined by \u00a3300m to \u00a334.7bn. Construction output dropped 4.3% from July, its biggest monthly fall since December 2012. It was down 1.3% when compared with August 2014 - the first year-on-year fall since May 2013, the Office for National Statistics said. City economists had expected a monthly increase of 1%. Construction makes up about 6% of Britain\u2019s economy. In the three months to August, output fell by 0.8%, the biggest decline since March 2013. Construction was down across the board, with housebuilding falling 3% in August from July. The British construction industry had a bad August, a particularly wet month. Official figures out today show output fell at its sharpest rate since late 2012, adding to other signs that overall economic growth slowed in the third quarter, between July and September. The FTSE 100 index in London, meanwhile, is on course for its biggest weekly rise in nearly four years. Our markets correspondent Nick Fletcher reports: The FTSE 100 has jumped another 29.15 points to 6404.97, its eighth day of rises. This week the index has gained 4.55% so far, its biggest weekly rise since December 2011, and it is set for its highest close since 18 August. As well as the Fed, investors are also hoping for further stimulus measures from the European Central Bank and perhaps the Chinese authorities. Gloomy forecasts for the global outlook from the International Monetary Fund have added to the feeling that central banks will keep acting to try and boost growth.\u201d A degree of calm has returned to financial markets. European shares are heading for their best week since January, on fresh optimism that interest rate hikes in the UK and US could still be some way off. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index is up 4.8% so far this week, following a sharp sell-off in August and September. Commodity prices have also stabilised somewhat. Neither the Bank of England nor the US Fed seems to be in a rush to raise borrowing costs. Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, says: The Fed minutes indicate that it will be patient in raising rates. The jury is still out whether the Fed will hike rates in December or early 2016, but this seems to be enough to lift global stocks after a horrible third quarter.\u201d Glencore is the top performer on the FTSE 100 index this morning. Its shares leapt more than 5% to 127p after the embattled FTSE 100 miner said it would cut a third of its annual zinc output, in a bid to ride out weak commodities prices. You can read the full story here. Last night, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde urged global policymakers to build stronger buffers against volatile financial markets in a \u201crapidly changing and uncertain world\u201d. Speaking at the fund\u2019s annual meeting in Peru, she denied the global economy was entering a \u201cdark period\u201d but said debts needed to be cut and called for greater international cooperation to prevent the economic recovery from being derailed. The IMF/World Bank autumn meetings are under way in Lima, Peru. George Osborne will be speaking there at 10pm UK time. Over here, David Cameron is due to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel at Chequers. In the US, Fed members Evans and Lockhart are scheduled to speak on the US economy and monetary policy. Regarding economic data, it is a quiet day. UK construction output and trade numbers for August are out at 9.30am London time. Investec economist Victoria Clarke has done a preview: The UK\u2019s trade deficit widened markedly in July, to \u00a311.1bn, with exports seen falling sharply, particularly to the United States and particularly chemical exports. One key uncertainty looking at the prospect for the August numbers is whether we will see last month\u2019s slump in chemical exports unwind; we are pencilling in only a modest correction. More broadly, survey data for the month suggest little by way of a quick turn in fortunes. Indeed, the August Manufacturing PMI pointed to new export business falling for the 5th straight month with companies linking this to the sterling exchange rate and weak sales performance to the Euro area and China. Against such headwinds we are doubtful we will see a sharp improvement in the overall trade balance; we are pencilling in a deficit of \u00a310.5bn. With the services trade balance steadier month to month, we look for a combined balance in goods and services of -\u00a32.8bn.\u201d \uf0b7 Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets agreed: The minutes from the FOMC\u2019s September meeting confirmed overnight that \u2018many\u2019, albeit not \u2018most\u2019, voting members still expected conditions for lift-off to be met this year, although \u2018several\u2019 remained concerned about the downside risks to activity and inflation. Indeed, the latest labour market report effectively ruled out a rate hike at the October FOMC meeting. And, in the absence of an improvement in tone of global economic data and financial market developments, lift-off might still be postponed into early 2016.\u201d Angus Campbell, senior analyst at online broker FxPro, has sent his thoughts on the Fed. Risk assets are being buoyed further by hungry investors happy to get back into equities as the outlook for monetary policy tightening looks more assured with rates set to stay lower for longer. The FOMC minutes were decidedly dovish with the Fed continuing to stress its concern in respect to risks from overseas and the impact this is having on global growth and US domestic inflation. This is increasing risk appetite giving renewed strength to the Aussie which overnight has broken to a new six week high against the dollar having pressed against the 0.7300 level already this morning. As we continue to move into the final quarter of 2015 the odds on there being a December rate hike from the Fed have significantly reduced. Our chief economist has been consistent in his call for no Fed hike this year as far back as 2014 (read here) and as the past couple of years have proved, whilst it is incredibly difficult to predict central bank monetary policy, we are looking for the first Fed hike to come in March 2016.\u201d The UK government has sold off another 1% of its stake in Lloyds Banking Group, reducing its holding in the bailed-out bank to below 11% (10.97%). UK Financial Investments, which manages the government\u2019s stakes in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, has now recouped \u00a315.5bn of the \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers\u2019 money which was pumped into Lloyds to rescue it at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. You can read the full story here, by our City editor Jill Treanor. Earlier this week, the chancellor, George Osborne, announced at the Conservative party conference that the government would sell at least \u00a32bn of Lloyds shares to private investors next spring to return the bank to full private ownership. More than 120,000 investors have registered their interest for the \u00a32bn share sale so far with investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. It will be the biggest privatisation Britain has seen since the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government sold \u00a33.9bn worth of shares in British Telecom and \u00a35.6bn of British Gas shares. Germany\u2019s Dax opened 1.1% higher, France\u2019s CAC and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB gained 1%, and Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 0.9% in early trading, on hopes hat a US rate hike could be some way off. Unexpectedly weak US jobs numbers published a week ago triggered speculation that the Fed could hold off raising rates this year and wait until 2016. The dollar lost ground on Friday as rate hike expectations receded, falling 0.2% against the euro to $1.1302. In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed 1.6% higher, taking the week\u2019s gain to 4%. Chinese stock markets were also up, extending Thursday\u2019s 3% gains. The blue-chip CSI300 index finished the day 1.3% higher while the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.2%. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed 45 points, or 0.7%, to 6240.75 within the first five minutes of trading. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Wall Street and Asian shares rallied overnight as the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting suggested an imminent interest rate hike was unlikely. European stock markets are set to open higher, with gains of 0.9% predicted for Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index, 1.4% for Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC 1.3%. The minutes of the Fed\u2019s 16-17 September meeting showed the US central bank thought the strengthening American economy warranted a rate hike soon, but was concerned that inflation could get stuck at low levels. Policymakers concluded that it was \u201cprudent to wait\u201d for more evidence, amid growing fears over the global economic slowdown. The minutes said: After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, all but one member concluded that, although the U.S. economy had strengthened and labor underutilization had diminished, economic conditions did not warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. In part because of the risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation, the committee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional information confirming that the economic outlook had not deteriorated and bolstering members\u2019 confidence that inflation would gradually move up toward 2 percent over the medium term.\u201d London Capital Group said in a note: European equities are set to rally as central banks give into the bulls\u2019 demands for dovish monetary policy to rescue them from their current plight. The Fed Minutes underlined the global economic slowdown and the potential to threaten the US economic outlook.\u201d",

However, the scale of the rebound was underwhelming, with the trade deficit narrowing from \u00a34.4bn in July to \u00a33.3bn in August; this kept it much wider than the average of the past six months (-\u00a32.5bn).</p> <p>The monthly data has been hugely volatile lately, with July\u2019s collapse in goods exports being followed by a rebound in August. But the underlying picture is one of a weakening export performance, with the official data moving closer to the story that has been conveyed by business surveys for some time.</p> <p>The geographic breakdown of exports shows an interesting turnaround compared to earlier in the year. Previously exports to EU countries had been very weak, reflecting the relatively slow recovery in the Eurozone and the appreciation of the pound against the euro. While trade with the EU has now picked up, exports to non-EU countries have weakened. This suggests that the impact of the slowdown in China and other emerging markets is beginning to bite, with exports to China down 16% over the three months to August compared with the previous three months.</p> <p><strong>These figures suggest that net trade is likely to exert a sizeable drag on GDP growth in Q3. And more bad news came from the construction figures</strong>, with output slumping by 4.3% on the month in August. Our short-term model suggests that we are likely to see construction output fall by more than 2% in Q3. With manufacturing output also likely to have fallen, Q3 growth will have been almost entirely reliant on the services sector. There is now some downside risk to our forecast that the preliminary estimate \u2013 due at the end of the month \u2013 will show GDP growth of 0.6%.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-561790ebe4b0681920a76880\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-09T10:09:35.301Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Zinc leaps 10%, other metals surge on Glencore news</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Zinc has surged 10% and other base metals also jumped after commodities giant Glencore said it would slash its zinc output by a third.

Ship Foliage, which launched on Tuesday, delivers preserved leaves right to customer\u2019s doors, but only three. And shipping is not included. \u201cIs this for real? YES!!\u201d the company\u2019s website proclaims. After only two days in business, it has received 135 orders. Kyle Waring, Ship Foliage\u2019s founder, is an experienced entrepreneur. He estimates that he\u2019s had over 10 companies. His first, which he sold when he was 16, was a gangster name generator. From there he went on to start a T-shirt company, a college humor website and a marketplace for game developers to pitch ideas to mobile companies. But now, at the age of 27, he\u2019s focused on his seasonal projects: leaves in the fall and snow in the winter. His fall leaf business has quickly garnered media attention. Customers pay $19.99 for three leaves \u2013 one red, one yellow and one green, or mixed \u2013 collected from somewhere in Massachusetts, Vermont or New Hampshire. The leaves are gathered by \u201cfoliage experts\u201d, according to the website. But Waring says it\u2019s him, his wife, and a few friends that do the leaf picking. The selection process is quite particular and Waring claims they only choose \u201cperfect Grade A leaves\u201d. \u201cI inspect every leaf to make sure that there\u2019s no holes from bugs eating the leaves and also make sure that there\u2019s no rips in the leaves,\u201d he said. \u201cI make sure the color of the leaf is a really strong, vibrant color that someone would enjoy and kind of resonate with the foliage in the fall.\u201d The leaves undergo a week-long process to preserve them, something Waring guarantees will last for \u201cyears\u201d. First, they are soaked in a glycerin and water mixture for three days. Then they are dried out, a process that typically takes an additional three to four days. Waring includes a handwritten note with each bundle of leaves, something that he says can be customized for free. When asked how he settled on a price for a bundle of three leaves, Waring said that it reflects how time consuming the process is. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s only $20 for some enjoyment and some nice decorations.\u201d Thus far the majority of his orders have been shipped to California, Florida and South Carolina. But surprisingly many are going to New York, too. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just the preservation process,\u201d Waring said. \u201cNo one wants to go through that hoopla.\u201d Waring plans to update his foliage product as time goes on, something he also did with his snow shipping company, Ship Snow, Yo. At first, he shipped water bottles filled with snow (which, upon delivery, held only water), and that evolved into 12- to 22-pound blocks of snow shipped overnight with a guarantee of \u201csnow on arrival\u201d. Waring says that 5-10% of Waring\u2019s Ship Foliage customers order two bundles of leaves, and approximately 2% order three or four. Despite his initial success, Waring said his family thinks he\u2019s \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d. He uses his friends and family to test out new products like this one, gauging their reactions to see if products will resonate with the general public. Waring has nothing concrete planned for the future as he will be busy this year with his leaf and snow businesses. But he isn\u2019t ruling out new ventures entirely. \u201cI\u2019m always building something new and something quirky so I\u2019ve got some ideas floating around,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll launch something come spring.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Around 250,000 people have registered to buy shares in Lloyds Banking Group, the government said as it sold down a further stake in the bailed-out bank and removed some of the complexity of its holding in Royal Bank of Scotland. Even as it prepares an offering of Lloyds shares to the public, the government is continuing to sell off shares to big City investors. The stake now stands at just below 11% as George Osborne continues with a plan to dribble out shares on to the stock market. At the time of the bailout in 2008 and 2009, the stake stood at 43%. In a separate announcement, RBS said it had permission to tidy up its shareholder structure by converting the B shares it issued to the government in 2009 into ordinary shares. These B shares were issued at the height of the banking crisis to pay for the asset protection scheme, which was required to insure its most troublesome loans, and were a mechanism to prevent the government\u2019s stake in RBS rising even further. The chancellor said the sale of the Lloyds stake had raised \u00a315.5bn for the taxpayer and 250,000 people had signed up on the government\u2019s official website to register an interest in the sale. About \u00a32bn of shares in Lloyds will be priced at a 5% discount to the market price and any investor who holds them for 12 months will be a given a bonus share for every 10 they hold. The sale is not expected until next spring. \u201cI am determined to build on this success by making Lloyds shares available to the public next spring, so that we can build a share-owning democracy and continue to reduce our national debt,\u201d said Osborne. While comparisons of previous sell-offs to the public remain tricky, around 54,000 investors expressed an interest in the Royal Mail sell-off during its registration period which lasted for 16 days. Investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said on Thursday that so far 120,000 people had signed up with the company for the sale. The government has only just started selling off its stake in RBS, cutting it from 79% to around 73% in August, by selling shares to hedge funds and institutional investors. At the end of this month the next opportunity arises for Osborne to sell off another chunk of shares as the bank will report its third quarter results and the 90-day period preventing a further sale will have expired. RBS shares were trading at 334p around 10am in London, below the 502p at which the government breaks even on its stake. Lloyds shares were trading at 77p, above the 73.6p break-even point.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct chief executive charged over USC administration", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Forsey, the chief executive of Sports Direct, has been charged with a criminal offence relating to the collapse of its fashion retailer USC. The 49-year-old businessman is accused of failing to notify authorities of plans to lay off warehouse staff in Scotland, around 200 of whom were given just 15 minutes notice by USC\u2019s administrator in January that they were losing their jobs. Forsey was sent his summons in July and his case is scheduled to be heard at Chesterfield magistrates\u2019 court next week. The UK Insolvency Service said: \u201cWe can confirm that criminal proceedings have been commenced against David Michael Forsey. He is charged with an offence contrary to section 194 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. \u201cThe investigation into the conduct of the directors is ongoing. The inquiries are at an early stage and given the criminal proceedings it is not possible nor would it be appropriate to comment any further.\u201d The conduct investigation is understood to have been kicked off three weeks ago. The Insolvency Service has the power to ban somebody from serving as a director for up to 15 years. The news of Forsey\u2019s court appearance emerged as Sports Direct founder and executive deputy chairman, Mike Ashley, was criticised for \u201cdisgraceful and unlawful employment practices\u201d after 50 former USC employees were awarded compensation. The workers received a \u201cprotective award\u201d equivalent to 90 days pay after Glasgow\u2019s employment tribunal heard how USC staff had only been informed that the company\u2019s warehouse in Dundonald, Ayrshire, would close 15 minutes before it was shut down. Under employment law, workers should be given at least 30 days consultation before losing their jobs. Rory McPherson, a partner at Thompsons Solicitors, which represented the 50 workers, said: \u201cThis judgement from the tribunal is very good news for the former employees at Dundonald who brought the case. They showed courage in standing up to and beating a rich and powerful employer like Mike Ashley who used disgraceful and unlawful employment practices. \u201cI call on politicians in both Holyrood and Westminster to do all they can to stop employers like Mr Ashley thinking they can ride rough shod over workers rights.\u201d Under European legislation the Insolvency Service will have to pick up the bill for the 50 workers, but it is only obliged to pay eight weeks\u2019 worth of the compensation to which they are entitled. Forsey\u2019s case is the latest in a series of legal actions relating to employment issues faced by Sports Direct. Up to 300 staff are preparing to file a claim after they were excluded from the company\u2019s bonus scheme because they were on zero-hours contracts. Sports Direct has admitted that about 80% of its workforce are on temporary contracts that do not guarantee weekly working hours. The company was forced to make clear the limitations of such contracts to staff after legal action by former employee Zahera Gabriel-Abraham. In January, West Coast Capital (USC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sports Direct, entered a \u201cpre-pack\u201d administration whereby the business was shorn of some staff and debts and then immediately bought back by another division of Sports Direct. Around 200 workers at USC\u2019s warehouse in Dundonald lost their jobs \u2013 with around 80 permanent warehouse staff arguing they had not been properly consulted. The move was so controversial that it prompted a parliamentary debate and a Scottish Affairs select committee hearing, during which Sports Direct\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell \u2013 a former chief constable of West Yorkshire police \u2013 admitted the group\u2019s executives only informed him about the administration the day before it happened. The MPs had originally asked Ashley to appear, but the billionaire declined to attend. The Trade Union Act states that an employer must give 30 days\u2019 notice to the secretary of state of proposals to make 20 or more staff redundant. Failure to do so is an offence which is liable for a fine of up to \u00a35,000. Filings at Companies House suggest that the administration of USC was being considered for at least two months: the joint administrators \u2013 the insolvency firms Duff &amp; Phelps and Gallaghers \u2013 met with Sports Direct in its role as a secured creditor of USC on 14 November 2014; then, after the fashion brand Diesel took action against USC over an unpaid bill, a representative from Gallaghers met with USC, where Forsey was also a director, on 17 December. Subsequently, USC filed its intention to appoint an administrator on 6 January, 2015, and formally entered administration a week later - at which point staff were told by the administrators that they would lose their jobs in 15 minutes. Sports Direct shares closed down more than 6% at 690p on Friday. The company declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to distribute thousands of tonnes of surplus food under a scheme that will use a social networking app to link all 500 of its UK stores to local charities, including food banks. The retailer, which has committed to cutting food waste from stores by a fifth by 2020, has been testing different ways of running the scheme at 45 outlets and opted to work in partnership with the Neighbourly app. Eighteen months on, it is ready to expand the scheme nationwide and said it should be up and running by next spring. \u201cOur priority is to reduce food waste while ensuring that, where there is a food surplus, we put it to the best possible use,\u201d said Louise Nicholls, head of responsible sourcing at M&amp;S. She said the retailer had already dramatically cut food waste by in-store measures, such as discounting stock close to its use-by date earlier in the day, but believed nearly half of the remaining waste was edible. At present, M&amp;S sends food waste to anaerobic digestion energy plants. The process can be costly and means thousands of tonnes of perfectly edible food never reaches a dinner plate. In the first stage of the redistribution scheme, M&amp;S is looking for new charity partners, such as food banks, community cafes, homelessness groups and community shops to work with 105 more stores by December. The rest of its UK stores will join the programme by next spring. Charities that want to collect free food sign up to the Neighbourly app with their requirements. Each day M&amp;S stores register the spare food they have on offer and alert local charities. The group\u2019s Cribbs Causeway store in Bristol has been working with Neighbourly for six months, during which time it has distributed 4 tonnes of food waste \u2013 about 10% of its total \u2013 to local charities including North Bristol food bank and the Upper Horfield Community Trust. The Trust is home to Daisy\u2019s cafe which provides free meals and discounted meals for mental health groups and the elderly as it tries to bring vulnerablepeople together. Tina Magee, who runs the cafe, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have carried on without M&amp;S. I was funding things myself.\u201d Now she is able to provide free meals for children once a week by selling low-price meals to other groups. The Neighbourly app collates information on how much is being redistributed, helping M&amp;S identify where waste is occurring. Nicholls said: \u201cThis gives us visibility to track exactly what product is going where and to tell a more accurate story about what is happening with our surplus food. When you make food surplus more visible then you can reduce it.\u201d The scheme launches as supermarkets face rising pressure to reduce waste. Just over 1%, or 200,000 tonnes of food wasted in the UK comes from stores, according to figures released esrlier this year by the government-backed Waste Resources Action Programme (Wrap) . Of the estimated 15m tonnes of food thrown away in the UK each year, more than half is disposed of in people\u2019s homes. In June, Labour MP Diane Abbott tabled an early-day motion calling on the government to introduce legislation that would ban supermarkets from throwing away food that is approaching its best-before date and instead make it available to charities. The idea was prompted by the introduction of similar legislation in France, which now bans large supermarkets from throwing away food in favour of handing it to charities or for animal feed. In June, Tesco started a similar scheme in partnership with food redistribution charity FareShare, which could hand tens of thousands of tonnes of surplus food from its stores to local charities. Until recently, only Sainsbury\u2019s operated a nationwide scheme to distribute food left over in stores to charities. About 300 of its 1,200 stores are involved. M&amp;S\u2019s food distribution scheme is an extension of the retailer\u2019s existing relationship with Neighbourly which it uses to connect store staff with local charities for volunteering or fundraising. Starbucks, Wagamama and Wessex Water also work with the Bristol-based company, which launched last year. But M&amp;S is the first to donate food waste via the service which aims to connect socially-conscious companies with local good causes. It is free to use for charities but charges its business partners, including M&amp;S, a subscription fee. Nicholls said building local relationships could all be complementary. \u201cIt is another way to build a connection. It may be in time that charities get less food but they get more volunteering.\u201d She said M&amp;S opted to work with Neighbourly because the trials had shown shops needed to work with a wide variety of charitable groups based close by. M&amp;S tried a similar redistribution scheme about seven years ago, but it never took off due to the complicated and time consuming nature of the paperwork required to establish the credentials of charities. Under the new scheme, Neighbourly handles that side of things centrally. \u201cNow it is a really simple process for stores,\u201d Nicholls said.",

Output in the industry fell by 4.3% on the previous month, surprising City economists, who had expected a 1% rise. Some analysts blamed the August downturn on the wet weather, but the steep monthly fall followed a weakening trend in recent months that pushed the construction sector to its first annual fall in output since summer 2013. A breakdown of the industry showed that all construction types reported a fall for the first time since December 2010. Housebuilding was down 3% month-on-month. The figures follow a string of speeches by senior political figures calling for a resurgence in infrastructure spending and housebuilding. Several projects are planned, including HS2, a second Crossrail tunnel in London, railway upgrades to spur the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d and the Thames Water super-sewer. George Osborne told the Conservative party conference in Manchester that nimbyism was a key factor holding back infrastructure spending, even in his Tatton constituency in Cheshire. The chancellor said: \u201cWhere would Britain be if we had never built railways or runways, power stations or new homes?\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has also promised to increased infrastructure spending and housebuilding, though with less reliance on private sector funding. Owen Goodhead, managing director of the Randstad CPE recruitment firm, said the underlying problem restricting output was a skills shortage \u201cputting our homes, infrastructure and economy on the line\u201d. \u201cConstruction in the UK could be expanding instead of retreating if the right people were in the right jobs. But training, skills and flexibility need to accelerate hugely for construction jobs to keep up with demand,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout it, all the chancellor\u2019s talk of investment in infrastructure will come to nothing.\u201d Mark Robinson, chief executive of the consultants Scape Group, said: \u201cThe skills shortage in construction is still a problem that needs a lot of work. The [government\u2019s] spending review in November will likely give us a longer-term view with regards to planned infrastructure and housing growth over the next five years, so we wait with bated breath to see the outcome.\u201d Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the 4.3% month-on-month drop in output \u201cwas a particularly poor performance, especially as it followed a drop of 1.0% in July\u201d. He said: \u201cThis means it is now highly likely that construction output contracted appreciably in the third quarter and was a drag on GDP. Indeed, construction output will need to have grown 8.2% month-on-month in September to have just been flat quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the soggy August might produce a bounce-back in the sunnier September. \u201cBut even if the fall was entirely reversed in September, this would still leave construction output down 1.2% in Q3, following Q2\u2019s 1.4% rise. Accordingly, the latest figures add to other evidence suggesting that the recovery slowed in the third quarter,\u201d he said.",

Accordingly, the latest figures add to other evidence suggesting that the recovery slowed in the third quarter,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A rise in car exports helped improve Britain\u2019s trade deficit in August, according to official figures. The monthly shortfall in the trade balance for goods narrowed to \u00a33.3bn from \u00a34.4bn in July. However, the UK was still heading for a huge deficit in the third quarter of the year after an upward revision to July\u2019s shortfall. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cEven if the trade deficit held steady in September, this would still leave the deficit in the third quarter as a whole at around \u00a311bn, far higher than the \u00a33.5bn deficit recorded in the second quarter.\u201d He said this suggests that net trade is probably making \u201ca significant negative contribution to GDP\u201d at the moment. Hollingsworth warned that the strong pound and weakness in demand overseas as the US economy stuttered and the eurozone remained in the doldrums meant the government\u2019s hopes of a significant rebalancing towards manufacturing exports would be dashed in the near term. Alongside the \u00a3500m rise in car exports in August, the chemicals industry sent more of its production to the US, the ONS said. Total goods exports increased by 3.5% to \u00a323.6bn in August 2015 from \u00a322.8bn in July 2015. But this positive news was offset by the continued decline in Britain\u2019s oil industry, which has been a major factor holding back progress this year. Lower production and the lower oil price have dented exports, and though oil imports are likewise cheaper, they continue to rise in volume. The mothballing and subsequent closure of the Redcar steel plant could also have had an impact as the export of basic materials dived in August by more than 10%. The services sector recorded an improvement in its trade balance, but the ONS pointed out that the UK continued to rely heavily on the financial services industry to pay its way in the world. Figures for the second quarter showed that the surplus on trade in services was \u00a322.8bn, of which almost half \u2013 \u00a310.1bn \u2013 was contributed by banks, insurers and the fund management industry. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the narrowing of the deficit in August was welcome, but taking the July and August figures together pointed towards a deterioration. \u201cThis confirms our earlier assessment that the significant improvement seen in the second quarter was only temporary. \u201cThe large trade deficit remains a major national problem. This is particularly true when we consider that other areas of our current account, notably the income balance, remain statistically insignificant.\u201d Kern urged the government to adopt measures that will \u201csecure a long-term improvement in our trading position\u201d.",

The division had been up for sale since February, during which time LSE shares have risen almost 3%. But following the disposal news, they are down 15p at \u00a324.36. Analysts at Numis said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although the gross figure is in line with what we estimate LSE originally paid for it late last year ($1.1bn), the net value is around 35% below what we are currently valuing it at ($1.4bn) and well below the figures that were being rumoured in the press (up to $1.8bn).</p> <p>Despite the price not being as high as it could have been, we believe this is a positive development for the group at it allows management to focus on delivering its targeted growth strategy and achieving the expected cost synergies. The proceeds from this transaction (expected to complete in the first half of 2016) will be used to reduce LSE\u2019s pro-forma net debt to EBITDA to 1.6 times, bringing it in line with management\u2019s target of 1.0 times -2.0 times. We maintain our hold recommendation but our target price decreases to 2,450p from 2,500p reflecting the lower than expected sale price.</p> </blockquote> <p>Credit Suisse kept an outperform rating on LSE shares:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the net sale proceeds of $920m are modestly below the low end of consensus expectations ($1.0-1.5bn), we think the deal represents the best balance between maximizing shareholder value and minimizing execution risk.

It will sell the asset management operation, part of the Frank Russell group it bought last year, to US private equity group TA Associates for $1.15bn (\u00a3752m), with net proceeds of around $920m (\u00a3601m). The division had been up for sale since February, during which time LSE shares have risen almost 3%. But following the disposal news, they are down 15p at \u00a324.36. Analysts at Numis said: Although the gross figure is in line with what we estimate LSE originally paid for it late last year ($1.1bn), the net value is around 35% below what we are currently valuing it at ($1.4bn) and well below the figures that were being rumoured in the press (up to $1.8bn). Despite the price not being as high as it could have been, we believe this is a positive development for the group at it allows management to focus on delivering its targeted growth strategy and achieving the expected cost synergies. The proceeds from this transaction (expected to complete in the first half of 2016) will be used to reduce LSE\u2019s pro-forma net debt to EBITDA to 1.6 times, bringing it in line with management\u2019s target of 1.0 times -2.0 times. We maintain our hold recommendation but our target price decreases to 2,450p from 2,500p reflecting the lower than expected sale price. Credit Suisse kept an outperform rating on LSE shares: While the net sale proceeds of $920m are modestly below the low end of consensus expectations ($1.0-1.5bn), we think the deal represents the best balance between maximizing shareholder value and minimizing execution risk. We believe it was imperative for LSE to conclude a deal swiftly following press reports that attempts to sell the business to other parties had stalled.",

Devan Kaloo, Aberdeen\u2019s head of global emerging markets, equities, said: \u201cAB Inbev\u2019s bid for SABMiller is welcome as it draws attention to the company\u2019s undervaluation, but the bid is opportunistic and Aberdeen will not support the current offer \u2013 AB Inbev need to rethink their numbers.\u201d The fifth biggest investor, Kulczyk Investments, has said it rejected the bid. South Africa\u2019s Public Investment Corp, which owns 3.1% of the brewer, as well as Investec, are also believed to be against. Institutional shareholders own about 59% of SABMiller. SABMiller\u2019s two major shareholders \u2013 Altria of the US and BevCo, owned by Colombia\u2019s Santo Domingo family \u2013 appear to be split over AB InBev\u2019s approach. Altria has publicly supported the proposal but BevCo has not. Separately, SABMiller announced a drastically accelerated cost-cutting plan. The company, which makes Grolsch and Peroni, has announced plans to make annual savings of $1.05bn by 2020. The previous target was $500m by 2018. The announcement follows a statement from the chief executive of AB InBev, Carlos Brito, in which he urged SABMiller shareholders to engage in talks to create a brewer that would produce a third of the world\u2019s beer. AB InBev went public with its \u00a342.15 a share cash offer for SABMiller, which also makes Coors, on Wednesday after being rebuffed twice behind the scenes. Brito had said on Wednesday that SABMiller investors should call the chair to force him to discuss the terms. A statement from SABMiller management said it was meeting with investors on Friday. The company has rejected the approach from AB InBev, saying it substantially undervalues the business. \u201cThe measures we are announcing today are a continuation of our existing cost-saving programme,\u201d the chief executive, Alan Clark, said. \u201cWhilst we are already a highly efficient business with strong Ebitda [Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation] margins of 38% across our 20 largest managed beer markets, we are continuing to remove duplication across markets, bringing specialist expertise in areas like procurement under one roof, and standardising common processes. \u201cIt results in our markets being freed up to concentrate on what they do best \u2013 growing revenue with local consumers and customers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Glencore, the embattled FTSE 100 miner and commodities trader, sparked the biggest rally in a decade in zinc prices on Friday after announcing it would cut one third of its annual production of the silver-grey industrial metal. Up to 1,600 jobs will be lost as a result of the move to cut 500,000 tonnes of zinc production, or about 4% of global supply. The company, the world\u2019s largest miner of zinc ore, said at current prices it was better to keep its resources in the ground. \u201cGlencore believes that current prices do not correctly value the scarcity of our zinc resources,\u201d the company said. The price of zinc, mainly used to coat steel and in roofing, has fallen 30% since May to five-year lows. But it jumped 12% after the announcement to reach the highest level for two months and record the biggest one-day gain in 10 years. Other commodities, including lead and nickel, were propelled higher. About a third of Glencore\u2019s annual zinc output will be stopped, mostly from mines in Australia, where 535 jobs will be lost. Operations in South America and Kazakhstan will also be affected. The zinc cuts come on top of an array of measures Glencore announced last month to help it slash its $30bn (\u00a319bn) in net debt by a third, including lower copper production, suspension of its dividends and a sale of new shares. Shares in the company have endured a rollercoaster ride, slumping to a record low last month of 68.62p but they have since recouped their losses and ended Friday 7% higher at 129p. At flotation in 2011, the shares were priced at 530p. The cuts will reduce the company\u2019s fourth quarter zinc production by 100,000 tonnes. It had previously expected to produce between 1.52m tonnes and 1.57m tonnes of the metal this year. \u201cGlencore remains positive about the medium and long term outlook for zinc, lead and silver. However, we are taking a proactive approach to manage our production in response to current prices,\u201d it said. The majority of the job losses are expected to be in Peru. In Australia, operations at the Lady Loretta mine in Queensland will be temporarily suspended, while output will be reduced at the George Fisher mine in Queensland and McArthur River mine in the Northern Territory.",
