      "bodyText": "Millions of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group customers have had difficulty accessing their accounts after the banks suffered IT meltdowns before the long weekend. On Friday, when RBS was trying to focus on its first quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2015 and Lloyds on the news that the taxpayer\u2019s shareholding had fallen to less than 1%, both banks instead faced questions about their digital operations. Customers of NatWest \u2013 part of RBS \u2013 complained on social media about their online banking, with some pointing out that it was payday. Some customers said their transfers were disappearing. Lloyds admitted that customers of all its brands, which include Halifax and Bank of Scotland, were being affected by a slow online service. Both banks apologised and RBS said it had resolved the issue by 3pm, ahead of Monday\u2019s public holiday across the UK. An RBS spokesperson said: \u201cOur mobile apps and online banking are now running as normal and delayed payments are starting to credit customer accounts. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.\u201d No customers would be left out of pocket, the bank added. Lloyds, which has 25 million customers, said: \u201cWe are aware that some of our customers are experiencing issues logging on to internet banking across all Lloyds Banking Group brands. We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and apologise for any inconvenience caused.\u201d The problems did not appear to be preventing customers from using cash machines or completing card transactions in shops, as was the case with previous IT issues. After a more severe systems meltdown in 2012, RBS was fined \u00a350m when customers were unable to access their cash. The problems occurred after RBS reported profits for the first three months of 2017 of \u00a3259m, which increased its share price by 4.5%. However, the shares remained below the level at which taxpayers break even on their 43% stake, which the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said will need to be sold at a loss. In contrast, Hammond claimed last week that he has recouped the \u00a320.3bn used to buy shares in Lloyds. The taxpayer stake, which was 43% at its peak, fell to 0.89% on Friday as the Treasury continued to sell off shares. The shareholding will decline to zero in coming weeks. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, who is cutting costs \u2013 16,000 jobs have gone since last year \u2013 in an attempt to bolster profitability, said there was no need to apologise for the government\u2019s inability to get its money back. The bailout was the \u201cright thing\u201d, he added.",

    "webTitle": "Growth slows in Britain and the US as GDP reports miss forecasts - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Phew! Economists and investors are catching their breath after a busy day dominated by growth figures from the eurozone, the UK and America. There\u2019s some disappointment that Britain, the United States and France all grew slower than expected in January to March. But there\u2019s no panic. American GDP is expected to rebound this quarter, while the UK seems to be settling into a period of slower growth due to the pick-up in inflation, and some Brexit uncertainty. Here\u2019s our news story about the US GDP: And here\u2019s our UK GDP story: Thanks for reading and commenting. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Here\u2019s today\u2019s Nasdaq record high: Larry Fink, the head of fund management firm BlackRock, has said it\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d that America grew slower than France in the last quarter. Fink is speaking at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago, where he expressed concern about the US slowdown. [Reminder, we learned today that French GDP rose by 0.3%, or 1.2% on the US-style \u2018annualised basis\u2019]. The US stock market isn\u2019t too concerned by the growth figures. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped in early trading, but the technology-focused Nasdaq hit a new record high. That\u2019s due to Amazon and Alphabet (Google), which both posted strong results after the closing bell on Thursday night. The weather is copping some blame for the slowdown in US growth. Unusually mild conditions meant Americans spent less money heating their homes and offices during the winter, which equates to lower economic activity. Michelle Meyer, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains: \u201cWarm weather meant consumers weren\u2019t spending as much on electricity and natural gas and home heating. Government spending can also be affected by seasonal factors, and defense spending is especially volatile.\u201d Here\u2019s Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics, explaining how weak consumption dragged the American economy back down in the last three months: The slowdown in the first quarter this year was principally due to a near-stagnation in consumption, which increased by only 0.3% annualised. Household spending was held down by a drop back in motor vehicle sales from a near-record high at the end of last year and the unseasonably warm winter weather, which depressed utilities spending. But consumer confidence is unusually high and real personal disposable income increased at a 4% annualised pace in the first quarter. Consumption growth will rebound in the second quarter. Another former Democratic official argues that we shouldn\u2019t panic about the US growth figures. Jason Furman, who chaired president Obama\u2019s council of economic advisors, points out that growth will likely rebound in the April-June quarter. It may be tempting to contrast Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d with the news that US economic growth has hit a three year low on his watch. This certainly isn\u2019t the start that Trump had in mind during the campaign, when he boasted that America could grow by more than 4% per year if he were in charge. But I don\u2019t think you can really blame the new president for the slowdown in Q1 (especially if you\u2019re also criticising him for not getting much done in his first 100 days). The consequences of Trump\u2019s presidency will only emerge over many months and years. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: We haven\u2019t yet had the expected fiscal stimulus from Trump, the effects of which may not be seen until the end of this year or the start of 2018. While investors might be disappointed with the reading, it has been a steady start to the year with inflation looking benign, a resilient jobs market and positive PMI data, all likely to boost returns for investors.\u201d Macro-economic strategist George Pearkes concurs: Jared Bernstein, a former advisor to VP Joe Biden, points out that America\u2019s economy has posted solid enough growth over the last year: Some context: As you can see, America\u2019s economy also grew modestly in Q1 2016, and actually shrank in Q1 2014. The first three months of 2015 weren\u2019t amazing either. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the US growth figures: The U.S. economy turned in the weakest performance in three years in the January-March quarter as consumers sharply slowed their spending. The result repeats a pattern that has characterized the recovery: lackluster beginnings to the year. The Commerce Department says the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, grew by just 0.7% in the first quarter following a gain of 2.1% in the fourth quarter. The slowdown primarily reflected slower consumer spending, which grew by just 0.3 percent. That was the poorest showing in more than seven years. Analysts blame in part the unusually warm winter, which meant less spending on utility bills. Economists believe the slowdown will be temporary. They forecast GDP growth will rebound to 3% or better in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u2019s economy has slowed sharply, posting its weakest growth in three years. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of just 0.7% in the first three months of 2017. That\u2019s equal to a quarterly rate of less than 0.2%, and means that the first growth figures of the Trump administration are a disappointment. This is a sharp slowdown compared to the final quarter of 2016, when the US economy grew at an annualised pace of 2.1%. As in the UK, consumer spending was partly to blame, with car sales rather weak. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s snap take: Three down, one to go.... After disappointing GDP figures from the UK and France, but stronger growth in Spain, we\u2019re now turning to America to see how its economy fared in the first quarter of this year..... Time for a quick recap of this morning\u2019s UK growth report. Economists are warning that the Brexit slowdown has begun, after Britain\u2019s economic growth has more than halved to its lowest rate since the EU referendum. UK GDP grew by just 0.3% in January to March, down from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s a weaker performance than the City expected. The service sector suffered the brunt of the slowdown, as rising prices hurt the retail, hotels and restaurant sector. The data show that the drop in the pound since last summer is now hurting the domestic economy. But manufacturing grew by 0.5%, suggesting sterling\u2019s depreciation has also boosted UK factories. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said that the UK economy remains resilient. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and TUC head Frances O\u2019Grady, have both warned that Britain faces a new cost of living squeeze. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says the consumer-driven slowdown has begun, as incomes are hit by slowing employment and wage growth as well as rising inflation. One quarter of slow growth is not definitive proof that the economy is on the ropes. But the pressure on consumers\u2019 incomes looks set to build this year as retailers pass on higher import prices; we still expect CPI inflation to exceed 3% in the second half of this year. The British Chambers of Commerce fears that the UK is entering a period of sluggish growth, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. With growth unlikely to pick up, Barclays predict UK interest rates will remain on hold until at least the end of 2018. The pound has not been rattled by the slowdown in UK growth. Instead, sterling hit a new seven-month high of $1.2957 after the GDP figures were released. The pound is now on track for its best month since the Brexit vote last June: As mentioned earlier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has become the latest bank to revise its pound forecasts higher. BAML currency analyst Kamal Sharma told clients that The announcement of an 8th June general election was a game-changing event for sterling. Sterling will face Brexit challenges but its day of reckoning has been pushed further into the future.\u201d BAML now expect the pound to bottom out at $1.25 in the current quarter and finish the year at $1.27, compared with their respective forecasts of $1.15 and $1.19 previously. The chancellor has now tweeted about the GDP figures: This chart, from CBI economist Alpesh Paleja, shows why the UK growth rate almost halved in the last quarter. As you can see, the retail and hospitality sector (in green) had been a key driver of growth in October-December, but shrank in January-March. The looming shadow of Brexit means the UK economy is unlikely to accelerate over the next couple of years, warns Morgan Stanley economist Melanie Baker. She writes: We expect this slower quarterly pace of growth to persist in 2017, reflecting our assumption that higher inflation will dampen real consumer spending growth and an assumption of subdued business investment as Brexit approaches As this chart shows, Morgan Stanley predict growth could inch up to 0.4% in April to June, but then dipping back to around 0.3%: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the news that growth slowed to 0.3% the last quarter: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures reveal the threat to living standards under the Tories. \u201cGrowth for the first three months of 2017 was only half of what was expected. It comes on the back of new forecasts last week from leading independent forecasters showing growth and earnings expectations slashed and inflation revised up.\u201d \u201cThere is no hiding from the truth. The Tories\u2019 economic plan has undermined the UK economy and is a threat to working people\u2019s living standards. \u201cThis General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Tory Party which only looks after the privileged few.\u201d There\u2019s not been much other reaction from the campaign trail; The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn thinks he knows why.... TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady fears that the alarm bells are ringing in the UK economy, now that the consumer slowdown is underway. \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures do not bode well for the future. \u201cConsumer spending has been propping up the UK economy. But with pay packets squeezed, families have less money to spend on the high street. \u201cThe next government cannot rely on household spending alone to drive growth, especially when another living standards crisis is on the horizon. \u201cPoliticians have long promised to rebalance the economy. They need to spell out at this election how they will deliver, starting with an industrial strategy that creates good jobs where they\u2019re needed most.\u201d But writing in The Times, Ed Conway suggests the Conservatives will play down economic issues in this election: The slowdown in Britain\u2019s economy will prevent the Bank of England raising interest rates until at least 2019. That\u2019s according to analysts at Barclays, who have issued a good note on the GDP figures. They argue: In our view, given rising inflationary pressures and the increasing likelihood of negative real wage growth in the coming months, household consumption will continue to ease over the course of 2017. All in all, we believe this strengthens our view that the Bank of England MPC will leave its monetary policy stance unchanged over our forecast horizon (until end-2018). Barclays also predict that the UK economy will keep slowing this year, as \u201chouseholds are forced to tighten their belts\u201d. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg says we shouldn\u2019t panic about the slowdown in the UK economy, even though growth halved in the last quarter: While the deceleration looks a little scary, the UK\u2019s trend rate is around 0.4%. The expansion is entering its eighth year and the labour market is at full employment. Against this backdrop, growth with some volatility around its trend rate during the middle of the cycle is more than satisfactory. Via Berenberg Bank, here\u2019s a neat chart showing UK growth by sector over the last decade: Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), believes Britain is entering a \u201csustained period of more sluggish growth\u201d. June\u2019s snap general election won\u2019t help the situation, he warns: Inflation is expected to continue to rise, increasing the squeeze on consumer spending power and firm\u2019s profit margins, pushing growth lower. The BCC\u2019s own Quarterly Economic Survey confirms that inflation is a key risk to the UK\u2019s growth prospects, with businesses under increasing pressure to raise prices. Uncertainty over the impact of Brexit and the distraction of a General Election are also likely to weigh on economic activity over the near term. Chancellor Philip Hammond has just been interviewed about the GDP figures by Sky News, outside the Treasury. Hammond argues that the UK economy is in good shape, despite the slowdown in the last quarter. \u201cEmployment at record highs and it\u2019s set to go higher still\u201d, says Hammond, adding that \u201cThe British economy is resilient\u201d. Q: But isn\u2019t the slowdown in growth due to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans? These negotiations will be \u201ctough and complex\u201d, Hammond replies. That\u2019s why we need strong and stable leadership and a clear mandate, to get the best possible deal, he concludes. The slowdown in Britain\u2019s service sector is worrying, because services firms make up around 80% of the economy. Dutch bank ING says households are being squeezed, and fears that Brexit uncertainty will compound the problem: Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen\u2019s take on today\u2019s GDP figures: Britain\u2019s economy slowed more than expected in the opening months of this year, with GDP growth slipping to 0.3% from 0.7% the previous quarter as the post-referendum rise in living costs took its toll on British households. The news adds to signs that the resilience seen for the UK economy in the wake of the Brexit vote is now waning and will come as a blow to Theresa May\u2019s government as it banks on a solid victory in the snap election on 8 June. Economists had expected growth to slow more modestly to 0.4% in the first quarter, according to a poll by Reuters. The 0.3% growth rate was the slowest for a year. Statisticians said the biggest drag was the retail sector, echoing other signs shoppers are cutting back.... Click here for the full story: Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank sums up the slowdown: To put the pace of growth into context, this is like driving away for the bank holiday weekend, hitting traffic and slowing from 70mph to 30mph\u2026 and it is starting to rain... Clarke also believes that Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is responsible: This weakness is likely to be blamed on Brexit. That is probably fair, albeit in an indirect sense. The fears leading up to Brexit were that growth would stall due to a dive in confidence, hiring and investment. That hasn\u2019t happened. What did happen is the pound dived, pushing inflation sharply higher and that is causing consumer spending and hence overall growth to slow. The good news is that the surge in inflation is probably temporary and the squeeze on growth should pass. However, it is probably going to take another year before growth on back on an upwards trajectory. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says that weak pay growth and the rising cost of living is hurting the UK economy. \u201cAfter a GDP reading which defied expectation at the end of last year, all eyes were on the Q1 data to see whether the Brexit effect would have affected UK economic performance at the start of 2017. Rising inflation and slow wage growth have dampened consumer demand and reduced retail spending, which were helping drive growth last year after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. On the other hand though, the increased attractiveness of sterling in the wake of the referendum has boosted manufacturing and international exports, making headway in rebalancing the UK economy. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, fears growth will remain modest this year. \u201cToday\u2019s print of 0.3% represents a sharp fall from the giddy pace of growth we witnessed a last quarter. Rising inflation seems to be having a negative impact on the parts of the economy exposed to the consumer. Looking ahead, we expect that pressure on real household incomes will keep growth subdued. Mark Sismey-Durrant, chief executive officer at Hampshire Trust Bank, blames economic uncertainty for the slowdown: \u201cToday\u2019s decline in GDP demonstrates the short term uncertainty being felt among both businesses and consumers. Businesses like certainty and with the impact of the snap General Election and the evolving EU negotiations, perhaps some economic impact is inevitable. However, we believe that the outlook offers room for optimism, based on the resilience the economy has demonstrated since the EU Referendum. Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway agrees that consumers are cutting back: ITV\u2019s Noreena Hertz reckons Theresa May won\u2019t be happy: Here are the key points from today\u2019s report into the UK economy: UK gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have increased by 0.3% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2017, the slowest rate of growth since Quarter 1 2016. Slower growth in Quarter 1 2017 was mainly due to services, which grew by 0.3% compared with growth of 0.8% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016. In Quarter 1 2017 there were falls in several important consumer-focused industries, such as retail sales and accommodation; this was due in part to prices increasing more than spending. Production, construction and agriculture grew by 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively in Quarter 1 2017. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.1% during Quarter 1 2017. Today\u2019s GDP repost shows that Britain\u2019s economy is suffering the impact of higher inflation. Retailers, hotels and restaurants all suffered falling growth, after being forced to hike prices due to higher input costs (because sterling fell sharply after the EU referendum). The ONS says: Retail trade and accommodation services were the main contributors to the negative growth in the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector. These industries were impacted by increases in prices. Britain\u2019s dominant service sector has suffered a significant slowdown in the last quarter. Services output expanded by just 0.3% in January-March, down from 0.8% in October-December. Industrial production grew by 0.3%, including a 0.5% rise in manufacturing output, construction expanded by 0.2% and agriculture grew by 0.2%. Breaking! Britain\u2019s economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of this year. UK GDP expanded by just 0.3% in January to March, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u2019s down from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016, and the slowest reading since the first three months of last year. More to follow.... A former top advisor to ex-chancellor George Osborne tweets: Tension is building in the City, with just four minutes to go until the UK growth figures are released. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says a surprise reading can\u2019t be ruled out.... After surprising everyone with 0.7% growth in the final quarter of 2016, the UK is expected to have seen a sharp drop-off in Q1 2017, analysts estimating that the country\u2019s economy expanded by just 0.4% across the first 3 months of the year. The GDP readings for the last few quarters, however, have tended to beat the Brexit-inspired gloom, so there is room for a shock this morning. Zing! Sterling has just hit its highest level against the US dollar since last September. The pound has jumped by 0.3% this morning to $1.2939, a seven-month high. It\u2019s also a little higher against the euro, at \u20ac1.1881. The rally comes as Bank of America tears up its gloomy forecasts for the pound. It now predicts that sterling will average $1.25 this quarter, having previously expected it to slump to $1.15. Gross domestic product is the economics world\u2019s favoured way of estimating growth and output. But it\u2019s not a perfect measure. GDP tries to pin down how well, or badly, a country is performing by estimating how much was produced, spent, and earned across its economy. It show the output across services, industry, construction and agriculture, household and government spending, business investment, and net trade. But it doesn\u2019t show whether the economic growth is being shared fairly, whether it is reducing inequality or creating it, whether economic activity is environmentally harmful, or Robert F. Kennedy gave the definitive explanation of GDP\u2019s flaws almost half a century ago, in a famous speech: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans. It\u2019s worth remembering that the UK\u2019s economy has actually held up pretty well since the EU referendum. GDP rose by 0.5% in July-September last year, accelerating to 0.7% in October-December, dashing forecasts that a Brexit vote would quickly trigger a recession. On a longer-term basis, Britain\u2019s economy has already posted 16 quarter of growth in a row. Unless today\u2019s report is a real shocker, that should become 17 quarters..... Breaking! Spain has shown Britain how it\u2019s done, by reporting strong growth figures for the last three months. Spanish GDP expanded by a punchy 0.8% in Q1, ahead of expectations, and extending its recent recovery. On an annual basis, Spain grew by 3.0%. Today\u2019s UK growth figures, due at 9.30am, are significant for several reasons. First, they\u2019re the most important economic data to be released before the general election on June 8th. So a strong GDP report would bolster the Conservative Party. But... Economists are expecting that growth slowed to its lowest rate in 12 months -- to around 0.4% to 0.5%, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. So if the GDP report is disappointing, opposition parties should be able to land some blows on the government. Secondly, there\u2019s Brexit. These figures will cover the three months before Theresa May triggered Article 50. Crucially, they also cover the period when the PM gave her Lancaster House speech, committing to leave the single market. Will that have dented business confidence? And has rising inflation, due to the slump in sterling last year, started to hurt consumers? Thirdly, there\u2019s the impact on the markets. The pound has quietly been recovering in recent weeks, back up to $1.29 against the US dollar from just $1.21 in mid-March. If GDP misses forecasts, then the pound may get tonked. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets have predicted that growth fell to 0.4%, setting the UK up for a year of slower growth. Even with the expectation of activity recovering in March, the broader narrative remains that we look for GDP growth to slow in 2017. Here\u2019s a good chart from the FT, showing how France\u2019s growth has fallen back: There\u2019s a flurry of banking news this morning too. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is majority-owned by the UK taxpayer, has posted its first quarterly profit since 2015. It made \u00a3259m in the three months to March, beating forecasts. Barclays has announced plans to hire 2,000 extra staff over the next few years, as part of a new push into technology. Can Fintech help to replace City jobs lost due to Brexit? And not to be outdone, the government has cut its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to just 0.89% - more than eight years after taxpayers bailing it out. We\u2019ve just learned that the slowdown in Britain\u2019s housing market is gathering pace -- another sign that the economy may be losing momentum. Nationwide has reported that prices FELL in April for the second month running (on a seasonally adjusted basis). And on an annual basis, prices only rose by 2.6% - the slowest rate of increase since June 2013. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says it may be due to rising inflation, which is driving down real incomes. Also, prices may simply have risen too high, Gardner adds: \u201cThere may also be more fundamental reasons for the slowdown. House price growth has been outstripping earnings growth for a sustained period of time, steadily eroding affordability on a number of metrics. For example, the typical house price is currently 6.1 times average earnings, well above the long run average of 4.3 times earnings, and close to the all-time high of 6.4 times recorded in 2007. France\u2019s economy was dragged back by disappointing trade figures (because exports fell while imports rose). This breakdown of the GDP figures shows how net trade (commerce exterieur) was negative for growth. INSEE explains: Foreign trade weighs on growth Exports decreased in the first quarter of 2017 (-0.7% after + 1.4%), particularly in transport equipment. At the same time, imports accelerated (+ 1.5% after + 0.8%). In particular, purchases of refined petroleum products are rebounding and those of other industrial products are growing more vigorously. Overall, foreign trade weighed on growth, at -0.7 point, after a contribution of +0.2 point the previous quarter. Bert Colijn, senior colleague at ING Bank, says the French growth figures are a disappointment: Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet agrees, but is encouraged that French businesses are investing more in new equipment and buildings. Breaking: France\u2019s economy grew slower than expected in the first three months of this year. French GDP expanded by just 0.3%, missing the 0.4% which economists had predicted. It\u2019s not all bad news, though - INSEE, the stats body, has revised growth in the last quarter of 2016 up to 0.5%, from 0.4%. French consumers dragged growth back; household spending slowed to just 0.1%. Business investment jumped, though, to +0.9% from 0.6% -- an encouraging sign. But...exports fell sharply (-0.7% from + 1.4%) while imports accelerated (+ 1.5% from +0.8%). Good morning. We\u2019re about to get a deluge of economic data that will show how some of the world\u2019s largest economies have performed in 2017. Growth figures from Britain, America, France and Spain are all being released over the next seven hours. And for different reasons, they should all be fascinating. Britain\u2019s GDP report will be pored over for signs that Brexit is hurting the economy. Economists expect growth to have slowed in January-March to around 0.4% to 0.5%, down from 0.7% in October-December 2016. France\u2019s figures will highlight the scale of the challenge facing either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen. Spain\u2019s data will show whether the eurozone\u2019s battered periphery is still recovering.... And America\u2019s growth figures are the first school report since Donald Trump became US president. And the bad news is that economists predict a slowdown, as consumers cut back.

Analysts blame in part the unusually warm winter, which meant less spending on utility bills.</p> <p>Economists believe the slowdown will be temporary. They forecast GDP growth will rebound to 3% or better in the current quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-590335ebe4b098a0c787ff15\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-28T12:38:09.028Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US economic growth falls to lowest pace since 2014</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31bd87ba5b9118fe5c4aef698e5c5b498502b9c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31bd87ba5b9118fe5c4aef698e5c5b498502b9c2/809_93_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The White House</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Breaking!

      "bodyText": "The UK economy suffered a sharp slowdown in the opening months of this year, as the post-referendum rise in living costs took its toll on British households and hit consumer spending. GDP growth fell more than expected to 0.3% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. The official figures add to signs that the UK economy\u2019s resilience in the wake of the Brexit vote is now waning and will come as a blow to Theresa May\u2019s government as it banks on a solid victory in the snap election on 8 June. Many economists expect the slowdown to continue as higher inflation dents consumer spending, a key driver for the UK economy. But the deterioration is still far off the Brexit-related slump some commentators had predicted. \u201cThe first quarter\u2019s slowdown was led by consumers, whose incomes are under pressure from slowing employment and wage growth as well as rising inflation,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cOne quarter of slow growth is not definitive proof that the economy is on the ropes. But the pressure on consumers\u2019 incomes looks set to build this year as retailers pass on higher import prices.\u201d The figures suggested consumer-facing sectors such as shops and hotels have been hurt in recent months by the squeeze on Britons\u2019 spending power from the pound\u2019s plunge since the Brexit vote. Sterling\u2019s weakness makes imports to the UK such as food and fuel more expensive. That factor combined with higher crude oil prices has lifted inflation to its highest level for more than three years. Economists had predicted a more modest slowdown to 0.4% growth, according to a Reuters poll. The 0.3% growth rate was the slowest for a year. There was also a sharp slowdown in GDP per head, which adjusts for the size of the population and is generally seen as a better guide to prosperity than mere GDP. It edged up just 0.1% in the first quarter after rising 0.5% in the previous quarter. Statisticians said the biggest drag on growth was the retail sector, echoing other signs shoppers are cutting back. Growth in the services sector, which makes up more than three quarters of the UK economy, slowed markedly to a two-year low of 0.3% from 0.8% in the final quarter of 2016. A leading thinktank underscored the pressures on household budgets as it noted the weakness in wage growth started long before the Brexit vote. After adjusting for inflation, employees\u2019 average earnings were still substantially below pre-recession levels, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said in a new analysis. On current forecasts, earnings would still not have fully recovered by the end of the next parliament. \u201cA period of this length over which earnings have fallen is unprecedented in modern times. They had started to recover a little between 2014 and 2016, but rising inflation linked to the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum has put a stop to that modest recovery,\u201d said IFS senior research economist Jonathan Cribb. The ONS figures showed industrial production and construction output also slowed in the first quarter. But economists noted that their fortunes could yet improve over coming months. There have been signs that the weak pound has already helped exporters by making their goods and services more competitive overseas. \u201cThe long-awaited slowdown is finally coming but I\u2019d be wary of over-interpreting today\u2019s numbers,\u201d said Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte. \u201cQuarterly GDP growth is choppy and prone to revision. Inflation will continue to squeeze the consumer but the outlook for manufacturing and exports has brightened. Growth is slowing, but this looks like a cooling, not collapse, in UK activity.\u201d Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, was also cautiously optimistic about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects. \u201cThe fears leading up to Brexit were that growth would stall due to a dive in confidence, hiring and investment. That hasn\u2019t happened.

But the deterioration is still far off the Brexit-related slump some commentators had predicted.</p> <p>\u201cThe first quarter\u2019s slowdown was led by consumers, whose incomes are under pressure from slowing employment and wage growth as well as rising inflation,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p> <p>\u201cOne quarter of slow growth is not definitive proof that the economy is on the ropes. But the pressure on consumers\u2019 incomes looks set to build this year as retailers pass on higher import prices.\u201d<br></p> <p>The figures suggested consumer-facing sectors such as shops and hotels have been hurt in recent months by the squeeze on Britons\u2019 spending power from the pound\u2019s plunge since the Brexit vote. Sterling\u2019s weakness makes imports to the UK such as food and fuel more expensive. That factor combined with higher crude oil prices has lifted inflation to its highest level for more than three years. </p> <p>Economists had predicted a more modest slowdown to 0.4% growth, according to a Reuters poll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/04/gdp_growth/giv-3902YSSpa2pVm0fO/\" data-alt=\"UK GDP chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/04/gdp_growth/giv-3902YSSpa2pVm0fO/\">UK GDP chart</a> </figure>  <p>The 0.3% growth rate was the slowest for a year. There was also a sharp slowdown in GDP per head, which adjusts for the size of the population and is generally seen as a better guide to prosperity than mere GDP. It edged up just 0.1% in the first quarter after rising 0.5% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>Statisticians said the biggest drag on growth was the retail sector, echoing other signs shoppers are cutting back. Growth in the services sector, which makes up more than three quarters of the UK economy, slowed markedly to a two-year low of 0.3% from 0.8% in the final quarter of 2016.<br></p> <p>A leading thinktank underscored the pressures on household budgets as it noted the weakness in wage growth started long before the Brexit vote. After adjusting for inflation, employees\u2019 average earnings were still substantially below pre-recession levels, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/9170\">a new analysis</a>. On current forecasts, earnings would still not have fully recovered by the end of the next parliament.</p> <p>\u201cA period of this length over which earnings have fallen is unprecedented in modern times. They had started to recover a little between 2014 and 2016, but rising inflation linked to the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum has put a stop to that modest recovery,\u201d said IFS senior research economist Jonathan Cribb.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p>The ONS figures showed industrial production and construction output also slowed in the first quarter. But economists noted that their fortunes could yet improve over coming months. There have been signs that the weak pound has already helped exporters by making their goods and services more competitive overseas. </p> <p>\u201cThe long-awaited slowdown is finally coming but I\u2019d be wary of over-interpreting today\u2019s numbers,\u201d said Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte.</p> <p>\u201cQuarterly GDP growth is choppy and prone to revision. Inflation will continue to squeeze the consumer but the outlook for manufacturing and exports has brightened. Growth is slowing, but this looks like a cooling, not collapse, in UK activity.\u201d </p> <p>Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, was also cautiously optimistic about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects.</p> <p>\u201cThe fears leading up to Brexit were that growth would stall due to a dive in confidence, hiring and investment.

The high street chain told a parliamentary committee in March that just one in 50 job applicants were British because its upmarket sandwich shops were not seen by Britons as a \u201cdesirable place to work\u201d. With 65% of its workforce drawn from EU countries other than Britain, Pret\u2019s director of human resources, Andrea Wareham, told MPs it would struggle to find enough staff if it was forced to turn its back on EU nationals after the UK leaves the European Union. Pret\u2019s attempt to appeal to British school leavers got off to a rocky start last month when the company came under fire after the Guardian reported it was offering 500 teenagers a week of work experience, without pay, to give them a taste of working for the private equity-backed firm. The 16- to 18-year-olds were only being offered free food. However, after a backlash on social media the company relented, with Schlee committing to pay all participants Pret\u2019s hourly starting rate. In recent months a number of UK employers have voiced concerns about their ability to fill jobs in shops, factories and hospitals if EU migrants decide to return home. Schlee told the Financial Times that Pret had not yet seen a decline in the number of EU workers seeking jobs but it was making a concerted effort to tap \u201cmore UK-oriented labour pools\u201d. Schlee said he was encouraged by government plans to head off recruitment woes for the hospitality industry with a new \u201cbarista visa\u201d mooted to allow young European citizens to continue coming to the UK to work in coffee shops and pubs. His comments came as the company reported a record set of full-year results, with global sales rising 15% to more than \u00a3776m last year. The chain\u2019s operating profits increased 11% to more than \u00a393m. Schlee said the pound\u2019s fall since the Brexit vote had been a double-edged sword as it had boosted UK sales by attracting more tourists but had also forced up the cost of many ingredients. He pledged to keep price rises below inflation, despite seeing spikes in the cost of imported ingredients such as salmon, avocados and crayfish. Pret has won a legion of loyal customers thanks to its ability to spot the latest food trends, such as avocado, quinoa and chakalaka beans. Pret said the most popular new ingredient over the past year had been coconut, with pots of dairy-free coconut porridge now accounting for one in every five sold in the UK. . The 30-year-old company was founded by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe, who went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe\u2019s Skinny popcorn. It is now controlled by private equity firm Bridgepoint but there has been speculation that it is gearing up for a stock market flotation within the next 18 months, with further speculation that bosses are eyeing a listing in New York rather than London. The chain has been a big hit in the US, where sales broke the $200m (\u00a3155m) mark for the first time in 2016.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s bad and impaired loans stand at historically low levels. Its net interest margin \u2013 the best measure of a bank\u2019s profitability \u2013 is the highest in the UK sector, and still rising. It is generating capital faster than expected. The end is in sight on PPI provisions. And the state\u2019s stake has been reduced to 2%, with the last of the shares to be sold in coming weeks. A good moment, then, for chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio to bow out after six years at the helm? Horta-Os\u00f3rio says he\u2019s happy in his post and there is more to do. Not everybody is convinced by that answer, since six years counts as a long innings for a FTSE 100 chief executive and he\u2019s constantly linked with the vacancy at HSBC. An exit can\u2019t be ruled out. But, actually, committing to a couple more laps of the track at Lloyds is surely a highly attractive prospect. With a 25% share of the UK retail market, the bank is currently playing in a league of its own and can expect to do so for years. The big danger passed last year, when the Competition and Markets Authority issued a woefully supine report that opted not to impose a structural shake-up on the sector, liberating Halifax from the Lloyds stable. That was the probably the last moment for regulators to be radical. Under the current set-up, Lloyds\u2019 leadership in UK retail banking is assured as far as the eye can see. It is big in all the main activities \u2013 current accounts, mortgages, retail deposits, loans to small businesses \u2013 and is filling the only obvious gap by boosting its credit card operation with the addition of the MBNA book. If Horta-Os\u00f3rio stays, his next three-year plan, due to be unveiled in the autumn, will be the easiest to write. Brexit-related uncertainties are a background worry since Lloyds is a proxy for the performance of the UK economy, but the major restructuring is over. It\u2019s now a matter of deciding how generous to be with shareholders\u2019 dividends while setting the correct rate of investment in digital innovations. There are fine judgments to be made, no doubt, but they are not the existential questions of old. Maybe Horta-Os\u00f3rio, at the age of 53, pines for a job on the global stage, but running a restructured Lloyds is surely an easier way to earn \u00a35m-ish a year than most of the alternatives. Proof will be in the pudding for M&amp;S All the reasons why Marks &amp; Spencer refused to offer an online food delivery service made sense. Very few shoppers use M&amp;S for their weekly shop. The range of foods is much smaller than in a conventional supermarket. M&amp;S doesn\u2019t sell other brands in any great quantity. But here comes the U-turn, or at least the contemplation of a U-turn. As the Guardian reveals, M&amp;S will conduct several online trials in food to see if it can make the economics work. Chief executive Steve Rowe is right to question the old assumptions, since the online market is only going to increase in size. If the punters are willing to pay for deliveries, the company must give them what they want, especially if the current lack of an online offer is one reason why M&amp;S\u2019s growth in like-for-like food sales has stalled. All the same, shareholders may need some convincing if M&amp;S declares the experiment to be a success and decides to plunge in further: yet another round of investment in distribution infrastructure is probably not what they want to hear. AstraZeneca\u2019s Soriot hasn\u2019t yet proved his worth AstraZeneca keeps getting into a mess over pay. In 2014, almost 40% of shareholders voted against the pay report. Now they\u2019ve done so again, presumably objecting to last year\u2019s \u00a313m pay package for chief executive Pascal Soriot, which inevitably flowed in large part from the flowering of a long-term incentive scheme. Whatever the small print of the scheme says, the rebels have right on their side. Soriot\u2019s reign has been a big improvement on that of his predecessor, David Brennan, but it\u2019s too early to be handing out \u00a313m prizes. On its own reckoning, AstraZeneca stands at a \u201cpivotal point\u201d as patents on old drugs expire and new medicines start to arrive. The company\u2019s drug pipeline is widely regarded as one of the best in the business, especially in oncology, but promise and hard success are not the same thing. AstraZeneca\u2019s share price is still well below the level at which Pfizer bid in 2014. The big bucks should come only when Soriot can show his strategic overhaul has delivered.",

It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/lloyds-profits-ppi-hbos\">generating capital faster than expected</a>. The end is in sight on PPI provisions. And the state\u2019s stake has been reduced to 2%, with the last of the shares to be sold in coming weeks. A good moment, then, for chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio to bow out after six years at the helm? </p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio says he\u2019s happy in his post and there is more to do. Not everybody is convinced by that answer, since six years counts as a long innings for a FTSE 100 chief executive and he\u2019s constantly linked with the vacancy at HSBC. An exit can\u2019t be ruled out. But, actually, committing to a couple more laps of the track at Lloyds is surely a highly attractive prospect. With a 25% share of the UK retail market, the bank is currently playing in a league of its own and can expect to do so for years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/21/lloyds-bank-bailout-repaid-in-full-philip-hammond-claims\">Lloyds bank bailout repaid in full, says Philip Hammond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The big danger passed last year, when the Competition and Markets Authority issued a woefully supine report that opted not to impose a structural shake-up on the sector, liberating Halifax from the Lloyds stable. That was the probably the last moment for regulators to be radical.</p> <p>Under the current set-up, Lloyds\u2019 leadership in UK retail banking is assured as far as the eye can see. It is big in all the main activities \u2013 current accounts, mortgages, retail deposits, loans to small businesses \u2013 and is filling the only obvious gap by boosting its credit card operation with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/20/lloyds-snaps-up-mbna-for-19bn\">addition of the MBNA book</a>.</p> <p>If Horta-Os\u00f3rio stays, his next three-year plan, due to be unveiled in the autumn, will be the easiest to write. Brexit-related uncertainties are a background worry since Lloyds is a proxy for the performance of the UK economy, but the major restructuring is over. It\u2019s now a matter of deciding how generous to be with shareholders\u2019 dividends while setting the correct rate of investment in digital innovations. There are fine judgments to be made, no doubt, but they are not the existential questions of old.</p> <p>Maybe Horta-Os\u00f3rio, at the age of 53, pines for a job on the global stage, but running a restructured Lloyds is surely an easier way to earn \u00a35m-ish a year than most of the alternatives.</p> <h2>Proof will be in the pudding for M&amp;S</h2> <p>All the reasons why Marks &amp; Spencer refused to offer an online food delivery service made sense. Very few shoppers use M&amp;S for their weekly shop. The range of foods is much smaller than in a conventional supermarket. M&amp;S doesn\u2019t sell other brands in any great quantity. But here comes the U-turn, or at least the contemplation of a U-turn. As the Guardian reveals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/this-is-not-just-any-online-grocer-ms-plans-food-delivery-service\">M&amp;S will conduct several online trials in food</a> to see if it can make the economics work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/this-is-not-just-any-online-grocer-ms-plans-food-delivery-service\">This is not just any online grocer \u2026 M&amp;S plans food delivery service</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chief executive Steve Rowe is right to question the old assumptions, since the online market is only going to increase in size. If the punters are willing to pay for deliveries, the company must give them what they want, especially if the current lack of an online offer is one reason why M&amp;S\u2019s growth in like-for-like food sales has stalled.</p> <p>All the same, shareholders may need some convincing if M&amp;S declares the experiment to be a success and decides to plunge in further: yet another round of investment in distribution infrastructure is probably not what they want to hear.</p> <h2>AstraZeneca\u2019s Soriot hasn\u2019t yet proved his worth</h2> <p> AstraZeneca keeps getting into a mess over pay. In 2014, almost 40% of shareholders voted against the pay report. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/astrazeneca-shareholders-revolt-again-over-executive-pay\">Now they\u2019ve done so again</a>, presumably objecting to last year\u2019s \u00a313m pay package for chief executive Pascal Soriot, which inevitably flowed in large part from the flowering of a long-term incentive scheme. Whatever the small print of the scheme says, the rebels have right on their side. Soriot\u2019s reign has been a big improvement on that of his predecessor, David Brennan, but it\u2019s too early to be handing out \u00a313m prizes.</p> <p>On its own reckoning, AstraZeneca stands at a \u201cpivotal point\u201d as patents on old drugs expire and new medicines start to arrive. The company\u2019s drug pipeline is widely regarded as one of the best in the business, especially in oncology, but promise and hard success are not the same thing. AstraZeneca\u2019s share price is still well below the level at which Pfizer bid in 2014. The big bucks should come only when Soriot can show his strategic overhaul has delivered.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has reported its first quarterly profit since 2015, as its management hopes it has started to turn a corner after nine years of losses since its \u00a345bn bailout during the financial crisis. The bank, 73% owned by the taxpayer, reported a \u00a3259m profit in the first quarter of 2017. The last time it turned a quarterly profit was the third quarter of 2015. It warned that profits would be down in the next quarter, however, because of a slower start in its investment banking arm. Its shares rose 2% to 258p, but this remains well below the 502p price on which the taxpayer breaks even for bailing out the bank. The contrast with Lloyds Banking Group, also bailed out during the crisis, is stark. As RBS was announcing its results, it was disclosed that the taxpayer stake in Lloyds \u2013 which stood at 43% at its peak \u2013 had fallen to below 1%. The chancellor, Phillip Hammond, declared last week that the government has recouped the \u00a320.3bn that was ploughed into Lloyds and admitted the government would have to sell off the remaining RBS stake at a loss. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said there was no need for an apology. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of an apology; we just have to go back to when the government stepped in. The price that was paid was the price of the day. It was the right thing to do to save the bank,\u201d he said. He expects RBS to make a full-year profit in 2018 after incurring another loss this year, its 10th consecutive loss since the bailout. McEwan said: \u201cThis bank has a very strong core with great potential, and we believe that by going further on cost reduction and faster on digital transformation, we will deliver a simpler, safer and even more customer-focused bank, with a compelling investment case.\u201d He highlighted the fall in costs for misconduct, the increase in income in the core bank and a reduction in costs \u2013 which will fall by \u00a3750m this year \u2013 which helped generate an operating profit of \u00a31.3bn during the first three months of the year. Some 16,000 jobs have been cut in the past year \u2013 taking the total number of employes to 76,200 \u2013 and more branches will be shut on top of the 158 closures announced last month. Landmark offices in London have also been shut. The bank is being held back by potential multibillion-pound fines in the US over the mis-selling of residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis and the continuing uncertainty over the way it will appease the EU over the disposal of 300 branches - called Williams &amp; Glyn (W&amp;G) \u2013 which were mandated because of the bailout. \u201cSubject to dealing with RMBS and W&amp;G this year, we anticipate being profitable in 2018, and are on course to deliver our targets for 2020,\u201d said McEwan. The bank is preparing to go to court next month to defend a case being brought by shareholders over allegations they were misled during a fundraising in 2008. The investors are calling former chief executive Fred Goodwin to give evidence. While the bank\u2019s legal charges were \u00a354m during the quarter \u2013 up from a year ago \u2013they were lower than the \u00a34bn incurred in the last quarter of 2016. Even so, RBS still highlighted a number of legal matters including the Russian money-laundering scandal reported by the Guardian. \u201cAllegedly certain European banks, including RBS and 16 other UK-based financial institutions, and certain US banks, were involved in processing certain transactions associated with this scheme,\u201d RBS said, adding it was \u201cresponding to requests for information from\u201d regulators.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s plan to cap gas and electricity bills could put billions of investment in the UK at risk by creating huge uncertainty over government intentions, according to the body representing the big six energy suppliers. In one of the strongest warnings yet about the impact of the cap on standard variable tariffs pledged by the Conservatives, Energy UK protested against \u201cill-considered\u201d political intervention. \u201cFurther price regulation at this moment would create huge uncertainty around future government intentions, potentially putting at risk the billions in investment and jobs needed to renew our energy system,\u201d the group said in its statement for the election published on Friday. Lawrence Slade, Energy UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhat the industry overall needs is a period of certainty so we know what the policy objectives are, what the targets are, the framework is \u2013 so we can work together with the investment community to deliver the low-carbon economy that we need.\u201d Controlling prices would hurt competition and innovation, the group added. Ministers should instead \u201crespect\u201d an 18-month review of the energy market by the competition watchdog, which decided against a cap in favour of measures to encourage greater switching, Energy UK urged. The industry body represents British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, SSE, ScottishPower and dozens of smaller suppliers. Slade said: \u201cIll-considered or poorly constructed regulation risks removing the competitive impetus that has driven the huge benefits seen in the market we have today, including an increasing number of suppliers offering a range of innovative products.\u201d He urged ministers to reconsider the \u201cpotential unintended consequences\u201d before intervening in the market. An influential government energy adviser said that the big six\u2019s \u201chowls of outrage\u201d had gone too far but argued that a price cap was not the right solution. \u201cI really fear for some knee-jerk price cap,\u201d Dieter Helm, an Oxford University economist, told an audience in London on Thursday. He said he favoured a more transparent energy tariff that was fairer for consumers but unregulated. Energy UK said that whoever won in the general election on 8 June should also take a new tack on solving fuel poverty, which affected 2.3m households. Help for those who were fuel poor \u2013 defined as people whose income would be below the official poverty line after paying for electricity and gas \u2013 should be funded through general taxation rather than paid through energy bills, the body said. \u201cThe regressive nature of how the government has used the electricity bill to fund these programmes also needs to be reviewed, ending the system whereby the fuel poor pay to fund programmes to help the fuel poor,\u201d said Slade. The industry called for continued commitment to decarbonise Britain\u2019s energy supply and said it would seek clarity on the post-EU position on carbon pricing. The next cabinet should also launch a review of the capture and storage of carbon emissions for industry and commercial sectors, it said. MPs on Friday warned that the government\u2019s cancellation of a \u00a31bn carbon capture and storage (CCS) competition 18 months ago had left a big gap in UK plans to cut emissions. \u201cThe cancellation of the competition means there is now a significant gap in the [business] department\u2019s plans for achieving decarbonisation while ensuring energy security. Without CCS there is no viable way to achieve emissions reductions in the industrial sector in the near future,\u201d said MPs on the public accounts committee.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell received \u00a348m in remuneration last year as WPP, the marketing and advertising company he founded and runs, moved to curb the level of his future payouts to avoid further clashes with investors. Sorrell, who has been on the receiving end of a string of shareholder voting revolts at WPP\u2019s annual meetings in recent years, received total pay, bonuses and incentive scheme payouts of \u00a348.1m in 2016. The figure is 31.6% lower than the \u00a370.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, which was opposed by one-third of WPP shareholders at last year\u2019s AGM. The payout, the last to be awarded under WPP\u2019s controversial \u201cLeap\u201d scheme, means Sorrell has received about \u00a3210m in total remuneration since 2012. WPP has introduced a less generous arrangement for Sorrell, which is expected to pay out \u00a319m a year. It will be the subject of a binding vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting in June. However, WPP said on Friday that it intended to tighten the policy further with a potential payout band of \u00a314.9m to \u00a319.2m maximum this year. From 2018, that will fall to between \u00a318m and \u00a313m as dividend equivalent payments are scrapped. The company has moved to stem further potential run-ins with investors at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the Brexit vote and the warning from Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. WPP\u2019s chairman, Robert Quarta, appointed at last year\u2019s annual meeting, also said planning to identify the successor to Sorrell, 72, had intensified. \u201cOur succession planning process, which has always been rigorous, has become even more focused and detailed over the past year,\u201d said Quarta, in WPP\u2019s annual report published on Friday. \u201cWhether it happens in the near or distant future, when Sir Martin leaves his role as chief executive, we will have an exceptional team of potential candidates on the bench.\u201d Sorrell shows no signs of slowing down, having celebrated the birth of another child on the day of the US presidential election last year. He has no plans to step aside and said, on the question of succession, that there is \u201cnothing to see here\u201d. His pay has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012, during what became known as the shareholder spring, nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual package for the previous year. Last year, Sorrell defended his remuneration, arguing that he had put three decades of his life into turning WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a global marketing business worth \u00a322bn. \u201cI\u2019m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years \u2026 I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.\u201d The question of a successor has exercised investors in recent years, with Guy Jubb, the former head of governance at Standard Life Investments, using his final appearance at a WPP annual meeting in 2015 to criticise the apparent \u201cSorrellcentricity\u201d at the company. Quarta, writing in the annual report, said there is a list of internal and external candidates who could take over. \u201cAs part of our continuous assessment of those individuals who might one day become chief executive of the group, we have invited a number of leaders within WPP companies to present to the board and attend board meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis exercise gives me greater confidence than ever in the strength of our people and their potential to succeed at the very top. \u201cThis internal pool is, of course, maintained alongside a constantly refined list of external candidates.\u201d Quarta said internal candidates include those who report directly to Sorrell, as well as \u201cmany who currently occupy the senior tier below\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, has admitted he made a mistake in his repeated attempts to unmask a whistleblower but said he did not offer his resignation over the scandal. The American is under mounting pressure after a shareholder advisory service, ISS, advised investors to abstain from backing his re-election to the board at next month\u2019s annual general meeting because of the ongoing investigation by the City regulators into breaches of whistleblowing rules. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said I made a mistake. I was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague. I should have left the organisation to handle it,\u201d said Staley, who was forced to take questions on the matter as he presented the bank\u2019s first-quarter profits. Staley refused to provide any more details about the situation, which has stunned the City since the bank said two weeks ago that his bonus would be cut after he became too involved in the whistleblowing case. This related to the conduct of Tim Main, who worked with Staley at US bank JP Morgan and was then recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June. He had not offered to resign, Staley said, in the face the regulatory investigation into himself and the bank by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. Barclays also said it would be creating 2,000 technology jobs to \u201cdraw upon the talent pool\u201d in the UK. Half of those have already been filled, with the rest being hired in the coming three years. Staley attempted to focus on the bank\u2019s profits, which more than doubled to \u00a31.6bn. He said this was in part driven by a reduction in operations it is aiming to sell off or close down. The figures do not include a \u00a3884m accounting hit from the value of Barclays\u2019 stake in its African business, which is in the process of being sold down under Staley\u2019s plan to end its global ambitions and focus on the US and the UK. \u201cWe are now just two months away from completing the restructuring of Barclays as a transatlantic consumer, corporate and investment bank and there is further good reason in this quarter\u2019s performance to feel optimistic for our prospects,\u201d Staley said. But the City was unconvinced and the bank\u2019s shares were down by almost 5% \u2013 the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 in early trading on Friday. Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cIn fairness to Jes Staley, who will be hoping that these results refocus attention on the business rather than past misdemeanours, there are signs of progress in the numbers. The wind-down of the bad bank is approaching completion, cost control seems to be in hand, and the UK is showing resilience. \u201cHowever, there is disappointment too. Chief among them is the poor performance from the investment bank\u2019s markets division, which saw income fall 4% compared with 9% growth at Deutsche Bank and a 15% rise among the big five US banks.\u201d Tushar Morzaria, the Barclays finance director, warned that legal proceedings and investigations relating to past deeds were yet to be resolved. \u201cFor example, the UK Serious Fraud Office has stated that it intends to make a decision shortly in respect of matters relating to our capital raisings in 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cThis decision could impact on the timing and/or outcome of other actions related to these capital raisings.\u201d The bank has previously disclosed that the City regulator wants to fine it \u00a350m for reckless misconduct during the time of the cash calls which kept it out of the clutches of the government bailout programme of the time. Barclays is fighting this penalty which has been put on hold while the SFO investigation continues. Morzaria said he hoped the provisions for payment protection insurance would be sufficient, despite an increase in complaints since March. The Financial Conduct Authority has set a deadline for complaints on the UK\u2019s biggest mis-selling scandal \u2013 which has cost the industry more than \u00a335bn \u2013 of August 2019, which may encourage a further rush of claims.",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has suffered another shareholder revolt over executive pay, with two-fifths opposing a \u00a313m package for its chief executive. Nearly 39% of investors voted against the pharmaceutical group\u2019s 2016 remuneration report at its annual meeting in London, similar to the rebellion it faced three years ago. Support for the new pay policy was much stronger, with 96% of investors backing it. AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, received a total pay package of \u00a313.4m last year because a long-term incentive plan and other rewards paid out. He was paid an annual salary of \u00a31.2m and an annual bonus of \u00a31.2m, down from \u00a32m the previous year. But he pocketed a further \u00a36.9m from a long-term incentive plan, plus a one-off payment of \u00a33.6m in compensation for bonuses he lost when he left his previous employer. Royal London Asset Management, which holds 1% of AstraZeneca shares, said it voted against the remuneration report and the chair of the remuneration committee, but backed the new pay policy. After consulting its biggest shareholders, AstraZeneca said it had made changes to its long-term bonus plans to simplify them and make them fairer. It added that its remuneration committee would \u201ccontinue the dialogue with shareholders, as appropriate, regarding any concerns following its AGM\u201d. Two advisory groups, PIRC and Institutional Shareholder Services, had urged shareholders to vote against the remuneration report and policy. PIRC described the \u00a36.9m long-term incentive plan payment as \u201cexcessive\u201d. Britain\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker has faced several protest votes over executive pay in recent years. In the shareholder spring of 2012, the chief executive at the time, David Brennan, was ousted after a row over his \u00a39m package and the firm\u2019s underperformance. In 2014, 40% of shareholders failed to back its remuneration report. The housebuilding firm Persimmon suffered a near 10% protest vote over executive pay on Thursday, while Crest Nicholson has pushed ahead with plans to pay out controversial bonuses, even though more than 58% of shareholders rejected its remuneration report last month in a non-binding vote.",

      "bodyText": "A slew of large tech companies including Google parent Alphabet and Amazon have reported better than expected bumper profits, promising to boost the Nasdaq index to fresh highs. The tech-heavy index already pushed to a new record on Thursday of 6,048.94, a rise of 0.39%, thanks to strong results from PayPal and Comcast. But after-the-bell figures from the industry\u2019s giants looked set to take it even higher when trading resumes on Friday. With shares already buoyant on the hopes of huge corporate tax cuts by the Trump administration, the impressive earnings helped Wall Street brush aside any concerns about a possible US government shutdown amid continued congressional wrangling. \u201cMost folks were expecting a build in earnings acceleration and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. \u201cDespite all the economic and geopolitical noise, ultimately the market has been responding to improving earnings.\u201d The record-breaking run is likely to continue next week when the market will hear from Apple and Facebook. Alphabet\u2019s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29% to $5.43bn, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. \u201cFor a company of Google\u2019s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. \u201cThey are the dominant force in digital advertising.\u201d Shares of the company rose 2.8% to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99% of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, saw its shares rise to their highest ever level after it said net income rose 41% in the first quarter of the year. Retail and cloud-computing sales led the way, boosted by fees from its Prime shopping club and media streaming services, along with growing advertising revenue. Shares rose 3.9% to $954 in after-hours trading, adding nearly $3bn to the personal fortune of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos. His wealth is now estimated at $79bn, making him the world\u2019s third richest person ahead of Warren Buffett on $74bn, according to Bloomberg. Bezos is $8.3bn behind Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who is in top spot with a fortune put at $87.3bn. PayPal jumped $2.74, or 6.2 percent, to $47.15 after reporting stronger revenue and earnings than Wall Street had forecast while Comcast was boosted by stronger revenue at theme parks it acquired as part of its NBCUniversal purchase. Microsoft profits disappointed investors as sales of its Surface tablets and laptops slumped and earnings came in lower than expected. But income was still a healthy 28% up in the first three months of the year. Intel, the chipmaker, saw profits rise by 45% to $2.9bn.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to launch an online grocery shopping service this autumn as it looks to cash in on the success of its food halls. The retailer confirmed that a team of executives was currently drawing up a battle plan ahead of trials this autumn, allowing M&amp;S customers to order food online and have it delivered to their home. While Britons may have fallen out of love with the M&amp;S clothing ranges in recent years they have been heading in droves to its food aisles as they opt to pick up food for an evening meal rather than do a big weekly shop. Until now selling food online has not made business sense for M&amp;S as its customers do not typically spend enough on groceries on each visit to make the service profitable. But the retailer has concluded it can no longer ignore what is the fastest growing section of the UK\u2019s \u00a3180bn grocery market as new delivery services, such as AmazonFresh, which allows shoppers to order groceries at lunchtime and get the delivery in time for dinner, revolutionise the way Britain buys food. Senior executives were informed of the plan at a meeting at Wembley, north-west London, on Wednesday. \u201cWe continue to review food online carefully,\u201d said Steve Rowe, chief executive of M&amp;S. \u201cIt has not cost us anything over the last five years by not being online with food. Our customers haven\u2019t moved yet, but they will and we need to ensure that we are ready with the right response. There are unanswered questions over what this means for M&amp;S and we have a team looking at this now with a view to undertaking a soft trial in the autumn.\u201d M&amp;S already sells a limited selection of party food and alcohol on its website but this would be the first time its wider grocery offer would be made available online. The high-street store is different from other food retailers as it stocks just 7,000 products compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops. It also focuses on exclusive own-brand products with only a limited number of household brands available in its stores. It is not clear how the retailer would overcome these hurdles if it were to offer customers a full grocery outlet. \u201cThe economics of food online are not straightforward and it is not something that we are going to rush into until we have substantial customer insight and a better understanding of what is right for M&amp;S and right for our customers,\u201d Rowe added. Tony Shiret, an independent retail analyst, said Rowe was finally \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d. Shiret added: \u201cIf they don\u2019t do food online they stand to lose market share to people who do. It\u2019s become a basic expectation from customers.\u201d However, the analyst said the retailer would face a big challenge trying to make the service profitable. \u201cIt is going to be tricky for them because their shopping baskets are small as people use their stores to buy bits and pieces.\u201d Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at the M&amp;S Croydon store in south London, and took over as chief executive last April, is seeking to revive the declining profits of the 132-year-old retailer. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm which under his predecessor, Marc Bolland, relied on heavy discounting to attract shoppers. Rowe is also keen to exploit the success of its food arm. Last year Rowe announced plans to shut 30 UK stores and convert 45 more into food-only shops as part of a business overhaul that would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to clothing and face the challenge posed by online shopping. M&amp;S confirmed the location of six of the affected stores, which included four large \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homeware and food. They are in Portsmouth, Hampshire, in Slough, Berkshire, Warrington in Cheshire, and Wokingham, Surrey. The retailer also unveiled plans to open another 34 food shops in the next six months.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rising inflation is taking its toll on British households, knocking consumer confidence to its lowest level since the aftermath of last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. Pollsters YouGov said worries about job security and living costs pushed its monthly measure of consumer mood down a further 1.5 points to 108 in April, the weakest reading since last July. The score above 100 still shows that more people are confident than not, bringing some solace for Theresa May\u2019s government as it banks on a solid victory in the snap election on 8 June. But the consumer confidence measure is well below the levels seen before June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The poll also underscored the squeeze on living standards as inflation starts to rise faster than pay. It found Britons were at their gloomiest in more than three years about their own financial outlook. \u201cMany analysts have said for a while that inflation would bite and these figures show that it has started to \u2013 and is likely to get worse over the coming year,\u201d said Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov reports. The downbeat tone of the poll chimes with signs the economy has lost momentum in recent months as the post-referendum resilience in consumer spending wanes. Official figures on Friday morning are expected to show UK economic growth slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year. Much of the pressure on households stems from higher inflation, which has picked up to its highest level in more than three years on the back of higher oil prices and because of the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote. A weaker currency makes imports to the UK such as food and fuel more expensive. Wage growth has fallen behind inflation, leaving people worse off in real terms and denting consumer spending, a key driver of the UK economy. YouGov bases its consumer confidence survey on 6,000 interviews a month, asking about household finances, property prices, job security and business activity, over the past 30 days and looking ahead to the next 12 months. Six of its eight measures fell in April. There was a small increase in homeowners\u2019 expectations for property prices over the coming year and people were more upbeat about the level of business activity in their workplace over the past month. However, confidence about job security over the last month dropped to the lowest level since April 2013. Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, which co-compiles the consumer confidence report, said the gloom around personal finances did not bode well for the UK economy. \u201cConsumer confidence has been on the cusp of a decline for a while and it has now tipped over and fallen,\u201d said Skero, head of macroeconomics at the consultancy. \u201cParticularly worrying is the fall in both the forward and backward-looking household finances as it is clear that people are starting to feel the pinch and expect things to get worse. If they start to really rein in spending, the knock-on effect on the economy could be notable.\u201d A separate measure of consumer confidence from the market research firm GfK also slipped in April, dropping one point to -7, the lowest since December. That report suggested people were more gloomy about their own finances and the UK economy, but more confident that now was a good time to make big purchases such as furniture. GfK spokesman Joe Staton said that while there was a dip compared with March, confidence was still \u201csurprisingly stable\u201d and had not suffered the sharp drop some commentators had suggested could follow the triggering of article 50. \u201cConsumers continue to remain positive about the state of their personal finances and even report that now is a good time to buy,\u201d Staton said. \u201cBut is this too good to be true? Is this simply the calm before the storm? Is pre-Brexit economic turbulence yet to really batter households? That threat cannot be ruled out.\u201d",

A weaker currency makes imports to the UK such as food and fuel more expensive.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/12/living-standards-fall-first-time-since-2014-uk-inflation-pay-growth\">Wage growth has fallen behind inflation</a>, leaving people worse off in real terms and denting consumer spending, a key driver of the UK economy.</p> <p>YouGov bases its consumer confidence survey on 6,000 interviews a month, asking about household finances, property prices, job security and business activity, over the past 30 days and looking ahead to the next 12 months. Six of its eight measures fell in April.<br></p> <p>There was a small increase in homeowners\u2019 expectations for property prices over the coming year and people were more upbeat about the level of business activity in their workplace over the past month.</p> <p>However, confidence about job security over the last month dropped to the lowest level since April 2013.<br></p> <p>Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, which co-compiles the consumer confidence report, said the gloom around personal finances did not bode well for the UK economy.<br></p> <p>\u201cConsumer confidence has been on the cusp of a decline for a while and it has now tipped over and fallen,\u201d said Skero, head of macroeconomics at the consultancy.</p> <p>\u201cParticularly worrying is the fall in both the forward and backward-looking household finances as it is clear that people are starting to feel the pinch and expect things to get worse. If they start to really rein in spending, the knock-on effect on the economy could be notable.\u201d<br></p> <p>A separate measure of consumer confidence from the market research firm GfK also slipped in April, dropping one point to -7, the lowest since December. That report suggested people were more gloomy about their own finances and the UK economy, but more confident that now was a good time to make big purchases such as furniture.</p> <p>GfK spokesman Joe Staton said that while there was a dip compared with March, confidence was still \u201csurprisingly stable\u201d and had not suffered the sharp drop some commentators had suggested could follow the triggering of article 50.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers continue to remain positive about the state of their personal finances and even report that now is a good time to buy,\u201d Staton said. \u201cBut is this too good to be true? Is this simply the calm before the storm? Is pre-Brexit economic turbulence yet to really batter households? That threat cannot be ruled out.\u201d</p>",
