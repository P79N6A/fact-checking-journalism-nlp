Tax treaties between Zambia and some of those countries mean the state's revenue authorities are unable to charge their normal tax on money leaving their shores. The revelations are contained in a report published by ActionAid, which exposes how Zambia Sugar has kept its contribution to the state's exchequer so low, although the company says that globally it actually pays a higher rate of tax on its profits than it otherwise would due to its corporate structure. It is estimated that the tax haven transactions of this one British headquartered multinational deprived Zambia of a sum 14 times larger than the UK aid provided to the country to combat hunger and food insecurity. ActionAid's findings will heap more pressure on the chancellor, George Osborne, to make progress in closing gaps in international tax standards and tackling avoidance at the G20 meeting of world leaders this week and the G8 in June. The total loss to tax avoidance by multinationals in the developing world is estimated to be around \u00a370bn a year, enough to save the lives of 85,000 children under the age of five in the world's poorest countries every 12 months, campaigners say. The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, who will visit Africa this week, said on Thursday that tackling those \"gaming the system, seeking to play us all for fools\" will be a priority for the UK government when it chairs the G8.

Antony Jenkins, who took over as Barclays boss when Bob Diamond was forced out as a result of the Libor-rigging scandal, will announce on Tuesday that the tax planning part of the structured capital markets (SCM) division \u2013 which has been accused of orchestrating tax avoidance on an \"industrial scale\" and has generated vast profits for the bank \u2013 is to be axed. The tax planning operation is one of several areas that have put been under review by Jenkins to assess if the bank's businesses are ethical and not just profitable. While Barclays will continue to offer straightforward tax planning to customers, it will pledge to no longer devise schemes purely intended for this purpose. Barclays is also facing calls to restrict bonuses following the \u00a3290m Libor rigging fine; a \u00a31bn bill for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance; and a potential multi-million pound fine for mis-selling interest rate swaps to small businesses. The Financial Services Authority and the Serious Fraud Office are also investigating the way the bank staved off a taxpayer bailout in 2008 by raising funds in the Middle East. However, employees were told about the size of their bonuses on Friday, and when the bank publishes its 2012 results on Tuesday, it is expected to reveal that it paid out up to \u00a32bn in bonuses. The existence of SCM has long been controversial, including rumoured \u00a340m pay deals for former bosses, and reports from insiders about tough management styles and odd rituals. Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor, and Labour peer Lord McFall have repeatedly raised the existence of the division when Barclays witnesses have appeared before the Banking Standards Commission, set up after the Libor scandal in June. McFall has cited reports from insiders \u2013 disputed by the bank \u2013 that the division had generated 110% of the bank's profits. When Jenkins appeared before the commission last week, Lawson accused the bank of engaging in \"industrial scale\" tax avoidance that while legal was unethical. Jenkins had indicated that a restructuring of the operation was likely and when he unveils his strategy for the bank he will insist that the tax operations will close. His plan is expected to fall short of a break-up of the bank, but is likely to involve 2,000 job cuts. Jenkins will admit that some parts of the business were engaging solely in devising tax schemes. \"There are some areas that relied on sophisticated and complex structures, where transactions were carried out with the primary objective of accessing the tax benefits,\" he will say. \"We will not engage in it again,\" he will say, because it is \"incompatible\" with a new commitment to pay tax.

      "bodyText": "More British ready meals are expected to be found to contain horsemeat over the next few weeks, the environment secretary has warned. The warning by Owen Paterson came after he held an emergency summit with bosses from leading supermarkets and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to tackle the scandal of horse in beef products. Food businesses have been told to send initial test results on all their products to the FSA by Friday. \"There may well be more bad results coming through, that's the point of doing this random analysis,\" he said. The minister said the scandal was either due to \"gross incompetence\" or an international criminal \"conspiracy\". \"If there's a criminal act we will work with the authorities wherever they are to ensure the appropriate measures are taken,\" he said. \"It's a straight fraud. If a product says it's beef and you're actually buying horse, that is a fraud. It is in the interests of everyone to get this resolved as rapidly as possible. \"This is a conspiracy against the public.\" Paterson said that retailers held the \"ultimate responsibility\" for ensuring there was no horsemeat in their products. Retailers would have to start doing their own testing, he said, noting that the supermarkets had agreed to work with the FSA to report their test results every three months. \"Ultimate responsibility for the integrity of what is sold on their label has to lie with the retailer,\" he said. Representatives from Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and other groups attended the meeting at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London. Paterson said the supermarkets had agreed that consumers should be compensated if they have bought withdrawn products, with no questions asked. Asked if there were any plans to test for traces of other meats, such as dog, in ready meals, the minister said: \"It may be very isolated, it might be a small number of suppliers involved in the horse trade. We don't know, but I think that as we progress, and we'll know more over the course of the next few weeks, we can decide what to do next.\" Questioned about whether he would be prepared to eat meat bought from a supermarket, he said: \"I would be very happy to eat any products on sale in British supermarkets this morning, but I would not recommend anyone to eat a product which has been withdrawn.\" The Labour MP Tom Watson published a letter on his website which he claimed was sent by Findus to retailers on Monday, warning that a French-based supplier had told it there may be problems with raw materials delivered since 1 August last year. In it, the firm claimed raw materials delivered to a French contractor since 1 August were \"likely to be non-conform and consequently the labelling on finished products is incorrect\". The letter added: \"The supplier has asked us to withdraw the raw material batches.\" But Findus has denied reports that the company first knew there was horsemeat in its products last year. \"Findus want to be absolutely explicit that they were not aware of any issue of contamination with horsemeat last year,\" it said in a statement. \"They were only made aware of a possible August 2012 date through a letter dated 2 February 2013 from the supplier Comigel. By then Findus was already conducting a full supply chain traceability review and had pro-actively initiated DNA testing.\" The Metropolitan police said officers had met the FSA over the scandal, although there is currently no official police investigation. Aldi said it felt \"angry and let down\" by its French supplier Comigel after tests on Today's Special frozen beef lasagne and Today's Special frozen spaghetti bolognese found they contained between 30% and 100% horsemeat. The company added that it would test the meals for the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, often referred to as bute, but said it was confident the meals were safe. Comigel, which also produced the contaminated Findus beef lasagnes, has blamed its suppliers. Erick Lehagre said he believed his company was buying French beef from a company called Spanghero but it had since told him it had come from Romania. The Trading Standards Institute has said the discovery of such high levels of horse meat suggests \"deliberate fraudulent activity\". Hospitals and education authorities were also checking the food they provide for traces of horsemeat. The FSA advised consumers who had bought affected beef lines from Findus not to eat them. They had not been tested for the presence of phenylbutazone, which is banned in the human food chain. It can cause a serious blood disorder in rare cases. The Guardian has also established that the FSA has been unable to trace all the horses slaughtered in the UK that tested positive for bute last year. The agency has routinely been testing less than 1% of slaughtered horses for the drug, but found four positives in a sample of 82 carcasses in 2012.
