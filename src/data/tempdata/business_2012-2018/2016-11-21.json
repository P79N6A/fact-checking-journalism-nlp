      "bodyText": "Stock markets hit record highs on Monday as traders continued to bet on a Trump-backed boom for business. Rising oil prices drove gains in the energy sector, where the president-elect has promised to roll back regulations, and the S&amp;P energy index gained 2.2% and closed at its highest levels in 16 months. At the close of the New York stock exchange (NYSE), the Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.76 points, or 0.47%, to 18,956.69, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.28 points, or 0.75%, to 2,198.18 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.35 points, or 0.89%, to 5,368.86. The levels marked a record close for each of the three major Wall Street indexes, but market participants cautioned that trading volume was likely to be light this week ahead of the US Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday. Brent crude oil settled up 4.4% at $48.90 and US crude settled 3.9% higher at $47.49 after touching their highest levels in about three weeks as the dollar weakened. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said he believed there was \u201ca strong likelihood\u201d that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) would agree to cap production later this month. European equity markets also moved higher as a jump in oil prices helped spur energy gains. \u201cThe post-election rally is continuing,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice-president at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. \u201cThere was some concern that rates might rise too far, but it looks like they may have slowed down a little bit.\u201d The Fed chair, Janet Yellen, said an interest rate hike could be \u201cappropriate relatively soon\u201d on Thursday, citing \u201cexcessive risk-taking\u201d as a danger were rates to remain low. The dollar was down 0.3% to 100.89 against a basket of major currencies, pausing after a 10-day streak in which it gained nearly 5%. That rally was fueled by expectations of policies by President-elect Donald Trump that would lead to interest rate increases.",

      "bodyText": "Train companies will only have to provide slow free Wi-Fi for customers despite a government pledge to introduce \u201cfast, cheap internet connections\u201d across the rail network. Before the general election, the government announced that all train operators bidding on future franchises and direct contracts in England and Wales would have to include free Wi-Fi as part of their pitches. The Department for Transport (DfT) even found almost \u00a350m of funding for several operators, including Southeastern and Arriva Trains Wales, to make sure free Wi-Fi could be introduced on some lines by 2017. However, Matt Hancock, the digital policy minister, revealed in a parliamentary debate that the minimum speed required on those bids was 1 megabit per second (Mbps) per passenger, \u201cwhich allows for basic web browsing, basic email and social media activity\u201d. This speed means a video would take hours to download and even just opening an email with an attachment would be a lengthy process. This is about a decade out of date for business travellers, even though the government wanted free Wi-Fi to enable commuters \u201cto keep up with work\u201d. Hancock said this minimum requirement would be increased by 25% a year and franchise bidders were already exceeding this threshold. For example, Abellio will provide up to 100 Mbps per passenger by 2019 on the East Anglia franchise. But a senior rail executive told the Guardian train operators could not be relied upon to guarantee fast broadband given their track records. He said: \u201cWi-Fi on trains is becoming an essential requirement for any business person travelling, but train companies in this country have been a bit slow on getting on board with better Wi-Fi.\u201d David Sidebottom, the passenger director at the watchdog Transport Focus, said: \u201cWi-Fi speed and connectivity can be patchy. Some operators charge for connections while on-board, while several do not offer any Wi-Fi at all. \u201cWe know that passengers now expect reliable, free access to Wi-Fi on trains \u2013 it was in their top 10 priorities for improvement \u2013 so we urge future franchises to ensure they have the capability to deliver this.\u201d Louise Haigh, Labour\u2019s digital economy spokeswoman, has pushed the government to commit to fast rail broadband through legislation. She is considering an amendment to the digital economy bill, which will return to the floor of the Commons next week. Haigh said: \u201cProviding good, free Wi-Fi on public transport is not just a better service for passengers but improves productivity and supports business as well. \u201cA third of the major rail franchises still do not provide free Wi-Fi, and the standard specification is only 1 Mbps per passenger, which will be very slow, even for some basic activity such as downloading an email with an attachment. \u201cGiven the huge profits made by the private train companies, the government should be pushing them to go further, faster.\u201d Haigh is also preparing an amendment to the bus services bill, which would force bus operators to provide free Wi-Fi. \u201cWhat goes for trains should go for the rest of our public transport network too,\u201d she said. A DfT spokesman said: \u201cWe are investing record amounts in our railways to improve journeys and expect that 90% of all trains will have access to Wi-Fi by the end of 2018, with virtually 100% by 2020.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the City\u2019s most influential and highest-paid bankers, Michael Sherwood, is leaving Goldman Sachs after a 30-year career, including becoming embroiled in controversy over the collapsed retailer BHS. Sherwood, a Londoner who joined Goldman after graduating from Manchester University, plans to focus on charitable activities when he leaves the US bank in about six months. A former bond trader who was paid $21m (\u00a316.8m) last year, Sherwood usually keeps a low public profile. But this year he appeared before MPs investigating the collapse of BHS, which put 11,000 jobs at risk and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. It was a public appearance that Goldman bankers would usually prefer to avoid. The bank is proud of its work behind the scenes in securing deals and offering advice to governments and big businesses. But Goldman was forced to talk about its relationship with Sir Philip Green when he was selling BHS. Green said he was \u201c1,000,000%\u201d would not have sold the department store chain to Dominic Chappell had the buyer not passed an informal vetting by the bank. Sherwood denied there had been \u201csniff test\u201d but also had to apologise to MPs for not disclosing that Goldman been approached by Green about a \u00a340m loan to BHS when it was bought by Chappell, a serial bankrupt. The MPs concluded: \u201cGoldman Sachs should have been either \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018out\u2019 of the deal, and demonstrably so. As it was, they had authority without accountability.\u201d Sherwood \u2013 known as \u201cWoody\u201d \u2013 told the Financial Times that his unexpected departure was not connected to BHS. He was regarded as candidate to replace Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman, whom Sherwood said had spent \u201cmost of his time trying to persuade me to stay\u201d. The discussions to leave had started before the BHS blow-up, he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have anything out there before I left. On Philip Green, I wish we hadn\u2019t been involved and I certainly don\u2019t think we did anything wrong,\u201d Sherwood told the FT. \u201cIt is one blip in a 30-year career and it really played no part in my decision.\u201d The 51-year-old was co-head of Goldman\u2019s European business, which employs 6,000 people and is grappling with the uncertainty caused by the vote for Brexit. Construction of a new head office in London \u2013 a stone\u2019s throw from its existing headquarters on the edge of the financial district \u2013 is already underway. His co-head, Richard Gnodde, will become chief executive of the European operations. Sherwood told the FT: \u201cAs you know, we were very much in the remain camp \u2026 We will readjust, we will have to do what we want. I hope it will be favourable to the UK and we are able to keep a lot of people here.\u201d He achieved the coveted status of partner while he was still in 20s and he told the FT: \u201cI stopped working for money a long time ago \u2026 when we went public.\u201d Goldman floated in 1999, putting value on its partners\u2019 stakes in the business for the first time. His stake is worth more than $70m. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Goldman Sachs addict and it\u2019s very hard to come off an addiction,\u201d he added. In a statement to the bank\u2019s 36,800 staff, the two most senior executives at Goldmn paid tribute to Sherwood. Blankfeinand Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer, said: \u201cPlease join us in thanking Michael, or Woody, as everyone calls him, for his commitment and extraordinary service to the firm, our clients and our people. We wish him, his wife Melanie and their family all the best in the years ahead.\u201d His immediate plan is said to be to focus on charities, including Greenhouse Sports, which helps children in cities access sport. Goldman has a long history of filling government and policy roles. Notable alumni include Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England; Hank Paulson, the former US treasury secretary; Lord O\u2019Neill, who drove the Conservative government\u2019s northern powerhouse policy; and Lord Paul Deighton, who was a Treasury minister for George Osborne. Politicians are also attracted to Goldman. Theresa May warned a private meeting of Goldman bankers about the dangers of Brexit a month before the referendum and before she became prime minister. An audio recording of the warning by May \u2013 who was then home secretary \u2013 was leaked to the Guardian.",

      "bodyText": "The government has scrapped controversial plans to force councils in England to raise rents for social housing tenants on higher incomes. The \u201cpay to stay\u201d policy, which was announced by George Osborne last year, would have seen households paying higher rents from next April if they earned above a set threshold. The housing minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had reviewed the policy and decided that it did not meet the aim of supporting working class families and saving money for the taxpayer. As a result, it would no longer be mandatory for councils to introduce it. In London, the policy was to apply to all households earning more than \u00a340,000, while outside the capital the threshold was \u00a331,000. An earlier change of heart before the EU referendum meant that tenants were facing a tapered increase, rather than paying a market rent as soon as they went over the threshold. However, councils had criticised the policy, saying that it would be costly to implement and lock thousands of working families out of social housing. The Local Government Association warned that 70,000 households would face rent increases as a result of the plans, while recently Hackney Council warned that families would get very little notice of the changes. Barwell said that the government had been reviewing the plans since the summer. \u201cWe have listened carefully to the views of tenants, local authorities and others and as a result, we have decided not to proceed with a compulsory approach. Local authorities and housing associations will continue to have local discretion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe government remains committed to delivering its objective of ensuring social housing is occupied by those who need it most. But we need to do so in a way that supports those ordinary working class families who can struggle to get by, and in a way which delivers real savings to the taxpayer.\u201d Barwell said the policy \u201cas previously envisaged did not meet those aims\u201d. The housing minister confirmed the government would go ahead with plans to offer only fixed-term tenancies to new tenants in council housing, and said the government would expect households\u2019 financial circumstances to be taken into account when tenancies were reviewed. \u201cExcept in exceptional circumstances, tenancies should be targeted on those on lower incomes. We will also consider whether other options exist to ensure that high income tenants in social housing make a greater contribution to costs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Two US banks \u2013 Citi and JP Morgan \u2013 have been designated as potentially posing the greatest risks to the global financial system in an annual ranking by regulators. Citi has replaced HSBC and joined JP Morgan in the highest ranking issued by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international alliance of central bankers, policy makers and regulators that sorts 30 major banks into five categories. The more systemically important the bank, the more capital it must hold to absorb losses during time of crisis. No bank has ever been placed in the highest, fifth category \u2013 which adds 3.5 percentage points to a bank\u2019s capital requirement \u2013 since the FSB rankings were introduced five years. Citi and JP Morgan are in the fourth category. HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, has been moved out of the fourth category for the first time to the third, reducing the top up to its capital by half a percentage point to 2%. Barclays has also had its status cut by one category, from the third to the less risky second bracket. Citi is among three US banks which have been pushed up the rankings: the other two are Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The rising importance of Chinese banks is also illustrated as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has moved up one ranking. Tomas Kinmonth, a fixed income strategist at ABN Amro, said the changes reflected the revised business models of some of the banks. \u201cThe European and UK banks are both retrenching and are trying to return to their core businesses. Thus the lowering of Barclays within the ranking comes partly as the bank moves to focus just on the American and European markets,\u201d said Kinmonth. \u201cCounterintuitively, a decrease in the systematic importance of the banks can actually be a positive for the institution. The bank can be expected to have less equity set aside, and can in theory allow them to return more proceeds to existing shareholders,\u201d he said. HSBC has also been scaling back its global presence \u2013 it recently sold its operations in Brazil \u2013 and also reducing its exposure to risky loans. Deutsche Bank, which was described by the International Monetary Fund as the world\u2019s riskiest bank, remained in the third category \u2013 where HSBC, Bank of America and French bank BNP Paribas also reside \u2013 requiring it to top up its capital by two percentage points. Deutsche was in the fourth category in 2012. The FSB is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Its role is to act a body coordinating policy towards the financial services sector around the world and monitor and assess vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system. It is playing a key role in trying to end the \u201ctoo big too fail\u201d problem that was highlighted by the 2008 banking crisis. Assessing the so-called globally systemic banks \u2013 known as \u201cG-Sibs\u201d \u2013 is part of its role. The banks are unlikely to need to raise more capital as many of them ready hold enough to appease regulatory demands. A list of the globally systemic insurers was also published, which includes Prudential and Aviva.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Technology was flagged as one of the British industries that would suffer most in the wake of a Brexit vote, with almost nine out of 10 London-based tech professionals opposing an EU exit. Several months after the referendum, however, and the sector has received a significant boost. Instead of a talent and investment flight, the capital\u2019s status as a global tech hub has been confirmed with statements over the past week from a pair of big beasts: Google and Facebook. Google confirmed that its enormous \u201clandscraper\u201d London HQ, first mooted in 2013, would be going ahead despite the vote. The company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, admitted to having reservations after the referendum verdict, but would not be dissuaded from establishing a new campus in King\u2019s Cross that will house up to 7,000 employees. Facebook followed on Sunday by announcing its own UK expansion. The social network will hire another 500 employees in the UK, boosting its British headcount by 50%, as it prepares to open new London officesin 2017. The news has been welcomed as proof that Britain can continue to compete globally in the tech industry even if it leaves the EU. Gerard Grech, the chief executive of industry body Tech City UK, said that the moves \u201care a huge endorsement of the country\u2019s attractiveness to tech companies\u201d. He acknowledged that other European cities, led by Berlin and Paris, will attempt to lure firms away from London by raising the spectre of post-Brexit instability, adding: \u201cLondon remains the digital capital of Europe but we know that we face friendly rivalry from other European cities over the next two years. International competitiveness raises the game for the whole of Europe as we want to see more European tech companies.\u201d But Russ Shaw, the head of lobby group Tech London Advocates, warns that the UK ambitions of Facebook and Google could bring dire Brexit warnings to life by creating an industry-wide skills shortage. Under this scenario, Facebook and Google will hoover up the best tech talent as they expand their UK bases and the competition for personnel will be intensified if immigration curbs are imposed in a post-Brexit UK at the same time. \u201cThe post-Brexit issue around talent has still not gone away,\u201d said Shaw. If the UK leaves the EU without retaining freedom of movement, tech companies have warned that they could struggle to fill key engineering roles. \u201cPerhaps the irony of all of these good news stories is that it will put even more pressure on the talent issue,\u201d Shaw adds. For overseas companies looking to expand, particularly those that already have a European headquarters, the UK remains attractive, according to Suranga Chandratillake, a general partner of venture capital firm Balderton. But that sentiment could turn. \u201cThe good news from Brexit is the pound is weak and so traditionally expensive UK employees are looking cheaper,\u201d said Chandratillake. \u201cLonger term confusion remains, however, on immigration policy and its societal impact. All of our companies employ highly diverse, critical employees from around the world. If it becomes difficult for them to live here in the future, whether legally or because they feel they are unwanted, the cheap pound won\u2019t help.\u201d Shaw warns that an atmosphere of uncertainty around the government\u2019s negotiation stance with Brussels has not helped inward investment to the UK, despite Theresa May\u2019s insistence that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. He added: \u201cI have heard that some investors have been holding back until there is clarity around what \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019 means.\u201d But recent events in other countries have left Britain looking like a comparatively safe investment opportunity. Speaking as Google confirmed the new London campus last week, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the capital welcomed all comers \u2013 and unlike Canada, which was inundated with migration queries following the election of Donald Trump, \u201cour website is not going to crash\u201d. Khan told the Guardian that Google\u2019s commitment was \u201can example of people still having confidence in London\u201d. When asked directly whether Trump\u2019s election would help attract talent to the capital, he demurred. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a special relationship with the US, we\u2019ve had presidents in the past who have been very familiar with the prime minister, we\u2019ll wait and see about the relationship between the president elect and Theresa May. \u201cThe key thing is, American businesses have great relationships with British businesses, and Americans have great relationships with Brits. Google making a big announcement in London, I think, bodes well.\u201d Facebook\u2019s London office is the company\u2019s largest engineering base outside the US, and houses the team behind Workplace, a product that lets businesses build their own internal Facebooks for employee communication. Intended to compete with Silicon Valley darling Slack, it\u2019s one of the first Facebook products that charges users directly: fees start at $1 per employee. Google\u2019s campus won\u2019t be the largest, but it will contain the first Google owned and designed building outside America. It will also host one of the UK\u2019s biggest tech successes of recent years, DeepMind: Google\u2019s world-leading AI research outfit. Co-founded by three Brits, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind was bought by Google for \u00a3400m in 2014. The fear among tech professionals is that a post-Brexit Britain will frighten away the skills and the money needed to ensure that more companies such as DeepMind emerge. For now, however, Google and Facebook are indicating that this will not be the case.",

Instead of a talent and investment flight, the capital\u2019s status as a global tech hub has been confirmed with statements over the past week from a pair of big beasts: Google and Facebook.</p> <p>Google confirmed that its enormous \u201clandscraper\u201d London HQ, first mooted in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/15/google-commits-to-massive-new-london-hq\">would be going ahead despite the vote</a>. The company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, admitted to having reservations after the referendum verdict, but would not be dissuaded from establishing a new campus in King\u2019s Cross that will house up to 7,000 employees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/facebook-hire-500-uk-workers-opens-london-hq-fitzrvovia\">Facebook will hire extra  500 UK workers for new central London HQ</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Facebook followed on Sunday by announcing its own UK expansion. The social network will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/facebook-hire-500-uk-workers-opens-london-hq-fitzrvovia\">hire another 500 employees in the UK</a>, boosting its British headcount by 50%, as it prepares to open new London officesin 2017.</p> <p>The news has been welcomed as proof that Britain can continue to compete globally in the tech industry even if it leaves the EU. Gerard Grech, the chief executive of industry body Tech City UK, said that the moves \u201care a huge endorsement of the country\u2019s attractiveness to tech companies\u201d.</p> <p>He acknowledged that other European cities, led by Berlin and Paris, will attempt to lure firms away from London by raising the spectre of post-Brexit instability, adding: \u201cLondon remains the digital capital of Europe but we know that we face friendly rivalry from other European cities over the next two years. International competitiveness raises the game for the whole of Europe as we want to see more European tech companies.\u201d</p> <p>But Russ Shaw, the head of lobby group Tech London Advocates, warns that the UK ambitions of Facebook and Google could bring dire Brexit warnings to life by creating an industry-wide skills shortage. Under this scenario, Facebook and Google will hoover up the best tech talent as they expand their UK bases and the competition for personnel will be intensified if immigration curbs are imposed in a post-Brexit UK at the same time. </p> <p>\u201cThe post-Brexit issue around talent has still not gone away,\u201d said Shaw. If the UK leaves the EU without retaining freedom of movement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/07/brexit-already-hurt-tech-but-next-step-could-be-worse\">tech companies have warned that they could struggle to fill key engineering roles</a>. \u201cPerhaps the irony of all of these good news stories is that it will put even more pressure on the talent issue,\u201d Shaw adds.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73fc423db320d6317a3f8c91372ef7b0204b77d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73fc423db320d6317a3f8c91372ef7b0204b77d8/0_169_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s new HQ will be in close proximity to its existing site in Kings Cross, creating a \u2018London campus\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For overseas companies looking to expand, particularly those that already have a European headquarters, the UK remains attractive, according to Suranga Chandratillake, a general partner of venture capital firm Balderton. But that sentiment could turn. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe good news from Brexit is the pound is weak and so traditionally expensive UK employees are looking cheaper,\u201d said Chandratillake. \u201cLonger term confusion remains, however, on immigration policy and its societal impact. All of our companies employ highly diverse, critical employees from around the world. If it becomes difficult for them to live here in the future, whether legally or because they feel they are unwanted, the cheap pound won\u2019t help.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw warns that an atmosphere of uncertainty around the government\u2019s negotiation stance with Brussels has not helped inward investment to the UK, despite Theresa May\u2019s insistence that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. He added: \u201cI have heard that some investors have been holding back until there is clarity around what \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019 means.\u201d<br></p> <p>But recent events in other countries have left Britain looking like a comparatively safe investment opportunity. Speaking as Google confirmed the new London campus last week, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the capital welcomed all comers \u2013 and unlike Canada, which was inundated with migration queries following the election of Donald Trump, \u201cour website is not going to crash\u201d.</p> <p>Khan told the Guardian that Google\u2019s commitment was \u201can example of people still having confidence in London\u201d. When asked directly whether Trump\u2019s election would help attract talent to the capital, he demurred. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a special relationship with the US, we\u2019ve had presidents in the past who have been very familiar with the prime minister, we\u2019ll wait and see about the relationship between the president elect and Theresa May. </p> <p>\u201cThe key thing is, American businesses have great relationships with British businesses, and Americans have great relationships with Brits. Google making a big announcement in London, I think, bodes well.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s London office is the company\u2019s largest engineering base outside the US, and houses the team behind Workplace, a product that lets businesses build their own internal Facebooks for employee communication. Intended to compete with Silicon Valley darling Slack, it\u2019s one of the first Facebook products that charges users directly: fees start at $1 per employee.</p> <p>Google\u2019s campus won\u2019t be the largest, but it will contain the first Google owned and designed building outside America. It will also host one of the UK\u2019s biggest tech successes of recent years, DeepMind: Google\u2019s world-leading AI research outfit. Co-founded by three Brits, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind\">bought by Google for \u00a3400m in 2014</a>.</p> <p>The fear among tech professionals is that a post-Brexit Britain will frighten away the skills and the money needed to ensure that more companies such as DeepMind emerge. For now, however, Google and Facebook are indicating that this will not be the case. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hofmeister is back. But not in a form recognisable to anyone old enough to remember the lager brand\u2019s laddish 1980s TV commercials, in which a pork pie hat-wearing mascot urged drinkers to \u201cfollow the bear\u201d. Only the name and bear logo remain, as Hofmeister swaps draft and cans for bottles and relaunches aiming to compete in the \u201cpremium\u201d lager market against rival brands such as Peroni, Budvar and Estrella. Richard Longhurst and Spencer Chambers, the drinks industry veterans behind the Hofmeister revival, are hoping to ride on the coat tails of nostalgia for the brand, a tactic that has worked well for other products. Wines such as Lambrusco and Black Tower are among old favourites to have staged nostalgia-fuelled comebacks, while the likes of Babycham and Advocaat have also enjoyed the occasional cameo. Longhurst and Chambers\u2019 aim is to exploit a gap in the market for a Bavarian beer, pitched somewhere in between micro-brewery \u201ccraft\u201d beers and mass-market megabrews. \u201cEveryone knows Bavaria makes some of the best beer in the world, yet no one can name a Bavarian brand,\u201d says Chambers, pointing out that the likes of Erdinger and Warsteiner are relatively small players in the UK. Despite mascot George the bear\u2019s claim to Bavarian heritage, the original 1980s Hofmeister never had the slightest association with Germany\u2019s beer-loving Bundesland. It was brewed in the UK and even in a decade in which weak, flavourless lagers successfully promoted with catchy marketing campaigns were the norm, quickly became a byword for bad beer. \u201cFor great lager, follow the bear,\u201d ran the slogan, part of an advertising campaign that reportedly proved to be cinema legend Orson Welles\u2019 last project as a director. The brand was retired in 2003 and there will be no nationwide TV campaign for its revival. Longhurst and Chambers are planning a more low key promotional strategy, making the beer available in regional pubs first while they gauge how well it is doing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to flood the market,\u201d said Longhurst. \u201cIt\u2019s not the beer or the brand that it was.\u201d Familiarity with the Hofmeister name, said Chambers, has already helped secure private funding from investors in the City of London. But marketing and PR expert Mark Borkowski \u2013 instrumental in the social media campaign that persuaded Cadbury\u2019s to bring back Wispa \u2013 thinks Hofmeister\u2019s \u201cEurofizz\u201d reputation means they have a tough job ahead. \u201cI can see the tactic. Here\u2019s a dead name that had its advertising peak in the mid to late 80s. There\u2019ll be nostalgia around that so stick it on a great beer and away you go,\u201d Borkowski said. \u201cPeople get excited by a heritage brand and it could give them traction and make people interested in it but one wonders whether it\u2019ll carry with hipsters into craft beer. \u201cI think they should just be a bit careful. It was a bit of a joke brand and the bottom line here is that it\u2019s got to be good, because it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d The increasingly mainstream \u201ccraft beer revolution\u201d has put the emphasis on quality and authenticity. Accordingly, Longhurst and Chambers toured Bavaria in search of the best Helles lager they could find. They hit upon award-winning fourth-generation brewery Schweiger, on the edge of the Ebersberger forest, which uses local Hallertau hops, natural spring water and barley from nearby farmers. The new Hofmeister is brewed according to the German \u201cReinheitsgebot\u201d law governing the ingredients of beer. The result is a pleasant, easy-drinking but relatively complex Helles lager with a long aftertaste, a world away from the original. With a brewer on board, the firm hired former Coca-Cola marketing director Zoe Howorth for the tricky task of relaunching George the bear as a mark of quality. Howorth said the Hofmeister bear\u2019s lads-on-tour, banter-based approach \u201cwouldn\u2019t be appropriate\u201d for today\u2019s market and he needed \u201creskinning\u201d. However, she added that \u201cFollow the bear\u201d still provided a \u201cfantastic call to action\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A rising oil price, along with political developments in France and Germany, has helped push European stock markets into positive territory on the first trading day of the week. The prospect that Francois Fillon could beat Marine Le Pen in next year\u2019s French presidential election has given investors some comfort, as has Angela Merkel\u2019s announcement she was running for a fourth term as German chancellor. Meanwhile the climb in crude, based on growing hopes that Opec would reach an agreement on limiting output at its meeting next week, has lifted commodity companies, while dollar weakness has also helped. But London shares slipped back from their highs after a bounce in sterling - the leading UK index is full of exporters and overseas earners who benefit from a weak pound. The currency responded to supposed hints from UK prime minister Theresa May about a Brexit transition deal. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 2.19 points or 0.03% at 6777.96 Germany\u2019s Dax was 0.19% higher at 10,685.13 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4529.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.19% to 16,297.26 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.1% down at 8614.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 615.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 0.4%, hovering around a new peak of 18947. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have also recorded new highs. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. On the effect of the US election on the euro area economic outlook, Draghi said it is too early too now. But he said, as with the UK referendum vote, the reaction in the markets was significant to start with, but then muted. Markets have shown their resilience, helped by the actions of in the first case the Bank of England, then the ECB. But clearly these changes have a long term impact which difficult to assess and in the case of the UK, depends on the shape of negotiations and the length of time it takes to find an agreement. ECB president Mario Draghi is now responding to the comments of MEPs. He says he understands the concerns about the bank\u2019s unconventional measures, and says there are some risks. But he says they do not see an asset price bubble developing. He said the risks are for the time being contained \u201cbut we watch them closely.\u201d Low interest rates are a consequence of low growth and low inflation around the world, he said, not the creation of the ECB. Policy rates have to be low to stimulate growth. By and large, regarding the negative rate situation , the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Our monetary policy is by and large the same as in the US, UK and Japan, says Draghi. He denies that the bank is overstepping its mandate (as was suggested by several MEPs). Here\u2019s the full Reuters report on the comments from ECB board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 on the bank not contemplating buying stocks as part of its QE programme. Away from the ECB and back to the CBI\u2019s annual conference in London, where Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has begun addressing delegates. Follow his speech on our politics live blog from here. Meanwhile, while ECB president Mario Draghi is listening to the various comments - often negative - on the bank\u2019s annual report, executive board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 has also been speaking. According to Reuters, he said that at some point the ECB would scale down its stimulus programme but not yet. And there was never any discussion about buying stocks as part of the QE programme. A number of MEPs are lining up to point out the problems in the eurozone and criticise some of the ECB\u2019s policies, while saying growth is still fragile. Draghi has begun speaking, apologising for his late arrival due to transport problems [we\u2019ve all been there...] You can follow the session here. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has defended the bank\u2019s monetary policy actions once more, and repeated his calls for governments to step up their own reforms to boost growth. And he said the bank needed to continue its supportive policies to bring inflation close to its target. In a speech to the European Parliament relating to the ECB\u2019s annual report, he said challenges had increased since his last session there in February. [Brexit for a start, one would think]. But he said the European economy had shown resilience to the global uncertainty, partly due to the ECB\u2019s actions: The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate, but steady, pace. It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties emanating from the global environment... Our monetary policy measures since June 2014 have been a key factor behind these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery... Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the stabilisation of oil prices. Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite of the gradual closing of the output gap. It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. But then he called for further action elsewhere: However... our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive action from other policy areas. In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area... The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment... Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost growth. The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel\u2019s announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon\u2019s right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden movement, it appears that May\u2019s (attempted) reassurances that the government is working to avoid a Brexit \u2018cliff edge\u2019 for businesses, comments that perhaps suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling\u2019s resurgence. And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively. The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar\u2019s dip this Monday (the greenback maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though without much actual momentum to push it any higher. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement from new UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Royal London Asset Management has called for measures to boost growth. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London, said: Now is the time to reset fiscal policy and the focus should be on boosting nominal growth to offset Brexit uncertainty rather than trying to deliver \u2018austerity-lite\u2019. Going for growth should reduce the debt burden over time as the government can borrow money in the gilt market at a cost of 1-2 per cent per annum and invest in an economy with long term growth potential of four. The government should counteract the lack of private sector investment since the financial crisis by improving transport infrastructure, housing and power generation while continuing to support research and new technology. Contrary to popular opinion, governments can borrow their way out of debt if interest rates are low enough - or \u2018save\u2019 their way deeper into debt if austerity causes the economy to weaken. A rise in the oil price on hopes of an Opec deal next week to limit production has helped push US markets higher in early trading. The post-election rally has continued, boosted by the expectation of infrastructure spending and other measures to boost the US economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 51 points or 0.28%, just 15 points below its record high. Meanwhile the Nasdaq index of technology companies has already reached a new peak, up 0.56%. The pound has just jumped by over one cent against the US dollar....and it\u2019s not quite clear why! After a slow start, sterling suddenly jumped by over 1% to hit $1.25, from $1.234 this morning. It\u2019s dipping back a bit now, as traders struggle to work out what happened. One theory is that Theresa May has sparked the rally, by telling business leaders this morning that she wants to avoid a Brexit \u201ccliff edge\u201d. That has raised hopes that Britain might seek a transitional arrangement, to help businesses adjust to life outside the European Union. Reuters are calling it a \u2018mystery move\u2019, saying: Sterling jumped by a full cent in a few seconds just after 1325 GMT on Monday, with dealers at several major banks saying there had been no clear driver of the move in a currency still smarting from a so-called \u201cflash crash\u201da month ago. Influential MP Andrew Tyrie is highly unamused that the Bank of England is considering hiking the UK\u2019s deposit protection scheme back to \u00a385,000, less than 18 months after cutting it to \u00a375,000. As we explained at 11.26am, the changes are driven by sterling\u2019s volatility, with the BoE tacking and jibing to keep in line with the \u20ac100,000 limit set by European regulators. But Tyrie, who chairs parliament\u2019s Treasury committee, thinks these changes undermine public confidence in the banking system. \u201cThe announcement today of another change to the deposit protection limit \u2013 there have been about seven in the last decade \u2013 is a recipe for yet more uncertainty. \u201cEach change will have carried a cost. It\u2019s extremely valuable for the level of deposit protection to be well known for long periods. This allows savers and small businesses time to adjust. Stability is what is needed. That is what can entrench public confidence in depositor protection, the most valuable commodity of all. \u201cThese recent changes have not been the fault of the PRA. They are an EU requirement, imposed by the European Commission. The current EU rules have always been unacceptable to a country such as the UK, in the EU but outside the Eurozone. Tyrie\u2019s solution is to take back control of these rules - which kick in if a bank fails: \u201cThe absurd situation, in which the UK is left vulnerable, at the discretion of the European Commission, to frequent changes in our deposit scheme, must be brought to an end. Brexit should give the UK the opportunity to set its own level of protection. We should take it.\u201d Francois Fillon\u2019s plans to shrink the French state by cutting 500,000 jobs will surely alarm France\u2019s unions, and could be fiercely fought. Cutting unemployment benefit and raising the retirement age will also be controversial, should Fillon become the next president. But MEP Philippe Juvin argues that Fillon is what France needs, telling Bloomberg TV this morning that: The financial markets want stability and they want trust. With Fillon they would get stability and trust. This chart, from the Economists\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe, shows how Fillon won support from Republican voters across the country: From Paris, Kim Willsher reports that French politicians are swiftly rethinking their alliance following Fillon\u2019s surprise win: Nicolas Sarkozy crashed out of the primaries with only 20.6% of the vote. Shortly after his defeat he called on supporters to throw their weight behind Fillon. Among those who responded to the call were former prime minister and presidential candidate Edouard Balladur, and Sarkozy supporters Brice Hortefeux and Rachida Dati, as well as fellow first-round loser Bruno Le Maire. On the other hand, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morziet, who came fourth in the primary has announced she will support Jupp\u00e9, as have former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and former minister Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse. The other first round contenders, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, former head of the centre-right party, and Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Poisson of the Christian Democrat party, have yet to declare their second-round allegiance. Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, the president of the centrist party MoDem, has already called for his supporters to vote for Juppe. The US stock market is expected to open calmly in 80 minutes time, as the Trump effect wears off: Francois Fillon hasn\u2019t got the Republican nomination sewn up quite yet. Having won yesterday\u2019s first round contest, he must now beat Alain Juppe in a run-off next Sunday. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem, given Fillon\u2019s strong showing in the primary: The scale of his victory has surprised many observers (perhaps because most people have been distracted by the US election!). So we\u2019ve published a profile of Fillon, ideal for anyone muttering \u2018Francois who?!\u2019 this morning. It explains how the former PM is winning support with a neoliberal, conservative stance reminiscent of Britain\u2019s Tory party in the 80s. Here\u2019s a flavour: Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who beat his former boss Nicolas Sarkozy to join Alain Jupp\u00e9 in the second round of voting for France\u2019s rightwing Republican party\u2019s presidential candidate, is a social conservative who likes drinking tea, driving classic cars and cutting state spending. The 62-year-old Paris MP\u2019s campaign slogan to slash half a million public sector jobs over five years is inspired by his heroine, Margaret Thatcher. Of the seven Republican candidates, Fillon was the most outspoken defender of what is seen in France as the Anglo-Saxon economic model. He appears unafraid of offending the French statist tradition or fuelling a popular backlash against neoliberal economics. In his last rally before Sunday\u2019s vote, he said: \u201cI\u2019m tagged with an [economically] liberal label in the same way one would paint crosses on the doors of lepers in the middle ages. But I\u2019m just a pragmatist.\u201d Fillon served as prime minister under Sarkozy, and is remembered for defying street protests and championing a rise in the retirement age. He tried to distance himself from Sarkozy after the 2008 financial crash by describing the country as bankrupt and suggesting France needed to cut state spending further. Opponents have questioned why he carried on serving as Sarkozy\u2019s prime minister if he disagreed with his approach. Sarkozy was disdainful of Fillon as a presidential candidate, referring to him as one of his staff. But Fillon had the last laugh. By pipping him to the second round runoff next week, Fillon has all but ended Sarkozy\u2019s political career..... Europe\u2019s big three stock markets are all pushing higher as lunchtime approaches. European politics is the main issue in the City today, meaning concerns over Donald Trump can take a (temporary?) back seat. Investors seem to be welcoming the emergence of Francois Fillon as the man to lead the French right-wing Republican party to victory over Marine Le Pen of Front National next May. As explained earlier, Fillon is the favourite to become France\u2019s next president after beating fellow right-wingers Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy in last night\u2019s primary. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is now up 35 points at 6810, a gain of 0.5%, led by mining companies. The French and German markets have posted similar gains (although Italy is still suffering from pre-referendum worries). Traders are hoping that Europe will stick with mainstream politicians in next year\u2019s crunch elections, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The confirmation that Angela Merkel is set to run for a fourth term as German chancellor in next year\u2019s election, combined with a Marine Le Pen-damaging victory for Francois Fillon in the first round of France\u2019s right-wing primaries, has given life to the euro this morning. The Eurozone currency finds itself up 0.2% against the dollar, just about lifting it away from last week\u2019s sub-\u20ac1.06 lows, while it has had more success against the pound, taking back nearly half a percent. The fact that this political news suggests stability in a region standing on the precipice of potential chaos has also helped out the Eurozone indices. French government debt have also strengthened in value this morning, pulling down the yield (interest rate) on its 10-year bonds. Newsflash: The Bank of England is considering raising the maximum bank deposit guaranteed in the UK to \u00a385,000, from \u00a375,000. The move is prompted by the pound\u2019s slump against the euro since June\u2019s EU referendum, from \u20ac1.30 to \u20ac1.16. Under EU law, consumers can recover up to \u20ac100,000 if they lose money when a bank collapses. And sterling\u2019s recent decline has pushed up the value of that protection in pound terms. The Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has concluded that the pound is not going to recover anytime soon: Taking into consideration the developments in financial markets following the UK\u2019s referendum vote to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016, including with respect to the GBP/EUR exchange rate, the PRA considers that a structural shift in the exchange rate has occurred. This may be a little embarrassing for the BoE. The limit was originally \u00a385k, but the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority decided to lower it to \u00a375k in July 2015 (because the pound had rallied against the euro). That decision angered the high street banks, who had just trained their staff on the scheme. Tinkering with the deposit protection scheme too often risks confusing consumers... Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence also thinks Francois Fillon would beat Marine Le Pen in a straight race to become French president. Barroso says Fillon\u2019s victory over Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy in Sunday\u2019s Republican primary is bad news for Le Pen: While left-wing voters would find it more difficult to support Fillon than Juppe in a second round, he is a less toxic candidate than Sarkozy; it is also likely that he would moderate his stance on economic issues between the two rounds in order not to scare off centrist voters. Fillon\u2019s biggest strength is that he would be able to limit the potential flow of traditional conservative voters towards the FN [National Front]. In sum, the former PM would probably be able to deploy the necessary ambiguity to build a coalition of voters that could defeat Le Pen. The euro has gained almost half a cent against the US dollar this morning, as European political drama overtakes Donald Trump as the main issue on the trading floors. The single currency is trading at $1.063, up from $1.0585 on Friday night. That ends 10 days of straight declines following the US election. Traders are digesting Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to run for a fourth term as German chancellor, and Francois Fillon\u2019s sudden promotion to favourite to become the next French president. Merkel has already warned that next year\u2019s election will be tough, given the rising tides of populism: Fillon has campaigned on a conservative platform of cutting 500,000 civil service jobs and ending the 35-hour week. He also favours taking a hard line over Brexit, as our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin explains: Fillon\u2019s success has raised hopes that National Front leader Marine Le Pen can be kept away from the presidency. But Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says we can\u2019t be complacent: The clearest message I received over the last two weeks was that opinion polls and historical voting patterns which suggest a le Pen victory is unlikely, won\u2019t do much to ease pre-election nervousness. Market participants can see the shift in the voter mood and the sharp swing in support for M Fillon can be seen as yet another surprise for opinion pollsters. Uncertainty will weigh on the Euro for months to come. City analysts are warning that Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement will not be a game-changer, given the UK\u2019s financial problems. George Palmer from Waverton Investment Management hopes that Phillip Hammond will announce new infrastructure spending plans. George Osborne\u2019s Budgets and Autumn Statements were defined by a general intent to cut deficits, budgets and taxes on the entrepreneur. If Hammond is going to stimulate an economy that is entering a period of uncertainty it is unlikely that he will be able to cut all three. He has already abandoned the prospect of balancing the books and Wednesday 23rd will give us an idea on tax cuts. In line with Mr Trump\u2019s promises of improved infrastructure (not just walls) to provide growth and jobs, the expectation is that Mr Hammond will similarly spend the windfall of expanded deficits and unbalanced budgets on some sort of infrastructure. And arguably, there is capacity to do so \u2013 the lack of investment (excluding the Olympics) since the Financial Crisis means its share of GDP has been falling steeply (as this chart shows): But Fiona Cincotti of City Index say Phillip Hammond hasn\u2019t got much flexibility to borrow more for investment: Given the size of the UK\u2019s debt pile, in addition to poor economic forecasts any expectations of Trump style spending are misplaced and he is likely to opt for a rather conservative budget in comparison. Sterling has seen a soft start to the week as Hammond\u2019s talking down of the UK\u2019s post Brexit economy over the weekend has done little to support the battered currency; we are expecting to see more volatility in the lead up to and during the course of the Statement on Wednesday. And Edward Hardy of currency exchange firm World First points out that Britain\u2019s financial position appears to be deteriorating: The size of Hammond\u2019s fiscal arsenal has been somewhat limited by new estimates forecasting a \u00a3100bln black hole in the UK\u2019s finances due to slower growth and limited international investment attributed to the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Despite the government ditching the pledge to balance the books by 2020, this lack of fiscal rigour will prevent Hammond, and any future governments, from enacting wider-reaching fiscal reform such as lifting the 1% public sector pay rise cap and revitalising public services. And She\u2019s off! Theresa May is telling the CBI conference that capitalism is the best hope for people struggling in the UK. But she\u2019s also challenging business to do more to help Britain, through long-term investment, helping communities and creating jobs for the next generation. May also declares that Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement will be \u201cambitious for business and ambitious for Britain\u201d. Philip Hammond, she says, will commit to creating a \u201cstrong and stable\u201d basis for the economy, while also bringing the deficit down and cutting the national debt That may be a hint not to expect a major easing of fiscal policy this week. Stay tuned to Politics Live for more from the CBI.... The CBI\u2019s annual conference is up and running, and Theresa May should give the keynote speech in a few minutes. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Britain\u2019s government is signalling that it may pull a sharp u-turn over plans to put workers on company boards. The Sunday Times reported yesterday that Theresa May is considering \u2018watering down\u2019 the plan, which was one of her early pledges when she replaced David Cameron in July. Business minister Greg Clark is now hinting that the government is indeed backing away from the plan (which wasn\u2019t popular with City bosses), telling Radio 4 that: \u201cTheresa May has talked about an economy that works for everyone - that includes workers, employees, consumers, the supply chain businesses - so we will put forward a series of ways in which those voices can be represented on boards. \u201cWe will publish those plans. We will have options. We are working with business. Frances O\u2019Grady, head of the TUC, isn\u2019t impressed: Italy\u2019s stock market has shed 1% in early trading as traders anticipate that voters will reject constitutional reforms in next month\u2019s referendum. The FTSE MIB has shed 160 points to 16,103, putting it on track for its weakest close since early July. The latest polls show that the public are likely to reject prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s proposal, to trim the Italian Senate\u2019s power and change the way its members are selected. Renzi has threatened to resign if he loses, which could plunge the eurozone into a fresh crisis (although he could yet lead a caretaker government). Social networking platform Facebook has given the UK economy a fillip, by announcing plans for a new headquarters in central London. The company is planning to hire 500 new workers, increasing its UK headcount by 50%, to work at the new site in Fitzrovia (the part of London around the BT Tower). Fingers crossed that this helps Facebook tackle its fake news problem.... Trump spent the weekend entertaining potential cabinet member at his New Jersey golf club. One \u2018serious\u2019 option for the Secretary of State position is former presidential candidate Mitt Romney (who has presumably been forgiven for labelling Trump as \u201ca phoney, a fraud\u2019\u2019 in March). These choices will be a litmus test for Trump\u2019s administration -- international investors will look for signs that the next president might row back from his anti-globalisation message. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, explains that politics will still drive the markets: \u201cWe\u2019ll to have to take a view as to whether these people are pro free trade, or not as anti free trade as Trump sounded on the campaign trail, and what we\u2019re likely to get in policies such as fiscal expansion and the dollar.\u201d After 12 days of shock, the City may have adjusted to the prospect of Donald Trump becoming the next US president. The world\u2019s financial markets are stubbornly, indeed disappointingly, quiet this morning as investors watch the billionaire president-elect form his new cabinet. Excited chatter about trillion-dollar infrastructure plans has faded, and anxiety over a bond market crash has eased too, while people wait to see how Trump prepares for power. So the pound is absolutely flat against the US dollar at $1.2345, and most government bond prices are inching a little higher. European stock markets are calm too, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 15 points in early trading. Trump\u2019s success pushed the Dow Jones index to a series of record highs, and sent government bond prices reeling. But that initial wild reaction may now have faded, as FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed explains: The reflationary trade, or as some like to call it \u201cTrump trade\u201d, probably led some big name bearish investors, who were calling the end of 8-year bull market to reconsider their judgments. Since Trump won the elections on November 9, the dollar index gained 3.6%, the Dow Jones traded at new record highs, and yields on U.S. 10-year treasury bonds rallied 25%. The shift in market sentiment was based on hopes that a Trump presidency means businesses\u2019 profits skyrocketing due to sharp cut in taxes, more capital expenditures, and finally some inflation supported by aggressive government infrastructure spending. It\u2019s difficult to know how much further this bull can run especially that it\u2019s driven by animal spirits, and yet no fundamental evidence. However, when everybody turns bullish, this is the time when you should get worried. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s wet and gloomy in the City, as traders squelch to the office at the start of another busy week. The big event comes on Wednesday, when chancellor Phillip Hammond delivers the Autumn Statement. It\u2019ll be Hammond\u2019s first major set piece event since replacing George Osborne at the Treasury, and a chance to set the economy on its post-Brexit path. However, the omens aren\u2019t great. Yesterday, Hammond downplayed the chances of giving much help to struggling families, pointing out that the national debt was \u201ceye-wateringly\u201d large. So hopes of a major infrastructure spending plan are already receding (although the chancellor may find \u00a31.3bn for the nation\u2019s roads). And after six years of Osborne-omics, we can see that those families at the bottom of the income pile have suffered badly. A new survey has shown that current austerity-driven welfare cuts will cost low-income working families more than \u00a32,500 a year by 2020. Our front page story explains: A study of 187,000 households across the UK found that policies including cuts to universal credit and the four-year benefit rate freeze, coupled with rising rents and higher inflation, would see low-income working families typically lose \u00a348.90 a week by the end of the decade. The findings have alarmed councils and charities worried that the growing financial burden on low-income families will raise poverty and homelessness levels. Also coming up today.... The impact of Brexit will be high on the agenda at the CBI\u2019s annual conference in London today. Prime minister Theresa May is the keynote speaker, and will be talking about her plans for \u201cA stronger, fairer Britain\u201d at 9.45am. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is also speaking, along with many of Britain\u2019s top business leaders. Our politics team will be covering the CBI conference, but we\u2019ll keep an eye for interesting titbits too. French politics took a twist last night when former PM Francois Fillon won the first round of the race to become the Republican party\u2019s candidate for the presidency next year. Fillon is now the odds-on favourite to become the next president, and has probably sunk Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s hopes of a political comeback. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is presenting the ECB\u2019s annual report to MEPs in Strasbourg this afternoon. The oil price could be volatile, as producers prepare for an OPEC meeting at the end of this month. But there\u2019s not much in the economic calendar to excite us, alas, so some traders are expecting a quiet day...",

[<em>Brexit for a start, one would think]</em>.</p> <p>But he said the European economy had shown resilience to the global uncertainty, partly due to the ECB\u2019s actions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate, but steady, pace. It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties emanating from the global environment...</p> <p>Our monetary policy measures since June 2014\u00ad have been a key factor behind these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery...</p> <p>Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the stabilisation of oil prices. </p> <p>Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite of the gradual closing of the output gap. </p> <p>It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. </p> </blockquote> <p>But then he called for further action elsewhere:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However... our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive action from other policy areas. </p> <p>In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area... </p> <p>The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment...</p> <p>Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost growth. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T16:34:29.007Z\">at 4.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5833159ae4b0e0ad2d75bc65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T15:43:12.927Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel\u2019s announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon\u2019s right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden movement, it appears that May\u2019s (attempted) reassurances that the government is working to avoid a Brexit \u2018cliff edge\u2019 for businesses, comments that perhaps suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling\u2019s resurgence.</p> <p>And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively.</p> <p>The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar\u2019s dip this Monday (the greenback maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though without much actual momentum to push it any higher. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583308a4e4b0da4920d6aee3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T15:03:52.650Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement from new UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Royal London Asset Management has called for measures to boost growth.

The government should counteract the lack of private sector investment since the financial crisis by improving transport infrastructure, housing and power generation while continuing to support research and new technology.</p> <p>Contrary to popular opinion, governments can borrow their way out of debt if interest rates are low enough - or \u2018save\u2019 their way deeper into debt if austerity causes the economy to weaken.</p> </blockquote> <p><em> <br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583309eae4b0e0ad2d75bc45\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T14:56:02.417Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets head towards record highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A rise in the oil price on hopes of an Opec deal next week to limit production has helped push US markets higher in early trading.

Opponents have questioned why he carried on serving as Sarkozy\u2019s prime minister if he disagreed with his approach.</p> <p>Sarkozy was disdainful of Fillon as a presidential candidate, referring to him as one of his staff.

The shift in market sentiment was based on hopes that a Trump presidency means businesses\u2019 profits skyrocketing due to sharp cut in taxes, more capital expenditures, and finally some inflation supported by aggressive government infrastructure spending.</p> <p> It\u2019s difficult to know how much further this bull can run especially that it\u2019s driven by animal spirits, and yet no fundamental evidence.

      "bodyText": "A clampdown on smoking in China and problems with a big acquisition have prompted a second profit warning in four months from Essentra, the maker of packaging and cigarette filters. In a trading update, Essentra said profit would fall by up to 20% in 2016. The warning, which followed a downgrade in June, knocked a fifth off the company\u2019s market value and sent its shares to their lowest level since early 2012. Colin Day, the chief executive, whose departure was announced three weeks ago, told analysts: \u201cI apologise that we had to do this. Clearly it doesn\u2019t give anybody any great delight or satisfaction.\u201d Essentra said its filters business was affected by weaker demand in China, slower implementation of new contracts and the sudden decision by a US customer to move production to Thailand. Day said it was hard to know what was going on in China and that he was wary about the outlook there. He said: \u201cThe underlying fact remains overall growth in China is slowing \u2026 You should talk to the tobacco companies.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has said that her government is working towards avoiding a \u201ccliff edge\u201d for business when Britain\u2019s two-year Brexit negotiating period comes to an end. The comments, after a keynote speech at the CBI conference aimed at reaching out to the business community and easing their concerns, suggest ministers will be aiming to put a transitional deal in place. \u201cObviously, as we look at the negotiation we want to get the arrangement that is going to work best for the UK and the arrangement that is going to work best for business in the UK. And I\u2019m conscious that there will be issues that will need to be looked at,\u201d May told delegates on Monday. She said she understood \u201cpeople don\u2019t want a cliff edge, they want to know with some certainty how things are going to go forward\u201d. The prime minister added: \u201cThat will be part of the work that we do in terms of the negotiation that we are undertaking with the European Union.\u201d The comments were in response to a warning from the CBI president, Paul Drechsler, who said business did not need a running commentary but was looking for clarity and \u201cabove all, a plan\u201d. He described a timetable on article 50 and guarantees on EU funding as encouraging signs, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s offset uncertainty around Brexit with greater certainty on Heathrow and Hinkley Point.\u201d But he said uncertainty remained, including over access to Europe\u2019s talent, and the single market. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another important question: what happens on the day after Brexit? When the clock strikes midnight, and our two years\u2019 negotiating time is up?\u201d he said. \u201cToday, businesses are inevitably considering the cliff-edge scenario \u2013 a sudden and overnight transformation in trading conditions. If this happens, firms could find themselves stranded in a regulatory no man\u2019s land. \u201cAnd even if our legal obligations are clear and in place there would also be real, practical implications. Our ports, airports and logistics firms, if faced with new trading rules, could suddenly need new and potentially complex paperwork, which would take more time and money to process. \u201cAs a result, they\u2019d need more warehouses to store more goods on-site, and more supply roads for the vehicles waiting to deliver them. At short notice. This would be impossible.\u201d Pressed later on whether May was signalling a transitional deal with the EU, the prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman suggested it was one option under consideration to guard against a sudden Brexit affecting businesses. \u201cShe was reflecting the views we have expressed already about how we secure the best deal for the UK and how we seek to provide certainty where we can to businesses and people across the UK of the steps moving forward,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a whole range of issues that are being worked through as we prepare for the negotiations.\u201d Businesses are clamouring for a transitional deal because the two-year negotiation will be focused on the task of leaving the union, and not on any future trading arrangement. At the end of the period the UK will automatically exit the EU, when some fear the country could face a cliff edge under which it would suddenly have to start dealing on unfavourable WTO terms. The hope is that ministers will either extend the period before Britain officially exits, which would need the agreement of all the other 27 member states, or that a temporary deal will be agreed. That could see preferential trading terms and some form of free movement retained while negotiations continue. However, the continuation of free movement could be difficult for May to explain going into an election in 2020, after her initial tough rhetoric on lowering immigration through leaving the EU. Drechsler said companies were less interested in the argument over a hard or soft Brexit, which would dictate the levels of control over migration and economic access, than in the need for a \u201csmooth Brexit\u201d. May addressed the issue during her speech in which she said Britain was at a \u201ctrue national moment\u201d that came with uncertainty but also opportunities. \u201cOpportunities to get out into the world and do new business with old allies and new partners. To use the freedoms that come from negotiating with partners directly, to be flexible, to set our own rules and forge new and dynamic trading agreements that work for the whole UK. Opportunities to become the true global champion of free trade,\u201d she said. May reiterated her suggestion that a running commentary would damage Britain\u2019s negotiating power but said she understood businesses needed clarity. \u201cSo where I can set out our plans without prejudicing the negotiation to come I will,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have been able to set out the timetable for triggering article 50: before the end of March next year. Why I want an early agreement on the status of UK nationals in Europe and EU nationals here, so that you and they can plan with certainty. And why we have been engaging heavily with businesses over the past few months to understand your priorities and concerns, and why we will continue to do so.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Theresa May: I won't force companies to appoint workers to their boards", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May has told business leaders that her government will not force companies to directly appoint workers or consumers on to their boards, watering down an earlier pledge on the issue. She used a keynote speech at the CBI conference to say she had no plans to mandate such changes, despite suggesting that would be the case during the leadership contest and at the Conservative party conference. \u201cWhile it is important that the voices of workers and consumers should be represented, I can categorically tell you that this is not about mandating works councils, or the direct appointment of workers or trade union representatives on boards,\u201d the prime minister told a packed room in central London. \u201cSome companies may find that these models work best for them \u2013 but there are other routes that use existing board structures, complemented or supplemented by advisory councils or panels, to ensure all those with a stake in the company are properly represented. It will be a question of finding the model that works.\u201d May\u2019s pledge was one of the more eye-catching elements of her pitch to replace David Cameron, on a platform centred around social justice. In July, she used a key speech in her bid to become Conservative leader to say: \u201cIf I\u2019m prime minister, we\u2019re going to change that system \u2013 and we\u2019re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.\u201d She returned to the theme as prime minister, using her Tory party conference speech to promise: \u201cLater this year we will publish our plans to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well.\u201d Pushed on the change of position in questions after her CBI speech, May played down the idea of a U-turn, saying there were a number of ways to boost representation of workers. It came after Greg Clark, the business secretary, made a similar argument on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said plans would be outlined by the end of the year, but declined to confirm that they would involve workers sitting on boards. \u201cThere are different ways of doing this,\u201d Clark said. \u201cTheresa May has talked about an economy that works for everyone \u2013 that includes workers, employees, consumers, the supply chain businesses \u2013 so we will put forward a series of ways in which those voices can be represented on boards.\u201d Asked if this meant the government was pulling back from the plan, Clark did not fully deny this, saying only: \u201cThere will be different options.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will publish those plans. We will have options. We are working with business. They will be produced and we will talk about it.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cTheresa May made a clear promise to have workers represented on company boards. The proposals in her speech today do not deliver on this. \u201cThis is not the way to show that you want to govern for ordinary working people.\u201d The GMB also accused the prime minister of failing to stick to her promise. \u201cThe Tories can claim to be the party of workers all they want, but actions speak louder than warm words,\u201d he said, arguing that the watering down of the pledge was telling. \u201cThe mask is slipping - nice speeches followed by broken promises will not help working people get fairness and dignity in the workplace.\u201d But May\u2019s official spokeswoman denied the policy had been watered down. \u201cLook at what the PM has said all the way through. This is about how workers\u2019 views are represented on boards. This is consistent with that... I think there will be a number of ways to do it. Part of the approach we will be taking is to put it out to consultation and hear views from stakeholders, employees and businesses on the best way forward. We are absolutely committed to having the voice of workers heard on boards as part of establishing the best corporate governance of any major economy.\u201d",

It will be a question of finding the model that works.\u201d</p> <p>May\u2019s pledge was one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-tory-leadership-pitch-andrea-leadsom\">more eye-catching elements of her pitch</a>  to replace David Cameron, on a platform centred around social justice.<br></p> <p>In July, she used a key speech in her bid to become Conservative leader to say: \u201cIf I\u2019m prime minister, we\u2019re going to change that system \u2013 and we\u2019re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.\u201d<br></p> <p>She returned to the theme as prime minister, using her Tory party conference speech to promise: \u201cLater this year we will publish our plans to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-plan-workers-boardroom-reform-extraordinary-tories\">Theresa May's plan to put workers in boardrooms is extraordinary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pushed on the change of position in questions after her CBI speech, May played down the idea of a U-turn, saying there were a number of ways to boost representation of workers.</p> <p>It came after Greg Clark, the business secretary, made a similar argument on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said plans would be outlined by the end of the year, but declined to confirm that they would involve workers sitting on boards.</p> <p>\u201cThere are different ways of doing this,\u201d Clark said. \u201cTheresa May has talked about an economy that works for everyone \u2013 that includes workers, employees, consumers, the supply chain businesses \u2013 so we will put forward a series of ways in which those voices can be represented on boards.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if this meant the government was pulling back from the plan, Clark did not fully deny this, saying only: \u201cThere will be different options.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will publish those plans. We will have options. We are working with business. They will be produced and we will talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady,<strong> </strong>said: \u201cTheresa May made a clear promise to have workers represented on company boards. The proposals in her speech today do not deliver on this.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the way to show that you want to govern for ordinary working people.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB also accused the prime minister of failing to stick to her promise. \u201cThe Tories can claim to be the party of workers all they want, but actions speak louder than warm words,\u201d he said, arguing that the watering down of the pledge was telling.</p> <p>\u201cThe mask is slipping - nice speeches followed by broken promises will not help working people get fairness and dignity in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But May\u2019s official spokeswoman denied the policy had been watered down. \u201cLook at what the PM has said all the way through. This is about how workers\u2019 views are represented on boards. This is consistent with that... I think there will be a number of ways to do it. Part of the approach we will be taking is to put it out to consultation and hear views from stakeholders, employees and businesses on the best way forward. We are absolutely committed to having the voice of workers heard on boards as part of establishing the best corporate governance of any major economy.\u201d</p>",

Brent crude is currently up 1.2% at $47.43 a barrel, helped by a softer dollar as well as renewed optimism that oil producers might seal an agreement to cut output. Commodities are also higher, with copper climbing more than 2% on hopes of increasing demand for metals. So mining shares have gained ground, with Glencore 5.3p higher at 267.2p and Antofagasta adding 12.5p to 678.5p, while Royal Dutch Shell A shares has risen 26.5p to 2011.5p and BP is 5.5p better at 453.15p. A rise in gold and silver once more has helped Randgold Resources rise 135p to \u00a359.25 and Fresnillo climb 27p to \u00a313.16. But the FTSE 100 has slipped back 7.13 points to 6768.64. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There wasn\u2019t much for the markets to go off of this Monday, causing the current macro-issues (US election fallout, Fed rate hike, Brexit) to mingle with the week\u2019s main events (the Autumn Statement, Thanksgiving) for a fairly dull start. The FTSE has really looked lethargic in the last week or so; bar some post-US election theatrics the UK index has struggled to manage anything resembling momentum, leaving it seemingly perpetually trapped below 6800. This week, at least, has Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement as a focal point, something that could help certain sectors, like infrastructure and home building, if Philip Hammond\u2019s first real performance as Chancellor follows what reports have suggested. For today, however, there isn\u2019t much for the FTSE to latch onto, with a rebound from its oil and mining stocks, inspired by sharp rises from Brent Crude and copper. Nerves have been rattled a little as packaging company Essentra, down 20% to 395.9p, cut its full year profit forecast due to a slowdown in China, and outsourcing group Mitie, 10% lower at 188.7p, issued a second warning this year, as customers delayed placing orders amid the uncertainty following the Brexit vote. Retailers and banks were also under pressure, with Next down 113p at \u00a349.77, and Lloyds Banking Group 1.5% lower at 58.57p.",

The ban is an attempt to halt the group\u2019s increasing dominance in the mobile market but, at the same time, the regulator has allowed BT to bid for airwaves critical to rolling out future 5G services, a move that has angered rival operator Three. The UK communications regulator has launched a consultation into the proposed auction of the spectrum, which will be critical in helping to meet demands for mobile broadband as well as future 5G mobile services. BT \u2013 which last year paid \u00a312bn to buy EE, Britain\u2019s largest mobile phone network \u2013 currently holds 45% of the UK\u2019s usable mobile spectrum. This compares with 28% for Vodafone, 15% for O2 and 12% for Three UK. Ofcom has blocked BT/EE from bidding for any more new spectrum in the 2.3GHz band, which could be used to boost existing 4G capability meaning faster downloads and internet browsing for consumers. \u201cOfcom is concerned that, if these immediately usable holdings were to become more unbalanced, this could harm competition in the next few years,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cIf BT/EE were to acquire all the 2.3GHz being awarded, it would have almost half of the immediately usable spectrum in the market.\u201d However, BT/EE will be allowed to bid for the second chunk of spectrum to be auctioned, the 3.4GHz band that is considered critical for the rollout of 5G services across Europe. Ofcom\u2019s decision to allow BT/EE to bid for 5G spectrum has angered Hutchison-owned Three, which last year had its \u00a310.25bn takeover bid for O2 blocked by competition regulators. Three has called for BT/EE to be completely stopped from bidding for the sale of the spectrum. \u201cOfcom exists to promote competition and protect consumers but it has once again shown it is not willing to make the big decisions needed to deliver the best outcome for the UK,\u201d said Dave Dyson, chief executive of Three UK. \u201cIt has allowed BT and Vodafone to stockpile valuable mobile airwaves and put genuine choice for consumers at risk. A 30% cap on total spectrum ownership and a spectrum reservation for smaller operators are the only measures that will preserve competition for the benefit of UK mobile consumers.\u201d Ofcom defended its move, which will be consulted upon after responses on the proposals close on 30 January 2017. It said the spectrum for 5G was not \u201cimmediately useable\u201d and that it is \u201cimportant that operators are given an opportunity to acquire this spectrum so they are able to consider early development of 5G services\u201d. \u201cThe UK has long benefited from strong mobile competition,\u201d said Philip Marnick, spectrum group director at Ofcom. \u201cWe are designing the auction to ensure everyone benefits from a market that continues to innovate and serve them well. \u201cSpectrum is the essential resource that fuels the UK\u2019s economy.

    "webTitle": "Mitie withdraws from healthcare as it issues second profit warning", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mitie has published its second profit warning in two months after the outsourcing company\u2019s customers continued to reduce spending due to rising costs and economic uncertainty. The company also said it would withdraw from its healthcare business, which provides home care for the elderly. The \u00a3128m cost of writing off the business drove Mitie to a \u00a3100m pre-tax loss for the first half of the year. Lady McGregor-Smith, Mitie\u2019s departing chief executive, said spending cuts had made the healthcare business unviable. The Conservative peer said vulnerable people would suffer unless the government resolved to fund care properly. Mitie has expanded to employ 63,000 people across businesses including office cleaning, immigration centres and pest control as organisations have sought to cut costs by contracting out services. The company hit the buffers in September as it said annual profit would be lower than expected because customers, from banks to local authorities, were delaying projects amid uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote and rising employment costs. Underlying annual earnings are expected to be up to 15% lower than analysts had pencilled in after the first profit warning. Mitie\u2019s shares fell as much as 18% in early trading and were down 7% at 194p after lunch. McGregor-Smith, who has run Mitie for almost 10 years, announced soon after the first profit warning that she would step down. McGregor-Smith, who was the first Asian woman to run a FTSE 250 company when she took the job, will leave on 12 December and be replaced by Phil Bentley, the former boss of Cable &amp; Wireless. McGregor-Smith said: \u201cI made the decision [to leave] over a year ago and the board has been looking at succession. I have to do the job based on current market conditions.\u201d She said cost cuts and new business in the pipeline had put Bentley in a good position to restore profitability. Mitie put its healthcare division under review in September and will now look for a company to take over the business or allow its contracts to wind down. Cash-strapped local councils have been seeking price cuts from the loss-making business, McGregor-Smith said. McGregor-Smith said councils and the health service were not to blame for the care crisis because employment costs, including introducing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, had gone up by a third in the past three years as government funding had fallen sharply. The prices requested by local authorities for care made it impossible for Mitie to carry on, she said. \u201cWhen I talked this through with the Care Quality Commission last week I said there is nothing else we can do. We are watching the standard of care fall when other players take the work on. \u201cCare workers should be paid significantly more but someone has got to pay for it. If we are serious about social care in the UK it needs significantly more than the funding that has been suggested. We don\u2019t believe additional funding will be made available to those who need it the most.\u201d A report by the King\u2019s Fund in September said old people\u2019s level of care depended on where they lived and how rich they were rather than their level of need. It said local authority spending on care for older and disabled people had fallen 11% in real terms in the past five years. McGregor-Smith said she had not thought about resigning the Tory whip in the House of Lords to protest against the lack of funding. She said no government in the past 10 years had done enough to support the sector. Mitie swung to a pre-tax loss of \u00a3100.4m in the six months to the end of September from a \u00a345.1m profit a year earlier. The \u00a3128m write-off connected to the healthcare business included \u00a3117m of goodwill and intangible assets.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian dollar has slid to its lowest level against its US counterpart since early June, as a rally in the greenback continued. On Monday evening the local unit stood at US73.22c, down from US73.89c on Friday. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory has put a fire under the US currency as investors bet that the incoming administration would boost government spending, causing higher inflation and interest rates. The trend continued when Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen signalled last week that a December rate rise in the United States was increasingly likely. A huge selloff on the global bond market has also seen money flow into the greenback, putting further pressure on other currencies such as the Aussie. National Australia Bank foreign exchange strategists have forecast the Aussie dollar to drop towards US70c during 2017, and even lower in 2018. Many economists expect the recent rise in commodity prices to go into reverse as the impact of China\u2019s last round of monetary stimulus wears off and the country\u2019s big importers of coal and iron ore run down inventories again. Rio Tinto, Australia\u2019s biggest producer of iron ore, confirmed on Monday that it is shedding 500 jobs in its operations in Western Australia amid expectations that the recent peak of nearly $80 a tonne for the steel-making commodity would not be sustained. But Goldman Sachs struck a more optimistic note for the Australian economy, saying in a note to clients on Monday that the dollar could rebound over US80c if commodity prices hold. Stock markets around Asia Pacific were also subdued by the continued strength of the Trump effect. Hong Kong, Shanghai and South Korea were all lower while the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was down 0.2%. Tokyo bucked the trend rising 0.8% helped by the falling yen which boosts the country\u2019s export-focused manufacturers. \u201cThe markets driven by Trump may be just about to have run their course for now,\u201d said Toru Ohara, chief investment officer at Okasan Asset Management in Tokyo. \u201cA rise in interest rates is, generally speaking, not good thing for stocks, especially for emerging markets. But if you think that US bond yields, which have been falling since 1982, may be bottoming out, that could mean the end of a low-growth/ low-inflation regime.\u201d",
