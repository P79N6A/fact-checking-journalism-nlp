      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has blamed its emissions scandal on a \u201csmall group\u201d of people and has suspended a number of staff as Matthias M\u00fcller was unveiled as its new chief executive. M\u00fcller, who has been promoted from his role as boss of Porsche, pledged to leave \u201cno stone unturned\u201d and \u201cmaximum transparency\u201d in an investigation into how the company cheated emissions tests on diesel cars. The new VW boss did not reveal how many staff had been suspended or who they were, but the company said the scandal was the result of \u201cunlawful behaviour of engineers and technicians involved in engine development\u201d. Bernd Osterloh, chairman of VW\u2019s work council and a member of the executive committee, said: \u201cA small group has done damage to our company. We need a climate where mistakes are not hidden.\u201d M\u00fcller and Osterloh were speaking at a press conference to unveil the new boss of the troubled German carmaker. The 62-year-old was elected by the VW board at a meeting on Friday to replace Martin Winterkorn, who resigned following revelations in the US that Volkswagen installed software in its cars to disguise illegal emission levels. \u201cMy most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group \u2013 by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation,\u201d M\u00fcller said. M\u00fcller faces a major challenge in rebuilding VW. The company has admitted that 11m cars were fitted with defeat devices and set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to pay for the costs of the crisis. However, it also faces the prospect of fines of up to $18bn (\u00a311.8bn) from US regulators and one of the biggest legal claims in history from customers and shareholders around the world. Berthold Huber, the acting head of VW\u2019s supervisory board, called the crisis a \u201cmoral and policy disaster\u201d. The carmaker has called an extraordinary shareholder meeting for 9 November. \u201cThe supervisory board has, on the basis of current information, recommended suspending some employees immediately until the whole case is cleared up,\u201d Huber said. \u201cThis has in part already happened. \u201cThe test manipulations are a moral and political disaster for Volkswagen. The unlawful behaviour of engineers and technicians involved in engine development shocked Volkswagen just as much as it shocked the public. We can only apologise and ask our customers, the public, the authorities and our investors to give us a chance to make amends.\u201d In further developments on Friday, the German government said that 2.8m of the 11m cars installed with the defeat device were sold in Germany and that commercial vehicles were also involved. Documents also emerged that showed EU offices knew two years ago that devices could skew emissions tests, and the US\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency warned that it would step up its emissions test against all carmakers and that VW faced \u201cmassive fines\u201d. In addition, Bloomberg reported that key parts of the faked emissions tests had been overseen by VW executives based in the company\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg. Herbert Diess, head of the Volkswagen brand, said that 5m of the 11m cars affected were Volkswagen passenger cars, including the sixth-generation Golf and the seventh-generation Passat. Diess said: \u201cWe are working at full speed on a technical solution that we will present to partners, to our customers and to the public as swiftly as possible. Our aim is to inform our customers as quickly as possible, so that their vehicles comply fully with regulations.\u201d Shares in VW fell by a further 4%. This means that roughly \u20ac25bn, or one-third, has been wiped off the value of the carmaker this week. Analysts at UBS warned that if the crisis worsened it could signal the eventual end of the combustion engine. Julie Hudson at UBS said: \u201cShould transport emissions become too difficult to regulate because of the difficulty of amassing accurate data, we think this might go way beyond the diesel engine, to accelerate the demise of the combustion engine.\u201d Alongside the appointment of M\u00fcller, VW announced a corporate shake-up designed to simplify its management team. This will involve operations in the US, Canada and Mexico combining under a new North America arm, Porsche being grouped with fellow sports car brands Bugatti and Bentley, and the VW brand combining with Seat and Skoda in a new \u201cvolume\u201d division. Michael Horn will remain head of VW in the US even though he admitted earlier this week that VW had \u201ctotally screwed up\u201d. M\u00fcller has worked at Volkswagen for more than 30 years. He joined the company\u2019s Audi subsidiary in 1971, training as a toolmaker and then studying computer science. He was group head of product planning from 2007 and has headed the Porsche sports car division since 2010. \u201cI am taking on this task at a time in which our company faces unprecedented challenges,\u201d the 62-year-old said. \u201cI will personally do everything to win back the trust of our customers, our employees, our partners, investors and the whole public. \u201cWe stand by our responsibility. Occasionally, our and your patience will be tested, but carefulness is even more important than speed. \u201cWhat is decisive is that nothing like this ever happens at Volkswagen again. So we will introduce even tougher compliance and governance standards in the company.\u201d Max Warburton, analyst at Bernstein, warned that the new chief executive faced \u201cprobably the world\u2019s toughest corporate gig\u201d. He added: \u201cA year of endless work beckons, begging for the forgiveness of regulators, government and consumers.\u201d Warburton said VW should consider buying back and scrapping all the 482,000 cars that US authorities have ordered it recalls. This could cost $6bn. M\u00fcller should also travel to the US immediately to meet government officials, he added. \u201cVW needs to think big and bold.\u201d VW is yet to break down where the 11m cars were sold around the world. However, officials at the GMB trade union in the UK called the company\u2019s actions \u201cunforgivable\u201d and that nitrogen dioxide levels were risking the health of street cleaners, refuse and parking staff in 18 areas around the UK. John McClean, the GMB\u2019s national health, safety and environment officer, said: \u201cWhat VW has done is unforgivable. The company should be severely punished for it\u2019s immoral, devious and deceitful approach to public health risks as well as mis-selling to car drivers.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Friday 18 September Volkswagen is told to recall 482,000 cars in the US after it is caught deploying sophisticated software to cheat emissions tests and allow its cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The Environment Protection Agency claims VW installed defeat devices, meaning the cars only cut their nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution during certification tests. Its investigation was prompted by research by the International Council on Clean Technology (ICCT), which had finally forced VW to admit its actions. The EPA says: \u201cWe intend to hold Volkswagen responsible. We expected better from VW. Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean-air standards is illegal and a threat to public health.\u201d The agency warns that VW will be further investigated and could face other action for breaching the Clean Air Act, including a maximum fine of up to $37,500 per vehicle, or $18bn (\u00a311.8bn). Sunday 20 September VW starts showing some contrition, promising to launch an investigation of its own. Chief executive Martin Winterkorn says: \u201cI personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law.\u201d Monday 21 September The noxious stench of faked emissions tests spreads to Europe \u2013 and the Frankfurt stock exchange. Within minutes of the market opening on Monday morning, about \u20ac15bn (\u00a311bn) is wiped off VW\u2019s share price. The German government warns that the VW scandal is jeopardising the reputation of Germany\u2019s entire automotive industry. Concerns also grow about the extent of possible test-fixing, with campaigners claiming that the European testing system is not fit for purpose. The possible ramifications for car manufacturers \u2013 and public health \u2013 start to emerge as the ICCT warns that other vehicles are emitting far more NOx than official tests suggest. VW presses ahead with a glitzy product launch in New York that features Lenny Kravitz singing \u2013 and an accompanying appearance on stage from US chief executive Michael Horn, who declares: \u201cWe have totally screwed up.\u201d Tuesday 22 September The morning after the party, the headache grows. Volkswagen now admits there are 11m cars worldwide fitted with its defeat devices. The numbers could mean that VW\u2019s diesels have pumped out as much as 900,000 tonnes of extra NOx emissions a year \u2013 about 25 times more than the UK\u2019s controversial Drax power station \u2013 with huge implications for public health. Winterkorn apologises again, releasing a hastily filmed video saying he was \u201cendlessly sorry\u201d. However, he insists he will not resign, even though VW shares slump again and the group tells investors it is earmarking \u20ac6.5bn to deal with the fallout. Governments around Europe call for action: Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, demands \u201ccomplete transparency\u201d and sends a transport ministry team into the firm\u2019s Wolfsburg HQ. Britain and France call for an EU commission inquiry. Analysts start talking about a \u201cLibor moment\u201d for the motor industry, and speculate on the uncertain future of diesel cars. Shares in other carmakers slip: Peugeot is down 7%, with BMW and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, having 5% wiped off their value. Wednesday 23 September Winterkorn finally bows to the inevitable and falls on his sword, protesting he was \u201cnot aware of any wrongdoing on my part\u201d. He walks away with a \u20ac28m pension pot. Lawyers start to circle: several class-action lawsuits are filed in the US and Canada, with UK firms saying they are preparing for similar cases here on behalf of VW owners. Criminal investigations are launched by the US Justice Department, while German public prosecutors consider the merits of a case. VW establishes a special committee to investigate, warning that heads will roll. Rival carmakers insist that VW is an isolated case. But criticism deepens over how much governments knew, and when, about true NOx emissions from diesel engines compared with test results in the motor industry. It also emerges that Germany was aware of defeat devices and that Britain, France and Germany had lobbied to dilute proposed real-world emissions tests for diesel engines, now delayed until at least 2017. Thursday 24 September Germany confirms that VW vehicles with software installed to cheat emissions tests were sold across Europe. Top German economists warn that the VW scandal could jeopardise the country\u2019s growth, and could now be a bigger problem for the wider German economy than Greece\u2019s debt. BMW shares take a further hit after transport campaigners claim their diesels also far exceed emissions limits in real-world tests. Under pressure from environmental groups and a prospective parliamentary grilling, the UK\u2019s Department for Transport says it will start its own inquiry into car emissions, including running new lab tests and comparing the results with cars on the road. France and Italy also announce action including random checks. Friday 25 September Volkswagen unveils its new boss, Matthias M\u00fcller, formerly head of its Porsche division. The carmaker then blames the emissions scandal on a \u201csmall group\u201d of people and says a small number of unnamed staff have been suspended. Rival car manufacturers angrily rebut claims they they employed similar methods, the EPA promises to \u201cup its game\u201d on the testing of cars, and the UK government insists it had not been given enough information to act on misleading test results.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our updated story on the new chief executive and the latest developments: Volkswagen has blamed the emissions scandal at the car maker on a \u201csmall group\u201d of people and suspended staff as it unveiled Matthias M\u00fcller as its new chief executive. M\u00fcller pledged to leave \u201cno stone unturned\u201d in an investigation, but did not reveal how many staff have been suspended and who they are. M\u00fcller was speaking as he was unveiled as the new boss of the troubled German car maker. \u201cMy most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group \u2013 by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation,\u201d he said. M\u00fcller has worked at Volkswagen for more than 30 years. He joined the company\u2019s Audi subsidiary in 1971, training as a toolmaker and then studying computer science. He was group head of product planning from 2007 and has headed the Porsche sports car division since 2010. The 62-year-old was chosen by Volkswagen\u2019s board at a meeting on Friday to replace Martin Winterkorn, who resigned on Wednesday following revelations in the US that Volkswagen installed software on diesel cars to disguise emission levels in tests. The full story is here: On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The US Justice Department has confirmed it has launched an investigation into VW over the emissions scandal, saying it takes the allegations very seriously, Reuters is reporting. There is however a complicated restructuring, including combining the US, Mexico and Canada into one region. Winfried Vahland will take charge of this region, but Horn remains president and CEO of VW US. The company says it is making various moves to streamline its business and strengthen its brands and regions, which is presumable a way of achieving this aim of \u201cmore open communication.\u201d One departure was announced, but not linked to \u201crecent events\u201d the company said, with sales and marketing boss Christian Klingler leaving with immediate effect. Here\u2019s the link to the full restructuring announcement. There seems to be no more news on other changes or resignations, despite the marathon board meeting. And despite the scandal, Michael Horn is holding on to his job as head of VW US. Here\u2019s the full statement from M\u00fcller on his appointment: My most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group \u2013 by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation. Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do everything it can to develop and implement the most stringent compliance and governance standards in our industry. If we manage to achieve that then the Volkswagen Group with its innovative strength, its strong brands and above all its competent and highly motivated team has the opportunity to emerge from this crisis stronger than before. He will remain chairman of Porsche until a successor is found. The full VW announcement is here: Matthias M\u00fcller appointed CEO of the Volkswagen Group There was a lot of talk from the VW executives about the company\u2019s staff: M\u00fcller is now speaking: He says this must not happen again, and his target is for people to enjoy driving our safe vehicle. I am confident we will overcome this crisis and turn VW into an even stronger business. He wants to rebuild trust with customers. He ends by praising Winterkorn... The press conference is underway, and VW has admitted it was shocked by the emissions scandal. It admits it needs a different business culture, one where things are communicated openly. It\u2019s official: Porsche chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller is the new boss of scandal ridden VW, replacing Martin Winterkorn. More on who knew what and when in the VW scandal: We may have been a bit premature earlier but now: Here\u2019s the link (in German). A class action has been filed in the US on behalf of an institutional investor against Volkswagen, says Reuters. Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Down says the complaint is on behalf of buyers of VW ordinary and preferred ADR shares, and charges VW and certain directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act. So lawsuits on the horizon not just from owners of VW vehicles, but owners of VW shares. Switzerland\u2019s Federal Roads Office says it is highly likely that VW sold diesel cars with the manipulated engines in the country. Diesel cars were also imported from the US, Reuters is reporting, and the office is still compiling the numbers of potentially affected vehicles. Meanwhile Volkswagen shares have closed down 4.32% after Germany said 2.8m cars could be affected, and the US environmental protection agency said it was stepping up emission tests in the wake of the scandal. BMW, however, has risen 4.24%, and Germany\u2019s Dax as a whole has closed up 2.7%. This is how VW\u2019s week unfolded on the stock market: Getting ready for the big moment: It appears the VW board meeting has finished and the press conference is imminent... While we wait for the white smoke from VW headquarters signalling the appointment of a new chief executive, a new name has thrown his hat into the ring. Analyst Max Warburton at Bernstein Research says in his latest note that Porsche chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller may be the favourite for the job but passenger brand boss Herbert Diess would be the preferred choice: Diess would be our first choice: he\u2019s the best candidate if VW wants to show everyone \u2013 internally and externally \u2013 that the regime has changed. Diess would also be the best choice for shareholders who would like other changes (cost/capital allocation etc.) after the EPA scandal has been dealt with. Warburton has also put himself forward: It\u2019s not obvious that VW has the ideal candidate, so I\u2019ve dropped my name in to the hat by sending my CV over to Wolfsburg. I\u2019m waiting for the call, but I have to accept that they\u2019ll probably choose someone internally. So he has laid out a plan for the new chief executive, whoever it may be: VW needs to think big and bold. There are five steps that I would recommend: (1) offer to buy back and scrap every 2.0 diesel sold in the US \u2013 all 482,000 of them (cost: around $6bn) (2) announce that VW will henceforth abandon all efforts to sell diesel engines in the US, but will embrace gasoline and PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) (3) send the new chief executive to the US on Monday to meet government officials, the EPA and media (4) announce the immediate suspension of the 100 engineers mostly closely linked with the engine and software development (5) announce the cessation of all motorsport activities immediately, turning all the funding over to electric vehicles, PHEV and environmental research \u2013 in a new research facility located in the US, employing US engineers. That will begin to stabilize the US situation. VW can then turn its attention to addressing European concerns. While this scandal is hugely damaging we believe the financial impact on VW will ultimately be lower than some of the headline numbers. We do not expect VW to face fines in Europe. We believe the long-run earnings power will recover. The whole industry will now face new compliance costs, not just VW. There is value here for the brave, long-term minded investor. Global markets continue to recover strongly following the comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Thursday hinting that interest rates could yet rise before the end of the year. As a reminder, markets took fright last week when the Fed kept rates on hold, on the basis there must be real concern at the central bank about the outlook for the global economy. But Yellen\u2019s remarks have given some reassurance, helping push the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.2%. The FTSE 100 is 2.5% better while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 3% - despite the VW scandal - and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.5%. Julian Jessop Chief Global Economist at Capital Economics explains why he thinks the Yellen comments have soothed investor fears: Fed Chair Janet Yellen used a speech last night to send a pretty clear signal that US interest rates are still likely to be raised later this year, despite the hesitancy last week. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, given that 13 of the 17 Federal Open Market Committee officials are already on record as expecting to hike no later than December. What\u2019s more, the positive tone in equity and commodity markets today in the wake of Yellen\u2019s comments supports our view that the gradual lifting of US rates from emergency lows might actually reassure investors about the global economic outlook. At first sight, any tightening in US monetary policy would be bad news for global asset markets. However, this takes no account of the context in which the Fed would be raising rates. A number of points are worth repeating. First, the Fed\u2019s failure to raise rates at the September FOMC meeting, rather than being reassuring, simply reinforced investors\u2019 concerns about the health of the world economy. The corollary is that a December rate hike would be a welcome vote of confidence. Second, even our relatively hawkish forecasts would still leave US rates at low levels by past standards (perhaps 2% at end-2016 and 3.5% at end-2017). There can also be little doubt that the Fed would go back on hold much sooner if either the economy or the financial markets reacted very badly. What\u2019s more, interest rates are still likely to be on hold for the foreseeable future in the euro-zone and Japan, and both the ECB and the Bank of Japan will probably expand their asset purchases under QE. The EPA has now wrapped up its media call, reports Dominic Rushe. The officials seemed to be a little defensive about the fact that they didn\u2019t spot this issue first. They were keen to point out that most emissions come from heavy diesel vehicles and that is where they have concentrated their - limited - resources to date. But VW just changed that. All manufacturers of smaller vehicles can now expect more stringent monitoring, the officials said. (As a reminder it was two clean air campaigners and West Virginia University who alerted the EPA to discrepencies in the emissions testing) In the US drivers who thought they were doing their bit for the environment by buying diesel cars are understandably angry after the VW scandal erupted. Here are some of their stories: The scale of the fines is massive. VW can be fined under the clean air act, the same act used to fine BP after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Grundler reiterates that the EPA can fine VW up to $37,500 per violation. We are now at the Q&amp;A, reports Dominic: Other manufacturers had been skeptical of VW\u2019s diesel claims, why had the EPA missed this, asks one reporter. Grundler said the EPA was \u201cnot naive\u201d and did not assume that all new technology worked and had tested VW vehicles. \u201cAs you know buried deep within 100m line of software code this company had a sophisticated algorithm to defeat those tests.\u201d The EPA says it is adding additional test to look for defeat devices but carmakers \u201cdon\u2019t need to know\u201d what these tests will entail. America\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the VW scandal last week, is acting to avoid similar cheating in the future, and admitted it needed to change which vehicles it focused on. Acting assistant administrator Janet McCabe has just said in a news conference that the EPA has written to all auto manufacturers today saying that it is stepping up its testing for everyone in the wake of the VW scandal. Christopher Grundler, director of EPA office of transportation and air quality said light diesel vehicles account for less than 1% of diesel vehicles on the road and their focus had been on heavier diesel vehicles which are responsible for the most emissions.That had now changed. \u201cWe are upping our game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have put manufacturers on notice.\u201d After better than expected US GDP figures, consumer confidence has come in broadly in line with expectations. The final University of Michigan consumer sentiment for September was revised up from the preliminary reading of 85.7 to 87.2. This compares to analysts forecasts of 87.1, but is down on August\u2019s 91.9. On Wall Street, markets have joined in the global recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 157 points or nearly 1% higher. Investor sentiment improved after US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen hinted that interest rates could be raised this year, despite being kept on hold last week. This eased fears about slowing global growth which had helped put markets under pressure. Bloomberg says: \u201cThe criteria, outcomes and engineering of cars that missed emissions targets were overseen by managers at Volkswagen\u2019s base in Wolfsburg.\u201d It added that it had no engineers in the US who were able to create mechanism which cheated on the tests. Bloomberg is reporting that Volkswagen executives in Germany controlled key aspects of the emissions tests, whose results the carmaker now admits were faked. VW shares are now down 4%. Volkswagen shares continue to fall, tumbling 3.8%. Its Porsche brand is down 1.7%, while its Audi subsidiary is 2.9% ahead. Other German carmakers have managed to hold on to their gains: BMW shares have risen 4.1% while Daimler is trading 3.4% higher. Volkswagen\u2019s German rival Daimler has issued a statement today saying that its engines comply with emissions standards. It stressed that it does not have software that manipulates emissions tests, like Volkswagen\u2019s diesel cars. Christian B\u00e4umler, of the Christlich-Demokratische Arbeitnehmerschaft (CDA), which describes itself as the social wing of the conservative CDU party, has spoken out against giving former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn a multi-million-euro payoff. This \u201cwould be a kick in the teeth for all employees who work hard for their company,\u201d he told Handelsblatt. Hans-Werner Sinn, president of Munich\u2019s Ifo institute, believes the criticism of Volkswagen is overdone. He argues that the Americans have for decades tried to keep smaller and more efficient diesel engines out of the US market because they did not have the technology themselves, he told German newspaper Handelsblatt. Alexander Traill, partner at risk and insurance law firm BLM, discusses how the new CEO of Volkswagen could be held personally liable for a drop in share price if he doesn\u2019t act quickly to sort out the mess the carmaker is in. Assuming he is appointed, Matthias M\u00fcller may be walking into a liability minefield. First of all, Martin Winterkorn may be held personally liable for the failures that occurred when he was in charge. The fact that he openly accepted responsibility for the irregularities found in the engines won\u2019t help his case, and the prospects of class actions by disgruntled shareholders are significant, particularly if the share price of VW is negatively impacted in the longer term. Mr Winterkorn also faces the matter of assisting and potentially being a subject of any regulatory prosecution both in the US and the UK. The new CEO is now under a huge amount of pressure to rectify the problem. If this is not done quickly enough to avoid a further fall in share price, he could also face the wrath of shareholders as well as becoming embroiled in prolonged regulatory investigations himself. However it is worth remembering that there will be other members of the VW board who may have failed in their responsibilities, so it would not be surprising if we were to see others called out and held accountable for the situation as well.\u201d The news has pushed shares in Volkswagen lower. They are now 3.1% down. The German transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has just announced that 2.8m Volkswagen diesel cars in Germany are affected by the emissions scandal. He said 1.2 litre cars could also be affected. Earlier, he said that light trucks too have been manipulated to cheat emissions tests. The scandal first came to light in the US. He stressed that the manipulation by the German carmaker is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d. In the UK, Greenpeace has written to the government to ask if ministers knew before this month that VW was fixing emissions tests. The environmental group has written to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin and environment secretary Liz Truss, asking four questions: - Did the government know before this month about the existence of so-called \u2018defeat devices\u2019? - If it did, what did it do to combat efforts by car manufacturers to fix emissions tests? - If the government was aware of the existence of \u2018defeat devices\u2019, did it discuss the issue with manufacturers of diesel cars? If so, how many meetings took place, who attended and what was the outcome? - What action did the government take to investigate the reported discrepancies between NOx [nitrogen oxides] measurements registered in testing, and so-called \u2018on the road\u2019 performance, in which NOx emissions were substantially higher? Greenpeace has also published figures showing the extent of lobbying in Brussels by manufacturers of so-called low-emission diesel cars. It said: Publicly available industry data shows that in 2014, manufacturers of diesel vehicles built to comply with the European Union\u2019s new emissions standards, known as Euro 6, spent up to \u20ac18.5m lobbying the EU and employed 184 lobbyists. This included 51 lobbyists who were granted passes giving them access to European Parliament premises. Volkswagen alone employed 43 lobbyists and spent \u20ac3.3m lobbying in Brussels, making it one of the biggest spenders on lobbying in the EU. The figures, drawn from the EU\u2019s voluntary transparency register, are likely to be a conservative estimate of actual lobbying spend as they are provided by the companies themselves and are not independently reviewed.\u201d The US Environmental Protection Agency will give an update on its Volkswagen findings during a media call at 10am EDT (3pm London time). More on earlier news that Norway too is investigating Volkswagen. Its economic and environmental crimes unit Okokrim has launched an investigation into whether the German carmaker, the biggest in the world, has used software in its diesel vehicles for cheating emissions tests in the Nordic country. In light of the revelation of the so-called Volkswagen affair in the United States and Europe, with [the company\u2019s] acknowledgement of extensive cheating, Okokrim will investigate whether there has been a criminal offence in Norway and whether the fraud has had any effect on the cars imported to the country.\u201d VW shares are now down 1.9%, while the company\u2019s supervisory board meeting continues. Analysts at Capital Economics have looked at the impact of the VW scandal on the German economy. Will the VW scandal put the brakes on German growth? ask Roger Bootle and Jonathan Loynes at the UK consultancy. The news last week that Volkswagen had cheated emissions tests prompted speculation that \u201cMade in Germany\u201d branding had been dealt a blow that could seriously jeopardize the economy\u2019s prospects. Given the importance of the car industry to German output and employment, fears about the effects of this on the German economy are understandable. For now, we are inclined to believe that the scandal will pass without any major long-term economic effects. However, short-term damage to business and consumer confidence could offset the boost from recall-related activity. We still see German GDP rising by 1.5% this year and next. But downside risks are mounting.\u201d Volkswagen shares are back in negative territory, dipping 0.5% \u2013 reversing earlier gains of more than 3%. Other German carmakers are still up, though. BMW, hit on Thursday by suggestions that its cars also exceeded emissions standards, has risen 4.7%. The carmaker rejected the claims and the trade magazine behind the report, Auto Bild, admitted that it had no evidence of data manipulation at BMW. European stock markets are still powering ahead. FTSE 100 index in London up 2.5% Dax in Frankfurt up 3.3% CAC in Paris up 3.6% Meanwhile, US economic growth has been revised higher - to an annual rate of 3.9% in the second quarter, from 3.7% estimated previously. Wall Street economists had not expected a revision. This will cement expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates towards the end of the year, as suggested by the central bank\u2019s chief Janet Yellen last night. Volkswagen\u2019s crisis deepens: German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt says that light trucks are also affected by the emissions scandal, according to Reuters. Flash on Reuters: Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board meeting is taking longer than expected, as its 20 directors are discussing a new corporate structure, as well as choosing a new CEO and dismissing other senior executives. Indeed, at least in Germany there are no signs that the Volkswagen scandal has harmed sales of diesel cars. Sebastian Lorenz from car website AutoScout24 has told Reuters that there has not been an impact on demand for new or used VW diesels in Germany, nor has there been an effect on prices. How much will the VW scandal affect sales? According to one retail analyst, not that much. John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, says: Historically, consumers have proved fairly resistant to corporate scandals that do not hit them financially\u2026. The key question is whether the VW scandal is sufficiently damaging for consumers to question the trust and desirability of the brand, or indeed, any other marques that are subsequently implicated. We feel as though this is unlikely.\u201d Stevenson adds: Indeed, if sales were hit, an increase in manufacturer deposit contributions and price reductions is likely to recover demand faster than a PR campaign.\u201d He thinks it may revive a consumer preference for petrol engines, but says car dealerships will prosper either way if VWs are recalled in the UK. As a rule, recalls are great for business, funded by the manufacturers and also bringing all customers back into the garage services business as a catalyst for other incremental work.\u201d Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes: The government has responded to claims of inaction and cover-up after reports that it was informed about the problem a year ago by the ICCT - the body that prompted the VW scandal to erupt in the US. The Department for Transport said it was taking \u201crobust action\u201d but said the report did not provide enough detailed information to act, nor suggest manufacturers were rigging tests through \u201cdefeat devices\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Department is already taking forward the key recommendation of the ICCT report \u2013 actively pushing for the introduction of a real-driving emission test in Europe. Volkswagen USA tweeted an apology to customers last night The ramifications of the Volkswagen emissions scandal may extend far beyond diesel cars. UBS analyst Julie Hudson reckons it could be a step towards the end of the internal combustion engine. Should transport emissions become too difficult to regulate because of the difficulty of amassing accurate data, we think this might go way beyond the diesel engine, to accelerate the demise of the combustion engine.\u201d Over in Athens, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is holding his first cabinet meeting following his triumphant return to power on Sunday, reports Helena Smith. Addressing his 26-member cabinet, the leftist leader said the new government\u2019s motto would be \u201chard work\u201d and its most pressing priority successfully completing a first review of the economy by Greece\u2019s creditors for the way to be opened for talks on debt relief to begin. \u201cWe must be worthy of the choice of Greeks [at the ballot box] in governance by bringing the changes and reforms to the country that the people need to breath again,\u201d he told his ministers. \u201cOur first step will be conducting the first review so that discussion of debt reduction and recapitalisation of banks can begin as soon as possible. A lot will depend on how the economy fares in the future on these two things.\u201d The cabinet, Tsipras said, had a \u201chuge responsibility\u201d to create a new Greece over the space of the next four years, it\u2019s mandate in power - a Greece that would no longer be under international tutelage. \u201cIf, in the first phase of our government we had [to focus on] negotiations [of the latest EU bailout accord for Greece] now we have the difficult job of creating a productive model that will reverse what has happened in recent years and especially the last five years in which the neo-liberal model ghas plunged society into desperation.\u201d Plummeting consumer confidence in diesel cars will benefit hybrid and electric vehicle sales, according to an expert in energy technology at the University of East Anglia. Konstantinos Chalvatzis, a senior lecturer in business and climate change at UEA\u2019s Norwich Business School, said the fallout from the Volkswagen emissions testing scandal will cause a lack of faith in diesel engines, \u201cwhich has been earned over the past decade in Europe.\u201d He argued: While in the past diesel engines were valued for their dependability and modest consumption, during the last decade they have grown to be very powerful and at the same time very efficient. This claim is now in doubt and this will be a huge advantage for manufacturers that have invested in hybrid and electric vehicles. The timing is also quite crucial at a time when numerous European cities, including many in the UK, have started looking into ways to discourage diesel vehicles. The VW scandal will only give them new arguments. \u201cVW has secured sales in a very aggressive market by providing false emissions and consumption data and putting its vehicles at an unfair advantage over those of competitor manufacturers. It is safe to say that other manufacturers will be looking into their legal options on this issue, including requesting compensation for lost profits. Norwegian police are on the case: they will investigate whether Volkswagen has broken any laws in Norway, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, two Chinese joint ventures of Volkswagen have said they are are unaffected by the emissions scandal. Bloomberg News has looked at how \u201cHow VW\u2019s Plan to Win America Backfired\u201d. The news agency writes: Something was different last January when Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn took the stage for his annual speech at the Detroit auto show: He addressed the industry\u2019s most important confab in English. His speech at Fishbone\u2019s, a Cajun restaurant a short walk from both the Chrysler Freeway and the riverfront GM headquarters, was halting, uneven, and read from a script. But at least it wasn\u2019t relayed through a translator, as Winterkorn had typically done in the past. For the 68-year-old executive, the switch was a symbol of his commitment to reversing years of underperformance in the world\u2019s most competitive auto market. The VW brand had just over 2% of US car sales -- a fraction of what Nissan and Toyota have, let alone Ford or GM. \u201cWe are -- and I am -- fully committed to the United States,\u201d Winterkorn said at the show. \u201cWe are putting the Volkswagen brand on track.\u201d ... The scale of the diesel scandal, which has now claimed Winterkorn\u2019s job and wiped about 21 billion euros ($24 billion) off of Volkswagen\u2019s market value, has stunned industry veterans, lawyers, and regulators. How could the German powerhouse do something so wrong, for so long, at such risk? The answer has a lot to do with Winterkorn\u2019s goal of overtaking Toyota Motor Corp. -- producer of the Prius hybrid -- as the world\u2019s No. 1 carmaker. European stock markets are showing no signs of slowing down, boosted by Fed chief Janet Yellen\u2019s comments last night. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, looks ahead to this afternoon\u2019s US GDP figures, the final estimate for the second quarter. Analysts are expecting the 3.7% annual growth rate to be confirmed. In an interesting turn of events, Yellen\u2019s vaguely hawkish comments last night appear to have boosted a previously rate-hike fearing market, causing the abrupt switch from the harsh intra-day losses seen on Thursday to the gung-ho gains of Friday morning. The Dow futures are currently pointing to a near 250 point jump at the US open, the sustainability of which will likely be dictated by this afternoon\u2019s final US second quarter GDP figure. Analysts are expecting the confirmation of the previously provided 3.7%, a healthy number that likely enhances the chances of an October or December lift-off [in rates] (even if August\u2019s China-chaos could cause a starkly different picture for the Q3 figure). How the Dow Jones reacts to this number should be enlightening; for the majority of 2015 any positive piece of US data has been a price-eroding factor for investors fearing the effects of a rate-hike. Yet today seems like the markets view of an increase in interest rates might be changing. The Dow will likely also be lifted by a stellar start to the day from Nike, with the company\u2019s shares rising 8% after hours on Thursday following its superb, China-boosted, first quarter report.\u201d According to German reports, Rupert Stadler - one of the contenders for the top job at Volkswagen - will remain in his post as head of the group\u2019s Audi subsidiary. Meanwhile, J\u00fcrgen Stackmann, who runs the Seat subsidiary in Spain, is to be appointed to VW\u2019s management board as its new sales chief, trade magazine Auto Motor und Sport reported. \u201cYeah right\u201d \u2013 independent City analyst Louise Cooper\u2019s reaction to the claims from carmakers (e.g. BMW) that they don\u2019t cheat on their emissions testing. She writes in City am: The German transport minister is as sceptical promising at a press conference Thursday that his department will be carrying out random tests on other cars, not just VW ones. Three things have struck me since this story began. Firstly quite how much the software cheated \u2013 emissions were up to forty times higher when the device was turned off. VW official diesel emissions data was not that different to other car makers, so either they\u2019ve been cheating too or their engines are way more advanced than VWs (and is that likely?).\u201d Companies don\u2019t admit fraud. VW didn\u2019t freely admit mea cupla \u2013 the regulator forced the information out of it. As it will be with the other car makers. Of course, as an owner of a Ford Focus with a diesel engine, I would like to be proved wrong. I\u2019d like to think better of human nature.\u201d A group of Greenpeace activists are demonstrating outside Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg in central Germany, holding up signs saying \u201cNo more lies!\u201d. German media are reporting that VW\u2019s former chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who stood down on Wednesday, wants to keep his job as boss of Porsche Automobil Holding \u2013 the holding company that controls 50.7% of the shares in the Volkswagen group. But he faces strong opposition from some board directors at Porsche. One told magazine Der Spiegel: \u201cThis is a conflict of interests. Herr Winterkorn has to give up this position.\u201d European stock markets are continuing their rise this morning, after US Fed chief Janet Yellen shed more clarity on the US interest rate outlook, by saying that rates would probably be raised before the end of the year. US markets are also expected to open higher. FTSE 100 index in London up 2.4% at 6103.48 Dax in Frankfurt up 2.8% at 9692.76 CAC in Paris up 3.3% at 4489.28 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: By resetting those expectations she appears to have given reassurance to investors about timings, but ultimately she hasn\u2019t really said anything new, and last night\u2019s speech appears to have been nothing more than a sop to the market, which continues to behave like a petulant child that constantly needs parental reassurance. She went on to play down the risks emanating from a China slowdown in contrast to last week\u2019s statement and the markets appear to have liked the more upbeat tone, but she still left plenty of wiggle room in case events don\u2019t pan out as expected, by stating that any decision would still be data dependant. While markets appear to have taken comfort from the slightly clearer tone last night a lot can change between now and October and or December, and recent data does suggest that the Fed\u2019s timetable could well be blown off course. US Q2 GDP is expected to be confirmed at 3.7%, while all eyes will be on speeches by Federal Reserve members James Bullard and Esther George later today. They are avowed hawks so they are likely to reinforce the message given to markets by Janet Yellen last night about a rise in rates this year. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FxPro, says: Once again mixed messages from Janet Yellen have presented investors with a binary situation on interest rates in 2015. The impression the market has taken from her speech at the University of Michigan last night is that it\u2019s more likely than not that the Federal Reserve will start its monetary tightening this year, however they are keeping the door open to maintaining rates at their historical lows in case the global picture worsens . This means that investors need to not only monitor US data very closely, but the situation across the other major economies in particular Asia.\u201d A brand consultancy estimates that the VW brand, valued earlier this year at $31bn, has lost $10bn in value since the emissions scandal erupted. Germany\u2019s national brand has also been tarnished. David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance, gives his view on the scandal. At Brand Finance\u2019s last calculation VW\u2019s brand value stood at just over $31bn, making it the world\u2019s third most valuable auto brand. It appeared to be motoring ahead\u2026 The apparent ease with which the company\u2019s activities were uncovered makes it all the more astonishing that VW was willing to endanger its most valuable asset. Rather than \u2018Das Auto\u2019, VW\u2019s motto might be more appropriate if changed to \u2018Crass Auto\u2019. That such an iconic German brand, the \u2018people\u2019s car\u2019, could behave in this way threatens to undo decades of accumulated goodwill and cast aspersions over the practices of German industry, making the Siemens bribery scandal appear less a one-off than evidence of a broader malaise. With reports that BMW has been implicated too, the damage to Germany\u2019s nation brand could become critical. Germany\u2019s status as the world\u2019s most powerful nation brand is under threat.\u201d In the UK, Labour has waded into the VW emissions scandal. Lilian Greenwood, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: Ministers must come clean and admit when they were first told about the diesel emissions scandal. \u200eThe International Council on Clean Transportation, the body which helped to expose the problem, warned a year ago that dangerously high levels of nitrogen oxide emissions were not confined to America. It is unacceptable that the Government waited this long to take action. Over recent days the Department for Transport has been forced to perform a series of screeching \u200eu-turns. After initially saying that only the European Commission could conduct an investigation, Patrick McLoughlin has been forced to backtrack, but after this latest revelation there can be little faith in the Department\u2019s response. Poor air quality is a growing problem in our towns and cities but the Government is in chaos on this issue, and it is becoming increasingly clear that real leadership was needed on this issue at least a year ago.\u201d The FTSE 100 index is now trading nearly 2.2% higher at 6091.22, boosted by commodity stocks such as copper and crude oil prices. Mining giant Glencore is one of the top risers, rising as much as 5%, after hitting a fresh record low on Thursday when Goldman Sachs cut its target price for the stock. Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.6% ahead at 9672.69 while France\u2019s CAC has gained 2.9% to 4473.54. The euro has lost more than 1% against the dollar, falling to $1.1116, after Fed chief Janet Yellen said it was likely that US interest rates would be raised before the end of the year. She said in a speech in Amherst, Massachusetts, last night: I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further and inflation moves back to our 2% objective.\u201d The dollar is rallying against a number of currencies and is on track for its best week in more than two months. It had hit a three-week low against a basket of major currencies when the Fed failed to raise rates at its September meeting. Some say that if Porsche boss Matthias M\u00fcller gets the top job at Volkswagen as expected, he may be a temporary CEO until another internal candidate, the company\u2019s brand chief Herbert Diess has proved himself. Diess is a newcomer, having joined from BMW in July, but won praise for the work he did there as a senior executive \u2013 including ruthless cost-cutting. Volkswagen\u2019s new CEO, to be announced later today, faces the task of steering the company through its worst crisis in its 78-year-history. One of the questions the board will have to consider in choosing a new boss is how he will deal with regulators in the US, for example if he is hauled in front of a committee there. The scandal deepened on Thursday, as US and European authorities stepped up their investigations. Germany\u2019s transport minister said that Volkswagen had also manipulated emissions tests in Europe. At least 27 US state attorneys have kicked off a multi-state investigation of the carmaker over the emissions scandal, and will send subpoenas to the company, according to Reuters. Maryland attorney general Brian Frosh said: I am furious that the world\u2019s leading car company wilfully took steps that polluted our environment and deceived consumers. Some 11m diesel cars around the world had software fitted to cheat emissions tests, but it was not activated in most of them, Volkswagen has said. It faces criminal investigations and class-action lawsuits from customers, and possibly shareholders. Bavarian carmaker BMW has also been dragged into the scandal, with a report \u2013 swiftly rejected by the company \u2013 that some of its cars also exceeded emission standards sending its shares tumbling on Thursday. They recovered this morning to trade 5% higher. Audi was up 1.4%, Porsche 0.7% and shares in the Volkswagen group gained nearly 3%. Credit ratings agency Fitch placed Volkswagen on \u201cnegative watch\u201d for a possible downgrade two days ago, which would make it more expensive for the company to borrow money. Emmanuel Bulle, senior director at the rating agency, said this morning that the company could weather a regulatory penalty of $10-20bn. He stressed, however, that the main issue is the long-term impact on Volkswagen\u2019s relationship with customers and regulators. The world\u2019s biggest carmaker could face an $18bn penalty in the US over cheating government pollution tests. Bulle told Bloomberg TV: That is something that they could afford. it would be a huge blow but they could survive. This could lead to a downgrade of one or two notches in VW\u2019s credit rating. But, he said, on top of that there is reputational damage. If there is a huge loss of faith in the company, that could lead to a further downgrade. We don\u2019t know for sure what consumers will do, what regulators will do. Volkswagen admitted to US regulators that some of its diesel cars were equipped with software designed to evade emissions tests. It has said it would set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) to cover the costs of the scandal. European stock markets have opened higher, but are still on track for a weekly loss after the Volkwagen scandal. VW shares are up 3.6%, and Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 1.8% in early trading. The FTSE 100 index in London is trading nearly 90 points higher, up 1.47% at 6048.63. France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s Ibex have both gained 1.7% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is up 1.9%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Last night\u2019s speech by Fed chief Janet Yellen certainly kept the Fed\u2019s options open for a rate rise this year, saying that most participants on the FOMC expected an \u201cinitial increase in the federal funds rate later this year\u201d but if the economy surprises them then judgements might change. Translation, we may raise rates, but then we might not. Later today we will get the final reading for US second-quarter GDP, which is expected to be confirmed at an annual rate of 3.7%, but these numbers won\u2019t tell us anything new about where the US economy is now, he noted. Good morning. The Volkswagen emissions test scandal which has engulfed the global car industry continues to unfold. It is the worst corporate scandal in Germany for years, and could prove to be a bigger threat to chancellor Angela Merkel than the Greece debt crisis. All eyes are on Volkswagen\u2019s 20-member supervisory board today, which is holding a crisis meeting at the carmaker\u2019s HQ in Wolfsburg to choose a successor to Martin Winterkorn. Winterkorn, who had been chief executive since 2007, quit on Wednesday, but insisted that he was not involved in the scandal. Matthias M\u00fcller, the 62-year-old boss of VW\u2019s Porsche sports car division, has emerged as the favourite to replace Winterkorn. Reuters reported last night that VW\u2019s former head product strategist is backed by a majority of directors on the board. You can find out more about the runners and riders for the job here. More heads could roll at the carmaker, with German reports that the research and development chiefs of Audi and Porsche, Ulrich Hackenberg and Wolfgang Hatz, could get their marching orders, along with Volkswagen\u2019s US chief executive Michael Horn and Heinz-Jakob Neu\u00dfer, head of VW brand development. We\u2019ll be tracking the latest developments through the day....",

Diess would also be the best choice for shareholders who would like other changes (cost/capital allocation etc.) after the EPA scandal has been dealt with.</p> </blockquote> <p>Warburton has also put himself forward:</p> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not obvious that VW has the ideal candidate, so I\u2019ve dropped my name in to the hat by sending my CV over to Wolfsburg. I\u2019m waiting for the call, but I have to accept that they\u2019ll probably choose someone internally.</p> </blockquote> <p>So he has laid out a plan for the new chief executive, whoever it may be:</p> <blockquote> <p>VW needs to think big and bold. There are five steps that I would recommend:</p> <p>(1) offer to buy back and scrap every 2.0 diesel sold in the US \u2013 all 482,000 of them (cost: around $6bn)</p> <p>(2) announce that VW will henceforth abandon all efforts to sell diesel engines in the US, but will embrace gasoline and PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles)</p> <p>(3) send the new chief executive to the US on Monday to meet government officials, the EPA and media</p> <p>(4) announce the immediate suspension of the 100 engineers mostly closely linked with the engine and software development</p> <p>(5) announce the cessation of all motorsport activities immediately, turning all the funding over to electric vehicles, PHEV and environmental research \u2013 in a new research facility located in the US, employing US engineers. That will begin to stabilize the US situation. VW can then turn its attention to addressing European concerns.</p> <p>While this scandal is hugely damaging we believe the financial impact on VW will ultimately be lower than some of the headline numbers. We do not expect VW to face fines in Europe. We believe the long-run earnings power will recover. The whole industry will now face new compliance costs, not just VW. There is value here for the brave, long-term minded investor. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-560561b6e4b08c512dd60b7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-25T15:08:03.306Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Global markets continue to recover strongly following the comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Thursday hinting that interest rates could yet rise before the end of the year.</strong></p> <p>As a reminder, markets took fright last week when the Fed kept rates on hold, on the basis there must be real concern at the central bank about the outlook for the global economy.</p> <p>But Yellen\u2019s remarks have given some reassurance, helping push the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.2%. The FTSE 100 is 2.5% better while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 3% - despite the VW scandal - and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.5%.</p> <p>Julian Jessop Chief Global Economist at Capital Economics explains why he thinks the Yellen comments have soothed investor fears:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fed Chair Janet Yellen used a speech last night to send a pretty clear signal that US interest rates are still likely to be raised later this year, despite the hesitancy last week. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, given that 13 of the 17 Federal Open Market Committee officials are already on record as expecting to hike no later than December. What\u2019s more, the positive tone in equity and commodity markets today in the wake of Yellen\u2019s comments supports our view that the gradual lifting of US rates from emergency lows might actually reassure investors about the global economic outlook.</p> <p> At first sight, any tightening in US monetary policy would be bad news for global asset markets. However, this takes no account of the context in which the Fed would be raising rates. A number of points are worth repeating. First, the Fed\u2019s failure to raise rates at the September FOMC meeting, rather than being reassuring, simply reinforced investors\u2019 concerns about the health of the world economy. The corollary is that a December rate hike would be a welcome vote of confidence.</p> <p> Second, even our relatively hawkish forecasts would still leave US rates at low levels by past standards (perhaps 2% at end-2016 and 3.5% at end-2017). There can also be little doubt that the Fed would go back on hold much sooner if either the economy or the financial markets reacted very badly. What\u2019s more, interest rates are still likely to be on hold for the foreseeable future in the euro-zone and Japan, and both the ECB and the Bank of Japan will probably expand their asset purchases under QE.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56055cffe4b090648ceb474d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominic-rushe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-25T14:48:51.910Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The EPA has now wrapped up its media call, reports Dominic Rushe.</p> <blockquote> <p>The officials seemed to be a little defensive about the fact that they didn\u2019t spot this issue first.

Ocado, the online retailer which delivers Waitrose goods, has contacted its top customers urging them to book a slot for festive food deliveries from 8 October \u2013 a full 11 weeks before Christmas and a week earlier than last year. Loyal shoppers who have paid for a priority shopping pass and are prepared to spend at least \u00a390 on their order are being given a chance to reserve their delivery slot before anyone else and offered potential free delivery on 20 December. Waitrose.com has also begun contacting shoppers about how to book a delivery slot for Christmas \u2013 it will be open for bookings from 15 October \u2013 fully 10 weeks before the big day. Shoppers expressed consternation on social media, with Ocado facing criticism for offering some customers\u2019 priority depending on the kind of annual delivery pass they have signed up for and how long they have been signed up. The two supermarkets are wrestling for customers as the battle for online sales will be hotter than ever among the UK\u2019s top grocers this year. While sales are falling in big supermarkets, they are rising online and all the big players want to ensure as large a slice of the action as possible. Tesco said shoppers who had signed up to its Delivery Saver scheme \u2013 in which they pay a monthly subscription for as many deliveries as they want over a year \u2013 would be able to book their Christmas delivery slot from the end of November \u2013 about a week earlier than other shoppers.

Sainsbury\u2019s is not giving its annual delivery pass shoppers priority on festive orders \u2013 anyone can book a slot three weeks in advance of when they want to receive their shopping. Asda has yet to confirm its plans. The rush to secure orders over the most important week of the year for UK retailers comes after a series of glitches and disrupted deliveries last year. Just a few days before Christmas, Sainsbury\u2019s accidentally cancelled hundreds of online orders after a computer failure while Waitrose.com shoppers were also let down after a glitch on the website.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A disabled teenager killed himself on the same day that the payday loans company Wonga cleared out his bank account, it has been revealed. An inquest heard that Kane Sparham-Price, 18, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, had \u201cnumerous problems including those connected with his mental health\u201d and spent much of his life in foster care and care homes. The teenager took out loans through Wonga\u2019s website after he turned 18 and left local authority care. He was found dead in February 2013 after the loans company took payments for his debts under the terms he had signed up to, leaving his bank account empty. There is no suggestion that Wonga acted unlawfully or was aware it had left Sparham-Price penniless, but a coroner\u2019s report, which has recently been unearthed, called for a change to payday loan rules to prevent similar deaths in the future. John Pollard, the senior coroner for south Manchester, said in the report, which was uncovered by Disability News Service last week: \u201cHe was left with no money in his account and no means of borrowing any more. Whilst I accept that the various payday lenders are legally entitled to \u2018clear out\u2019 someone\u2019s bank account if money is owing to them, it struck me that there ought to be a statutory minimum amount which MUST be left in an account (say \u00a310) to avoid absolute destitution; and as I understand you set and regulate the rules, you might look at this with a view to preventing further deaths.\u201d The report was sent to the Financial Conduct Authority 12 months ago. In the FCA\u2019s response last October, the chief executive, Martin Wheatley, said introducing such changes would be \u201cundesirable\u201d because it would include the potential for breaching a customer\u2019s privacy, as well as the possibility of incurring extra bank charges if a payment was refused. Wheatley added, however, that the FCA had already taken action to restrict continuous payment authorities (CPAs) as part of new rules on payday loans. This meant that lenders such as Wonga were no longer allowed to make more than two attempts to use a CPA to take a repayment or use a CPA to take a part-payment, as in the case of Sparham-Price. He said: \u201cWe found that some lenders were using CPAs as a debt collection method and that some consumers were left in significant difficulties and unable to pay for essentials such as food and heating. \u201cThis restriction should mitigate the likelihood of lenders \u2018clearing out\u2019 a consumer\u2019s account, as payment will only be taken where the amount can be taken in full.\u201d In a statement, Wonga said: \u201cWe were sorry to hear of the tragic death of Mr Sparham-Price. We take our responsibilities to our customers very seriously and we have strict lending criteria in place. \u201cWe conducted a full review of this case at the time to confirm we acted according to regulatory guidelines and to continue to improve our engagement with customers.\u201d Wonga agreed with the FCA in October to make \u201csignificant\u201d changes to its business because it was \u201cnot taking adequate steps to assess customers\u2019 ability to meet repayments in a sustainable manner\u201d. This meant that hundreds of thousands of Wonga customers subsequently had their outstanding loans written off. \u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

He was found dead in February 2013 after the loans company took payments for his debts under the terms he had signed up to, leaving his bank account empty.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that Wonga acted unlawfully or was aware it had left Sparham-Price penniless, but a coroner\u2019s report, which has recently been unearthed, called for a change to payday loan rules to prevent similar deaths in the future.</p> <p>John Pollard, the senior coroner for south Manchester, said in the report, which was <a href=\"http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/teenager-killed-himself-hours-after-wonga-cleared-out-his-bank-account/\">uncovered by Disability News Service</a> last week: \u201cHe was left with no money in his account and no means of borrowing any more. Whilst I accept that the various payday lenders are legally entitled to \u2018clear out\u2019 someone\u2019s bank account if money is owing to them, it struck me that there ought to be a statutory minimum amount which MUST be left in an account (say \u00a310) to avoid absolute destitution; and as I understand you set and regulate the rules, you might look at this with a view to preventing further deaths.\u201d</p> <p>The report was sent to the Financial Conduct Authority 12 months ago. In <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-0463-Response-by-Financial-Conduct-Authority.pdf\">the FCA\u2019s response</a> last October, the chief executive, Martin Wheatley, said introducing such changes would be \u201cundesirable\u201d because it would include the potential for breaching a customer\u2019s privacy, as well as the possibility of incurring extra bank charges if a payment was refused.<br></p> <p>Wheatley added, however, that the FCA had already taken action to restrict continuous payment authorities (CPAs) as part of new rules on payday loans. This meant that lenders such as Wonga were no longer allowed to make more than two attempts to use a CPA to take a repayment or use a CPA to take a part-payment, as in the case of Sparham-Price.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cWe found that some lenders were using CPAs as a debt collection method and that some consumers were left in significant difficulties and unable to pay for essentials such as food and heating.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis restriction should mitigate the likelihood of lenders \u2018clearing out\u2019 a consumer\u2019s account, as payment will only be taken where the amount can be taken in full.\u201d<br></p> <p>In a statement, Wonga said: \u201cWe were sorry to hear of the tragic death of Mr Sparham-Price. We take our responsibilities to our customers very seriously and we have strict lending criteria in place.<br></p> <p> \u201cWe conducted a full review of this case at the time to confirm we acted according to regulatory guidelines and to continue to improve our engagement with customers.\u201d</p> <p>Wonga <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/news/wonga-major-changes-to-affordability-criteria\">agreed with the FCA in October</a> to make \u201csignificant\u201d changes to its business because it was \u201cnot taking adequate steps to assess customers\u2019 ability to meet repayments in a sustainable manner\u201d. This meant that hundreds of thousands of Wonga customers subsequently had their outstanding loans written off.</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is <a href=\"tel:1-800-273-8255\">1-800-273-8255</a>.

      "bodyText": "The US economy grew faster than previously thought in the second quarter of the year, according to new figures that have fanned expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of 2015. Government data suggested the world\u2019s biggest economy grew at an annual pace of 3.9% between April and June, exceeding economists\u2019 expectations for the GDP estimate to stay unchanged at 3.7%. It marked an even stronger bounceback from the sluggish 0.6% growth recorded in the opening months of 2015 when an especially harsh winter hit economic activity. The report followed comments on Thursday from the head of the US central bank, Janet Yellen, who said she could start raising borrowing costs from their record low \u201clater this year\u201d. The dollar strengthened against other currencies and US stock markets rallied after the upward revision to GDP, which the Commerce Department said was largely driven by consumer spending being stronger than previously thought. Economists said the figures left the door open for the US central bank to raise interest rates from their current record low of close to zero at policy meetings in October or December. \u201cYellen has confirmed a hike can still occur in 2015, so speculation over a December move is currently rife in the market \u2013 with short-term dollar bulls hoping for an October move,\u201d said Alex Lydall, senior trader at foreign exchange business Foenix Partners. \u201cWith the exception of inflation, economic indicators are still solid for the domestic economy in the US, so the pertinent question remains: will the Fed risk looking irresponsible and delay rate hikes into 2016, or will they take the plunge this year, with perhaps a more cautious hike than the expected 0.25%? The jury is still out.\u201d The Federal Reserve held off raising borrowing costs at its policy meeting last week as it cited volatility in the global economy. But Yellen indicated in a speech on Thursday this week that there was a still a good chance the first hike for almost a decade could come before the year is out. She said US economic prospects \u201cgenerally appear solid\u201d and it was best not to wait too long to tighten policy, which has been ultra-loose since the global financial crisis. However, some experts noted that GDP figures did not give the most up-to-date picture of the economy\u2019s performance and that more timely economic indicators painted a gloomier picture. The revision had \u201clittle bearing on US policy\u201d, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic data company Markit, which tracks business activity in the US and other economies. \u201cIt does little to change the story that the economy rebounded strongly in the spring after the weak patch seen earlier in the year. More important are the forward-looking indicators, which include a number of red flag warnings that growth is slowing amid headwinds of the strong dollar, slumping oil prices, financial market volatility and emerging market jitters,\u201d he added. \u201cThe more up-to-date survey data play into the hands of dovish policymakers and will reduce the odds of interest rates rising any time soon.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The extradition hearing of Navinder Singh Sarao, the British trader accused of contributing to a so-called flash crash in financial markets, has been put back until February. The London-based trader, who is accused by the US authorities of market manipulation, appeared in Westminster magistrates court for what was expected to be a hearing into his possible extradition. Sarao, arrested by British police on a US warrant in April, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 criminal counts including wire fraud, commodities fraud, commodity price manipulation and attempted price manipulation. The hearing was put back after the court heard that Sarao\u2019s barrister, James Lewis QC, had injured himself when leaving home on the morning before the court hearing. A new extradition request was also presented to the court by Mark Summers QC, for the US government, extending the dates of the allegations by six months. Judge Quentin Purdy told Sarao he should have time to prepare in light of the new dates and set 4 and 5 February for the new hearing. The former bank worker and Brunel University student, who lives and worked at his parents\u2019 modest home in Hounslow near Heathrow, is accused of using an automated trading program to \u201cspoof\u201d markets by generating large sell orders that pushed down prices. He then cancelled those trades and bought contracts at lower prices, prosecutors say. The flash crash saw the Dow Jones industrial average briefly plunge more than 1,000 points on 6 May 2010, temporarily wiping out nearly $1tn in market value. US prosecutors say his criminal activities netted him about $40m profit and if convicted he faces a long jail term \u2013 the maximum sentences for the charges amount to hundreds of years in prison. The 36-year-old has already spent four months behind bars after failing to meet \u00a35m bail terms because his assets had been frozen. He was finally released earlier this month after US authorities agreed he could be released on bail of \u00a350,000. Sarao denied any wrongdoing in May, telling the court: \u201cI\u2019ve not done anything wrong apart from being good at my job.\u201d The court has been told that despite his modest lifestyle, he had funds of more than \u00a330m, including \u00a325.5m held in Switzerland and \u00a35m in a US escrow account. Sarao spoke only to confirm his name, age and address and to say that he did not accept extradition. His counsel Joel Smith said the legal team had only been informed of the new extradition warrant on Thursday night. \u201cMr Sarao is understandably distressed. His mental health is fragile. It adds to the stress and strain these proceedings have put on him,\u201d Smith said. The case has been adjourned until October 22 for legal argument ahead of the hearing in February.",

      "bodyText": "When Ashley Scarpa, a Lakeland, Florida, restaurateur and environmental volunteer, bought a Volkswagen Passat diesel last year she thought she was doing her bit for the planet. Now she feels like a jilted lover. After revelations that VW gamed its emissions monitors to make 11m of its cars seem greener than they were \u2013 a move that may be responsible for adding nearly 1m tonnes of air pollution every year \u2013 she is understandably upset. \u201cI was partial to VW, and they had a little bit of an edge in the buying process, but that\u2019s all changed,\u201d Scarpa said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re breaking up. We can either be friends or hate each other. Maybe we\u2019ll even get back together, but not right now.\u201d \u201cI hope they make a decision quickly and figure out what to do to make this right,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my opinion, that will make or break our relationship.\u201d In the meantime, she has no choice but to keep driving the car she thought was an environmentally sound choice when she chose it over hybrid models. \u201cLowering my carbon footprint was major for me and was a selling point, so I\u2019m really upset,\u201d she said, adding that she would have to drive to do volunteer work with an organization that helps sea turtles on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted that I have to drive my polluting vehicle two hours on the freeway to get there.\u201d Scarpa is not alone. Volkswagen is still a niche player in the US, where it has done much to promote its image as a green company. Until the scandal broke the company was running ads that depicted Tanner Foust, a Volkswagen rally driver and host on Top Gear USA, driving elderly women around in a TDI Volkswagen. The spots were meant to dispel myths about diesel, that they were dirty and loud. All of VW\u2019s clean diesel ads have now been removed from the automaker\u2019s official YouTube channel. On VW\u2019s Facebook page and on other online forums that cater to Volkswagen fans, there have been numerous comments posted by people angry about the automaker\u2019s dishonesty. \u201cAs a someone who has owned, driven and loved Volkswagens for more than 40 years, because of your criminal actions, I will probably NEVER buy another. #BoycottVW Shame on you,\u201d Gary Oliver posted. Marciamallow, a user on the Volkswagen Owner\u2019s Club forum, said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe Volkswagen pulled this stunt. Very disappointed.\u201d The disappointment is understandable. Volkswagen\u2019s green push went beyond mere advertising. In a sustainability report it released last year, the automaker pledged that by 2018 it would be \u201cthe world\u2019s most environmentally compatible automaker\u201d. In the report\u2019s environmental section, it says: \u201cThe Volkswagen Group has a long tradition of resolute commitment to environmental protection.\u201d \u201cKnowing what we now know, every other sentence is cringeworthy,\u201d Linda Greer, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s (NRDC) health and environment program, said. \u201cThe basic upshot of this 156-page report is how much they care and how much they\u2019re doing for the environment.\u201d Greer, who owned a succession of three Volkswagens \u2013 including her first car \u2013 over two decades before switching to a Toyota Prius, called VW\u2019s intentional shirking of emissions rules unforgivable. But she also said it was a window into the sometimes shadowy world of corporate social responsibility reports. The reports, which can be light on facts and numbers, can be used to greenwash a company\u2019s reputation. \u201cNot every company that does social responsibility reporting does this, but it really casts a shadow on the voluntary corporate social responsibility movement,\u201d she said, adding that Volkswagen\u2019s report read like an extended infomercial. \u201cPutting myself in the shoes of all those VW diesel owners, I would feel utterly deceived. A lot of people bought those cars because of their fuel economy and emissions.\u201d NRDC also said this week that US taxpayers also have reason to feel betrayed, alleging that Volkswagen accepted tens of millions in clean energy subsidies from the federal government for promises it failed to keep. Another trial the VW diesel crowd faces is in the coming weeks and months is what will become of their cars\u2019 resale values. But it may not be the time to seek out screaming deals on used Volkswagen diesels. Matt DeLorenzo, from Kelley Blue Book, said that it will take a while for the issue to sort itself out, both in terms of resale value and what the EPA will expect for emissions testing. The long-term impact of the Volkswagen scandal remains to be seen but diesel, which has struggled to gain the market share it has in Europe, is likely to take another hit. General Motors is often credited for turning an entire generation sour on diesel engines after cranking out a number of its notoriously underpowered and unreliable Oldsmobile diesels between 1978 and 1985. DeLorenzo doesn\u2019t think the Volkswagen fiasco will have as much negative punch but it won\u2019t help. \u201cIt\u2019ll certainly have people looking less favorably at diesels than they were two weeks ago,\u201d he said, adding that the diesel pickup truck crowd was unlikely to be fazed. DeLorenzo predicted that many brand loyalists would stick with Volkswagen as the scandal played out but that the newer converts would be most turned off by the whole affair. The real impact the automaker, he said, was in terms of development funds. \u201cThe money they\u2019re going to be spending on recalls and litigation should be going toward product,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to put them at a competitive disadvantage when other automakers are spending money on product and moving forward.\u201d Regardless of the manufacturer\u2019s woes, many customers are left with the blue funk of betrayal, and cars of uncertain future.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The housing bill expected in October is surely the time to set out some radical, long-term policies which could truly reform the market. It will be a terrible missed opportunity if instead the bill seeks only to implement the short-term home ownership measures so prominent in the election campaign. These policies supported an aspiration of doubling the number of first-time buyers compared with the previous five years. \u201cStarter homes\u201d are to be sold at a discount of 20% to first-time buyers under 40, financed by reducing the requirement for infrastructure funding from developers. To deliver the goal of 200,000 starter homes built by 2020, this has been extended beyond the original scope of using brownfield sites not previously identified for housing. So now it amounts to a subsidy for 200,000 fortunate households, at the cost of inadequate infrastructure provision and with less assurance that these units will add to previously planned supply. The second key policy is the right to buy for housing association tenants. This has raised a large number of concerns, most notably about the forced sale of charitable assets and about the proposed financing method of selling off more expensive social housing. But there are other worries. Home ownership can be onerous. We know that at some future date there will be another economic downturn, bringing rising unemployment and for some households a struggle to meet their mortgages. It is vital that the mortgages offered to those benefiting from starter homes or right to buy meet the prudent affordability criteria set out in the Mortgage Market Review. A housing market downturn brings costs for government, as well as for borrowers and lenders; we should avoid adding to these risks. However, the real case against these policies to promote home ownership is that they fail to address the underlying issue. It\u2019s a tempting goal, as the majority of households would like to own their own home. But above a certain proportion of income, high housing costs lead to financial stress for the less well-off. Only reducing house prices relative to incomes will give us long-term, sustainable higher rates of home ownership, as well as easing the burden on hard-pressed renters. In the July budget, George Osborne announced a sensible housing market measure, by setting out a reduction in the tax relief for mortgage interest for buy-to-let landlords. This should tilt the market back towards homeowners, without driving up demand, and by pre-announcing a gradual reduction the market will not be disrupted. Now we urgently need a further package of radical but gradual measures, aiming to increase supply and to use the tax system to make housing less attractive as an investment. This would improve affordability for first-time buyers and result in the housing space we do have being shared more fairly. There are 1.1m households in England and Wales in overcrowded homes, yet 8.1m households have two or more spare bedrooms. Nothing wrong with spare rooms \u2013 but if a home is underoccupied with a view to reaping the benefit of rising prices, this is a cost to wider society. The planning system implicitly supposes more housing supply has an environmental cost yet owner-occupied homes are exempt from capital gains tax and increasingly from inheritance tax. What is the least that should be in this package? Reinforcing recent planning reforms, to give real teeth to the duty to cooperate between local authorities, ensuring that housing demand, from population growth and rising incomes, is met across housing market areas. An immediate start on the search for sites suitable and locally acceptable for new settlements \u2013 probably called garden cities/villages. Greater financial incentives from central government to local authorities who accommodate higher rates of new housing. Reforming council tax, so that it reflects changing property values and phasing out the single-person discount. More financial freedom for local authorities to build council houses. Better regulation of standards in the private rented sector \u2013 a tenure now housing many disadvantaged families. Most controversial: taking the opportunity of the council tax property revaluation to introduce capital gains tax on future house price rises. This would set a clear agenda for the long term. It could command cross-party support. It would be a bill introduced by politicians ready to look beyond the easy headlines of support for a few first-time buyers today. It would be a principled acceptance of the costs of unpopular decisions now, because in the long-run the benefits for younger generations (and indeed for all of us by cutting the housing benefit bill) would be so important. The electoral outlook is pretty good for the Conservatives. It would be such great news to see this political capital used for this package, to support the economy and for many to bring huge gains in their wellbeing.

Policymakers are scrutinising the booming buy-to-let sector for any moves by lenders to make it easier for would-be landlords to obtain loans. They are also concerned that a rapid fall in house prices could force landlords to sell their properties, exacerbating the decline. The Bank said the \u201cdownside risks\u201d to stability have increased since July and pointed to the market volatility sparked by gyrations on China\u2019s stock market in August, highlighting so-called Chinese Black Monday when the FTSE 100 index of leading stocks lost more than \u00a360bn. It is commissioning analysis on such contagion and impact of computer trading strategies. In its quarterly update on potential risks to the financial markets, the bank said it was not taking any immediate action to cool the buy-to-let market, where the mortgages are usually riskier interest-only loans. But it said it was looking at whether the buy-to-let boom could magnify falls and rises in house prices. The Bank published data showing that buy-to-let mortgage lending has increased by more than 40% since the 2008 banking crisis, while owner-occupied lending has increased by 2% over the same period. \u201cBuy-to-let mortgage lending has the potential to amplify the housing and credit cycles, though the extent of the amplification is hard to judge because the market has only recently grown to significant levels. Any increase in buy-to-let activity in an upswing could add further pressure to house prices,\u201d the financial policy committe (FPC) said. \u201cBuy-to-let investors may further exacerbate a downturn if they expect rental incomes to fall below their interest payments, and consequently add to selling pressure.\u201d The FPC said there was evidence that 40% of buy-to-let investors would respond to a fall in their rental income below their interest payments by selling their property. Set up by the coalition government, the FPC was created in response to the banking crisis and designed to spot potential threats to financial stability. It first said it was monitoring the buy-to-let sector in July, when it also outlined concerns about the level of household debt. In its latest update, the Bank said the rapid growth of buy to let backed its call for the government to give it powers to intervene in the market \u2013 just as it can with residential mortgages. A consultation is scheduled to take place this year. It said: \u201cThe FPC is alert to the rapid growth of the market and potential developments in underwriting standards. As the market continues to grow, particularly if driven by loosening of underwriting standards, the sector could pose risks to broader financial stability, both through credit risk to banks and the amplification of movements in the housing market. Intensified competition among lenders could lead to loosening underwriting standards in future.\u201d The FPC also conducted an annual review of the impact of help to buy on the sector \u2013 announced in March 2013 and helping buyers with deposit of just 5% of their property. It concluded that \u201cthe scheme does not pose material risks to financial stability\u201d. It also looks at global risks and in its latest analysis it pointed to the potential lessons from 24 August \u2013 Chinese Black Monday \u2013 when there were more than 1,000 temporary suspensions on individual equities on the New York Stock Exchange. The FPC has commissioned analysis from the Financial Conduct Authority of the way contagion spreads between markets. \u201cThe committee is alert to the possibility that future heightened volatility and reductions in market depth could have more widespread and persistent effects, including on the provision of credit to the real economy,\u201d the FPC said. In July, the FPC had been concerned about the precarious position of Greece but concluded that the risk had abated. \u201cHowever, other downside risks to UK financial stability stemming from the global environment, and to which the United Kingdom as a global financial centre is exposed, have increased. These risks come from both China and emerging market economies more broadly,\u201d it said. The outcome of bank stress tests will be announced in December and will look at their ability to withstand global risks and the impact or scale of future fines for misconduct. \u201cThe scale of future misconduct and redress costs for the UK banking sector is highly uncertain and banks should hold sufficient resources to pay these costs without affecting their ability to continue to lend to the real economy. The committee will review potential future costs as part of the 2015 stress test of the UK banking system,\u201d the FPC said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lawyers and the Australian consumer watchdog are circling Volkswagen, with the carmaker still unable to say whether its cars in Australia have been fitted with software that cheats environmental tests. Volkswagen has admitted that it installed a program in the engine software of some of its diesel cars that reduced toxic emissions when being tested. The US Environmental Protection Agency discovered that 482,000 VW diesel cars on American roads were emitting up to 40 times more toxic fumes than permitted. The automaker estimates this cheat affects 11m cars worldwide, but the Australian arm of the company has been unable to confirm if cars in Australia have been affected and is awaiting information from its German headquarters. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission spokeswoman said the watchdog is \u201cmaking enquiries to determine if consumers might have been exposed to misleading claims. The ACCC is also considering the rights of consumers under the Australian consumer law.\u201d Volkswagen\u2019s share price has tumbled by a third since news of the scandal broke, with its chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who insists he didn\u2019t know of the rule breaking, stepping down. The company faces fines of up to $18bn in the US and could be hit by customer legal action, including claims made in Australia. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers have urged buyers of Volkswagen diesel cars to come forward for a potential case against the company. \u201cMany people will have bought these cars thinking they were getting a clean, green car with good mileage but it is looking increasingly likely that for many people worldwide that is not the case,\u201d said Damian Scattini, class actions principal at Maurice Blackburn. \u201cIf it is confirmed that cars in Australia have been affected by this incident then it is likely these cars will be worth significantly less for consumers trying to sell at a later date.\u201d Australia has less stringent air pollution regulations surrounding vehicle emissions compared to the US and Europe. Australian passenger cars can emit up to 1g of carbon monoxide per kilometre and 0.06g of nitrogen oxides per kilometre. There are no regulations around the emissions of carbon dioxide, despite advice from the Climate Change Authority that this would significantly help lower Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas output. The sale of diesel cars in Australia has doubled over the past decade, putting a greater onus on a tightening of the emissions standards. In April, the then industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, said the looming closure of car makers Ford and Holden in Australia provided an opportunity to introduce better emissions standards. \u201cWe will need to look at our emissions standards,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are lagging behind the rest of the world and one of the main reasons for that was that it would have severely jeopardised local production of motor vehicles. Now that\u2019s not an issue.\u201d A spokeswoman for the department of infrastructure and regional development said the federal government is \u201cmonitoring developments\u201d in the US and how they will relate to Volkswagen in Australia. \u201cThe department is seeking urgent clarification from Volkswagen Group Australia, as to whether vehicles supplied to the Australian market use similar software to that used in the US,\u201d she said. The spokeswoman said emissions tests are subject to an audit by the department and it would work with the car maker and the ACCC to withdraw any non-compliant vehicles.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest residential housing price figures released this week by the ABS show that after a brief respite, the housing market has again caught fire in Sydney and Melbourne. In the latter part of 2014 and early stages of 2015 there was some evidence that the housing boom was cooling off. After house prices in Sydney soared by 16% from March 2013 to March 2014, things settled down a bit. Prices kept going up, but the speed was not as fast. In the 12 months from December 2013 to December 2014, Sydney prices went up on average by a lower 12.1%. Well, strap yourself in. In the latest data from the ABS, housing prices in Sydney have risen 18.9% in the 12 months to June 2015 \u2013 the biggest annual rise in Sydney in over a decade: Melbourne too has had an increase. After similarly looking like it had peaked in March 2014, the quarterly growth of 4.2% in June was the biggest in Melbourne since March 2010: But, as has often been the case with the housing boom since 2012, it is mostly occurring in Sydney and Melbourne. In all the other capital cities there is barely a sign of housing life. Perth is the worst of the lot \u2013 with the impact of the end of the mining boom, average house prices in that city have not risen since March 2014. This discrepancy is made even more clear when we look at the growth of prices since the RBA began cutting interest rates in November 2011. In that time, Sydney residential house prices have risen 52%, Melbourne\u2019s went up by 20%, whereas none of the other capital cities have seen rises above 15%: Funnily enough, only Sydney\u2019s housing prices since the December 2011 quarter have risen faster than the weighted national average \u2013 which shows how much the Sydney market dominates the rest of Australia. In terms of total housing stock, the NSW market accounts for 40% and Victoria an additional 25%: Interestingly, the housing boom of the early to mid-2000s was not really a Sydney one. Sydney house prices of course were easily the most expensive in the nation, but from 2004 to 2008 places like Perth and Melbourne saw the big price jumps. But since 2011 it has been all about Sydney. In December 2011 the median house price in Sydney was $533,000, compared with $495,000 in Melbourne \u2013 92% of the level in Sydney. Now the median house price in Sydney is $871,000, while in Melbourne it is just 65% of that amount, at $570,000. And this boom, as ever, has been fuelled by debt. In March, Australia set a record high housing debt to income ratio of 142.1%. And after six years of relatively flat growth, debt levels in Australia since the RBA began cutting rates at the end of 2011 have started rising fast: The 8.9 percentage point increase in the debt to income ratio over the past two years is the fastest two-yearly rise in debt levels since March 2007: The rise in house prices continues to be mostly off the back of investors. While the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has instituted measures to try to limit investor credit growth for individual banks at 10% per annum, the current overall growth remains at 10.8%: Interestingly, last week before the House Economics Committee RBA governor Glenn Stevens noted these new rules, which were devised to limit investor credit, had seen some banks increase the interest rates for investors. He predicted it may have an effect on credit growth, but one more about definition than reality. Stevens predicted that \u201cwe will now see a number of people who used to call themselves investors are going to call themselves owner-occupiers because the relative pricing has changed\u201d. He said he believed the rules did serve to maintain stability in the banking system, but they may not do much to make house prices stable. In response to a question from a student from Gungahlin college in the ACT, about the difficulty for first-home buyers, Stevens argued the issue was more about increasing housing supply than government measures designed to reduce prices. He argued that \u201cthe answer is not going to be government programs that give you money, because that money just ends up in the hands of the sellers. The answer has to come on the supply side of the market. In a country with this much land, something is wrong if we cannot do the marginal cost of housing a bit cheaper than we do\u201d. For now, it appears the RBA is happy to keep interest rates where they are, and there seems little concern about them needing to rise to cool down the housing market \u2013 especially at a time when overall economic growth is weak. And thus the question remains, as it has for the past three years: can prices continue to boom when the economy itself does not? Six months ago it seemed house prices were beginning to respond to the weak economy and slow down, but these latest figures show that, once again, they have shot off ahead.",

After house prices in Sydney soared by 16% from March 2013 to March 2014, things settled down a bit. Prices kept going up, but the speed was not as fast. In the 12 months from December 2013 to December 2014, Sydney prices went up on average by a lower 12.1%. </p> <p>Well, strap yourself in. In the latest data from the ABS, housing prices in Sydney have risen 18.9% in the 12 months to June 2015 \u2013 the biggest annual rise in Sydney in over a decade: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VdhCL/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Melbourne too has had an increase. After similarly looking like it had peaked in March 2014, the quarterly growth of 4.2% in June was the biggest in Melbourne since March 2010:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yz9E4/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But, as has often been the case with the housing boom since 2012, it is mostly occurring in Sydney and Melbourne. In all the other capital cities there is barely a sign of housing life. Perth is the worst of the lot \u2013 with the impact of the end of the mining boom, average house prices in that city have not risen since March 2014. </p> <p>This discrepancy is made even more clear when we look at the growth of prices since the RBA began cutting interest rates in November 2011.</p> <p>In that time, Sydney residential house prices have risen 52%, Melbourne\u2019s went up by 20%, whereas none of the other capital cities have seen rises above 15%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZqVrl/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Funnily enough, only Sydney\u2019s housing prices since the December 2011 quarter have risen faster than the weighted national average \u2013 which shows how much the Sydney market dominates the rest of Australia.</p> <p>In terms of total housing stock, the NSW market accounts for 40% and Victoria an additional 25%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JQmpY/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Interestingly, the housing boom of the early to mid-2000s was not really a Sydney one. Sydney house prices of course were easily the most expensive in the nation, but from 2004 to 2008 places like Perth and Melbourne saw the big price jumps. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/185o8/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But since 2011 it has been all about Sydney. In December 2011 the median house price in Sydney was $533,000, compared with $495,000 in Melbourne \u2013 92% of the level in Sydney. Now the median house price in Sydney is $871,000, while in Melbourne it is just 65% of that amount, at $570,000. </p> <p>And this boom, as ever, has been fuelled by debt. </p> <p>In March, Australia set a record high housing debt to income ratio of 142.1%. </p> <p>And after six years of relatively flat growth, debt levels in Australia since the RBA began cutting rates at the end of 2011 have started rising fast:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Kjpws/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The 8.9 percentage point increase in the debt to income ratio over the past two years is the fastest two-yearly rise in debt levels since March 2007:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 7\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yihib/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The rise in house prices continues to be mostly off the back of investors. While the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has instituted measures to try to limit investor credit growth for individual banks at 10% per annum, the current overall growth remains at 10.8%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog 8\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CpdHS/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Interestingly, last week before the <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommrep%2F468d534f-c605-425d-96b9-0906e3278a7d%2F0001%22\">House Economics Committee</a> RBA governor Glenn Stevens noted these new rules, which were devised to limit investor credit, had seen some banks increase the interest rates for investors. He predicted it may have an effect on credit growth, but one more about definition than reality.</p> <p>Stevens predicted that \u201cwe will now see a number of people who used to call themselves investors are going to call themselves owner-occupiers because the relative pricing has changed\u201d. </p> <p>He said he believed the rules did serve to maintain stability in the banking system, but they may not do much to make house prices stable. </p> <p>In response to a question from a student from Gungahlin college in the ACT, about the difficulty for first-home buyers, Stevens argued the issue was more about increasing housing supply than government measures designed to reduce prices. </p> <p>He argued that \u201cthe answer is not going to be government programs that give you money, because that money just ends up in the hands of the sellers. The answer has to come on the supply side of the market. In a country with this much land, something is wrong if we cannot do the marginal cost of housing a bit cheaper than we do\u201d.</p> <p>For now, it appears the RBA is happy to keep interest rates where they are, and there seems little concern about them needing to rise to cool down the housing market \u2013 especially at a time when overall economic growth is weak. </p> <p>And thus the question remains, as it has for the past three years: can prices continue to boom when the economy itself does not? Six months ago it seemed house prices were beginning to respond to the weak economy and slow down, but these latest figures show that, once again, they have shot off ahead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The average price paid by Londoners for property has had hit a record high of 12 times earnings, and the gap between house prices in the capital and the UK\u2019s other big cities is at its widest for 20 years, according to a an industry report. Despite recent reports showing a slowdown at the top of London\u2019s property market, the monthly survey by the property firm Hometrack shows that the difference in average prices between the capital and other large cities has continued to grow. The report says the widening gap \u201chighlights a seemingly overvalued London market\u201d. Hometrack\u2019s figures, which are based on Land Registry data and information from mortgage valuations, show that in Liverpool and Glasgow homes are about 75% cheaper than in London. While the average price paid in the capital is now \u00a3437,700, in Glasgow it is \u00a3107,300, while in Liverpool it is \u00a3109,600. Even in Bristol, where the market has been busy and prices are now 16% above their 2007 peak, homes are changing hands for an average price of \u00a3231,300 \u2013 47% below that in the capital. According to the report, half the purchasers in the first half of the year had no property to sell, and this change in the mix of buyers put upward pressure on house prices. The report echoes other recent surveys that show a shortage of properties coming on to the market. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has reported several months of falling listings. Across the UK\u2019s 20 biggest cities, Hometrack said prices had increased by 8.3% since September 2014, but behind this headline the picture was mixed. In Aberdeen prices had dropped by 2% over the past 12 months, to an average of \u00a3193,000, as the low price of oil prompted job cuts and reduced demand for housing. In Cambridge, however, prices rose by 11.2%, with residents and investors driving up the market. According to Hometrack\u2019s figures, prices are now 43.6% above their pre-crisis peak, and have hit an average of \u00a3388,600. In London, prices are now a higher multiple of earnings than ever before, while in other large cities the ratio is running at its long-term average. Hometrack said this suggested that price rises could spread as investors and developers looked for more affordable markets. Richard Donnell, Hometrack\u2019s director of research, said: \u201cA changing mix of buyers is compounding the scarcity of housing for sale with rising numbers of first-time buyers and investors buying property while having nothing to sell. Only a recovery in the number of moves among existing homeowners or an increase in new supply will ease the current housing scarcity \u2013 which seems unlikely in the near term.\u201d He added: \u201cLondon\u2019s price earnings ratio is at an all-time high, while there remains value in most other regional cities. The pricing differential [with] London could well assist city regions to attract new investment as the cost of housing starts to influence decision-making for both households and businesses.\u201d On Thursday the National Association of Estate Agents became the latest organisation to report a lack of homes going on the market. It said the number of properties listed by each agent fell by a third in August, reaching an 11-year low. Estate agents had an average of 38 homes on their books during the month, down from 55 in July. Meanwhile, the number of potential buyers dropped from 462 to 408 per branch. The NAEA\u2019s managing director, Mark Hayward, said: \u201cThere are now 11 house hunters fighting after every available house \u2013 which isn\u2019t sustainable. First-time buyers are finding themselves being squeezed out of the competition, which of course means it\u2019s taking young buyers longer to get their foot on the first step of the ladder, which will in turn increase pressure on the rental market.\u201d",
