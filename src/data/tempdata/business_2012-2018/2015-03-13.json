I usually shop in Debenhams. I like the fashions there and it\u2019s got good concessions.\u201d</p> <p>Mai Seida, 32, says she\u2019s a regular visitor to BHS as it has good prices and nice fabrics but it is mainly her mother who shops there. \u201cI prefer H&amp;M, Gap or Primark,\u201d she says. Dionne Benjamin, 28, also likes Primark, H&amp;M and New Look but visits BHS to pick up bargains on footwear or lingerie. \u201cThey do have some great bargains but my favourite shop is H&amp;M. They have better fashion and change their stock constantly.

The company is also saddled with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3100m in 2013 according to accounts at Companies House. </p> <p>Stephen Springham at analysis firm Planet Retail said: \u201cBHS was a very good deal for Philip Green. It enabled him to buy Arcadia and make an attempt to buy Marks &amp; Spencer.

The building was sold last week to Alexander Dellal, brother of the model Alice and grandson of legendary property investor \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t know why anybody shops there. The buildings are always awful, the clothes, the layout, it\u2019s all awful. I have bought something for my mum, though,\u201d says Carol Haigh, a 62-year-old shopper, as she steps out of BHS\u2019s flagship store on London\u2019s Oxford Street. As dozens of middle-aged women scan the store\u2019s sales rails on a sunny spring afternoon, most are unaware that the whole business has just been bought for the bargain price of \u00a31. But shoppers and retail watchers believe the new owners, a little-known group of investors, will have to invest a lot more than a pound if they are to have any hope of staging a high-street comeback. Sir Philip Green, the man who finally offloaded BHS this week after 15 years of ownership, promised to \u201cbattle it out on the high streets\u201d with Marks &amp; Spencer after his attempt to buy that chain were rebuffed in 2004. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a contender,\u201d he pledged. A decade on, the Oxford Street store has the well-cared-for appearance of any flagship site but it still looks like a cut-price, cheerful version of the M&amp;S outlet down the road. Shoppers at the BHS store sum up its problems. \u201cI\u2019m not really a regular shopper,\u201d says Faith, 49. \u201cI think its merchandise looks a bit old. I usually shop in Debenhams. I like the fashions there and it\u2019s got good concessions.\u201d Mai Seida, 32, says she\u2019s a regular visitor to BHS as it has good prices and nice fabrics but it is mainly her mother who shops there. \u201cI prefer H&amp;M, Gap or Primark,\u201d she says. Dionne Benjamin, 28, also likes Primark, H&amp;M and New Look but visits BHS to pick up bargains on footwear or lingerie. \u201cThey do have some great bargains but my favourite shop is H&amp;M. They have better fashion and change their stock constantly. Even if you don\u2019t know anything about fashion you can see what\u2019s in for the season there,\u201d she says. While Green\u2019s Topshop chain continues to do well and is expanding internationally, BHS has struggled to increase sales and made a \u00a370m loss in 2013 and a \u00a3116m loss a year before that. The company is also saddled with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3100m in 2013 according to accounts at Companies House. Stephen Springham at analysis firm Planet Retail said: \u201cBHS was a very good deal for Philip Green. It enabled him to buy Arcadia and make an attempt to buy Marks &amp; Spencer. He has taken a lot of money out of it and a lot of costs out but he has not made it fit for the future.\u201d BHS shareholders, led by Green\u2019s wife, Tina, who lives in Monaco, have enjoyed dividends of at least \u00a3400m over the years. While Green, who celebrates his birthday this weekend, enjoys the benefit of that deal and the relief of offloading a loss-making business, Springham says BHS\u2019s stores look tired. The chain hasn\u2019t modernised its image while competition across the high street has only become stronger. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to question whether things have ever been right with BHS. It\u2019s difficult to see how it is going to break the spiral,\u201d Springham said. BHS\u2019s new owner, Retail Acquisitions, headed by former racing driver and bankrupt Dominic Chappell, has said it wants to expand the group\u2019s homewares and food sales and potentially bring in new clothing concessions alongside Green\u2019s Wallis and Evans brands. Retail watchers believe BHS will continue to struggle to differentiate itself in a tough market and is likely to be broken up. Primark has bought a number of BHS stores in the past and is thought to be keen to buy more, if the price is right. \u201cBHS has fallen foul of the middle-market malaise,\u201d says Terry Green, who previously ran BHS, Debenhams and the clothing division at Tesco. \u201cPrimark and the supermarkets are the new middle market. If you\u2019re positioned where BHS and Marks &amp; Spencer are you are vulnerable, almost niche. You are not appealing to the broad market.\u201d Green, who headed BHS for a brief period after Philip Green\u2019s family took control, was able to boost profits by more than \u00a3100m within 18 months at the business.

    "webTitle": "'Grexident': Germany warns Greece could leave euro by accident - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "To recap: European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras met in Brussels today and called on European governments to show solidarity with Greece. Tsipras later said that his meetings had gone well (\u201ctoday was a positive day\u201d). Juncker said: I\u2019m totally excluding a failure. I don\u2019t want a failure. I would like Europeans to go together. This is not a time for division. This is a time for coming together. His comments came after German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told an Austrian broadcaster on Thursday night that the lack of progress was increasing the chances of an accidental Greek exit from the euro - a \u201cGrexident\u201d. As the responsibility, the possibility to decide what happens only lies with Greece, and because we don\u2019t exactly know what those in charge in Greece are doing, we can\u2019t rule out. Have a good weekend. We\u2019ll be back next week. The euro is now down more than 1% against the dollar at $1.05230. Tsipras just tweeted: It appears that Tsipras\u2019 meetings in Brussels have gone well. As we reported earlier, the Greek prime minister has been meeting with the European Commission\u2019s president Jean-Claude Juncker and European parliament president Martin Schulz. Tsipras expressed satisfaction with the meetings, saying \u201ctoday was a positive day\u201d. Tsipras has also briefed Syriza MEP Manolis Glezos on the work of his government. Glezos admitted that there were different views on certain issues but was hopeful that they would be resolved. \u201cI have never been against the government, neither am I now,\u201d he said, Reuters reported, adding that he trusted the \u201cgovernment of the people\u201d and the prime minister. He also said that the two men had not talked about the issue of German reparations and that it would be discussed in time. Tsipras, for his part, said they had a meaningful discussion. He acknowledged that \u201cwe are in a critical period\u201d but added optimistically We will succeed in living up to the expectations of the Greek society, the popular mandate and our oath to honour these fights and give popular sovereignty, independence and prosperity back to our country. Earlier, Greece\u2019s statistics service ELSTAT published its first estimate for GDP growth last year. It reckons the Greek economy grew by 0.8% in 2014, better than the 0.6% expected by Athens and its international lenders. A second estimate is due on 9 October. Over in Greece, the central government missed its budget surplus target in the first two months of the year because of a shortfall in tax revenues. The figure is not the one monitored by the troika of international lenders, but nonetheless indicates the (lack of) progress in the country\u2019s attempts to get its finances back on track. The surplus came in at \u20ac1.2bn, below the \u20ac1.4bn target set out in Greece\u2019s latest budget. Tax revenues totalled \u20ac7.3bn, nearly 14% below the targeted \u20ac8.5bn, the finance ministry said. As just mentioned, Brent crude has dropped below $57 a barrel, and is currently trading down 63 cents at $56.45, a fall of 1.1%. Oil prices fell after the International Energy Agency said a global oil glut was building, with US oil output showing no signs of slowing. US crude lost almost a dollar, a fall of over 2%, to $46.06. The IEA said: US supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down. Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations. Barbara Lambrecht, analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, predicted: The market will be more balanced in the second half, but there is still a massive oversupply in the first half. We still expect oil prices to fall in the coming weeks due to rising inventories. US stockpiles climbed last week to hit the highest level for this time of year in more than 80 years. Pulling away from the all-time high hit at the start of the month, Britain\u2019s top share index has slipped 0.2% to 6744.70 and looks set to notch up its biggest weekly fall so far this year due to a drop in utility stocks and commodity-related shares. The FTSE 100 index hit a record high of 6974.26 points on 2 March. Utility shares, such as SSE and British Gas owner Centrica, were hit by the Labour party\u2019s pledge to bring down energy costs for consumers before the year is out if it wins the UK election on 7 May. Ed Miliband wants the energy regulator to use a proposed legal power to enforce an additional cut in annual fuel bills estimated to be worth \u00a3100 per household. Here is the story in full. With Brent crude oil dropping below $57 a barrel, energy stocks such as BG and Royal Dutch Shell also fell. Germany\u2019s Dax, meanwhile, is on course to post its ninth weekly rise in a row. The weak euro has benefit car manufacturers that rely on exports such as Volkswagen. Following a week of heightened tension between the two countries, a spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel dismissed the idea of a feud with Greece. Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin that Merkel\u2019s goal remained to keep Greece in the eurozone, and that responsibility for finding a solution to Greece\u2019s problems rested with the eurozone as a whole. I neither see a private feud nor do I view the whole issue of Greece and how it solves its problems as a bilateral German-Greek topic. The Russian central bank has cut its key lending rate for a second time this year. Rates were cut to 14% from 15% as the bank signalled it is more concerned about a recession than high inflation. The Central Bank of Russia said a slow economy - hit by the slump in oil prices and western sanctions imposed over Ukraine - should start to limit inflation. It is forecasting a fall in GDP of 3.5% to 4% in 2015, and expects inflation to fall to about 9% in a year\u2019s time. Russian inflation is currently 16.7%. Man of the moment Yanis Varoufakis has been photographed at his home in Athens for a piece in French magazine Paris Match. The Greek finance minister is pictured with his wife Danae Stratou. Take a look at the gallery of pics here. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar, at a 20-month low of $1.4834. It is roughly flat against the euro at \u20ac1.3998. The Office for National Statistics has published some weak numbers on UK construction output. It fell unexpectedly by 2.6% in January, sharply below economists\u2019 expectations of a 1.2% rise. It was the biggest drop since November 2013 and followed a 0.6% increase in December. Housebuilding declined by 5% over the month, while commercial building such as offices and shops was down 6.6% and new infrastructure work fell by 2.7%. A poor performance in January meant construction output fell by 3.1% on annual basis. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 2.2% increase. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit: Official data indicated a steep downturn in UK construction activity at the start of the year, following a worryingly sharp decline in the fourth quarter of last year. However, while there are signs that the sector is set to see a tougher year in 2015 compared to last year, survey data and corporate earnings suggest growth is merely slowing rather than collapsing. The Greek PM said the problems facing Greece are the eurozone\u2019s problems and its partners in the single currency bloc should send a message of solidarity to his country. Speaking in Brussels, Tsipras said: Greece has already started fulfilling its commitments mentioned in the Eurogroup decision of 20 Feb so we are doing our part and we expect our partners to do their own. And I\u2019m very optimistic ... that we will find a solution because I strongly believe that this is our common interest. I believe that there is no Greek problem, there is a European problem. Now is the time to give a message of hope to the Greek people, not only implement, implement, implement and obligations, obligations, obligations. The message that the European institutions will give help and solidarity with particular rates, in order to over come this very bad situation at the social level. Because we are pro-European and we want to go on together in a common future, I believe that at the end of the day we will solve all these misunderstandings and we will go on with this honest compromise that we did on the 20th February. Our intention is to implement this decision in a constructive way, in a way that will help Greece to overcome the crisis and Europe to overcome the crisis. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is in Brussels today to meet the European Commission\u2019s President Jean-Claude Juncker. The pair will attempt to make some progress on a way forward for Greece, after eurozone finance ministers rejected Athens\u2019 reform proposals on Monday. Juncker said he was ready to make \u201cproposals\u201d to overcome the differences between Greece and its eurozone partners. I\u2019m not satisfied with the developments in recent weeks. I don\u2019t think we have made sufficient progress. I\u2019m totally excluding a failure. I don\u2019t want a failure. I would like Europeans to go together. This is not a time for division. This is a time for coming together. Tsipras said he was optimistic the political will existed to find a solution soon. A new poll by the German TV channel ZDF shows that the German public are losing patience in Greece, with a growing number in favour of a Greek exit from the euro. Asked whether Greece should stay in the euro, 52% said no, down from 41% in February. The poll (in German) is here. The euro is down against the dollar this morning after regaining some ground yesterday. It is currently trading at $1.0606, down 0.3%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, considers the impact currency volatility having on equities. Having seen European markets reap the benefits of a weaker euro this week, yesterday\u2019s rebound in the single currency prompted a little bit of a pause in upward momentum in European stocks and a slightly weaker session, though it won\u2019t be enough to prevent the DAX posting its ninth successive positive week in succession. The FTSE100, on the other hand will probably post its second successive negative week in a row, such are the currency divergences being played out in global markets at the moment. The weaker US dollar [on Thursday] on the other hand helped US markets regain some of their recently lost mojo as both the Dow and S&amp;P500 pulled back strongly, helped by a disappointing February retail sales report. European markets have opened higher this morning, with Germany\u2019s DAX on course to post its ninth weekly rise in a row. FTSE 100: +0.02% at 6,762.30 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 4,990.18 Germany\u2019s DAX: -+0.3% at 11,828.44 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.5% at 11,070.3 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 22,848.04 Sch\u00e4uble - whose relationship with Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis appears to go from bad to worse - made a few other points in his interview with Austrian TV. Greece needs to fulfil its obligations otherwise there will be no further payments under the current bailout programme Europe is ready to help Greece, but Greece must help itself The problem cannot be solved by making others scapegoats Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The hours tick on and the hostile words grow louder but still there is no agreement on Greece\u2019s reform proposals. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s frank and outspoken finance minister, says the lack of progress is increasing the chances of an accidental Greek exit from the euro - a \u201cGrexident\u201d. He also said the onus was on Greece to help itself. Asked by the Austrian broadcaster ORF about the prospect of a Grexident, Sch\u00e4uble said: As the responsibility, the possibility to decide what happens only lies with Greece, and because we don\u2019t exactly know what those in charge in Greece are doing, we can\u2019t rule out.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned the financial community against complacency in the wake of a series of \u201cshort sharp shocks\u201d in markets over recent months that it said could happen more frequently. Chris Salmon, the Bank\u2019s executive director for markets, said uncertainty surrounding the global economy following the collapse in the oil price had heightened anxiety in the major currency and bond markets. He argued that the growing unease combined with a shift to computer-generated trading platforms, some of which froze amid serious market volatility related to US Treasury yields and the Swiss franc over the past year, had triggered panic trading. Salmon said another \u201cflash crash\u201d in one market could spill over into other markets and cause widespread panic. The warning followed an unusually calm period last year when the Greek crisis and other major events failed to move markets. But in October, concerns about the global economy triggered a flash crash in US Treasury yields, and in January this year there was a sharp rise in the Swiss franc after it was detached from tracking the euro. In both cases, markets stabilised over the following weeks to avoid contagion to other markets, but this may not be the case every time, Salmon said. \u201cFinancial markets may not have been truly tested for the ability to absorb price moves or flows that persist for a prolonged period, or for a wider spillover between markets,\u201d Salmon said in a speech in London. \u201cAnd that is why it is only fit and proper for me to finish on a cautionary note: market participants take heed.\u201d He said the spikes in volatility in recent months have coincided with periods when trading firms were reluctant to buy and sell financial instruments in the frenzied period during a major event. Increasing reliance on computer-based trading was reason to believe that the severity of the two events was accentuated by structural change in the bond, commodity and currency markets, he said. \u201cThere must be a risk that future shocks could have more persistent and more widespread impacts across financial markets than has been the case in the recent past.\u201d He said markets were more liquid before the banking crash of 2008, but warned that this was an unusual period when the cost of participating in markets was \u201cunder-priced\u201d. Regulators have encouraged banks to direct their currency trades via electronic trading platforms to make them more transparent. Currency markets dwarf stock and bond markets with trillions of dollars traded every day. But the algorithms used by the trading firms can lead to the platforms shutting down in periods of stress that occur when lots of participants want to buy, without any traders willing to sell. The mismatch, which regulators have attempted to eliminate, can send prices spiralling upwards or downwards. Regulators are braced for a series of shocks over the next few months as the US central bank prepares to increase interest rates from 0.25%. Salmon points out that 24 central banks have cut rates this year in response to slowing global growth. But the US is heading in the opposite direction. The US economy has surged over the last year and many politicians have called on the Federal Reserve head, Janet Yellen, to raise rates. When it happens, cash is expected to pour into the US, pushing up the value of the dollar and the cost of US debt. Several countries have borrowed heavily in dollars to benefit from low interest rates. It is not known how heavily indebted governments and corporations will pay the higher interest rates and what disruption it will cause in the markets. Salmon said: \u201cif we accept the hypothesis that the market\u2019s ability to digest significant news has changed such that sudden increases in volatility and loss of liquidity are more likely, then the concern is that the stabilising factors which dampened the impact of such events in recent months may not always kick in. \u201cIn those circumstances the period of market dislocation could become more persistent, increasing the scope of spillovers across financial markets, with potentially more significant impacts for financial stability,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "The French financial state prosecutor has requested that HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank be sent to criminal trial over a suspected tax-dodging scheme for wealthy customers. The recommendation follows a lengthy investigation by local magistrates into alleged tax fraud involving 3,000 French taxpayers and is a procedural step that brings the Swiss banking arm one step closer to a possible trial in France. The parent company HSBC, which faces a separate ongoing French investigation, said: \u201cThis is a normal step in the judicial procedure and the outcome of the matter is not determined as of today.\u201d The bank has one month to respond after which French magistrates will take the final decision on whether to hold a trial. Le Monde reported that HSBC refused a plea deal that would have avoided a trial. It said HSBC would have had to pay a \u20ac1.4bn fine as part of that deal. HSBC has admitted failings in compliance and controls in its Swiss bank and faces investigation by US authorities and an inquiry by British MPs after reports that it helped customers conceal millions of dollars of assets in a period up to 2007. Cases against specific clients of the Swiss bank are already in progress in France. The scandal at HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank came to light when the Guardian and other media organisations around the world published revelations from leaked files. The files showed that the Swiss operation enabled clients to evade and aggressively avoid taxes and withdraw \u201cbricks\u201d of cash without question. HSBC faces 10 separate inquiries around the world into the scandal. The US Department of Justice is considering criminal charges against the bank and its clients and the bank is under investigation in Brazil, India, Belgium and other jurisdictions. HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, has admitted that the revelations are a source of shame and the chairman, Douglas Flint, has said they are \u201cdeeply humbling\u201d. The two have pledged to clean up the bank but say they cannot be held responsible for the Swiss bank\u2019s actions. The Guardian reported that Gulliver had an account at the Swiss private bank and that he also used a Panamanian company to channel his earnings. He admitted the arrangement, which he ended in 2009, looked strange but said it was to protect his privacy and was not related to tax. Margaret Hodge, chair of the UK\u2019s public accounts committee, has called on Rona Fairhead, who is a non-executive HSBC director, to resign as chair of the BBC Trust over the scandal. Pressure also increased on Flint this week when Robert Jenkins, a former Bank of England policymaker, called on him to quit as HSBC chairman to preserve his own reputation and that of the bank. The Swiss revelations came on top of a $1.9bn (\u00a31.3bn) fine imposed on HSBC in the US for flouting sanctions and allowing its Mexican arm to launder money for drug gangs. Arlette Ricci, the millionaire heiress to the Nina Ricci fashion and perfume house, went on trial last month in Paris accused of hiding more than $22m from French tax authorities via a bank account at HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm. The trial, held in a special new Paris court to deal with tax fraud, was seen as a test case \u2013 Ricci was among the first clients to go on trial over money held via HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank. More than 60 wealthy French people have been formally investigated since a list of thousands of clients alleged to have evaded taxes through HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank became public. Ricci, 73, a French psychoanalyst and writer, was on trial alongside her daughter and accountant. All denied charges of tax fraud and money-laundering.

Halifax is the first UK bank to test electronic wristbands that use customers\u2019 heartbeats to verify their identities in an effort to make online banking safer. The technology means that people will not need to remember multiple passwords when they log into their accounts. The Nymi band, which looks like a watch, authenticates the wearer by identifying the unique electrical signals emitted by his or her heart, known as an electrocardiogram, when it is first placed on the wrist. The customer wears the band on one wrist and touches the top sensor with the opposite hand. Another set of sensors detects whether the person is still wearing the band, and shuts the device down if their heartbeat is not recognised. This is how it works: first, you check your heartbeat pattern on a computer and store it on the wristband. You then need to pair the band with your smartphone, using a banking app and Bluetooth, so whenever you want to do your banking you put on the wristband and it automatically connects with your phone. The wristband has been developed by Toronto-based technology firm Bionym, which has also trialled it with Royal Bank of Canada. Halifax, which is owned by Lloyds Banking Group, says the technology is superior to fingerprints or iris scans as the heartbeat is a \u201cvital signal of the body and as such, naturally provides strong protection against intrusions and falsification\u201d. The bank will ask some customers entering its branches to try out the electronic wristband when they log into their bank accounts on a smartphone or computer. A spokeswoman said: \u201cYou could fake someone\u2019s fingerprint, but you can\u2019t fake someone\u2019s heartbeat.\u201d The band has sensors that in the future could be used in other areas, for example for gesture recognition, such as unlocking a door.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has launched a coffee price war as it combats the sobering effect of supermarket competition on alcohol sales. Wetherspoon is seeking a bigger share of the breakfast market to offset the effect of cheap booze deals at superstores, which have hammered sales across the pub industry. The company is launching its drive from a position of strength as the fifth-biggest seller of breakfasts in the UK, selling 50m coffees and 24m breakfasts per year. From next week, the 936-strong pub chain will sell Lavazza filter coffee for 99p \u2013 a price cut of about 20p \u2013 with free refills at 880 pubs. A small latte or cappuccino will cost the same. It is also introducing a new traditional breakfast at \u00a32.99, in addition to its other 10 breakfasts, as it tries to grab a bigger slice of the booming coffee and food-on-the-go market. Wetherspoon\u2019s founder and chairman, Tim Martin, said the company aimed to treble coffee and breakfast sales over the next 18 months. One industry expert said the gambit could drive sales because Wetherspoon has already built on its image as a provider of cheap beer in music-free pubs. \u201cIs Wetherspoon even a pub any more? It trades throughout the day so it\u2019s got breakfast, lunchtime, afternoon tea and coffee before becoming more of a traditional pub in the evening. It\u2019s no longer just about cheap beer,\u201d said Peter Martin of the pub and restaurant analysis firm CGA Peach. \u201cThe breakfast market isn\u2019t massive but it\u2019s growing and it fits into the industry trend for all-day trading. They are going for a good, well-known brand of coffee that says you will get good quality at the best price.\u201d With 13.7% of the market, Wetherspoon is more popular for breakfast than Pret A Manger, used by 6.5% of breakfast buyers, and Caff\u00e8 Nero, with 8.8%. But it lies behind Greggs, Costa, Starbucks and market leader McDonald\u2019s which was visited by 29% of those buying breakfast, according to CGA Peach. Wetherspoon is stepping up its efforts in the breakfast market to counteract slowing sales growth and what it says is the malign effect of cheap supermarket alcohol on the pub trade. Martin has been a vociferous critic of the way supermarkets and pubs are taxed. Supermarkets pay no VAT on food, which allows them to subsidise alcohol, while pubs pay 20% VAT on food. Pubs also pay 15p per pint in respect of business rates, while supermarkets pay only about 1.5-2p per pint. He said: \u201cThe biggest danger to the pub industry is the continuing tax disparity between supermarkets and pubs \u2026 There is a growing realisation among politicians, the media and the public that pubs are overtaxed.\u201d Wetherspoon announced the coffee drive alongside half-year results that showed profits before tax and one-off items slipped 0.9% to \u00a337.5m. Like-for-like bar sales were up 1.5% while food grew by 10.1%. Higher utility bills and wages pushed down the group\u2019s operating margin, a measure of profitability, to 7.4% from 8.2%. The chain expects a \u201creasonable outcome\u201d for the year as a whole, despite rising marketing and wage costs. Sales at Wetherspoon pubs open more than a year were up 1.6% in the six weeks to 8 March, down from growth of 4.5% in the first half of the year.",

It is also introducing a new traditional breakfast at \u00a32.99, in addition to its other 10 breakfasts, as it tries to grab a bigger slice of the booming coffee and food-on-the-go market.</p> <p>Wetherspoon\u2019s founder and chairman, Tim Martin, said the company aimed to treble coffee and breakfast sales over the next 18 months.</p> <p>One industry expert said the gambit could drive sales because Wetherspoon has already built on its image as a provider of cheap beer in music-free pubs. </p> <p>\u201cIs Wetherspoon even a pub any more? It trades throughout the day so it\u2019s got breakfast, lunchtime, afternoon tea and coffee before becoming more of a traditional pub in the evening. It\u2019s no longer just about cheap beer,\u201d said Peter Martin of the pub and restaurant analysis firm CGA Peach. </p> <p>\u201cThe breakfast market isn\u2019t massive but it\u2019s growing and it fits into the industry trend for all-day trading. They are going for a good, well-known brand of coffee that says you will get good quality at the best price.\u201d</p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8496ed7f2913cac116d2d1ae4c22d79b6af4c3c6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426239015542/0bc6d667-5a45-4d2d-97b9-83383b5006fc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Martin at a JD Wetherspoon.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Martin at a JD Wetherspoon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JD Wetherspoon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With 13.7% of the market, Wetherspoon is more popular for breakfast than Pret A Manger, used by 6.5% of breakfast buyers, and Caff\u00e8 Nero, with 8.8%.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband wants the energy regulator to use a proposed legal power to enforce an additional cut in annual fuel bills estimated to be worth \u00a3100 per household. The Labour leader has already pledged to introduce an energy bill price cap, freezing bills until 2017, which the party says will cut annual bills by \u00a3120 a year. Miliband\u2019s latest proposal would almost double that saving for most consumers by 2017. If Labour wins the general election, it will hand Ofgem a new legal duty to review energy prices by the autumn \u2013 and the power to order price reductions before the winter if it is shown that individual firms are not passing on cuts in wholesale prices. The cut would last at least until the energy market had been reset by the end of 2017. The legislation, Labour said, would be fast-tracked to bring about an immediate end to the overcharging by the big six energy firms. But the proposed law may be seen as a new intrusion by Ofgem into the market. Critics have claimed the freeze policy had lost its political clarity owing to the fall in energy prices caused by the slump in the price of oil. But Labour now says that despite wholesale energy prices falling by an average of 20% over the past year, the big six energy firms have reduced gas bills by only 1-5%, while electricity bills have not been cut at all. \u201cWhat better evidence do we need of the chronic overcharging, the broken market and the ripoffs being faced by millions of families and businesses across Britain?\u201d Miliband will say. The shadow energy minister, Caroline Flint, defended the policy against accusations Labour was responsible for the failure of energy companies to cut prices: \u201cI don\u2019t accept that,\u201d she told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIf prices had been frozen at the time of Ed Miliband\u2019s speech (in 2013), bills today would be cheaper,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we always have 101 reasons from the energy companies and those in the sector about why they can\u2019t pass on wholesale costs.\u201d Flint said that the Conservative party had blocked proposals to give the regulator extra powers twice in the last year. \u201cFunnily enough, if you look back to 2009, David Cameron, as the opposition leader \u2026 was saying that something had to be done about this problem, because this not new.\u201d She said Labour was committed to creating a competitive energy market: \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of going from the big six to the big one. We need to make sure that we have an energy market that is fit for the future.\u201d Conservative energy minister Matthew Hancock condemned the policy: \u201cThis is now the sixth version of a chaotic Labour energy policy that would have put up families\u2019 bills by \u00a3100 and could do the same again - their record at setting prices has been a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd only Ed Miliband could propose giving a new power to a regulator he plans to scrap.\u201d Consumer groups estimated that the failure to cut prices is costing families and businesses \u00a32.5bn a year. Which? has said that further cuts of up to 10% for gas and electricity bills should be made this year. Such a reduction would save the typical family almost \u00a3100 this winter, on top of the forecast \u00a3120 savings they would get from Labour\u2019s plan to freeze energy bills until 2017. Bills have increased on average by 4.2% (\u00a370) in the last 12 months, according to consultants Apollo Energy. Since 2008 the total cost of gas, electricity and other fuels have risen by 57%. In January 2013 fuel bills accounted for 18% of consumer expenditure. Energy firms are likely to be furious about the new threat to their revenues, but ministers have also said there is a problem with consumers not receiving the full impact of falling wholesale prices. In November Danny Alexander, the Treasury chief secretary, wrote to all of the main fuel suppliers and distributors to demand that they pass on the benefits of falling oil prices to customers as quickly as possible. The chancellor, George Osborne, has also promised to monitor the behaviour of the big six energy firms \u201clike a hawk\u201d. But the firms say they have to purchase their oil many years ahead, and details of their hedging strategies have to be kept commercially confidential. They argue that the cost of fuel is only half of their overall costs, and does not take into account network expenditure. Miliband\u2019s announcement on energy policy comes as part of Labour\u2019s fifth and final pledge on living standards to be unveiled at its pre-election event in Birmingham on Saturday. The coalition claims that his campaign about living standards has now been blunted by wages starting to rise in real terms. But Miliband shows no sign in backing down, and will say: \u201cThe vital link between the wealth of our nation and working families has been broken. It\u2019s been 18 months since I announced the next Labour government would freeze energy bills \u2013 so they can only go down and not up \u2013 until 2017 while we reset this broken market. \u201cIn those months we first heard loud protests from the big six energy firms and their PR guys in the government. Then we saw prices continue to rocket upwards, unchecked by the government. \u201cNow something else is happening. The costs of energy are tumbling down, not because of anything the government or the big six energy firms have done, but because of global changes in oil and gas supply. \u201cThe cost of energy to the big six firms fell by 20%. Your gas bill fell by between 1 and 5%. Your electricity bill probably hasn\u2019t fallen at all. \u201cEven the PR guys for the big six \u2013 David Cameron and George Osborne \u2013 admit this is a problem. But they have not acted and the whole country knows why. It\u2019s because they will never stand up to powerful interests and they never stand up for you.\u201d Last month the Competition and Markets Authority released early findings of an inquiry into the sector that the big six were overcharging millions of loyal customers by up to \u00a3234 a year.",

The South Australian minister for automotive transformation, Kyam Maher, used an appearance before a Senate hearing on Friday to attack the Abbott government\u2019s actions earlier this week concerning the immediate future of the automotive transformation scheme (ATS) \u2013 and also to press for a fundamental redesign of the assistance program. On Tuesday, the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, said the Coalition would not proceed with plans unveiled in last year\u2019s budget to axe $500m from the ATS between now and 2017. The backflip recognised the reality that the budget measure was blocked in the Senate, and it was also an attempt to boost the Coalition\u2019s flagging political fortunes in South Australia. But the announcement was badly fumbled. The Adelaide newspaper was briefed ahead of time that $900m was back on the table, then Macfarlane clarified the amount was actually $500m, then other government sources said the funding was actually more like $100m because the industry is winding down in anticipation of the exit of the car manufacturers in 2017. Maher told the hearing Tuesday\u2019s announcement had caused significant confusion, given estimates of the funding on offer were different \u201cdepending on which Liberal was leaking at the time\u201d. He said the funding on offer presently was \u201centirely inadequate\u201d to help the components industry transition beyond the time Holden was due to quit Australian shores in 2017. Maher argued the Abbott government needed to reinstate $900m for the ATS \u2013 the entire budget for the scheme out to 2021 \u2013 and allow companies to use the funds on offer to help their diversification either into global supply chains, or into other industries entirely. SA officials said current indications suggested 20% of tier one components firms would survive if they continued with their diversification plans. \u201cWe are very firm in our call for the $900m to be spent,\u201d Maher said on Friday. \u201cAnd very broadly we would like the ATS broadened to allow for diversification.\u201d Liberal senator Sean Edwards asked Maher whether he was prepared to confirm that the industry was operating under exactly the same policies that had been in place under the previous federal Labor government.
