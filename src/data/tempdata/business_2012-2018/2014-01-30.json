      "bodyText": "Labour was given further ammunition in its campaign over the cost of living when the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned on Thursday that living standards were unlikely to reach their pre-recession levels before the next election. The contentious issue of falling living standards is potentially Labour's strongest card at the election, and the IFS analysis suggested Ed Miliband will be able to argue on polling day that voters are worse off than they were in 2010 when the coalition came to power. But a separate survey, published on Friday, offers comfort to the Conservatives by showing that the improving economy is leading to growing confidence among households. Much of the debate about living standards has been hampered by out of date information, and the IFS tried to take into account more recent effects of changes to incomes, tax rises and inflation. The analysis suggested \"there is little reason to expect a strong recovery in living standards over the next few years\". According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, real earnings are not expected to return to their 2009-10 levels until 2018-19. \"Further discretionary cuts to benefits and tax credits will put downward pressure on real incomes, particularly for low-income households. Given this, it seems highly unlikely that living standards will recover their pre-crisis levels by 2015-16.\" According to the IFS, median income is more than 6% lower than the peak in 2007-08, ahead of the financial crisis. The Conservatives have claimed that the rich have borne the brunt of the fall in living standards. The IFS said that better-off households have seen bigger proportionate real falls in income than poorer ones if it was assumed that all households faced the average inflation rate. But the IFS said: \"Poorer households have in fact experienced significantly higher rates of inflation.\" George Osborne claimed the figures overall showed just how much poorer the country was as a result of Labour's recession but also said that the fall in incomes had \"probably come to a halt\" and that the median household would see a rise in income in 2013/14. That belief was bolstered by a separate survey out on Friday suggesting Britons are feeling more optimistic than they have for the past six years, boosted by a growing economy and a brighter outlook for household finances. The GfK consumer confidence index jumped six points to -7 in January, ending three months of falls and reaching its highest level since September 2007 \u2013 the same month customers fearing for their savings queued up at branches of Northern Rock. The index is now 32 points higher than the low point of the downturn in July 2008. Respondents to the survey said they felt more positive about the prospects both for the broader economy and their own finances over the next 12 months. It came as Bank of England data showed the housing market continuing to gather speed, with the number of mortgages taken out by homebuyers in December at its highest level since January 2008. The Bank said 71,600 home loans were approved, worth \u00a312.4bn. The figure in December 2012 was \u00a38.3bn. Nick Moon, director of social research at GfK, said a key question now was whether heightened consumer confidence would translate into higher spending. He said: \"The somewhat anaemic retail sales figures for December suggest that the huge growth in the confidence index over the summer didn't lead to a similar growth in spending. \"It will be interesting to see, over the coming months, how the relationship develops between confidence, disposable income, and consumer spending.\" Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, attacked Labour's spending plans claiming they represented a cumulative \u00a3166bn borrowing bombshell between now and 2020-21, the end of the next parliament.

The chancellor, in the Times in July 2013, stressed the need to start investing in science and infrastructure around the country but, to date, investment in infrastructure has been mainly in London. Crossrail, for example, involves an expenditure of \u00a315.9bn (2008 prices) and the King's Cross redevelopment \u00a3810m. Professor Dorling in 2013 highlighted the increasing north-south divide; there is an ever-widening gap between house prices in London and other parts of the country and, on 27 January, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/27/great-migration-south-private-sector-jobs-london\" title=\"\">you reported on 2009-12 net migration into London</a>. It is time for the emphasis on infrastructure spending to shift towards the Midlands and the north.</p> <p>The recent offer from the China Railway Group for the funding of a crossrail link from Peterborough to Rugby, Coventry, HS2 and Birmingham airport, and the (suppressed) government report recommending building several new garden cities, both offer interesting possibilities.

All wealth is created directly by someone's labour or indirectly by the labour which produces the capital equipment used to produce that wealth. We could all stare at the bounties of nature forever but until someone gets their hands dirty no wealth would be created. Let's try a thought experiment: if we placed any of these so-called wealth creators on a desert island (blessed with abundant natural resources) how much wealth do we think they would create?

Professor Dorling in 2013 highlighted the increasing north-south divide; there is an ever-widening gap between house prices in London and other parts of the country and, on 27 January, you reported on 2009-12 net migration into London. It is time for the emphasis on infrastructure spending to shift towards the Midlands and the north. The recent offer from the China Railway Group for the funding of a crossrail link from Peterborough to Rugby, Coventry, HS2 and Birmingham airport, and the (suppressed) government report recommending building several new garden cities, both offer interesting possibilities. One can envisage two or three really superb new garden suburbs built along a fast monorail line \u2013 together with a world-class science, technology and engineering college and associated business start-up facilities \u2013 specifically to concentrate on emerging technologies that will drive UK growth. This is but one idea, but we urgently need to start investing to achieve secure growth and also address the problem of 1 million youngsters currently unemployed, not in education or training. Robert Oak Shrewsbury, Shropshire \u2022 Let's get this straight \u2013 the economy is growing and the fastest-growing sectors are utilities (electricity, gas etc) and business services and finance. Clearly, the government should actively encourage these sectors to take even more money from us, either by increasing their patently inadequate charges or via more bailouts (RSB), so that these sectors, and therefore the economy, will grow even faster. Phil Taylor Manchester \u2022 It's time the self-serving nonsense about wealth creators is exposed to the ridicule it deserves (Letters, 29 January). All wealth is created directly by someone's labour or indirectly by the labour which produces the capital equipment used to produce that wealth. We could all stare at the bounties of nature forever but until someone gets their hands dirty no wealth would be created. Let's try a thought experiment: if we placed any of these so-called wealth creators on a desert island (blessed with abundant natural resources) how much wealth do we think they would create? If anyone is still not sure, a look at the excellent 1957 film The Admirable Crichton will give the answer. Brian Gibson Rotherham, South Yorkshire",

      "bodyText": "India's central bank governor has blamed the US and other western nations for the financial tremors shaking emerging markets as he attacked the way the US was withdrawing its colossal stimulus programme. On the day strong American growth figures pointed to further tapering away of the US Federal Reserve's bond-buying programme, Raghuram Rajan said it was time the role played by developing countries in hauling the global economy out of recession was remembered in Washington and other developed country capitals. Important emerging economies \u2013 including India, Turkey and South Africa \u2013 have all raised interest rates to defend their currencies this week amid signs that the gradual phasing out of quantitative easing has led to investors becoming more jittery about high-yielding, risky markets. Russia was the latest country to feel the pressure as the fall in the rouble to its lowest level for five years prompted the central bank to threaten speculators with unlimited intervention. The Fed announced on Wednesday that the US economy was strong enough for it to reduce monthly asset purchases from $75bn to $65bn (\u00a348bn) and news that the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the final three months of 2013 left Wall Street convinced that further tapering was inevitable. \"International monetary co-operation has broken down,\" Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said in a Bloomberg India TV interview. \"Industrial countries have to play a part in restoring that [co-operation between central banks], and they can't at this point wash their hands off and say we'll do what we need to and you do the adjustment. \"Fortunately the IMF has stopped giving this as its mantra, but you hear from the industrial countries: We'll do what we have to do, the markets will adjust and you can decide what you want to do,\" he added. \"We need better co-operation and unfortunately that's not been forthcoming so far.\" Wall Street responded positively to the growth figures, seeing the strongest growth in annualised consumer spending (3.3%) and a surge in exports (11.4%) as evidence that the economy was at last putting the recession of 2008-09 behind it. The annualised growth rate was lower than the 4.1% recorded in the third quarter. Rob Carnell, economist at ING bank, said growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 would probably have been close to 3.5% at an annual rate had it not been for parts of the federal government being shut down in October. While inflationary pressure was weak, Carnell added: \"This should not be enough to detract the Fed from what looks like will be another $10bn taper at their March meeting, taking monthly QE down to $55bn.\" The Dow Jones industrial average was up 130 points by noon in New York, while other markets had a quieter trading session after the recent turbulence triggered by big currency selloffs in Argentina and Turkey. The FTSE 100 in London closed six points lower at 6538, while share prices in Turkey and Argentina both rose.",

      "bodyText": "Libya's sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for more than $1bn (\u00a3600m) over allegations that the investment bank exploited a lack of financial expertise at Colonel Gaddafi's investment fund. In papers filed in London's high court, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) said Goldman charged it $1.1bn for a series of complex derivative trades in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, which it claimed eventually proved worthless. Even so, the bank is estimated to have reaped profits on the transactions of around $350m, the legal papers alleged. The case promises to provide an intriguing insight into how major banks scrambled to get their hands on Libya's wealth after the United Nations voted to lift sanctions on the country in 2003, a battle that continued until the reintroduction of the trading ban in 2011.

The investment bank's executive director in charge of Libyan investments, Youssef Kabbaj, was summoned to the LIA's office to explain, only for the meeting to come to an abrupt conclusion when the banker was thrown out of the building by LIA director, Mustafa Mohamed Zarti. Goldman reportedly offered to make Libya one of its biggest investors as compensation for losing practically all the funds the LIA entrusted to it.

Operating profits for 2014, the company said, are likely to be 10%-20% below the City's consensus guess of \u00a3277m. Cue a 17% fall in the share price. Recovery from the prison-escorting and tagging sagas will not be speedy.</p> <p>Rose-tinted vision among investors may be part of the problem here.

      "bodyText": "Good news for scandal-hit Serco: the Cabinet Office has declared the company to be sufficiently cleansed to be allowed to bid for public sector contracts again. But here's the sting for shareholders. They have been fooling themselves if they thought Serco suffered anything less than a full-on corporate heart-attack last year. Operating profits for 2014, the company said, are likely to be 10%-20% below the City's consensus guess of \u00a3277m. Cue a 17% fall in the share price. Recovery from the prison-escorting and tagging sagas will not be speedy. Rose-tinted vision among investors may be part of the problem here.

Helena Smith in Athens writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Releasing its quarterly review earlier today, IOBE was unequivocal: in 2014 the recession-hit Greek economy would finally bottom out, it said, but in sharp contrast to official forecasts it could not be excluded that national output would also contract.</p> <p>The Athens-based think tank, which was headed by Yannis Stournaras before he took up the post of finance minister in June 2012, said much would depend on the implementation of structural reforms, foreign direct investment and the persistent problem of Greece\u2019s debt overhang \u2013 a barrier to international business interest in the country.</p> <p>IOBE\u2019s research director, Angelos Tsakanikas, who helped draft the report, told me that while the economy was \u201cmoving towards zero\u201d it was possible it could still contract.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a slowing down of the depression, we are moving towards stability, towards zero, but this [recovery] is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing is done with implementing structural reforms, attracting investment and tackling unemployment, the economy could contract \u2026 we could, for example, see it hit minus two.\u201d The macro-economic environment would also play a role. \u201cLast year we had recession in the euro zone. If international trade improves it will be easier for Greeks to export.\u201d</p> <p>Athens\u2019 pro-bailout coalition government has repeatedly said the economy --- which has shrunk by around 25% since the debt crisis began - will begin to recover in 2014, growing by a predicted 0.6%.</p> <p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Addressing his parliamentary group today, prime minister Antonis Samaras insisted that Greece was about to pull out of recession \u2013 at six years its longest in post-war history. \u201cThe country has suffered, and is still suffering, but the worst has been avoided and we are now starting to come out of the crisis. Some seem to forget that we stopped the country from collapsing,\u201d the conservative leader told his MPs. \u201cWith the help of God and people\u2019s support we will achieve even more.\u201d</span></p> <p>After pulling off the biggest fiscal consolidation ever recorded in an OECD country, optimism is such that Stournaras has declared Greece will also re-enter markets in the summer of 2014. But as IOBE, the economic institute, emphasized in its report, there are worries that not enough has been done to implement structural reforms that would improve business by overhauling an archaic public administration and bureaucracy. Raising the same concerns the Greek parliament\u2019s independent budget office announced on Wednesday that priority to fiscal reforms (at the behest of creditors) had ultimately \u201cweakened the [country\u2019s] long-term prospects for recovery.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-30T16:16:24.449Z\">at 4.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52ea6ad8e4b082819802e9e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-30T15:16:37.167Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Back in the US, and signs of a slowdown in the housing market.</b></p> <p>Pending home sales fell 8.7% in December, according to an index from the National Association of Realtors.

Helena Smith in Athens writes: Releasing its quarterly review earlier today, IOBE was unequivocal: in 2014 the recession-hit Greek economy would finally bottom out, it said, but in sharp contrast to official forecasts it could not be excluded that national output would also contract. The Athens-based think tank, which was headed by Yannis Stournaras before he took up the post of finance minister in June 2012, said much would depend on the implementation of structural reforms, foreign direct investment and the persistent problem of Greece\u2019s debt overhang \u2013 a barrier to international business interest in the country. IOBE\u2019s research director, Angelos Tsakanikas, who helped draft the report, told me that while the economy was \u201cmoving towards zero\u201d it was possible it could still contract. \u201cThere is a slowing down of the depression, we are moving towards stability, towards zero, but this [recovery] is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing is done with implementing structural reforms, attracting investment and tackling unemployment, the economy could contract \u2026 we could, for example, see it hit minus two.\u201d The macro-economic environment would also play a role. \u201cLast year we had recession in the euro zone. If international trade improves it will be easier for Greeks to export.\u201d Athens\u2019 pro-bailout coalition government has repeatedly said the economy --- which has shrunk by around 25% since the debt crisis began - will begin to recover in 2014, growing by a predicted 0.6%. Addressing his parliamentary group today, prime minister Antonis Samaras insisted that Greece was about to pull out of recession \u2013 at six years its longest in post-war history. \u201cThe country has suffered, and is still suffering, but the worst has been avoided and we are now starting to come out of the crisis. Some seem to forget that we stopped the country from collapsing,\u201d the conservative leader told his MPs. \u201cWith the help of God and people\u2019s support we will achieve even more.\u201d After pulling off the biggest fiscal consolidation ever recorded in an OECD country, optimism is such that Stournaras has declared Greece will also re-enter markets in the summer of 2014. But as IOBE, the economic institute, emphasized in its report, there are worries that not enough has been done to implement structural reforms that would improve business by overhauling an archaic public administration and bureaucracy. Raising the same concerns the Greek parliament\u2019s independent budget office announced on Wednesday that priority to fiscal reforms (at the behest of creditors) had ultimately \u201cweakened the [country\u2019s] long-term prospects for recovery.\u201d Back in the US, and signs of a slowdown in the housing market. Pending home sales fell 8.7% in December, according to an index from the National Association of Realtors. This was the lowest level since October 2011, although part of the fall was due to the cold weather across the country. Housing sales have been hit by a rise in mortgage rates, but the cold was pinpointed by NAR economist Lawrence Yun: Unusually disruptive weather across large stretches of the country in December forced people indoors and prevented some buyers from looking at homes or making offers. Teunis Brosens at ING Bank said: This is a nasty surprise, that is probably partly explained by adverse weather conditions in December. It is unclear however to what extent bad weather explains sales weakness. A few bits of good news are that mortgage rates have stabilised since December, and the number of mortgage applications has also recovered to pre-December figures. There is therefore some ground to believe that today\u2019s plunge in pending sales is a one-off that will party be reversed in the coming months. Still, it is very clear that the housing bonanza of late 2012 and early 2013 is over. The Fed\u2019s tapering is not without consequences, and the housing market is shifting in a lower gear. Meanwhile Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up around 50 points or 0.34%. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso is speaking about the state of the economy (at the plenary session of the Committee of the Regions in Brussels): Dow Futures now sharply higher in the wake of the US GDP figures, up 92 points. We'll know shortly how accurate that proves... The US GDP figures probably mean the Fed could trim another $10bn off its monthly bond buying programme at its March meeting, said ING's Rob Carnell. He said: US GDP came in right on expectations at 3.2% for the fourth quarter, though this is a pretty good result, and comes after a strong 4.1% figure for the previous three months. The Bureau of Economic analysis estimates that the government shutdown reduced GDP by about 0.3 percentage points. So without this, GDP may have come in closer to 3.5%. Overall, this is a strong set of data, especially when you take into account the government shutdown, though the GDP price deflators were on the weak side \u2013 which may worry some. This should not be enough to detract the Fed from what looks like it will be another $10bn taper at their March FOMC meeting taking monthly QE down to $55bn. But if GDP figures were in line with expectations, weekly jobless claims rose by more than forecast. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit rose by 19,000 to 348,000 last week compared to an expected figure of 330,000. But analysts pointed out the week included Martin Luther King day, and claims tended to be volatile around Federal holidays. On top of that, claims for Louisiana were estimated because of poor weather. The Dow Jones Futures, showing a 42 point increase ahead of the GDP and jobless claims data, has slipped to a 35 point predicted rise. The US economy grew by 3.2% in the fourth quarter, official figures show, which is bang in line with expectations. It compares to a 4.1% rise in GDP in the third quarter, and benefited from strong household spending and rising exports. The figures come a day after the US Federal Reserved trimmed its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn and said that \"growth in economic activity picked up in recent quarters.\" Consumer spending rose by 3.3%, the strongest since the fourth quarter of 2010 while exports grew by 11.4%. Emerging market currencies have clawed back some of this morning's early losses, but the Turkish lira is still down around 0.2% against the US dollar at 2.26. The Hungarian forint is also down on the day, off 0.6% at 311 to the US dollar. And the ruble was also hit, touching a record low against the euro and the lowest level since March 2009 against the dollar. Just chatted with Jeremy Cook of World First, who explained that a range of factors are pushing down emerging market currencies. For example, the Fed's continued taper, the weak Chinese manufacturing figures (see opening post), political unrest in Ukraine and Thailand, current account deficits in many countries. This has combined into a perfect emerging market storm. The Hungarian forint is likely to come under more pressure, Cook added, because its central bank had indicated it wanted to maintain loose monetary policy. And the Turkey lira is still being hit because traders fear that the huge interest rate hikes on Tuesday night leave them with few other weapons now. Cook added: \ufeffThere's a school of thought that they've fired their last bullet and not landed a fatal blow in the battle to protect their currency. And with that, I\"m handing over to Nick Fletcher for the rest of the day - starting with the US GDP data for the last quarter, any moment.... Cheers all. GW Data firm Markit reports that the cost of insuring Russian and Ukranian debt against default has risen this morning, suggesting increased worries about both countries. 30-Jan-2014 13:12 - UKRAINE'S 5-YEAR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS RISE 62 BPS FROM WED CLOSE TO 999 BPS, HIGHEST SINCE DEC 17 - MARKIT (That means it would cost almost \u00a31m per year to insure \u00a310m of Ukranian bonds.) 30-Jan-2014 13:12 - RUSSIA 5-YEAR CDS RISE 16 BPS TO 209 BPS, A 6-MONTH HIGH - MARKIT Although Greece is calmer than during the height of the crisis, protests against the government's austerity programme have not gone away. A group of health service workers and patient have held a demonstration outside a cancer hospital in Athens this morning, against planned cuts to public health spending: The protests took place as prime minister Antonis Samaras rejected claims that he might call an early general election, having seen his majority shrivel in recent months. He also told MPs that Greece would hit its target of a primary surplus (excluding the cost of paying back its debts), saying: \ufeff\"Based on the most recent data, the primary surplus reached, and I would say exceeds, 1 billion euros,\" The New Zealand dollar is another casualty of the volatility in the FX market, down around 0.5% today at 0.816 to the US dollar. It's struggling after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand central bank voted to leave interest rates unchanged last night, although there's a theory that it could hike next month. Jane Foley of Rabobank explains: The worse performing G10 currency over the past 5 days is the New Zealand dollar (NZD). Last night\u2019s decision by the RBNZ to leave rates on hold weighed on the NZD, though the hawkish commentary by the central bank leaves suggests it will still be the first developed world central bank to hike rates. The RBNZ described the NZ economic expansion as having \u201cconsiderable momentum\u201d and stated that it \u201cremains committed to increasing the OCR as needed to keep future average inflation near the 2 percent target mid-point\u201d. Brief drama in the stock market there -- shares in banking giant HSBC soared 10%, forcing the stock to be suspended. But a few minutes later, it's back where it started - leaving traders wondering if someone accidentally botched an order -- known as a 'fat finger trade' in the City. Fat-finger blunders are embarrassing, and can be pretty expensive for the offender -- unless the stock market regulator decides to cancel the trades. Turkey's finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, has reiterated that the country will not introduce capital controls to try to support the lira. Simsek told reporters that Turkey would seek to improve the investment environment and continue its reforms, rather than restricting the flow of capital. Reuters has more details: \ufeffSpeaking to reporters a day after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan referred to a possible \"out of the ordinary\" economic package, Simsek said it was too early to start discussing tax breaks for certain sectors. Further proof that the eurozone is no longer the big threat to the global economy -- Italy's borrowing costs just hit a euro-era low at a \u20ac8.45bn auction of debt this morning. The Italian Treasury sold five year bonds at an average yield of just 2.43%, the lowest interest rate since the euro was created. It also sold 10-year bonds at an average yields of 3.81%, down from 4.1% last month. Business and consumer confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level since July 2011, driven by a pickup in Germany (unsurprising) and France (more surprising). That's according to the EC's monthly survey which showed that economic confidence has risen for the ninth month in a row as the perils of the eurozone debt crisis receded. Sentiment in Germany jumped to from 106.0 to 106.7 on the EC's index, while France rose from 96 to 97.1 (where 100 is the long-term average). Blue-chip companies with exposure to emerging markets are dominating the fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. It's not just Diageo, although its problems in China and Nigeria have certainly hit its shares. My colleague Nick Fletcher writes: And the effect of a slowdown in emerging markets has been starkly illustrated by drinks giant Diageo, down 219p or 11% to \u00a316.91 at one point before recovering to \u00a31792.5p, 117.5p lower. The company reported sales of 1.8% in the first half, down from 2.2%, hit by weakness in China, Thailand and Nigeria. In particular a crackdown by the Chinese government on gift giving and personal spending by civil servants has hit sales of spirits. SABMiller, another company with a strong presence in emerging markets, is down 73p at 2728.5p while Unilever has fallen 54p to \u00a323.37, Prudential is down 27p to \u00a312.17 and Standard Chartered is 25.5p lower at 1262p for similar reasons. Business lending in the UK, though, continues to lag the mortgage market -- underlying how consumers have been driving the recovery. Lending to non-financial firms fell by another \u00a31.9bn last month -- that's a surprise, as other surveys have shown that the availability of corporate credit has risen. IHS economist Howard Archer explains that firms must be offered credit at affordable rates, otherwise the recovery could falter: As demand for credit does pick up, it is vitally important for healthy and more balanced UK growth that all companies who are in decent shape and who do want to borrow \u2013 whether it be lift investment, explore new markets or generally support their operations \u2013 can do so, and at a non-punishing interest rate. This applies to all companies, whatever their size. Britain's housing market continued to strengthen in December, with 71,638 mortgages approved last month. That's the biggest figure since January 2008, in the early months of the financial crisis. A Turkish official has told Reuters that the country's government is not planning capital controls -- something analysts have speculated might be required if the lira keeps falling. Here's the details: Turkey is not considering any sort of capital controls as it battles to defend the lira, a senior government official said on Thursday, after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said an \"out of the ordinary\" economic package could be announced soon. \"We are not working on capital controls and it is not on the table,\" the official told Reuters. Under capital controls, individuals and firms are restricted from taking money out of the country, and can also be prevented from large cash withdrawals (as in Cyprus since last spring). Today's selloff pushed the South African rand down to a new five-year low against the US dollar. Its slide accelerated after mining unions turned down a 9% pay offer from three mining companies. The proposal fell short of workers' demands for a significantly higher minimum wage (details here) The Hungarian forint is also being driven down this morning, falling another 1% to a two-year low of 312.15 against the euro. One traders in Budapest told Reuters that the forint is feeling some of the heat directed against the lira: \"The ink has not yet even dried on the Turkish rate hike and they come against the forint\". Emerging market currencies are also taking another pasting, in a volatile session. The Turkish lira is currently down another 1% or so, at 2.28 to the US dollar. That means it's lost all the gains created by Tuesday night's shock interest rate hikes. The South African Rand has also weakened around 0.8% against the US dollar, to 11.35, a day after its central bank also announced a surprise rise in borrowing costs. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says the twists and turns have left many traders dizzy, after Turkey's rate hike sparked only a very short-term rally in the lira: It is easy in hindsight to point out that aggressive rate hikes at a time of moderate growth can be counter-productive, or that there were not many big speculative short positions in the lira that could be flushed out by the move... But I didn't hear many people expressing those views when I arrived at work yesterday morning, after the rally and before the reverse. Now, many investors will be trying to keep risk at a minimum, while a few will no doubt be wondering what the next currency to come under pressure is. ' Germany's labour market has picked up again this month, as the eurozone's largest economy begins 2014 with a much larger fall in unemployment than expected. Reuters has the details: German unemployment fell significantly more than expected on a seasonally adjusted basis in January, Labour Office data showed on Thursday. The number of people out of work decreased by 28,000 to 2.927m, the data showed. The mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll had been for a decrease of 5,000. The jobless rate stood at 6.8% for January. The rate for December was revised down to 6.8% from an originally reported 6.9%. Thought for the day, from a City fund manager with a finger in plenty of emerging market pies: The news that China's factory sector slowed this month (see here) has helped send shares down in emerging markets - where the Federal Reserve's decision to keep tapering has also hit sentiment. The Indian Sensex is down 1.3% so far, South Africa's main index has lost 0.4%, and the Thai market is off 1%. Environmental activists should be very pleased to hear that Royal Dutch Shell has abandoned plans to drill in the Alaskan Arctic this summer. The u-turn, announced in its results this morning, comes after a US court rules that officials hadn't considered the full environmental impacts of exploring in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. CEO Ben van Beurden said he wasn't prepared to devote further resources to Alaska while the legal situation remained murky. Here's the full story: Shell shelves plan to drill in Alaskan Arctic this summer Diageo is the biggest faller in the City this morning , down over 4% after the drinks firm reported a slowdown in sales to emerging markets. It blamed weak sales of baijiu (the strong Chinese white spirit), and also tough trading in Nigeria - where cash-strapped consumers sought out cheaper beer rather than Diageo's Guinness Net sales were down 22% in China, and 10% in Nigeria, in the last six months. Ivan Menezes, chief executive, said Diageo faced \"a more challenging emerging market environment\". The recent turmoil in the markets, which has seen many currencies slide, won't make things easier. More on this later In the City, the FTSE 100 has fallen 22 points in early trading to 6520, as all the main European markets open in the red. Germany's DAX and the French CAC are broadly flat, but Spain's IBEX is down 0.4% and Italy's FTSE MIB has dropped 0.3%. The Fed taper, and the weak Chinese factory data, aren't giving traders any reason for optimism -- especially after most Asian stock markets fell. Ishaq Siddiqi, strategist at ETX Capital, comments: \ufeffOvernight, Asian markets were rocked by the combo of Fed tapering and more importantly for the region, data which continues to point to contraction in Chinese growth \u2013 the HSBC PMI manufacturing report out of the country dipped into contraction zone to 49.5, raising fears that pace of the slowdown in China is accelerating beyond even the government\u2019s expectations. Just in: Spain's economy has continued to claw its way out of the eurozone crisis by posting another quarter of growth. Spanish GDP rose by 0.3% in the final three months of 2013, accelerating from the 0.1% expansion recorded in the third quarter. The figures confirm that Spain is putting its long recession behind it, as this chart from Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet shows. On an annual basis, GDP was down by 0.1%, while the Spanish economy still shrank by 1.3% during the year. It's not as strong as the UK's recovery (Britain's GDP grew by 0.7% in the quarter). And the Spanish jobless crisis is clearly a massive problem still. But it should fuel optimism that the eurozone periphery is making some progress out of the slump. The Beijing government may be concerned to hear that Chinese manufacturing output declined for the first time since last July (see opening post for the details). Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, reckons Chinese officials should be ready to tweak their economic reform plans, saying: \ufeff\"A soft start to China's manufacturing sectors in 2014, partly due to weaker new export orders and slower domestic business activities during January. Policy makers should pay attention to downside risks and pre- emptively fine-tune policy to steady the pace of growth if needed.\" The full survey is online here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. It's the morning after the taper before, as the City digests last night's message from the Federal Reserve that it has kept trimming its bond-buying stimulus programme. Undaunted by the turmoil in emerging markets, the Fed made it pretty clear that it will keep tapering so long as the US economy appears to keep recovering. As we liveblogged last night, EM didn't even get a mention in the statement as the Fed reduced its bond-buying programme to $65bn/month. Federal Reserve cuts additional $10bn from economic stimulus programme The decision was unanimous -- showing America's central bank wasn't knocked off course by the slowdown in US job creation in December, or the emerging market problems. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets comments: It appears that the Fed is prepared t\ufeffo look past the weakness in the last US jobs report of 2013 given the better than expected economic data coming from elsewhere. The consensus also suggests that the FOMC aren\u2019t concerned about deflationary pressures either at this point, or recent volatility in emerging markets. And overnight, confirmation of a slowdown in China's manufacturing sector has made the markets more fretful. The China Markit/HSBC final manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the factory sector, fell to 49.5 this month from December's 50.5. That's the first time in six months that the PMI has been below the 50-point mark, which separates expansion from contraction. In a worrying sign, the survey showed output growth had eased to a \"marginal pace\", while jobs were cut at the fastest rate since March 2009. \uf06e In the first deterioration in six months, Markit also reported that new export orders declined in January. That helped wipe 1% off the Chinese stock market, while Japan's Nikkei tumbled 2.5% -- reversing all yesterday's gains. Reaction to follow, along with other developments through the day.",

Ironically the warning came minutes after the government said it had decided the company would be allowed to win new work. Both Serco and FTSE 100 rival <strong>G4S</strong> charged for tagging criminals who were not monitored, were in prison or even dead. Analyst David Greenall at RBC Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> If we assume 20% hit to consensus for 2014 - then earnings per share would be 27.7p so still trading on 16 times PE. Note we have 2015 earnings also down on 2014 at present.

The incremental corporate renewal costs could also be a feature at G4S when it reports. One would also thought there may well be greater one-offs at G4S if for example the tagging contract is deemed to have a similar negative hit (ie around \u00a370m at Serco). </blockquote> <p>G4S fell 8.2p to 237.7p while another outsourcer, <strong>Capita</strong>, closed 10p lower at \u00a310.01.</p> <p>Among a host of company results, <strong>BSkyB </strong>was 33.5p better at 878p following its figures while <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares rose 24p to 2266.5p..</p> <p>British Airways and Iberia owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong> added 15.5p to 418.7p after positive comments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>Elsewhere gaming group <strong>888</strong> was steady at 140p despite announcing record revenues in the fourth quarter. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> We recognise that the short-term uncertainties may hold back the shares in the near term, but the underlying proposition is strong and the progress in the US is promising (the platform has now surpassed Party/Borgata in New Jersey). We also see the potential for further special dividends.

The positive news pushed M&amp;B shares up 10.6p to 449.1p.</p> <p>But <strong>Premier Oil</strong> slipped 4.7p to 272.8p as Goldman Sachs moved from buy to neutral: While valuation remains relatively attractive, we forecast little medium-term growth and see better opportunities elsewhere in the sector.</p> <p>Finally <strong>blinkx</strong>, the video search and ad group spun out of Autonomy, fell sharply after criticism from a US blog by Harvard Business School professor Benjamin Edelman, which raised questions about its advertising tactics and the value it provided for advertisers. The company belatedly responded to the fall, saying:</p> <blockquote> As a matter of course, the company does not normally comment on such matters. However, blinkx has noted a recent blog post by a consultant paid by unnamed third parties, in which he discloses, \"I prepared a portion of this article at the request of a client that prefers not to be listed by name.\" blinkx strongly refutes the assertions made and conclusions drawn in the blog post. <br> The company confirms there has been no material change to the operational and financial performance or outlook for the business, and that fiscal third quarter trading was in line with management expectations. </blockquote> <p>This did little to limit the damage, with blinkx losing 32% of its value to 1189.75p.</p>",

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Europe's markets have continued to weaken with companies with particular exposure to emerging markets starting to feel the draught as investors wake up to the possibility that the recent rate hikes in these various markets are quite likely to prompt a slowdown in these parts of the world. Overall the FTSE 100 closed down 5.83 points at 6538.45. Mid-cap outsourcing group Serco slid 86.3p to 423.2p after it issued a profit warning. It said 2014 profits could be up to 20% below forecasts after its high profile UK government contract failures. Ironically the warning came minutes after the government said it had decided the company would be allowed to win new work. Both Serco and FTSE 100 rival G4S charged for tagging criminals who were not monitored, were in prison or even dead. Analyst David Greenall at RBC Capital Markets said: If we assume 20% hit to consensus for 2014 - then earnings per share would be 27.7p so still trading on 16 times PE. Note we have 2015 earnings also down on 2014 at present. This takes no account of further contract risk (Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Northern Rail, Docklands Light Railway are all major renewals over the next two years). The bigger issue may be that net debt to EBITDA could go to around 2.7 times...we would note that other outsourcers have raised money when the ratios have moved to these levels, while potential customers may think twice about outsourcing to a company which is more financially stretched. The incremental corporate renewal costs could also be a feature at G4S when it reports. One would also thought there may well be greater one-offs at G4S if for example the tagging contract is deemed to have a similar negative hit (ie around \u00a370m at Serco). G4S fell 8.2p to 237.7p while another outsourcer, Capita, closed 10p lower at \u00a310.01. Among a host of company results, BSkyB was 33.5p better at 878p following its figures while Royal Dutch Shell B shares rose 24p to 2266.5p.. British Airways and Iberia owner International Airlines Group added 15.5p to 418.7p after positive comments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elsewhere gaming group 888 was steady at 140p despite announcing record revenues in the fourth quarter. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said: We recognise that the short-term uncertainties may hold back the shares in the near term, but the underlying proposition is strong and the progress in the US is promising (the platform has now surpassed Party/Borgata in New Jersey). We also see the potential for further special dividends. Therefore, we are happy to stick with our buy recommendation. Mitchells &amp; Butlers, whose pub brands include Toby Carvery and All Bar One, enjoyed its biggest ever sales week as part of the Christmas festivities. The company said like for like sales rose 2.6% over the three weeks to 4 January, with food volumes up 1.3%. The positive news pushed M&amp;B shares up 10.6p to 449.1p. But Premier Oil slipped 4.7p to 272.8p as Goldman Sachs moved from buy to neutral: While valuation remains relatively attractive, we forecast little medium-term growth and see better opportunities elsewhere in the sector. Finally blinkx, the video search and ad group spun out of Autonomy, fell sharply after criticism from a US blog by Harvard Business School professor Benjamin Edelman, which raised questions about its advertising tactics and the value it provided for advertisers. The company belatedly responded to the fall, saying: As a matter of course, the company does not normally comment on such matters. However, blinkx has noted a recent blog post by a consultant paid by unnamed third parties, in which he discloses, \"I prepared a portion of this article at the request of a client that prefers not to be listed by name.\" blinkx strongly refutes the assertions made and conclusions drawn in the blog post. The company confirms there has been no material change to the operational and financial performance or outlook for the business, and that fiscal third quarter trading was in line with management expectations. This did little to limit the damage, with blinkx losing 32% of its value to 1189.75p.",

      "bodyText": "The John Lewis Partnership is set to ditch its final salary pension scheme in an attempt to cut costs, the last major retailer to do so. The group, which owns the Waitrose supermarket chain as well as department stores, said it was planning a hybrid scheme in which part of workers' pensions would be linked to their final salary and part would depend on contributions. The company, which is one of just a handful of businesses still offering a final salary pension, also wants to increase the period staff must wait before they can join the salary-linked scheme, known as a defined benefit pension, from three years to five years. Other proposals include linking the pension scheme's normal retirement age to future increases in the state pension age and tying pension increases during retirement to the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation capped at 2.5% rather than the higher retail prices index (RPI).

John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant, said any decision on trimming John Lewis benefits was likely to be \"highly political\" as the cost of dealing with the pension deficit ultimately came out of the employees' annual bonus payments. He said the measures were unlikely to be enough in the long term: \"Although this is a change and the benefits will be less, this is still a defined benefits scheme open to new and existing members and that doesn't go far enough. \"At some point in the future John Lewis will have to come back and have another go at it.\" The pension proposals will now be discussed by John Lewis employees with a final plan expected to be voted on towards the end of this year.

Serco agreed last month to pay \u00a368.5m plus VAT to compensate taxpayers for overcharging plus \u00a32m in profits from its prisoner escorting contract. The Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation into the tagging affair, which damaged Serco's reputation and its relationship with the government, its biggest customer. Running prisons, medical services, railways, defence contracts and other state work makes up about a quarter of the group's revenues. The renewal plan includes a management pledge to \"do what is right\", a new code of conduct, better training and performance management, separate management of UK central government work, a board-level corporate responsibility committee and ethics committees in each division. Serco is without a chief executive after Chris Hyman left in October. The company said it expected to appoint his replacement soon. Acting chief executive Ed Casey said: \"We have been through a very difficult period since July of last year, which has had a major impact on Serco: reducing near-term growth, diverting management focus, and adding costs to strengthen the business. We are now able to assess more clearly the adverse impact that continues into 2014. \"Nonetheless, following the continued implementation of our corporate renewal plans, Serco will be in a stronger position to compete effectively and return to making sustainable progress.\" RBC's Greenall said costs for the corporate renewal plan would probably affect G4S and that one-off charges could be bigger at G4S than at Serco.",

This represents the biggest rise in Spanish GDP since the beginning of 2008.</p> <p>The inland revenue report says the submerged economy has grown fastest in those areas most affected by unemployment and the burst housing bubble, such as Andalusia, the Canaries, Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha. The figure for Extremadura, where unemployment stands above 30%, is 31.1%.</p> <p>The housing boom \"created a huge reserve of black money, especially in coastal areas\", demonstrated by the \"massive use\" of \u20ac500 notes, which the report claims account for 70% of all the cash in circulation.</p> <p>Other factors are the punitive social security regime imposed on the self-employed and the lengthy and labyrinthine process of establishing a legal enterprise, both of which discourage entrepreneurship and boost the cash-in-hand economy.</p> <p>The report comments on the \"serious moral problem when it comes to paying taxes\", a situation that has put Spain's black economy high above Germany (13.1%), France (10.8%) and the UK (10.1%), although the rate in Italy, Portugal and Greece is closer to Spain's.</p> <p>Shadow economic activity in Greece is equivalent to almost a quarter of national output, a study by the London-based Institute of Economic Affairs found. The research found that Greece's shadow economy was equivalent to 24% of GDP last year, which was one of the highest rates in Europe but lower than a decade earlier when it surpassed 28%.</p> <p>The authors of the Spanish report, carried out for the tax department by the Universitat Rovira i Virgili, criticise the government for turning a blind eye to fraud. They also say it is only thanks to the black economy, along with family support and charity, that there has not been widespread social unrest.

The report by Spain's inland revenue department titled The Cost of the Submerged Economy: Increased Fraud During the Crisis claims that the black economy is now worth \u20ac253bn (\u00a3208bn) \u2013 \u20ac60bn more than in 2008. Meanwhile, figures released on Thursday show that Spain's GDP rose by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2013, up from 0.1% in the third quarter. This represents the biggest rise in Spanish GDP since the beginning of 2008. The inland revenue report says the submerged economy has grown fastest in those areas most affected by unemployment and the burst housing bubble, such as Andalusia, the Canaries, Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha. The figure for Extremadura, where unemployment stands above 30%, is 31.1%. The housing boom \"created a huge reserve of black money, especially in coastal areas\", demonstrated by the \"massive use\" of \u20ac500 notes, which the report claims account for 70% of all the cash in circulation. Other factors are the punitive social security regime imposed on the self-employed and the lengthy and labyrinthine process of establishing a legal enterprise, both of which discourage entrepreneurship and boost the cash-in-hand economy. The report comments on the \"serious moral problem when it comes to paying taxes\", a situation that has put Spain's black economy high above Germany (13.1%), France (10.8%) and the UK (10.1%), although the rate in Italy, Portugal and Greece is closer to Spain's. Shadow economic activity in Greece is equivalent to almost a quarter of national output, a study by the London-based Institute of Economic Affairs found. The research found that Greece's shadow economy was equivalent to 24% of GDP last year, which was one of the highest rates in Europe but lower than a decade earlier when it surpassed 28%. The authors of the Spanish report, carried out for the tax department by the Universitat Rovira i Virgili, criticise the government for turning a blind eye to fraud. They also say it is only thanks to the black economy, along with family support and charity, that there has not been widespread social unrest. Although unemployment stands at around 26%, it is an open secret that this figure disguises the large numbers working in the submerged economy. In spite of the high levels of fraud, there is only one Spanish tax inspector for every 1,928 taxpayers, compared with 860 in France and 729 in Germany.",

      "bodyText": "Shell's controversial presence in the Arctic, US shale lands and the Niger delta is in doubt after the oil group announced a sweeping strategic overhaul that includes the suspension of its Alaskan drilling programme. Taking the knife to some of his predecessor's pet projects, new chief executive Ben van Beurden said that the Anglo-Dutch company might have gone \"too quickly\" into shale exploration in the US and signalled a partial or total retreat from its onshore operations in Nigeria. Van Beurden's plans, including a multibillion-pound programme of disposals and writedowns, were announced in the wake of a tumultuous fourth quarter that saw earnings plunge 71% to $2.1bn (\u00a31.3bn) while oil and gas production fell 5%. \"We have not always made the right capital choices,\" van Beurden said at a briefing in London as he revealed a $687m writeoff in North America from shale, gas and the damaged Arctic drilling rig Kulluk. He blamed poor markets as well as internal failures for its problems as he dramatically pulled the plug on Shell's controversial scheduled drilling programme in the Alaskan Arctic this summer. Van Beurden admitted the exploration drive in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, which has cost $5bn so far, was \"under review\" amid a torrent of negative campaigning from green groups. A swath of onshore shale oil and gas assets in North America, with a balance-sheet value of $24bn, are also being considered for disposal or writedowns, while $1bn has been knocked off US shale drilling planned for this year. \"You could argue we went in too far, too quickly [into shale],\" he said. Van Beurden also made clear that Nigeria, once a key part of the Shell empire but a country where onshore operations have been subjected to repeated physical attacks, was being prepared for a future selloff or major scaling-back. \"We have seen a very difficult security situation for a number of years \u2026 What really do we have as value-added in this?\" he asked. Van Beurden, who took over from Peter Voser at the start of 2014, confirmed that annual profits, on a current cost of supply basis, had slumped 48% to $16.7bn despite very high oil prices, although US gas prices have been low.He is expected to give more details of his strategy after a management day on 13 March. \"We are making hard choices in our worldwide portfolio to improve Shell's capital efficiency,\" Van Beurden said. \"Our ambitious growth drive in recent years has yielded a step-change in Shell's portfolio and options, with more growth to come, but at the same time we have lost some momentum in operational delivery, and we can sharpen up in a number of areas,\" he added. Shares in Shell closed up 1% at \u00a321.48. Shell still has drilling interests in a range of territories, including the US Gulf, Brazil, Norway, Russia and Mozambique. Group spending is to be slashed this year by 20% to $37bn and the moves to halt high-cost operations off Alaska were particularly welcomed by environmentalists. Greenpeace campaigner Charlie Kronick said: \"The company has spent huge amounts of time and money on a project that has delivered nothing apart from bad publicity and a reputation for incompetence. The only wise decision at this point is for Mr Van Beurden to cut his company's losses and scrap any future plans to drill in the remote Arctic Ocean.\" Jacqueline Savitz, a vice-president at the Oceana conservation group, which had taken legal action to try to stop the oil company drilling, said: \"Shell is finally recognising what we've been saying all along: that offshore drilling in the Arctic is risky, costly and simply not a good bet from a business perspective.\" The decision to shelve drilling off Alaska came alongside a $200m writeoff of expenses connected with the Kulluk drilling rig, which ran aground in 2012. It also follows a US court ruling that the US department of the interior had failed to consider all environmental impacts of exploration in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas when it gave Shell permission to drill. \"This is a disappointing outcome, but the lack of a clear path forward means that I am not prepared to commit further resources for drilling in Alaska in 2014,\" van Beurden said. \"We will look to relevant agencies and the court to resolve their open legal issues as quickly as possible,\" he added, indicating there could be huge writedowns emanating from the Arctic still to come. Meanwhile Shell said it had distributed more than $11bn to shareholders in dividends and expects to spend more in 2014. The basic financial results were known two weeks ago when the company issued a shock profit warning, but on Thursday Van Beurden brushed off suggestions that management must have seen the crisis coming and should have told the market quicker. Total backs shale The French oil group Total has taken a second bet on Britain becoming a significant shale gas producer. Small independent shale pioneer Egdon Resources said it had sold off another part of its licence in the Gainsborough concession in the Midlands. Total will also pay \u00a313.5m of exploration costs. Earlier this month, the company took a 40% interest in two shale exploration licences in Lincolnshire. The move came on the day Shell reiterated that it had no current interest in UK shale. Shell is pursuing shale exploration in the US, Ukraine, China and Russia. But its financial turbulence means this year Shell will reduce its global spend on a search for shale resources from $6bn to $5bn.",

The company's strong position in emerging markets is seen as one of its long-term strengths but investors are increasingly jittery about those markets as the US tightens monetary policy, making Asia, Africa and Latin America relatively less attractive investment prospects. China's weakening manufacturing performance is also a big worry. Asian stock markets fell heavily and central banks in India, Turkey and South Africa have raised interest rates in attempts to support their currencies. Ivan Menezes, Diageo's chief executive, said: \"We have continued to demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio and diverse global business in a period which saw a more challenging emerging market environment. \"Sustained performance in the US and improved performance in western Europe enabled Diageo to absorb the current challenges in some of our emerging markets. We reacted quickly to the changing emerging market environment, reducing inventory levels in several key markets, which led to a weaker Q2 [second quarter].\" Net sales in Greater China fell 22% in the first half, mainly because of plunging sales of Shui Jing Fang, Diageo's brand of baijiu, the 52% proof white spirit that is drunk to seal business deals. Diageo said: \"Greater China performance largely reflects the impact of the government's anti-extravagance measures. The Shui Jing Fang business was most affected, with significant price discounting by competitors in the baijiu category driving a 66% decline in net sales.\" Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, has sought to rein in ostentatious spending by officials on gifts, banquets and alcohol-fuelled receptions to ease public unrest about the corruption and extravagance among the country's elite.",
