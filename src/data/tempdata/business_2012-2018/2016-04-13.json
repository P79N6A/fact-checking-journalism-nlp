      "bodyText": "The EU referendum and changes to stamp duty have contributed to a \u201cclimate of uncertainty\u201d that could lead to falling sales and prices in the housing market, surveyors and estate agents have said. For the first time since 2008, more of those on the frontline of the market expect sales to fall in the near term than increase, according to the latest monthly report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). The expected fall in activity comes after a busy start to the year as buy-to-let investors attempted to complete sales ahead of the introduction of a new higher rate of stamp duty on 1 April. Rics said agreed sales had increased for the fourth month running. The group said most UK regions had seen prices increase in March and that on a national level they had now risen every month for three years. However, London was a \u201cnotable exception\u201d and prices were reported to be falling in some areas. It said uncertainty over the EU vote and the mayoral election, together with the recent weakness of the pound, were expected to contribute to falling prices. Of respondents working in central London, 38% more expected to see house prices fall than rise over the next three months. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist of Rics, said: \u201cElections inevitably bring with them periods of uncertainty in the market, and our figures would suggest that May\u2019s devolved elections are no exception. Likewise, the EU referendum is likely to be an influence in terms of the damper outlook for London in particular.\u201d John King, of London-based estate agents Andrew Scott Robertson, said activity had picked up ahead of the stamp duty change. He added: \u201cThe outcome is likely that we will see a slowdown in sales occurring while outside events surrounding currency rates and employment levels undermine confidence.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s latest credit conditions report, published on Wednesday, found mortgage lenders are also expecting a fall in enthusiasm for buy-to-let following April\u2019s tax rise. Lenders told the Bank that they expected demand for buy-to-let loans to fall significantly in the second quarter, while demand for other mortgages would increase slightly. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that lending to buy-to-let investors was up by almost two-thirds year-on-year in February, as some landlords took advantage of low interest rates to remortgage, while others added to their portfolios ahead of changes to stamp duty rates. It said 23,700 buy-to-let loans worth \u00a33.7bn were taken out during the month, a 47% increase in volume on the previous February and a 61% rise in value. The key driver was remortgaging, with borrowers taking advantage of low rates to refinance their portfolios. Of the total, 13,100 mortgages worth \u00a32.2bn were remortgages. The number of first-time buyer mortgages was up by 11% year-on-year, at 22,000, while borrowing by these new entrants to the housing market was up by 21% at \u00a33.4bn. The property firm LSL, owner of Reeds Rain and Your Move estate agents, said that the market had seen its busiest March in nine years. It estimated a 30% month-on-month increase in transactions, saying it expected there to be 80,000 sales registered in England and Wales. While the spring bounce accounted for much of the increase, it said sales were set to be 7% higher than in March last year. Adrian Gill, director of Reeds Rains and Your Move, said: \u201cThis spring, with a frantic flurry of activity, the housing market has come to life ... This goes beyond any normal seasonality, with second-home and buy-to-let investors rushing to beat a bigger tax bill.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There have been no credible expressions of interest in buying Tata Steel\u2019s entire UK business and the chances of a rescue deal are \u201cremote\u201d, according to figures close to the sale process. The comments will heighten concern about the future of the Port Talbot steelworks, the biggest in the country, and more than 40,000 workers who either work for Tata Steel or its suppliers Tata and the government officially kicked off the sales process for Tata Steel UK on Monday, with just weeks to find a buyer before the Indian company closes the sites. Although it is early in the process, there are concerns about the lack of interest in the entire business, which is losing at least \u00a31m a day. One source close to Tata said \u201cpeople are interested in bits\u201d rather than the operations as a whole. It is understood this includes the downstream operations, such as rolling mills, but not Port Talbot and its blast furnaces. The pension fund is a \u201cbig blocker\u201d for any deal, the source added. The British Steel pension scheme, which is connected to the business, has liabilities of \u00a314.5bn. The scheme is well funded, but this is only because Tata has been pumping in more than \u00a3100m every year. Tata has said it needs to find a \u201ccredible\u201d buyer for the business and is thought to have concerns about Sanjeev Gupta, the boss of metals group Liberty House and a potential bidder. The Indian company wants to sell off the UK operations as a whole. Trade unions have also called on Tata to avoid a break-up of the business because it would leave Port Talbot, which is thought to be under particular financial strain, vulnerable to closure. Senior figures in Tata believe that ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate, is one of the only investors with the scale to rescue the business, but the package offered by the sellers and the government must be \u201cpalatable\u201d. As little as three months ago ThyssenKrupp was understood to have been in talks with Tata about buying its European steel business, including sites in the UK and the Netherlands. The German company even started due diligence, but pulled out after becoming concerned about the mounting losses at Port Talbot and the cost of modernising the site. Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director of Tata Steel, said on Monday that the company will court potential buyers, including investment firms and industrial companies from around the world. He said: \u201cThere has been a lot of people who have expressed interest, and we are aware of some of the interest that you refer to in the media. But today is a good time where our advisers will now start reaching out, and it is not a few people. I don\u2019t want to give a number, but it is in tens, many tens actually.\u201d Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government is willing to co-invest with a potential buyer, paving the way for a part-nationalisation of the Tata business if a private sector saviour can be found. This has boosted the hopes of securing a rescue deal. The construction industry lent its support to Britain\u2019s steelworks on Wednesday, praising the quality of domestic steel. The British Constructional Steelwork Association (BCSA), which represents companies using steel in construction and engineering products, said the structural steel market is expected to grow by 4% this year. It also said that steel remains competitively priced compared to alternatives. For example, the cost of a steel-framed building is around 5% lower than a concrete-framed building. Sarah McCann-Bartlett, director general of the BCSA, said: \u201cUsing a UK or Irish steelwork contractor adds additional value to the economy through the whole supply chain including the fabrication of the steelwork, and the supply of other products and services such as secondary steelwork, metal decking, protective coatings and cladding.\u201d UK Steel, the industry trade body, said the support of key projects could spark an increase in demand for steel. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \u201cThe steel industry is vital to the economy. On the back of the huge infrastructure projects in the pipeline and demand from key sectors such as automotive and aerospace its potential for growth is enormous. \u201cOrganisations in both the public and private sector should, where possible, give every opportunity during bidding processes to back British sustainable steel, adding to local economic value in a more environmentally sustainable way.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Institute of Directors weighs in on BP chief executive's pay award", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Institute of Directors has made a rare intervention on executive pay, urging BP shareholders to think twice before backing a decision to award $20m (\u00a314m) to chief executive Bob Dudley in a year when the company ran up its worst-ever losses. Simon Walker, the director general of the IoD, said the enormous remuneration deal for 2015 sent \u201cthe wrong message\u201d to investors and other boards, given the $6.5bn annual loss and the decision to axe 7,000 jobs. His comments came on the eve of what is likely to be a stormy BP annual general meeting in London, with the oil company facing criticism over a range of issues including controversial new drilling plans in waters off Australia. \u201cIt is rare that the IoD intervenes on the subject of an individual chief executive\u2019s pay. We are concerned, however, that Mr Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay package will seem unjustified to many shareholders, considering the performance of the company over the past 12 months,\u201d said Walker. Like other oil companies BP was hit hard by a collapse in oil prices last year, but the company argued that Dudley had done a good job in difficult circumstances. A spokesman said: \u201cDespite the very challenging environment, BP\u2019s safety and operating performance was excellent throughout 2015 and management also responded early and decisively to the steep fall in the oil price.\u201d He added that BP\u2019s performance had surpassed the board\u2019s expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration \u2013 and that the oil company\u2019s investors had agreed to the pay deal. \u201cThese clear measures derive directly from BP\u2019s remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with over 96% of the vote.\u201d Some of BP\u2019s major shareholders including Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London Asset Management have already both spoken out on the pay issue, as have proxy advisers Glass Lewis, ISS and ShareSoc. Walker said BP was not a badly run company and its current woes are common to other firms in the sector, but the corporate governance code was clear that pay should be tightly linked to performance and that targets should be stretching and rigorously applied. \u201cShould the pay package be approved, it could send the wrong message to investors and other boards. We therefore urge all shareholders to scrutinise the pay deal of Mr Dudley very closely,\u201d said the IoD boss. BP will also face fire at the AGM from investors and conservationists concerned about whether or not a promise to be transparent over the threats to its business from climate change is being kept, about plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight and a continuing unwillingness to fully open a company archive to the public despite a commitment to do so. In addition, there is a threat that the shareholder meeting will be one of a number targeted by Brexit campaigners to highlight their desire for Britain to leave the European Union. The responsible investment group ShareAction says the issue of high remuneration and what it believes is a high-risk project off southern Australia are linked. The country\u2019s offshore oil and gas authority has already rejected BP\u2019s original application to drill four exploration wells in the Great Australian Bight because of alleged inadequacies in its plans, but the oil company has since resubmitted new plans. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said: \u201cBP should take heed of the groundswell of opposition on remuneration. Shareholders expect to see value for money and long-term strategic thinking in exchange for high pay packets \u2013 not the pursuit of high-risk, high-cost projects like the controversial Great Australian Bight proposal. \u201cInvestors will be keen to know how BP can justify a 20% increase in Bob Dudley\u2019s pay when the company appears to be gambling on a project with the potential to become a second Deepwater Horizon.\u201d Phil Vernon, managing director of Australian Ethical Investment, criticised BP over its southern drilling plans, saying it should not be happening at a time when the world was trying to move to a low carbon economy. \u201cThe Paris agreement increases the imperative for oil and gas companies to urgently change their portfolios to reflect the shift to a lower-carbon mix. Directing capital to costly projects like the Great Australian Bight is high risk as the world moves to cut emissions. Further, BP can\u2019t afford the prospect of a Macondo-like oil spill in an area of such exceptional marine significance. The case against this project is both an ethical and a financial one.\u201d And in a third strand of attack, campaigners at Warwick University said BP was continuing to resist opening its corporate archive based on the student campus. The records are believed to contain years of BP research and development into solar and other renewable energy technologies that the company has since largely turned its back on. At last year\u2019s AGM, the BP chairman, Carl Henric Svanberg, insisted the archive was open to public use as part of a plan to be totally transparent about climate change issues.",

We are concerned, however, that Mr Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay package will seem unjustified to many shareholders, considering the performance of the company over the past 12 months,\u201d said Walker.</p> <p>Like other oil companies BP was hit hard by a collapse in oil prices last year, but the company argued that Dudley had done a good job in difficult circumstances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/executive-pay-up-increase-thinktank-analysis\">Executive pay up almost 6% according to thinktank analysis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesman said: \u201cDespite the very challenging environment, BP\u2019s safety and operating performance was excellent throughout 2015 and management also responded early and decisively to the steep fall in the oil price.\u201d</p> <p>He added that BP\u2019s performance had surpassed the board\u2019s expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration \u2013 and that the oil company\u2019s investors had agreed to the pay deal.</p> <p>\u201cThese clear measures derive directly from BP\u2019s remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with over 96% of the vote.\u201d</p> <p>Some of BP\u2019s major shareholders including Aberdeen Asset Management and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/11/vote-against-bp-chief-bob-dudley-pay-shareholder-group-says\">Royal London Asset Management have already both spoken</a> out on the pay issue, as have proxy advisers Glass Lewis, ISS and ShareSoc.</p> <p>Walker said BP was not a badly run company and its current woes are common to other firms in the sector, but the corporate governance code was clear that pay should be tightly linked to performance and that targets should be stretching and rigorously applied.</p> <p>\u201cShould the pay package be approved, it could send the wrong message to investors and other boards. We therefore urge all shareholders to scrutinise the pay deal of Mr Dudley very closely,\u201d said the IoD boss.</p> <p>BP will also face fire at the AGM from investors and conservationists concerned about whether or not a promise to be transparent over the threats to its business from climate change is being kept, about plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight and a continuing unwillingness to fully open a company archive to the public despite a commitment to do so.<br></p> <p>In addition, there is a threat that the shareholder meeting will be one of a number targeted by Brexit campaigners to highlight their desire for Britain to leave the European Union.</p> <p>The responsible investment group ShareAction says the issue of high remuneration and what it believes is a high-risk project off southern Australia are linked.

With colouring-in now considered an established hobby for many British adults, it was only a matter of time before publishers came up with a new iteration. On Wednesday, high street stationer WH Smith toasted bumper sales of extreme dot-to-dot and \u201cquerkles\u201d \u2013 a modern take on colour by numbers. Demand for what WH Smith calls colour therapy books has been propping up book sales at the retailer since last spring. Titles such as Enchanted Forest by Johanna Basford and and Millie Marotta\u2019s Animal Kingdom are still riding high in the Amazon UK bestseller list, where reviewers swap handy tips on which are the best pens and pencils to use and how to best colour over the centre of a double page spread. \u201cIn the last couple of months two other activity books have taken off \u2013 extreme dot-to-dot and a thing called querkle, which is extreme colour by numbers,\u201d said Stephen Clarke, the WH Smith chief executive. \u201cIt has had a big impact on our book sales and we are still seeing it performing really strongly.\u201d Rather than reaching for a glass of wine at the end of the day, these wholesome pursuits are often touted as an antidote to stress. Colouring books make up 70% of WH Smith\u2019s sales of \u201cadult activity\u201d books but extreme dot-to-dot and querkles are the fastest growing new puzzle genres. The retailer said that at times it has struggled to keep up with demand and in some cases it has rationed stocks as they kept selling out. For a tenner you can pick up Gareth Moore\u2019s Ultimate Dot to Dot. The book comes with the promise of \u201cover 30,000 dots\u201d to join, although the images \u2013 which include a pharaoh\u2019s death mask, the Taj Mahal and a skull \u2013 look more like the basis of a psychiatric evaluation. One Rorschach-esque picture in Moore\u2019s book has more than 1,700 dots to join. The book comes with encouraging instructions advising users to \u201cstart at number 1\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t worry if you make a mistake\u201d. However, its author adds the irreverent advice that you could always \u201cstart anywhere you like and the fill in the bits you missed later\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "European markets rallied and the FTSE 100 hit its highest level in 2016 after a sharp rebound in Chinese exports eased fears over the state of the global economy. The FTSE closed up 120.5 points or 1.9% at 6,362.89, the highest level since 2 December. Germany\u2019s DAX rose 2.7% and the French CAC closed up 3.3%. Investors were cheered by a bigger-than-expected jump in demand for China-made goods, which fuelled hopes that the world\u2019s second largest economy was in better shape than feared. Chinese exports returned to growth for the first time in nine months, up 11.5% in March compared with a year earlier. It was the biggest rise since February 2015 and followed a 25% fall in February when Chinese new year celebrations disrupted trade. Mining companies were among the top FTSE risers on hopes that demand for commodities such as iron ore, copper and zinc would rise on the back of stronger demand in China. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe last two months have seen a turnaround in fortunes for the UK stock market, after a miserable start to the year. Strong performance from oil and mining shares has been the key driver of the rebound in the Footsie, on the back of a recovery in commodity prices.\u201d Brent crude oil dipped slightly but remained above $44 a barrel. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cThe apparent turnaround in China\u2019s economy, the rise in oil prices as well as a more cautious Federal Reserve have removed the major concerns that led to the beginning of the year sell-off.\u201d Markets shrugged off a surprise fall in US retail sales and a warning from the International Monetary Fund about the possibility of a fresh global financial crisis. Mark Williams and Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics said the trade data suggested fears about the Chinese economy were overdone. \u201c[It] adds to growing evidence that the extreme gloom of a few weeks ago about the state of the domestic economy was misplaced,\u201d they wrote in a note. Despite the rebound in exports, China\u2019s trade surplus \u2013 exports minus imports \u2013 was the lowest in a year, at $29.9bn, after imports fell by a smaller-than-expected 7.6%. Figures to be published on Friday are expected to show growth in China slowed in the first quarter. Tim Condon, ING\u2019s Asia chief economist, said a bounce in Chinese exports in March was not enough to rescue a poor first quarter. \u201cForget exports. Support for growth will have to come from domestic spending. 2016 is shaping up to be the worst year for China\u2019s exports since 2009 and could be an even worse year for imports. \u201cPolicy has turned more accommodative in 2016 and the January-February activity data contained hopeful signs that it\u2019s bearing fruit. We think those signs are a sufficient reason for the authorities to stay the course.\u201d The Chinese government is targeting economic growth of 6.5% to 7% this year. The economy grew by 6.9% in 2015, the slowest rate in a quarter of a century.",

His plan is coherent \u2013 indeed, it is probably the only credible strategy in a market where the new price-setters are the discount twins Aldi and Lidl. But the \u201cin time\u201d clause is critical, at least for shareholders. On that score, Lewis is still offering only caution. Trading conditions are \u201cchallenging\u201d. Profits won\u2019t improve in a \u201cstraight line\u201d. More investment will be needed, which is retailers\u2019 code for keener prices. In short, Tesco shareholders will have to be patient. Wednesday\u2019s 8% drop in the share price was fair. It is also fair \u2013 for the time being, at least \u2013 for Lewis to plead for time. The new regime can\u2019t be faulted on what it has done so far. The top priority was always to arrest the slide in sales, and that has been achieved. Lewis can also argue he is taking the fight to discounters on fresh produce and meat, albeit via the dubious tactic of using fictitious farm names. On operating profits for the last financial year \u2013 the only tangible financial ambition Lewis had set publicly \u2013 the target was achieved with \u00a3944m. But the question of where Tesco\u2019s profit margins in the UK will settle in the medium-term remains anybody\u2019s guess. The 5% rate of old, when Tesco was fleecing customers and gouging suppliers, is out of the question. Is the new level 2% or 3%? Last year it was 1.2%, with the second half better than the first. Lewis\u2019 reluctance to air an estimate is understandable \u2013 he probably doesn\u2019t know himself. But the City won\u2019t view the Vague Dave show as charming for ever. One of these days, shareholders will want to know if the boss thinks he is running a proper recovery stock or a business that is merely better than the hollowed-out 2014 version. IPO reform overdue About time, too. The Financial Conduct Authority has realised the London IPO, or flotation, market has become an exercise in smoke and mirrors. Full prospectuses sometimes appear after shares have started trading. Independent analysts, who might be sceptical about the quality of goods on offer, are kept away from managements. Thus the only pre-float research that appears comes from analysts connected to the banks and brokers working on the IPO \u2013 and even that is kept within limited circulation. Meanwhile, the whole shebang is overseen by investment banks who slip extra shares to favoured fund managers when the newly-arriving company is genuinely a flyer. The FCA\u2019s interim findings are, therefore, welcome. The regulator must now ensure information becomes timely and useful. Prospectuses should be published a fortnight before trading day and independent analysts should not be gagged by lack of access. Neither measure, in itself, would guarantee a superior level of scrutiny. Small companies, in particular, may still struggle to gain anybody\u2019s attention. But the regulator can encourage a spirit of open and honest debate. Get on with it: reform was overdue two decades ago. Premier keeps its head After all the fuss, Mr Kipling is staying British. US spice maker McCormick has walked away from a bid for parent Premier Foods, saying it couldn\u2019t meet the board\u2019s price expectations. Cue a 25% fall in Premier\u2019s shares and, one suspects, unhappiness in shareholder ranks. Potential cash bids at twice the old share price don\u2019t come along often. Indeed, this saga has already seen tempers flare over Premier\u2019s side-deal with Nissin, the Japanese noodle maker and new friend in a mission to serve Ambrosia rice pudding and suchlike to the world. Agreement on a commercial partnership was quickly followed by Nissin buying a 20% stake in Premier. Was it right for Premier, when negotiating the trading alliance, to tell Nissin of McCormick\u2019s potential bid interest? A couple of big Premier shareholders thought they smelled an underhand tactic to frustrate McCormick. Despite the kerfuffle, it\u2019s hard to say Premier did anything wrong. The Takeover Panel was informed at every stage, one assumes. What\u2019s more, the cooperation agreement can\u2019t have acted as a poison pill because it couldn\u2019t be signed until McCormick had decided whether to bid. As for Nissin\u2019s actual share purchase, it couldn\u2019t happen until everybody \u2013 shareholders included \u2013 had been told of McCormick\u2019s interest. Add it all up, and Premier seems to have kept its head when all about were losing theirs. It will be a harder task for Premier\u2019s board to demonstrate that their debt-laden business is worth more than the 65p, or \u00a3537m, that McCormick was waving. But that\u2019s next year\u2019s story.",

      "bodyText": "The oil industry\u2019s knowledge of dangerous climate change stretches back to the 1960s, with unearthed documents showing that it was warned of \u201cserious worldwide environmental changes\u201d more than 45 years ago. The Stanford Research Institute presented a report to the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1968 that warned the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels could carry an array of harmful consequences for the planet. The emergence of this stark advice follows a series of revelations that the fossil fuel industry was aware of climate change for decades, only to publicly deny its scientific basis. \u201cSignificant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000 and these could bring about climatic change,\u201d the 1968 Stanford report, found and republished by the Center for International Environmental Law, states. \u201cIf the Earth\u2019s temperature increases significantly, a number of events might be expected to occur including the melting of the Antarctic ice cap, a rise in sea levels, warming of the oceans and an increase in photosynthesis. \u201cIt is clear that we are unsure as to what our long-lived pollutants are doing to our environment; however, there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe.\u201d The study, written by scientists Elmer Robinson and RC Robbins, adds that accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere could cause \u201cserious worldwide environmental changes\u201d. The scientists estimated that CO2 in the atmosphere could reach 400 parts per million by 2000. In fact, CO2 levels broke that milestone last year, recording their largest leap on record. This huge increase in CO2, the primary driver of the greenhouse effect, has helped global temperatures rise by 1C over the past century. It is estimated that about three-quarters of the world\u2019s known fossil fuel reserves, including oil, coal and gas, will have to remain unburned if civilisation is to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, such as droughts, floods, food insecurity and inundation from rising seas. API, the peak body for the oil industry in the US, knew about the dangers of climate change at least 20 years before the issue was brought into mainstream public discourse via the former Nasa scientist James Hansen. Former US president Lyndon Johnson also received an early warning about climate change, with scientists explaining the mechanism of the greenhouse effect in 1965. Last year, it was revealed that ExxonMobil, the world\u2019s largest oil company, knew of climate change as early as 1981, only to spend millions of dollars over the following 27 years to promote climate denial. The exposure of this prior knowledge has been led by Inside Climate News. Exxon had a dedicated in-house team that established the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, but the company still spent years refusing to acknowledge the issue and funding climate denial activities. Exxon now insists it accepts climate science and doesn\u2019t promote denial of the changes to the planet already under way. The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) said hundreds of documents show oil and gas executives met in 1946 to agree that they should fund research into air pollution issues. The subsequent findings were then covered up to protect company profits, according to the environmental law group. Carroll Muffett, president of CIEL, said the latest documents from 1968 \u201cadd to the growing body of evidence that the oil industry worked to actively undermine public confidence in climate science and in the need for climate action even as its own knowledge of climate risks was growing. \u201cThese documents are the tip of an evidentiary iceberg that demands further investigation,\u201d Muffett said. \u201cOil companies had an early opportunity to acknowledge climate science and climate risks, and to enable consumers to make informed choices. They chose a different path. The public deserves to know why.\u201d The prominent climate scientist Michael Mann, of Pennsylvania State University, said it was \u201cdisgraceful that industry groups like API knowingly hid the dangers of their project decades ago when they first learned of them, much as the tobacco industry hid the dangers of their product\u201d. API was contacted for comment on the documents.",

In fact, CO<sub>2</sub> levels <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/co2-levels-make-largest-recorded-annual-leap-noaa-data-shows\">broke that milestone last year</a>, recording their largest leap on record. </p> <p>This huge increase in CO<sub>2</sub>, the primary driver of the greenhouse effect, has helped global temperatures rise by 1C over the past century. It is estimated <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/22/earth-day-scientists-warning-fossil-fuels-\">that about three-quarters</a> of the world\u2019s known fossil fuel reserves, including oil, coal and gas, will have to remain unburned if civilisation is to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, such as droughts, floods, food insecurity and inundation from rising seas.</p> <p>API, the peak body for the oil industry in the US, knew about the dangers of climate change at least 20 years before the issue was brought into mainstream public discourse via the former Nasa scientist James Hansen. Former US president Lyndon Johnson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/05/scientists-warned-the-president-about-global-warming-50-years-ago-today\">also received an early warning</a> about climate change, with scientists explaining the mechanism of the greenhouse effect in 1965.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding\">it was revealed that ExxonMobil</a>, the world\u2019s largest oil company, knew of climate change as early as 1981, only to spend millions of dollars over the following 27 years to promote climate denial. The exposure of this prior knowledge has been led by <a href=\"http://insideclimatenews.org/\">Inside Climate News</a>. </p> <p>Exxon had a dedicated in-house team that established the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, but the company still spent years refusing to acknowledge the issue and funding climate denial activities. Exxon now insists it accepts climate science and doesn\u2019t promote denial of the changes to the planet already under way.</p> <p> The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) said hundreds of documents show oil and gas executives met in 1946 to agree that they should fund research into air pollution issues. The subsequent findings were then covered up to protect company profits, according to the environmental law group.</p> <p> Carroll Muffett, president of CIEL, said the latest documents from 1968 \u201cadd to the growing body of evidence that the oil industry worked to actively undermine public confidence in climate science and in the need for climate action even as its own knowledge of climate risks was growing.</p> <p> \u201cThese documents are the tip of an evidentiary iceberg that demands further investigation,\u201d Muffett said. \u201cOil companies had an early opportunity to acknowledge climate science and climate risks, and to enable consumers to make informed choices. They chose a different path. The public deserves to know why.\u201d</p> <p>The prominent climate scientist Michael Mann, of Pennsylvania State University, said it was \u201cdisgraceful that industry groups like API knowingly hid the dangers of their project decades ago when they first learned of them, much as the tobacco industry hid the dangers of their product\u201d.</p> <p> API was contacted for comment on the documents.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Governments across the Middle East and north Africa can expect to lose $2tn in income over the next five years as the slump in oil and commodity prices sends unemployment soaring and denies them tax receipts. The drop in oil prices from their peak between 2004 and 2008, coupled with declines in metal and basic food prices, will force many governments to borrow to make up the difference, the International Monetary Fund said in its annual Fiscal Monitor. The Washington-based lender said borrowing was already increasing across the region and pushed debt to GDP ratios in emerging market and middle income economies to levels last seen in 2008. Analysts have previously warned that Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries have large savings and can absorb the loss for several years, but widening fiscal deficits are expected to create even more political instability in a region already wracked by terrorism and widespread corruption. The IMF said: \u201cThe fiscal positions of commodity exporters have been especially hard hit. In the Middle East and north Africa, the cumulative fiscal balances of oil exporters alone are expected to deteriorate by over $2tn in the next five years relative to 2004\u201308, when oil prices peaked. \u201cIn 2016, the outlook remains uncertain, particularly for oil exporters that based their budgets on optimistic oil price assumptions and may have to revise their plans in the course of the year,\u201d it said. Budget balances in emerging market and middle-income economies deteriorated sharply, forcing the IMF to downgrade its forecasts from an average deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2014 to 4.5% in 2015. The IMF said the 2015 number was the largest deficit since the 1990s and the largest yearly deterioration since the beginning of the global financial crisis. Sovereign debt ratings have recently been downgraded in a number of countries, including Azerbaijan, Brazil, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Venezuela. More are expected unless commodity prices pick up markedly during the next year. The IMF said developed economies in Europe also remain vulnerable to a budget crisis as a combination of low inflation, low interest rates and sluggish growth prevent them cutting deficits without harming their long term financial position. \u201cA lasting solution to the debt overhang problem is not possible without higher medium-term growth,\u201d it said. \u201cA sustained increase in growth of 1 percentage point could bring debt ratios in advanced economies to their pre-crisis levels within a decade. This underscores the need to accelerate structural reforms, including tax and expenditure policies that reinforce incentives to work and invest, and spur productivity growth,\u201d it added.",

      "bodyText": "An upturn in sales at Tesco was overshadowed by gloom surrounding the outlook for profits as the retail giant is forced to slash prices amid a fierce supermarket price war. Tesco shares were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 on Wednesday after its chief executive, Dave Lewis, warned investors that it faced a \u201cchallenging, deflationary and uncertain market\u201d. He said the new management team had stabilised the business and they were no longer in \u201c the crisis we were 16 months ago\u201d. However, he went on to warn that tough market conditions meant Tesco\u2019s profit recovery would not be a \u201cstraight line\u201d. Price cuts have reduced the cost of an average weekly shop in Tesco by over 3% in the last year, Lewis said, but the grocer would have to do more to stay competitive as it battles the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. \u201cThis will be reflected in the pace of improvement in profitability in the current year, particularly in the first half,\u201d he explained. Tesco eked a pre-tax profit of \u00a3162m in the year to 27 February, compared with last year when it crashed to the biggest loss ever recorded on the UK high street, slumping \u00a36.4bn into the red after taking massive writedowns on its property portfolio and stock. The underlying profit figure was in line with analyst expectations of \u00a3944m. Four years ago Tesco was making a \u00a34bn annual profit. Lewis was parachuted in as chief executive following the sacking of Philip Clarke. The business was subsequently engulfed in an accounting scandal after a whistleblower revealed supplier payments were mishandled \u2013 a matter that is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office \u2013 when Clarke was in charge. Lewis said the retailer had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d on the turnaround plan he set out in October 2014. He has slashed the number of products on Tesco\u2019s shelves by 18% and devoted the freed up space to bestselling lines. Tesco also reduced the number of multi-buy promotions by a third in the fourth quarter, and clocked up like-for-like sales growth in the UK of 0.9% \u2013 its first increase in three years. \u201cWe have regained competitiveness in the UK with significantly better service, a simpler range, record levels of availability and lower and more stable prices,\u201d said Lewis, who has slashed head office costs and deployed thousands more staff on to the shopfloor. He said sales volumes in its UK supermarkets \u2013 the number of items sold rather than their value \u2013 had increased for the first time in five years as \u201cmore customers are buying more things more often at Tesco\u201d. This was reflected in the recovery in the performance of its sprawling Tesco Extra stores, where like-for-like sales were down just 0.3% compared with a decline of more than 6% when Lewis took over. The improvement in the retailer\u2019s fortunes means staff will be paid a one-off \u201cturnaround bonus\u201d worth up to 5% of their salary in May. The payout is in shares but staff are able to cash them in immediately if they want. One of Tesco\u2019s biggest investments to date has been the launch of seven \u201cfarm brands\u201d. The new labels, with fictitious names such as Woodside, Willow and Boswell Farms, were created for a new budget range of produce, meat and poultry designed to compete with the discounters. Prior to the launch a basket of 51 comparable products cost \u00a3103.11 at Tesco versus \u00a389.06 at a discounter. The new brands mean that the price of the Tesco basket has now come down to \u00a386.34 \u2013 a 16% reduction. Despite criticism of the fictitious farm names, Lewis said the new brands had proved popular, adding that customers \u201care more savvy about marketing than they are given credit for\u201d. He added: \u201cDo they come from farms? Yes. Can one farm satisfy all the demand from Tesco? No. The product truth is absolutely right.\u201d Prior to the update, analysts had been expecting underlying profits of \u00a31.25bn for the current financial year. But Lewis refused to be pinned down to the forecast, stating he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to put the business in a place where it has to run to meet a number\u201d. Stifel analyst James Collins, who rates Tesco shares a sell, said it was not surprising that Lewis was cautious about its ability to grow profits. \u201cManagement has cautioned that investments in the customer offer will impact the pace of profit improvement this year, particularly in the first half,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is no great surprise but should rein in the market\u2019s over-optimism about how quickly trading improvements might translate into meaningful profit improvement.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Some of the US\u2019s biggest banks still lack a proper plan for bankruptcy, in the event of another major financial crisis, US regulators said on Wednesday. In the wake of the great recession banks were required to come up with \u201cliving wills\u201d to prove they had a credible plan for bankruptcy that would not require another bailout from the taxpayers. But after reviewing the plans of five institutions \u2013 JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Corp \u2013 the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) have determined that the banks have yet to meet that requirement. \u201cThe goal to end too big to fail and protect the American taxpayers by ending bailouts remains just that: only a goal,\u201d said Thomas Hoenig, FDIC vice-chairman. The banks are to submit revised proposals by 1 October. According to feedback from the regulators, one of the main concerns with JP Morgan\u2019s proposal was the bank\u2019s liquidity in a time of need. Regulators were concerned the bank would not be able to shift money around to fund some of its operation during a time of stress or bankruptcy. \u201cObviously we were disappointed,\u201d said Marianne Lake, JP Morgan\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cThe most important thing is that we work with our regulators to understand their feedback in more detail.\u201d Bank of America also needs better processes for estimating its liquidity needs, the regulators said. And while Wells Fargo was deemed to have \u201cfirm-wide, high-quality liquid assets\u201d, regulators raised concerns over \u201cquality control, senior management oversight, and recovery and resolutions planning staffing\u201d. In its statement, Wells Fargo said it was disappointed its plan was \u201cdetermined to have deficiencies\u201d but the feedback was \u201cconstructive and valuable to our resolution planning process\u201d. If these banks do not submit acceptable plans by October, regulators could impose sanctions such as higher capital requirements and restrictions on growth. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also received their feedback on Wednesday. While Goldman Sachs\u2019s plan passed muster with the Fed, it was deemed wanting by the FDIC. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, did not meet the legal standards according to the Fed, but the FDIC gave a more positive assessment. Citigroup was the only bank whose plan was accepted by both agencies. It too, however, received feedback containing shortcomings that it has to fix by July 2017. The regulators\u2019 rejections of a handful of banks\u2019 living wills is likely to fuel criticism that the banks are still \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and could force another huge taxpayer bailout should there be another major financial crisis. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has previously said that if elected president he would try to break up big banks. However, when pushed on exactly how he intended to do that by the New York Daily News editorial board, the Vermont senator struggled to provide a detailed answer. The process of drafting living wills was introduced in the Dodd-Frank rules brought in by Congress after the financial crisis in order to tackle the systemic risks posed by the collapse of the financial industry. The process of drawing up the wills is ongoing and that the banking industry is committed to working with the regulators, said John Dearie, CEO of Financial Services Forum \u2013 a trade group that represents 16 of the largest banks with the exception of Wells Fargo. \u201cNo financial company should be considered too big to fail. The principal regulators have said that there has been substantial progress in their ability to resolve the largest US financial institutions,\u201d Dearie said. \u201cThe Dodd-Frank Act clearly mandates that taxpayer funds can never again be accessed \u2013 nor should they. Thus, it is in the best interest of the industry that all large institutions have credible resolutions plans and, with that in mind, institutions will continue to work to address the technical shortcomings identified in this round of regulatory feedback.\u201d Proposals by Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS are still under review.",

      "bodyText": "The founder of fashion chain Reiss has banked a \u00a3100m-plus windfall after selling a majority stake in the upmarket brand, which is a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge. David Reiss, who took over a single gentleman\u2019s outfitters in London\u2019s Bishopsgate run by his father in 1971 and built it into an international empire, has struck a deal with American private equity firm Warburg Pincus that values the business at \u00a3230m. Reiss, who owned 90% of the business, will get the bumper payout and also retain a significant stake in the business. He is also staying on as chairman and chief executive. The management team, who share the remaining 10% stake in the business, will also remain in place. The retailer said teaming up with the US investors would enable Reiss to step up expansion in North America, Asia and Australia. Reiss has previously said he wanted to turn the brand into a \u201cluxury Topshop\u201d. The business, which only began selling womenswear in 2000, now operates 160 stores in 15 countries. It also sells online via its own website and recent partnerships with Asos and Zalando. The company made a profit before financial charges of of \u00a324.4m from sales of \u00a3146m last year. Sales were given a major boost by the Duchess of Cambridge, who started wearing Reiss clothes in 2010. She brought international attention to the brand when she wore a white \u00a3159 Reiss dress for her official engagement portrait and another Reiss dress when she met the Obamas. The chain credits the duchess for \u201csending the brand to stratospheric new heights\u201d. Reiss said: \u201cWe have built a great business providing our customers with timeless luxury at affordable prices and I am confident that working together we will be able to build a truly global fashion brand.\u201d The chain branched out to the US after Reiss was approached with a takeover bid by American fashion group Liz Claibourne in the early 2000s. Reiss said he thought: \u201cWhy don\u2019t I do it myself?\u201d But the firm has been looking for an investor to help fund overseas expansion for over a year as none of his three children wanted to run the business. Son Darren sits on Reiss\u2019s board as a non-executive director but runs his own property investment business after years working in banking. Daughter Debra, who worked as a brand director for Reiss in the US, died last year aged 34 after suffering from a long-term illness. Reiss is an upmarket departure for Warburg Pincus, which is best known in the UK for its investment in discount chain Poundland. \u201cAs long-term growth investors, we look forward to partnering with David and his team and supporting the global expansion of Reiss,\u201d said Paul Best, managing director at Warburg Pincus. \u201cThe business has built an enviable position in its core UK market, with a broad and loyal customer base, and we believe there is a significant opportunity to build on this success and accelerate development internationally.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Better than expected Chinese trade data which prompted hopes the world\u2019s second largest economy was beginning to stabilise set the tone for a positive day for investors. A rise in US crude inventories, which contributed to a 1% fall in oil prices, did not dampen the mood, while better than expected results from US bank JP Morgan gave further support to the market. Weak US retail sales also helped, dampening fears of an immediate rise in US interest rates. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 120.5 points or 1.93% to 6362.89, its highest level since 2 December last year Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.71% to 10,026.10 France\u2019s Cac closed up 3.32% at 4490.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 4.13% to 18,165.59 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.21% higher at 8820.7 In Greece, though, the Athens market dipped 0.83% to 548.83 on continuing concerns about an agreement between the country and its creditors on its bailout On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 150 points or 0.85%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It is not just oil which is giving the market a lift. Joshua Mahony at IG said: Confidence is coursing through the veins of financial markets today, as the worries seen at the turn of the year disappear into the rear view mirror. If yesterday was all about oil, today\u2019s big mover was the US dollar which finally found a buyer after over two weeks of selling. European and US stock markets are clearly in a jubilant mood, with buyers remaining in control since the opening bell. The relative disregard from US markets at the release of the joint worst retail sales figure in over a year, spells out the buoyant mood of markets today. The Bank of Canada maintained its headline interest rates steady today, in line with expectations. Certainly there will be significant relief at the BoC at the recent revival in crude prices, which will help ease the burden of monetary policy. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has reached its highest closing level since 2 December. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: There can be little doubting the fact that London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a solid day of gains during Wednesday\u2019s session, realising its first triple digit gain in a month and finding intra-day highs not seen since early December 2015. Commodity prices continue to march higher and that is very much dictating the pace for the markets \u2013 the Dow Jones non-ferrous metals index is up another 6% already and the miners are scattered across the top of the board, but once again Standard Chartered is worthy of note. The bank\u2019s exposure to commodity traders has been something of a millstone, but as underlying prices rally, the stock is back in vogue and today\u2019s 10% gain is certainly impressive. The recent strength of the oil price - today\u2019s fall notwithstanding - has been based mainly on hopes that the weekend\u2019s producer meeting will agree a freeze, along with signs of a slowdown in US output. But, says Capital Economics: There have not been any game-changers in the fundamentals of the oil market itself. Admittedly, US oil production has started to fall. But the declines are small. US oil output was down by about 1.7% year on year in February. What\u2019s more, both the key pillars which have underpinned the recent rally could quickly unwind. Indeed, there is no guarantee of a deal at the weekend. Saudi Arabia has said that it will not participate in a production freeze unless Iran agrees to join as well and Iran has steadfastly committed to increasing its output to pre-sanctions levels. As it happens, we think some sort of compromise agreement is still likely, even without Iran\u2019s full participation. But given that very few of the countries attending the meeting on Sunday have either the capacity or intention to increase output anyway, freezing production at the current very high level should at best put a floor under prices. Oil prices have slipped further after a much bigger than expected rise in weekly crude inventories, but still remain well above $40 a barrel. Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $43.96. Distillate stocks also rose by more than forecast: But gasoline inventories fell back: The enthusiasm for the Chinese export figures has outweighed a host of bad news for stock markets, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The reasons to abandon the day\u2019s super-surge began to stack up this afternoon, yet the markets remained resolute in their Chinese export-inspired jubilance as the day continued. First Opec cut its demand forecasts for 2016, slashing estimates by 50000 barrels a day with the potential for more revisions to come. Then there was yet another poll outlining the damage that would be dealt in the case of a Brexit, news that was swiftly followed by the announcement of falling retail sales in the US. Adding to the mounting bad news was a report from Reuters stating that US regulators believe JP Morgan (which rose by 3.5%% this Wednesday after revealing a better than expected first quarter loss), Bank of New York Mellon, Bank of America, State Street and Wells Fargo do not have sufficient \u2018living wills\u2019 in place to deal with another financial crisis. Along similar lines the IMF warned that the European banking sector (namely those institutions found in Greece, Italy and Portugal) would be unable to deal with a repeat of the 2008/09 recession, stating that \u2018a more complete solution to the [region\u2019s] banks\u2019 problems cannot be further postponed\u2019. Yet despite this string of scary dispatches from around the world the global indices were in remarkable good health this afternoon. The Dow Jones, boosted by the growth from JP Morgan, edged up 130 points, hitting 17850 and fresh 2016 highs in the process; the FTSE, meanwhile, climbed 120 points to 6360, enjoying the freedom given to it by its China-inspired breakout. Over in the Eurozone the Dax, perhaps intimidated by that looming 10000 mark, slightly underperformed its regional peers, the German index settling for a 2.3% rise compared to the more explosive 3% growth seen by the Cac. The US market has followed other global markets higher after the positive Chinese export data, better than expected results from JP Morgan and the oil price holding onto much of its recent gains. The weak US retail sales have also helped sentiment, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may be reluctant to raise interest rates again in the near future after December\u2019s increase. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 122 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 is 0,6% higher and Nasdaq has added 1%. European markets have seen their gains accelerate, with the FTSE 100 up 1.7% to its highest level since early December, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.7%. More on the weaker than expected US retail sales. Rob Carnell of ING said: Even when you take some upward revisions into account for February, this is yet another soft retail sales release, and makes an April rate hike look far-fetched. Consensus was hoping that despite the likelihood that the headline retail sales figure would be depressed by very weak auto sales in March, rising gasoline prices would provide some offset at the headline level, and a pick up in underlying sales would prop up the core figures. This did not happen. Indeed, the headline fell by 0.3% month on month, much worse than the 0.1% increase expected, and core figures were also weak, with the control group for sales which strips out most of the volatile components, rising only 0.1% month on month. Moreover, when you take into account that these figures are dollar amounts, and not adjusted for inflation, which most likely rose in March as a result of higher energy prices (data released tomorrow), then it looks as if real consumer spending will barely register 1.0% growth in the first quarter of 2016, and real GDP for the same period will be equally soft. All of which makes it seem highly unlikely that the April FOMC meeting will deliver a further rate hike on top of the December 15 hike. Indeed, some expectations that the April meeting might be used to flag a possible June hike also look stretched following this and other recent soft activity data. We expect some softening in the rhetoric of Federal Reserve speakers in advance of this month\u2019s meeting, so a \u201cno change\u201d will not be a surprise for markets. The IMF\u2019s warning on the state of the European banking system is directed at countries on the periphery of the eurozone, and Italy in particular, writes Phillip Inman: Total losses attributed to European banks in the last financial crash were around \u20ac1tn, so a repeat of the devastation caused in 2008 could be withstood by just calling on shareholders to sacrifice their equity. If the crash cost more than \u20ac1tn, banks can call on the \u20ac8tn of debts to bondholders, which could be cancelled in part or in their entirety, freeing up cash from interest payments to safeguard depositors. This is a substantial extra buffer. No wonder officials in Brussels, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and the UK\u2019s regulator, the Bank of England, feel confident a taxpayer bailout will never again be required. So it might seem odd that the International Monetary Fund has sounded a warning in its latest financial stability report about the parlous state of the European banking system... But the IMF is not talking so much about the UK as Italy and other countries in the eurozone periphery. Italy has propped up a forlorn bunch of regional banks that have done little to tackle loans that will never be repaid. Zombie businesses that spend all their spare cash on interest payments, denying them the funds for investment, litter the Italian manufacturing sector, which remains vast... It is estimated that bad loans in Italy account for more than a third of the \u20ac900bn total, which means that a \u20ac6bn rescue fund put forward by Rome is desperately inadequate. So the IMF is less interested in the aggregate figures for European bank funding and more concerned about the weakest link, which experience tells us can set off a chain reaction, bringing good banks down with the bad. For that reason the IMF should be applauded. More here: A day after cutting its global growth forecasts, the International Monetary Fund is talking about the risks of a new financial crisis. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund has highlighted risks of a new financial crisis, warning that global output could be cut by 4% over the next five years by a repeat of the market mayhem witnessed during the 2008-9 recession. The IMF used its half-yearly Global Financial Stability Report to call for urgent action on the problems of banks in the eurozone, a third of which it said faced \u201csignificant challenges\u201d to be sustainably profitable. \u201cIn the euro area, market pressures also highlighted long-standing legacy issues, indicating that a more complete solution to European banks\u2019 problems cannot be further postponed,\u201d the Fund said. It said there needed to be a comprehensive strategy to deal with \u20ac900bn of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the books of eurozone banks, adding that banks also needed to be closed in order to deal with excess capacity. \u201cThe hardest hit banking systems within the euro area in February have been those of Greece, Italy, and to a lesser extent, Portugal, along with some large German banks, reflecting some or all of the following factors: structural problems of excess bank capacity, high levels of NPLs, and poorly adapted business models.\u201d Noting that threats to global financial stability had increased since its last health check in October, the Fund said: \u201cThe main message of this report is that additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and inflation outlook and securing financial stability. In the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur.\u201d It added that there was a risk that investors would demand high interest rates and that tougher financial conditions would create a \u201cpernicious feedback loop\u201d of fragile confidence, lower growth and inflation, and rising debt. The full story is here: Five of the top eight US banks do not have credible plans for winding down their operations during a crisis without being bailed out with public money, according to a report from federal regulators. Reuters reports: The \u201cliving wills\u201d that the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation jointly agreed were not credible came from Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, J.P. Morgan Chase, State Street and Wells Fargo. The requirement for a living will was part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the US government spent billions of dollars on bailouts to keep big banks from failing and wrecking the US economy. \u201cThe FDIC and Federal Reserve are committed to carrying out the statutory mandate that systemically important financial institutions demonstrate a clear path to an orderly failure under bankruptcy at no cost to taxpayers,\u201d FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action is a significant step toward achieving that goal.\u201d None of the eight systemically important banks, which the US government considers \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d fared well in the evaluations. A bank has to fix deficiencies only if the two regulators jointly determine its plan does not have the potential to work. The FDIC alone determined that the plan submitted by Goldman Sachs was not credible, while the Federal Reserve Board on its own found Morgan Stanley\u2019s plan not credible. Citigroup\u2019s living will did pass, but the regulators noted it had \u201cshortcomings.\u201d The Fed and the FDIC said they were continuing to assess plans for four foreign banks - Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS. The weaker than expected US retail sales figures could give the Federal Reserve pause for thought on interest rates, said Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: Consumer spending remains a core component of the US economy, so all eyes will be on these latest sales figures from Main Street. Last year, economists heralded the resilience of US consumers as a rare bright spot against a backdrop of turbulent financial markets and weakening global demand, so they will be discouraged by this below expectations performance. These lingering doubts over retail\u2019s strength may force the Fed to give second thought to the rumoured interest rate hike, which some had speculated could come sooner rather than later. A drop in car purchases caused an unexpected drop in US retail sales in March, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales fell 0.3% after being unchanged in February, and compared to forecasts of a 0.1% rise. Core retail sales - excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services - edged up 0.1% in March, the same as an upwardly revised figure for February. A vote by Britain to leave the European Union would damage the UK economy, according to the majority of economists surveyed in a Reuters poll. Thirty one of the 35 economists polled said the impact of leaving would be negative, but there was a roughly equal split about whether remaining in the EU would be positive or neutral. A vote to leave was also likely to lead to a Bank of England rate cut, the majority of the economists believed. Opec has predicted that global demand for oil will be less than previously expected in its latest monthly report. The oil producers group cut its forecast for 2016 demand by 50,000 barrels a day as consumption slows, and said there could be further downward revisions. Meanwhile it pumped 32.25m barrels a day in March, up by 15,000 barrels from the previous month. The report indicated excess supply of 790,000 barrels a day in 2016 at current levels, up from 760,000 suggested last month. The figures come ahead of a key meeting of producers in Doha at the weekend, which will discuss a freeze in output at January\u2019s levels to try and tackle the supply glut. The oil price has been fairly unmoved by the report, with all eyes on the weekend meeting. Brent crude is down 1% at $44.19 a barrel, in line with its earlier performance. Time for a quick catch-up Stock markets in Asia and Europe have rallied today, after China beat expectations with an 11% surge in exports in March. Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets,. sums up the morning: \u201cMid-way through the European session, equity markets are holding firm with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 benefiting from a good set of Chinese trade data - that helping the miners and other EM-focused stocks. Does this mean better times ahead? We must be careful when answering such a question, but with Chinese copper imports having surged by 36% in March, the near-term outlook seems trade positive. So as we stand.... The FTSE 100 index is on track for its highest close of 2016. It\u2019s currently up 90 points in London, led by natural resource companies and financial stocks. Traders are optimistic that the worst of the commodity slump may be over, if Chinese firms are faring better than feared. JP Morgan has reported a 6.6% fall in profits, better than feared. Its shares are likely to rally when Wall Street opens. UK supermarket chain Tesco is under pressure. Its shares have slumped by 5.5%, despite posting its first sales rise in three years, after CEO Dave Lewis warned that the market is challenging and uncertain. Greek bonds have weakened, on fears that bailout talks with its creditors are floundering. Shares in Premier Foods, owner of Mr Kipling cakes and other kitchen staples, have slumped by 30% after a potential takeover bidder walked away. A Chinese hard landing is the number one fear in the City, according to a new survey from Moodys\u2019s. The rating agency found that a third of investors believe China\u2019s slowing economy is the biggest risk, followed to deflation in the euro area. Investors are also worried about a rise in support for European populist parties and Britain\u2019s EU referendum. Anke Rindermann, an associate Managing Director at Moody\u2019s, hopes that a Chinese economic crisis can be avoided: \u201cIt is clear that a slowing Chinese economy is a major concern among market participants. However, rather than a hard landing we expect a continuation of slower GDP growth at around 6% as Chinese authorities continue to use policy measures to avoid a sharp economic slowdown.\u201d Wall Street is expected to open strongly in two hours time: JP Morgan\u2019s shares are up almost 3% in pre-market trading, as Wall Street welcomes its financial results. Bank of America and Citigroup are up around 2% in the pre-market too. JP Morgan has reported a 6.6% drop in profits in the last quarter, down from $5.91bn to $5.52bn. As feared, the Wall Street bank has suffered a fall in revenues from trading and investment banking. But the results look a little better than expected. JP Morgan has posted average earnings of $1.35 per share, down from $1.45, but ahead of forecasts of $1.26 per share. It has also set aside over $400m to cover bad losses in the energy sector. That follows the recent slump in the oil price, which is causing some energy companies serious financial distress. It\u2019s nearly time for JP Morgan to kick off the US bank reporting season, by revealing how well (or badly) it performed in the last three months. Analysts predict that earnings and revenues both fell during the quarter, as investment banking has suffered from lower trading volumes and fewer major deals recently. And the banks always have the capacity to surprise us, as Jeremy Cook, economist at World First, points out: Beneath the optimism in the markets, worries over Greece\u2019s bailout are resurfacing. Investors are concerned by Athens\u2019 ongoing failure to reach a deal with creditors over issues such as pension reforms. So prices on Greek bonds have fallen sharply this morning. And this has driven up the yield, or interest rate, on Greek two-year debt to 12.5%, from 11% yesterday. That\u2019s a 10-week high, and implies a higher risk of Greece defaulting. Talks between Greece and its bailout creditors over the country\u2019s next economic reforms efforts are now suspended until next week. If a deal isn\u2019t reached eventually, Greece won\u2019t have the funds for debt repayments in July. And Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, has now arranged to meet with French president Francois Hollande - a key ally - next week. Italian bank shares have risen sharply this morning, up around 6% on average. The \u20ac5bn bank rescue deal agreed over the weekend is bolstering confidence in the sector. But caution is needed -- Italian banks still hold around \u20ac196bn of bad debts, so \u20ac5bn will only be a sticking plaster if the eurozone crisis flares up again. There\u2019s no stopping the FTSE 100 index right now. The blue-chip index is up 95 points at 6337, its highest level since last December. Mining stocks continue to surge, thanks to new optimism about China\u2019s economy following March\u2019s 11% jump in exports. Shares in Anglo American are up 7% and BHP Billiton has gained 6%. Banks are benefitting too. Standard Chartered, which has a big exposure to Asian markets, has jumped by 10% to the top of the FTSE leaderboard. Joshua Mahoney of IG says the City is hoping that the worst could be over for commodities. For the commodities rout to be over a resurgent China is required, and the impressive trade data released overnight provided exactly the assurance we were looking for. While it may be too soon to conclude that the worst is over for China, this revival in exports helps restore confidence as investors pile into commodity stocks once more. David Cheetham of City broker XTB.com reckons Tesco is on the right path, despite this morning\u2019s stock market drubbing: A 0.9% rise in like-for-like sales for Q4 2015 is arguably the highlight of this solid report, and marks the first quarter of comparable sales growth in over three years.... More work is clearly needed before investors can hope for a return to anywhere near the previous levels of stock price, but this morning\u2019s report shows that the current strategy is beginning to bear fruit and the continued attempts by Mr. Lewis to streamline the business and dispose of unwanted segments indicate that the firm won\u2019t be resting on it\u2019s laurels as they strive to return to former glories. Tesco is now the worst-performing share across Europe\u2019s main stock markets, after it warned that the supermarket sector remains tough. Here\u2019s our full story on Tesco\u2019s results: European stock markets are rallying hard, on the back of today\u2019s Chinese trade data. The Italian, German and French markets have all gained around 2%, a strong move, amid hopes that the global economy may be picking up. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct calls it \u201ca rather impressive start\u201d. Commodities remain very much in focus \u2013 we\u2019ve seen base metals soaring in the last few hours helped by upbeat Chinese import data and even if oil prices are coming off the boil a little, the bulls are still winning out at least for now. But investors may be getting carried away..... The 11% surge in Chinese exports in March sounds impressive, but manufacturers are actually still shipping fewer goods abroad than on average, as this tweet shows: News that Chinese exports rebounded in March has \u201cmore than revitalised the market\u2019s spirits\u201d, says Conner Campbell of SpreadEx: Whilst it is too early to claim that talk of a Chinese economic slowdown has been overstated (imports did shrink by 7.6% over March, and there is still the Q1 GDP and industrial production data to come on Friday), the announcement of an 11% rise in the country\u2019s exports has had a miraculous effect on the European indices this Wednesday morning. Tesco is missing out on today\u2019s rally, despite reporting its first sales increase in three years. Shares in the supermarket chain have slumped by 4%, after CEO Dave Lewis warned that hitting analyst profit forecasts for this year would be a \u201cbig achievement\u201d. That\u2019s not what the City likes to hear. Lewis\u2019s caution has taken the shine off today\u2019s results, which showed a 0.9% jump in sales and a small rise in operating profits. Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as China\u2019s trade figures boost confidence. In London, the FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level of 2016. The blue-chip index has gained 63 points, or 1%, to 6302 points. That\u2019s quite a recovery since the turmoil of January and February, when it fell to 5,500. Mining stocks are leading the way, on hopes that demand for commodities like iron ore, copper and zinc may be picking up. Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets, explains why shares are rallying: In March, Chinese exports went up by 11.5% (in US dollar terms), the most in a year and an impressive recovery from February\u2019s 25% slump. That\u2019s sure to indicate that China\u2019s still making stuff, so should be a good thing for companies that produce materials - like miners \u2013 today. Other European markets are also romping ahead. Mixing Ambrosia custard and Bisto gravy with Schwartz\u2019s dried spices would challenge the most daring fusion chef. So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that an attempt to merge the companies behind these brands has also failed. McCormick, the US food group, told the City this morning that it\u2019s walking away from attempts to acquire Britain\u2019s Premier Foods, which produces Mr Kipling cakes alongside Ambrosia, Bisto and Batchelors soups. Premier Foods had resisted McCormick\u2019s advances, angering shareholders such as Standard Life. And the City is reacting -- Premier Foods share just plunged by 30% at the start of trading! Here\u2019s the story: The rebound in China\u2019s exports shows that pessimism over the global economy is overdone, argues Marcel Thieliant and Mark Williams of Capital Economics: China\u2019s trade data for March point to healthy growth in import volumes and add to growing evidence that the extreme gloom of a few weeks ago about the state of the domestic economy was misplaced\u2026. However, they also point out that the data is muddied by the impact of the Chinese New Year, so we shouldn\u2019t get too carried away. Asian markets are rallying hard, following news that Chinese exports surged 11% in March. The Shanghai stock market jumped by 2%, as investors hailed the better-than-expected trade figures. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed 2.5% higher, while Australia gained 1.5%. Some investors are calculating that China\u2019s new growth figures, due on Friday, might beat expectations. Economists had forecast that annual growth to slow to 6.7% in January to March, from 6.9%. Perhaps that\u2019s too pessimistic?.... There\u2019s relief in the markets this morning after China posted surprisingly good trade figures. Chinese exports rose by 11.5% percent on-year in March, in dollar terms, the biggest jump since February 2015. That\u2019s a significant recovery from the 25% slump seen in February - when the Lunar New Year disrupted trade. Imports in March shrank by 7.6%, less than expected, after a 13.8% slump a month ago. And this means China\u2019s trade surplus decreased to $29.9 billion, the least in a year. This beats analyst forecasts, and suggests that China\u2019s economy may be avoiding the kind of \u2018hard landing\u2019 that would shake the global economy. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains why traders will be encouraged by China\u2019s trade data: The surge in exports adds to the improving outlook for China indicated by moderating producer price inflation and a rebound in business confidence data. The pickup in exports was likely supported by the devaluation of the yuan at the start of the year which made Chinese goods relatively cheaper than domestic options abroad. Standard Chartered Bank economist Shuang Ding is more cautious, though: \u201cEven with this rebound, first-quarter trade is still quite weak....We cannot be very definite about a turnaround.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for corporate results. UK supermarket chain Tesco is publishing its full-year results today. At first glance, it appears that CEO Dave Lewis\u2019s turnaround plan is bearing fruit, with profits up and sales returning to growth. And then JPMorgan Chase will kick off the US reporting season around noon BST. That\u2019ll show how Wall Street is coping with the current environment of record low interest rates and financial volatility. Over in Washington, The International Monetary Fund will release its Global Financial Stability Report at 2pm GMT. That\u2019ll highlight the key threats to the world economy. Yesterday, the Fund caused a stir with a warning about Britain\u2019s EU referendum, alongside a raft of growth cuts: And Greece could be in the spotlight again, after failing to reach a deal with its creditors over economic reforms this week. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Joshua Mahony at IG said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Confidence is coursing through the veins of financial markets today, as the worries seen at the turn of the year disappear into the rear view mirror. If yesterday was all about oil, today\u2019s big mover was the US dollar which finally found a buyer after over two weeks of selling. European and US stock markets are clearly in a jubilant mood, with buyers remaining in control since the opening bell. The relative disregard from US markets at the release of the joint worst retail sales figure in over a year, spells out the buoyant mood of markets today.</p> <p>The Bank of Canada maintained its headline interest rates steady today, in line with expectations. Certainly there will be significant relief at the BoC at the recent revival in crude prices, which will help ease the burden of monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has reached its highest closing level since 2 December. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There can be little doubting the fact that London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a solid day of gains during Wednesday\u2019s session, realising its first triple digit gain in a month and finding intra-day highs not seen since early December 2015. Commodity prices continue to march higher and that is very much dictating the pace for the markets \u2013 the Dow Jones non-ferrous metals index is up another 6% already and the miners are scattered across the top of the board, but once again Standard Chartered is worthy of note. The bank\u2019s exposure to commodity traders has been something of a millstone, but as underlying prices rally, the stock is back in vogue and today\u2019s 10% gain is certainly impressive.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570e6b3ce4b00aa863320735\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T15:55:37.584Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The recent strength of the oil price - today\u2019s fall notwithstanding - has been based mainly on hopes that the weekend\u2019s producer meeting will agree a freeze, along with signs of a slowdown in US output. But, says Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote> <p>There have not been any game-changers in the fundamentals of the oil market itself. Admittedly, US oil production has started to fall. But the declines are small. US oil output was down by about 1.7% year on year in February. What\u2019s more, both the key pillars which have underpinned the recent rally could quickly unwind.</p> <p>Indeed, there is no guarantee of a deal at the weekend. Saudi Arabia has said that it will not participate in a production freeze unless Iran agrees to join as well and Iran has steadfastly committed to increasing its output to pre-sanctions levels. As it happens, we think some sort of compromise agreement is still likely, even without Iran\u2019s full participation. But given that very few of the countries attending the meeting on Sunday have either the capacity or intention to increase output anyway, freezing production at the current very high level should at best put a floor under prices. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T15:55:45.669Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570e5b62e4b05f26af2e112f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T14:48:24.631Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices have slipped further after a much bigger than expected rise in weekly crude inventories, but still remain well above $40 a barrel.

This did not happen. Indeed, the headline fell by 0.3% month on month, much worse than the 0.1% increase expected, and core figures were also weak, with the control group for sales which strips out most of the volatile components, rising only 0.1% month on month.</p> <p>Moreover, when you take into account that these figures are dollar amounts, and not adjusted for inflation, which most likely rose in March as a result of higher energy prices (data released tomorrow), then it looks as if real consumer spending will barely register 1.0% growth in the first quarter of 2016, and real GDP for the same period will be equally soft.</p> <p>All of which makes it seem highly unlikely that the April FOMC meeting will deliver a further rate hike on top of the December 15 hike. Indeed, some expectations that the April meeting might be used to flag a possible June hike also look stretched following this and other recent soft activity data. We expect some softening in the rhetoric of Federal Reserve speakers in advance of this month\u2019s meeting, so a \u201cno change\u201d will not be a surprise for markets. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570e44bde4b0283cd85b7297\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/phillipinman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-13T13:24:06.029Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF\u2019s warning on the state of the European banking system is directed at countries on the periphery of the eurozone, and Italy in particular, writes Phillip Inman:</p> <blockquote> <p>Total losses attributed to <a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/europeanbanks\">European banks</a> in the last financial crash were around \u20ac1tn, so a repeat of the devastation caused in 2008 could be withstood by just calling on shareholders to sacrifice their equity.</p> <p>If the crash cost more than \u20ac1tn, banks can call on the \u20ac8tn of debts to bondholders, which could be cancelled in part or in their entirety, freeing up cash from interest payments to safeguard depositors. This is a substantial extra buffer. No wonder officials in Brussels, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and the UK\u2019s regulator, the Bank of England, feel confident a taxpayer bailout will never again be required.</p> <p>So it might seem odd that the International Monetary Fund has sounded a warning in its latest financial stability report about the parlous state of the European banking system...</p> <p>But the IMF is not talking so much about the UK as Italy and other countries in the eurozone periphery. Italy has propped up a forlorn bunch of regional banks that have done little to tackle loans that will never be repaid. Zombie businesses that spend all their spare cash on interest payments, denying them the funds for investment, litter the Italian manufacturing sector, which remains vast...</p> <p>It is estimated that bad loans in Italy account for more than a third of the \u20ac900bn total, which means that a \u20ac6bn rescue fund put forward by Rome is desperately inadequate.</p> <p>So the IMF is less interested in the aggregate figures for European bank funding and more concerned about the weakest link, which experience tells us can set off a chain reaction, bringing good banks down with the bad.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has highlighted risks of a new financial crisis, warning that global output could be cut by 4% over the next five years by a repeat of the market mayhem witnessed during the 2008-09 recession. The IMF used its half-yearly global financial stability report to call for urgent action on the problems of banks in the eurozone, a third of which it said faced \u201csignificant challenges\u201d to be sustainably profitable. \u201cIn the euro area, market pressures also highlighted long-standing legacy issues, indicating that a more complete solution to European banks\u2019 problems cannot be further postponed,\u201d the IMF said. It said there needed to be a comprehensive strategy to deal with \u20ac900bn (\u00a3715bn) of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the books of eurozone banks, adding that banks also needed to be closed in order to deal with excess capacity. \u201cThe hardest hit banking systems within the euro area in February have been those of Greece, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Portugal, along with some large German banks, reflecting some or all of the following factors: structural problems of excess bank capacity, high levels of NPLs and poorly adapted business models.\u201d Noting that threats to global financial stability had increased since its last health check in October, the IMF said: \u201cThe main message of this report is that additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and inflation outlook and securing financial stability. In the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur.\u201d It added that there was a risk investors would demand high interest rates and that tougher financial conditions would create a \u201cpernicious feedback loop\u201d of fragile confidence, lower growth and inflation, and rising debt. \u201cDisruptions to global asset markets could increase the risks of tipping into a more serious and prolonged slowdown marked by financial and economic stagnation.\u201d Financial soundness could be eroded to such an extent that both economic growth and financial stability are affected. In such circumstances, world output could be 3.9% lower by 2020 than the IMF is expecting. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, said that was equivalent to a year\u2019s growth. The stability report said banks in advanced economies had become safer in recent years and were now better placed to withstand financial strain. Even so, banks had come under market pressure at the start of the year, reflecting concerns about their business models in a period when economic growth was sluggish. It said approximately 15% of banks in advanced economies (measured by their assets) faced significant challenges in attaining sustainable profitability without reform, rising to one third in the euro area. The IMF said deteriorating profitability and unresolved legacy challenges raise the risk that external capital and funding could become more expensive, particularly for weak banks with very low share prices. \u201cItalian banks face a particular challenge in this regard, as market pricing has reflected investor confidence that some banks may face difficulties in growing out of their substantial non-performing loan overhang, despite constructive steps taken by Italian authorities to facilitate balance sheet repair.\u201d The IMF also expressed concerns about China, the world\u2019s second biggest economy, which is in the throes of a transformation of its economic model away from exports and towards consumer demand. It said China\u2019s rebalancing was inherently complex, and slower growth had eroded corporate sector health. \u201cA comprehensive plan to address the corporate debt overhang would assist a steady deleveraging process.\u201d It is closely monitoring the impact of falling oil prices on the health of firms dealing in commodities, since higher debt burdens intensify the pressure on banks. \u201cPolicymakers need to build on the current economic recovery and deliver a stronger path for growth and financial stability by tackling a triad of global challenges \u2013 legacy challenges in advanced economies, elevated vulnerabilities in emerging markets and greater systemic market liquidity risks. \u201cProgress along this path will enable the world\u2019s economies to make a decisive break toward a strong and healthy financial system and a sustained recovery. In such a scenario, world output could expand by 1.7% relative to the baseline by 2018.\u201d Asked about the potential consequences of a decision by the UK to leave the EU, Vi\u00f1als, said: \u201cThe uncertainty that will follow a leave vote is going to be protracted. It may last a couple of years. \u201cIt is going to create uncertainty not only for the economy but for the financial sector.\u201d Vi\u00f1als refused to be drawn on whether a vote to leave the EU would put London\u2019s role as the world\u2019s main international financial centre at risk. He said that would depend on what sort of arrangement Britain negotiated with the EU after a vote to leave.",

It said there needed to be a comprehensive strategy to deal with \u20ac900bn (\u00a3715bn) of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the books of eurozone banks, adding that banks also needed to be closed in order to deal with excess capacity.</p> <p>\u201cThe hardest hit banking systems within the euro area in February have been those of Greece, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Portugal, along with some large German banks, reflecting some or all of the following factors: structural problems of excess bank capacity, high levels of NPLs and poorly adapted business models.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/apr/13/imf-eurozone-banks-weakest-link-italy\">IMF homes on the eurozone's weakest link: Italy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Noting that threats to global financial stability had increased since <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/GFSR/2015/02/index.htm\">its last health check in October</a>, the IMF said: \u201cThe main message of this report is that additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and inflation outlook and securing financial stability. In the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur.\u201d</p> <p>It added that there was a risk investors would demand high interest rates and that tougher financial conditions would create a \u201cpernicious feedback loop\u201d of fragile confidence, lower growth and inflation, and rising debt. </p> <p>\u201cDisruptions to global asset markets could increase the risks of tipping into a more serious and prolonged slowdown marked by financial and economic stagnation.\u201d</p> <p>Financial soundness could be eroded to such an extent that both economic growth and financial stability are affected. In such circumstances, world output could be 3.9% lower by 2020 than the IMF is expecting. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, said that was equivalent to a year\u2019s growth.</p> <p>The stability report said banks in advanced economies had become safer in recent years and were now better placed to withstand financial strain. </p> <p>Even so, banks had come under market pressure at the start of the year, reflecting concerns about their business models in a period when economic growth was sluggish.</p> <p>It said approximately 15% of banks in advanced economies (measured by their assets) faced significant challenges in attaining sustainable profitability without reform, rising to one third in the euro area.</p> <p>The IMF said deteriorating profitability and unresolved legacy challenges raise the risk that external capital and funding could become more expensive, particularly for weak banks with very low share prices. \u201cItalian banks face a particular challenge in this regard, as market pricing has reflected investor confidence that some banks may face difficulties in growing out of their substantial non-performing loan overhang, despite constructive steps taken by Italian authorities to facilitate balance sheet repair.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbf40c0e20bd14b394403127ee534ff20d866460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbf40c0e20bd14b394403127ee534ff20d866460/0_44_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Vi\u200b\u200b\u00f1als\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, delivers remarks during the global financial stability report press briefing in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IMF also expressed concerns about China, the world\u2019s second biggest economy, which is in the throes of a transformation of its economic model away from exports and towards consumer demand. It said China\u2019s rebalancing was inherently complex, and slower growth had eroded corporate sector health. \u201cA comprehensive plan to address the corporate debt overhang would assist a steady deleveraging process.\u201d </p> <p>It is closely monitoring the impact of falling oil prices on the health of firms dealing in commodities, since higher debt burdens intensify the pressure on banks.</p> <p>\u201cPolicymakers need to build on the current economic recovery and deliver a stronger path for growth and financial stability by tackling a triad of global challenges \u2013 legacy challenges in advanced economies, elevated vulnerabilities in emerging markets and greater systemic market liquidity risks.<br></p> <p>\u201cProgress along this path will enable the world\u2019s economies to make a decisive break toward a strong and healthy financial system and a sustained recovery. In such a scenario, world output could expand by 1.7% relative to the baseline by 2018.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the potential consequences of a decision by the UK to leave the EU, Vi\u00f1als, said: \u201cThe uncertainty that will follow a leave vote is going to be protracted. It may last a couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to create uncertainty not only for the economy but for the financial sector.\u201d</p> <p>Vi\u00f1als refused to be drawn on whether a vote to leave the EU would put London\u2019s role as the world\u2019s main international financial centre at risk. He said that would depend on what sort of arrangement Britain negotiated with the EU after a vote to leave.</p>",

The City regulator said investors should have timely, high-quality information when a private company sells shares for the first time. It highlighted the current blackout period, usually two weeks, in which analysts from banks working on an IPO do not publish research before the sale prospectus is released. Those analysts get favoured access to the issuing company\u2019s management. This means investors receive important information late in the process and other analysts do not get vital contact with the company\u2019s bosses, stifling independent research, the FCA said. It proposed delaying the release of research by banks working on the IPO until after the prospectus is published and ensuring analysts not linked to the offer are invited to meet management. The FCA published its proposals on IPOs with the interim conclusions of a study of competition in investment banking, announced more than a year ago. Advising on share and debt issues made up about a quarter of revenue earned by so-called universal banks and generated gross fees for lenders of about $17bn (\u00a312bn) in 2014, the FCA said. Its report painted a picture of an uncompetitive market dominated by big operators and beset by potential conflicts of interest. In particular, providing cheap lending and broking services in return for big fees for selling securities makes it hard for smaller underwriters to compete for that work. The regulator\u2019s concerns included: Investment banks with big balance sheets to lend from gained an advantage over other advisers in getting work from companies issuing shares or debt The problem is made worse by banks including clauses in contracts tying companies to them for future deals and this should end, the FCA said League tables supposedly showing which banks work on the most deals may be unreliable or manipulated to distort clients\u2019 decisions about whether to hire a particular bank Some banks may reward favoured investors when allocating shares in an IPO, creating conflicts of interest Christopher Woolard, the FCA\u2019s director of strategy and competition, said investment banking should serve the economy by helping companies raise money efficiently for investment and expansion.

In addition, we want to start a discussion on changing the sequence of the IPO process to make the market work better by giving investors the right information at the right time.\u201d Peter Hahn, professor of banking at IFS University College, said stopping banks locking companies in to services and removing the blackout period were good ideas but that the proposals would only have a limited effect on the market. \u201cThe issue of tying is probably the most important part of it because that fundamentally seems to create a conflict of interest and the blackout period certainly should be addressed because we\u2019re in a world of instant information.

      "bodyText": "The Post Office is facing criticism after agreeing to hand over up to 61 more branches to WH Smith in a 10-year deal. The Communications Workers Union, which represents postal workers, said the move was \u201cblatant back-door privatisation\u201d of the main crown post offices that were traditionally run directly by the Post Office. Unite, which represents supervisors and managers at the Post Office, said the deal was \u201cthe beginning of the death rattle for a national, high-quality post office network\u201d. The deal with WH Smith will include some of the 39 crown post offices the organisation told staff it would be handing over to private hands in January \u2013 but the Post Office would not confirm how many. WH Smith already operates 107 Post Office branches in its own stores, about half of which are former crown outlets, after a controversial series of deals. \u201cA cherished national company such as the Post Office handing over large crown offices in prime locations is an admission that the strategic direction of the Post Office is fundamentally flawed. It is completely incongruous that WH Smith can run a major Post Office better than the Post Office itself,\u201d said Andy Furey, assistant secretary of the CWU. \u201cOur members do not wish to work for WH Smith, which has a track record of zero-hours contracts and a minimum wage approach to resourcing,\u201d Furey added. Unions are concerned about potential job losses as well as cuts to pay and benefits for staff. But Steve Clarke, chief executive of WH Smith, said the changes did not mean job losses as the \u201cservice levels in our post offices are as good as you find elsewhere\u201d. He said WH Smith\u2019s involvement meant seven-day opening for many post offices and a secure position at the centre of high streets. He added that WH Smith did not use zero-hours contracts at all \u2013 apart from for 17 students who had requested them so that they could work at stores near their home and university. \u201cWe pay competitive wages in the locations where we are running post offices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never had a problem with recruitment or retention of staff.\u201d WH Smith announced the deal with the Post Office as it revealed an 11% rise in pretax profit for the six months to February to \u00a380m as sales at stores open a year or more rose 2%. The company said sales at its established high street stores had not fallen for the first time since 2002 as shoppers splashed out on adult activity books, including dot-to-dots and colouring-by-numbers, as well as brightly coloured stationery and pens. Trading profit at branches in airports, train stations and other travel sites rose 9% to \u00a335m as the company benefited from a rising number of travellers. Sales at established travel stores rose 5% and the company plans to open 20 more such outlets this year. It is also opening its own stores in Spain and Germany. WH Smith is also seeking to expand on the high street by persuading independent retailers to sign franchise agreements. It already has deals with about 100 businesses, many of which are also home to post offices. Clarke said post offices were good for business as they brought extra shoppers into stores. The Post Office\u2019s chief executive, Paula Vennells, said: \u201cWe know that people place huge importance on the presence of a Post Office branch on their high street. Our collaboration with WH Smith will help to secure this, as well as bring new investment into the network.\u201d She said that just over half of the post offices that would move into WH Smith stores would be run directly by the Post Office under concession agreements. Currently, all post offices within WH Smith stores are run by the retailer under franchise agreements. But the CWU has raised fears that more than 400 jobs could be at risk from the closure or privatisation of crown offices. Hundreds of long-term staff were made redundant when WH Smith took on an initial batch of post offices in 2006. In 2013, the Post Office proposed handing 70 crown offices over to franchises and 50 have already been put into private hands, including dozens now run by WH Smith. The 314 crown offices operate differently to the vast majority of the Post Office\u2019s 11,500 branches, which are already run on a franchise or agency basis.",

      "bodyText": "When financial regulators say the European banking system is safe from another major crash they are talking about the funds banks can use to offset their losses. The 31 biggest banks hold an aggregate \u20ac1tn (\u00a3700bn) of shareholder funds, and account for about 75% of the European banking system by assets. Across all banks, it\u2019s fair to say the total equity reaches \u20ac1.35tn. Total losses attributed to European banks in the last financial crash were around \u20ac1tn, so a repeat of the devastation caused in 2008 could be withstood by just calling on shareholders to sacrifice their equity. If the crash cost more than \u20ac1tn, banks can call on the \u20ac8tn of debts to bondholders, which could be cancelled in part or in their entirety, freeing up cash from interest payments to safeguard depositors. This is a substantial extra buffer. No wonder officials in Brussels, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and the UK\u2019s regulator, the Bank of England, feel confident a taxpayer bailout will never again be required. So it might seem odd that the International Monetary Fund has sounded a warning in its latest financial stability report about the parlous state of the European banking system. It said more should be done to tackle the \u20ac900bn of non-performing loans on the books of eurozone banks. It also said there were too many banks chasing too little business and some should be wound up. In Britain this warning might verge on the bizarre. The government wants more banks and has already pushed Lloyds, HSBC and RBS to take a tough line on bad loans. Looking back to 2009, we can see that the Labour government went further than almost all its European counterparts in separating banks from their bad loans to clean up the system. But the IMF is not talking so much about the UK as Italy and other countries in the eurozone periphery. Italy has propped up a forlorn bunch of regional banks that have done little to tackle loans that will never be repaid. Zombie businesses that spend all their spare cash on interest payments, denying them the funds for investment, litter the Italian manufacturing sector, which remains vast. A clearout of bad loans would precipitate mass insolvencies among business customers that depend on cheap funding. Panic would ensue. Italian banks might have the funds to manage the transition if the ECB could boost interest rates and help their profitability. As it is, the ECB has introduced negative deposit rates, which Italian banks must pay to keep funds with the ECB. This increases their costs and should be passed to customers for holding their money. Milan, Turin and Siena\u2019s finest institutions have so far refused, squeezing their profit margins and putting their solvency in doubt It is estimated that bad loans in Italy account for more than a third of the \u20ac900bn total, which means that a \u20ac6bn rescue fund put forward by Rome is desperately inadequate. So the IMF is less interested in the aggregate figures for European bank funding and more concerned about the weakest link, which experience tells us can set off a chain reaction, bringing good banks down with the bad. For that reason the IMF should be applauded. The difficulty is the trap set by eurozone politicians that have come to rely on cheap ECB funds to lubricate their economies and who ignore the damage this does to their banks. Without a functioning banking system across the whole of Europe, business investment will remain flat and growth weak. And the danger of another crash will continue to lurk in the background.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cGood morning! I make 80 cents for every dollar that a man makes,\u201d a woman told passersby as they exited New York City\u2019s Bryant Park subway station on Tuesday morning. The woman, who makes a living passing out newspapers to commuters, was not the only one sharing such statistics during the annual equal pay day. A few blocks away, Hillary Clinton was about to take the stage at the New York Times Center to address exactly the same issue. \u201cIt\u2019s equal pay day,\u201d Clinton told the audience of about 250 women before returning to what, for her, appear to be more pressing matters. \u201cIt is also the one-year anniversary of my journey \u2026 my campaign.\u201d Clinton, the former US secretary of state and current Democratic presidential candidate, is currently the only woman running for the highest office. Yet, speaking about the issue that many women face in their workplace, Clinton has yet to share any personal anecdotes about negotiating for higher pay or about the time that she might have found herself earning less than her male counterparts. Despite assuring the audience that she has \u201clived through all of this\u201d, Clinton shared little of her personal experience. The closest she came on Tuesday was when she relayed a story about a young girl asking her if she was going to be paid as much as a \u201cboy president\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the pay gaps are in many settings, predominantly in the private sector,\u201d Clinton admitted. \u201cIn the public sector there is more transparency. You are being paid by taxpayers\u2019 dollars. Like I told that little girl, I think I\u2019d be paid the same, because that\u2019s on the record.\u201d While Clinton has spent most of her life in the public sector, she did at one point work as a lawyer in Arkansas. In fact, Clinton was the first female lawyer to be hired by Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where she worked at the time when her husband and former US president Bill Clinton became the state\u2019s attorney general. Yet instead of sharing her personal experience from the law firm \u2013 where, according to a 1994 New York Times article, she was among the lower-paid partners due to time spent outside the office \u2013 Clinton shared anecdotes she has picked up while campaigning. One such anecdote was about a 17-year-old \u201cyoung man\u201d who got hired to work as a cashier at the same store where his mom had worked for years. Excited about his first paycheck, mother and son opened it together only to realize that her son was earning more than her. \u201cLast time I checked there is no discount for being a woman,\u201d Clinton told the audience. \u201cGroceries don\u2019t cost us less. Rent doesn\u2019t cost us less.\u201d Yet, as Clinton pointed out, a gender wage gap still persists. According to the US census, in 2014 women were still earning just 79% of men\u2019s wages. That year, median earnings for men were $50,400 a year while women earned on average about $39,600. What\u2019s more, for every age group, starting at 18 years old, women are more likely to live in poverty than men. For example, about 18.2% of women aged 25 to 34 years old live in poverty while 11.3% of men do. The gender wage gap becomes even wider when it is broken down by race. African American women earn just 64 cents for every dollar that white men do, while Hispanic women earn 54 cents. In addition to bias \u2013 both conscious and unconscious \u2013 \u201cthere are other reasons why women end up earning less than men over the course of their lifetime,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI am very proud that New York and California have raised the minimum wage, because two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women. Two-thirds of workers in tipped jobs are women, and those jobs are hard. They are insecure and they don\u2019t pay nearly enough. I hope the rest of the country will catch up with New York and California. Women all over America deserve a raise.\u201d Yet Clinton has stopped short of endorsing the $15 minimum wage, which has been championed by her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders, instead supporting a more moderate proposal of $12 an hour as the new federal minimum wage. As she continues to campaign for president, Clinton is likely to speak on this issue again \u2013 even if it\u2019s without personal anecdotes. \u201cOccasionally, when I give a speech like this, which I do practically every day, people will say: \u2018Oh there she goes, she is playing the gender card\u2019,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWhat I say to that is: if talking about equal pay and paid leave and more opportunities for women in the world is playing the gender card, deal me in.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A doubling of spending on refugees led to an increase in aid spending by the world\u2019s richest countries in 2015, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has announced. The OECD\u2019s annual update on development assistance showed that aid budgets totalled $131.6bn (\u00a392bn) last year \u2013 a 6.9% increase on 2014. But the rise was exaggerated by the $12bn spent on helping to cope with a massive increase in refugees, the Paris-based body said. Once this was stripped out, aid spending was up by 1.7%. Money spent hosting or processing refugees in donor countries accounted for 9.1% of aid budgets in 2015, up from 4.8% in 2014. The OECD said the rise in refugee costs did not significantly eat into development programmes, with around half of donor countries using money from outside their aid budgets to cover refugee costs. \u201cCountries have had to find large sums to cover the costs of an historic refugee crisis in Europe, and most have so far avoided diverting money from development programmes. These efforts must continue. We also welcome that more aid is being provided to the poorest countries,\u201d said OECD secretary-general Angel Gurr\u00eda. \u201cGovernments must ensure that development aid keeps rising. They also need to develop long-term options for meeting future refugee costs and the integration of refugees in our societies, while ensuring at the same time that ODA [official development assistance] reaches those countries and people that need it the most.\u201d The OECD said a record 1.5 million refugees claimed asylum in OECD countries in 2015, more than a million of them arriving in Europe. The rules of the OECD\u2019s development assistance committee (DAC) permit member countries to count certain refugee-related expenses as ODA for the first year after their arrival. Three countries \u2013 Australia, Korea and Luxembourg \u2013 do not count refugee costs as ODA. Others \u2013 Austria, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden \u2013 saw refugee costs account for more than 20% of their ODA in 2015. Despite the increased spending on refugees, the 2015 data showed that bilateral aid to the poorest countries rose by 4% in real terms, in line with commitments by donors to reverse recent declines. The OECD said a survey of donor spending plans through 2019 suggested flows to the poorest countries will keep rising. The OECD said aid budgets, adjusted for inflation, had increased by 83% since 2000 when the United Nations set its 2015 millennium development goals. The MDGs have subsequently been replaced by new sustainable development goals. \u201cWe need to remember that the best way to achieve the sustainable development goals and avoid future refugee crises is to continue the current momentum of aid flows, particularly to the neediest and most fragile countries,\u201d said Erik Solheim, DAC chair. \u201cI am glad that we have reversed the recent declines in aid to the poorest countries and that most countries aren\u2019t spending large amounts of their ODA on hosting refugees.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The continuing craze for adult activity books, including extreme dot-to-dot and \u201cquerkles\u201d, and strong high street sales helped WH Smith increase profits in the first half of its financial year. Pre-tax profit for the six months to February increased 11% to \u00a380m as sales at stores open a year or more rose 2%. The stationer and bookseller increased its interim dividend by 11% to 13.4p. Trading profit at branches in airports, train stations and other travel sites rose 9% to \u00a335m as the company tapped into growing passenger numbers. Sales at established travel stores rose 5%. Trading profit at high street stores, for many years the weaker part of the business, rose 6% to \u00a353m with sales at established stores flat. Over Christmas, equivalent sales rose 2%, the best performance since 2002. The company\u2019s high street branches have benefited from the craze for what it calls \u201ccolour therapy\u201d books for adults. WH Smith highlighted strong sales of the books in October and the boom continued over Christmas with a new wave of products taking off early this year. Stephen Clarke, WH Smith\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe colouring book craze is still going on and it\u2019s got a new lease of life. In the last couple of months two other activity books have taken off \u2013 extreme dot-to-dot and a thing called querkle, which is extreme colour by numbers. It has had a big impact on our book sales in the half and we are still seeing it performing really strongly.\u201d He said WH Smith had performed well despite tough times for the wider retail market, questions over the economy and technology replacing paper reading matter because it had invested in stores and products. Books make up almost a quarter of high street sales and the activity book phenomenon has had a big effect, Clarke said. The strong sales figures follow criticism of WH Smith for failing to pass on VAT savings at airports to customers. The company has pledged to change prices at hospital branches after charging more in those stores. Clarke said in January that, following strong Christmas sales, annual profit would be slightly better than expected. On Wednesday he made no further upgrade to expectations for pre-tax profit of about \u00a3130m for the year. The 224-year-old company\u2019s shares, which had gained almost a third in the past year, fell 4% to \u00a317.35. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong Securities, said there was much to praise in WH Smith\u2019s performance but that the shares appeared to be valued too highly compared with other retailers. \u201cOur only reservation is in terms of the valuation which has moved far ahead of the peer group \u2026 We find it difficult to justify the valuation despite the strength of the company.",

      "bodyText": "Mining shares are leading the way forward after better than expected Chinese trade data renewed hopes of a positive outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy, helping the FTSE 100 to a new high for the year. But retailers are also in focus, with Tesco leading supermarkets lower despite signs of a turnaround, and Halfords higher following a strong fourth quarter. The car parts and bicycle specialist has reported a 2.6 per cent like for like rise in fourth quarter revenue and confirmed full year profit guidance of between \u00a378m and \u00a382m. In cycling bike sale rose for the second successive quarter, but parts and accessories fell. Motoring sales were boosted by in-car dashboard cameras, car cleaning products and travel equipment, while its Autocentres business benefited from investment to refurbish the sites. Halford\u2019s shares are up 4% at 401.8p, and Stifel analyst Scott Ransley said: Sales exceeded our low-end expectations although profit guidance is unchanged. Nevertheless against some challenging comparisons we would view this as a positive retail performance, following the resilient third quarter in Retail. Given the flat 2017 growth outlook, we believe the shares could continue to trade in the 320-420p range. Liberum analysts were less positive: We see a strong fourth quarter as encouraging, although one quarter does not make a trend and we need to see further momentum before turning more positive. We maintain our sell recommendation, but acknowledge that there are some clear positives, including a healthy balance sheet, a 4%+ dividend yield and the potential for near-term special cash returns. But WH Smith is down 45p at \u00a317.60 following its half year results, and Tesco has dropped 7.45p to 188.85p on worries about a cautious outlook even though it reported its first quarterly sales growth for three years. Joe Rundle at ETX Capital said: The headline figures are promising, but Tesco is like an oil tanker that takes a long time to turn around and although not through the turn at least it\u2019s started to head in the right direction... Nevertheless, there appear to be no shortage of problems ahead for Tesco, with continued competition on both sides of the high street; from the likes of Aldi and Lidl at the low-end to Waitrose at the high-end. Tesco also has to contend with the emerging threat from Amazon in the online sector. Despite reducing net debt by 40%, at \u00a35.1 billion Tesco still has too much debt and its bonds are rated as junk. Morrisons has also fallen, down 1.8p at 199.4p. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 78.02 points at 6320.41, with Anglo American up 42.3p at 681p and Rio Tinto rising 113.5p to \u00a322. This is the highest level for the leading index since early December. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: That\u2019s been a rather impressive start to the day\u2019s session for equities with the FTSE-100 charging higher at the opening bell and punching rather unexpectedly through the 6,300 level. Commodities remain very much in focus \u2013 we\u2019ve seen base metals soaring in the last few hours helped by upbeat Chinese import data and even if oil prices are coming off the boil a little, the bulls are still winning out at least for now. Critically there\u2019s an element of uncertainty hanging over whether producer nations will be able to agree a meaningful production freeze this weekend and we\u2019ve seen a little profit taking on crude as a result, but so long as we can hold onto the majority of these recent gains \u2013 that $40/barrel level holds psychological significance - then the broader based equity rally may be sustainable. Despite a dip in the oil price - Brent crude is down 1% at $44.18 a barrel - it shows no signs of a serious plunge ahead of this weekend\u2019s meeting of oil producers. There are hopes that there will be some kind of agreement to freeze output in an attempt to tackle the supply glut. Meanwhile with investors happy to move into riskier assets, defensive stocks such as utilities are out of favour. SSE is down 7p at \u00a315.14, United Utilities has lost 4p to 956p and Severn Trent has slipped 10p to \u00a322.33.",

      "body": "<p>Mining shares are leading the way forward after better than expected Chinese trade data renewed hopes of a positive outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy, helping the FTSE 100 to a new high for the year.</p> <p>But retailers are also in focus, with Tesco leading supermarkets lower despite signs of a turnaround, and <strong>Halfords</strong> higher following a strong fourth quarter.</p> <p>The car parts and bicycle specialist has reported a 2.6 per cent like for like rise in fourth quarter revenue and confirmed full year profit guidance of between \u00a378m and \u00a382m. In cycling bike sale rose for the second successive quarter, but parts and accessories fell. Motoring sales were boosted by in-car dashboard cameras, car cleaning products and travel equipment, while its Autocentres business benefited from investment to refurbish the sites.</p> <p>Halford\u2019s shares are up 4% at 401.8p, and Stifel analyst Scott Ransley said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sales exceeded our low-end expectations although profit guidance is unchanged. Nevertheless against some challenging comparisons we would view this as a positive retail performance, following the resilient third quarter in Retail. Given the flat 2017 growth outlook, we believe the shares could continue to trade in the 320-420p range. </p> </blockquote> <p>Liberum analysts were less positive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We see a strong fourth quarter as encouraging, although one quarter does not make a trend and we need to see further momentum before turning more positive. We maintain our sell recommendation, but acknowledge that there are some clear positives, including a healthy balance sheet, a 4%+ dividend yield and the potential for near-term special cash returns. </p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>WH Smith</strong> is down 45p at \u00a317.60 following <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/wh-smiths-high-street-sales-colouring-books-dot-to-dot\">its half year results</a></strong>, and <strong>Tesco</strong> has dropped 7.45p to 188.85p on worries about <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/tesco-no-longer-in-crisis-chief-executive-profit-sales-share-price\">a cautious outlook even though it reported its first quarterly sales growth for three years.</a></strong> Joe Rundle at ETX Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The headline figures are promising, but Tesco is like an oil tanker that takes a long time to turn around and although not through the turn at least it\u2019s started to head in the right direction...</p> <p>Nevertheless, there appear to be no shortage of problems ahead for Tesco, with continued competition on both sides of the high street; from the likes of Aldi and Lidl at the low-end to Waitrose at the high-end. Tesco also has to contend with the emerging threat from Amazon in the online sector. Despite reducing net debt by 40%, at \u00a35.1 billion Tesco still has too much debt and its bonds are rated as junk.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong> has also fallen, down 1.8p at 199.4p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is up 78.02 points at 6320.41, with <strong>Anglo American</strong> up 42.3p at 681p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rising 113.5p to \u00a322. This is the highest level for the leading index since early December. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That\u2019s been a rather impressive start to the day\u2019s session for equities with the FTSE-100 charging higher at the opening bell and punching rather unexpectedly through the 6,300 level. Commodities remain very much in focus \u2013 we\u2019ve seen base metals soaring in the last few hours helped by upbeat Chinese import data and even if oil prices are coming off the boil a little, the bulls are still winning out at least for now. Critically there\u2019s an element of uncertainty hanging over whether producer nations will be able to agree a meaningful production freeze this weekend and we\u2019ve seen a little profit taking on crude as a result, but so long as we can hold onto the majority of these recent gains \u2013 that $40/barrel level holds psychological significance - then the broader based equity rally may be sustainable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite a dip in the oil price - Brent crude is down 1% at $44.18 a barrel - it shows no signs of a serious plunge ahead of this weekend\u2019s meeting of oil producers. There are hopes that there will be some kind of agreement to freeze output in an attempt to tackle the supply glut.</p> <p>Meanwhile with investors happy to move into riskier assets, defensive stocks such as utilities are out of favour. <strong>SSE</strong> is down 7p at \u00a315.14, <strong>United Utilities</strong> has lost 4p to 956p and <strong>Severn Trent</strong> has slipped 10p to \u00a322.33.</p>",

Managers at Britain\u2019s biggest pharmacy chain were found to be directing their chemists to provide medicine-use reviews (MUR) to customers who didn\u2019t need them, in order to claim public money from the NHS. The NHS pays \u00a328 for each MUR, which is carried out by a pharmacist and intended to give patients professional advice on health, diet and how best to manage their medicines. However, an investigation by the Guardian has found evidence that Boots managers are directing staff to carry out MURs on each other and on patients who don\u2019t need them or can\u2019t use them. One pharmacist in the Midlands said he was directed by his managers to carry out an MUR on a man with dementia, and on himself.

      "bodyText": "Nurofen\u2019s manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser should be fined $6m for misleading consumers over a range of \u201ctargeted\u201d pain products that cost twice as much as its standard painkillers despite all products in the Specific Pain Range having the same active ingredient and effect, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has found. In December the federal court found the British company Reckitt Benckiser, the manufacturer of the painkiller, had engaged in \u201cmisleading conduct\u201d by representing that its Nurofen Specific Pain products targeted a type or area of pain despite being identical, and ordered they be removed from supermarket shelves within three months. Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache all contain 342mg of ibuprofen lysine, and cost up to twice as much as its regular products. On Tuesday, lawyers for the ACCC told a federal court hearing in New South Wales that the company had profited substantially and should be fined accordingly. \u201cThere needs to be some serious taking away of profit,\u201d a barrister, Katrina Banks-Smith SC, reportedly told the court. \u201cThey purchased product they thought was special and it wasn\u2019t. They were misled.\u201d The ABC has reported Reckitt Benckiser argued that a \u201crational\u201d consumer would not think that a pain-specific product was more effective than a regular one, and suggested that customers were nevertheless prepared to pay more for the product because the \u201cease of selection\u201d meant they \u201cmight well pick up the \u2018migraine\u2019 product \u2026 simply because no further inquiry is required\u201d. Federal court justice James Edelman said that argument attributed \u201ca very low level of intelligence to purchasers\u201d. Edelman is expected to deliver his ruling on the penalty later this month. The specific-pain products are still available, but have been repackaged. \u201cThe Australian Nurofen Specific Pain Range was removed from retail shelves in Australia within three months, and replaced with interim packaging as agreed with the ACCC, which clearly disclosed to consumers that the products are equally effective for other forms of pain,\u201d a spokeswoman for Nurofen said. The description of Nurofen\u2019s \u201cgeneral pain\u201d products on its website now carries the disclaimer: \u201cAny of the four products shown on this page have the same ingredient and can be taken to provide effective temporary relief of pain and/or inflammation associated with either migraine, tension headache, back pain or period pain.\u201d Reckitt Benckiser said in December that it accepted the federal court\u2019s ruling but denied attempting to deceive customers. \u201cThe Nurofen specific-pain range was launched with an intention to help consumers navigate their pain relief options, particularly within the grocery environment where there is no healthcare professional to assist decision-making,\u201d a spokeswoman for Nurofen, Montse Pena, said. \u201cNurofen did not set out to mislead consumers. Nurofen has cooperated with the ACCC in relation to these proceedings and will fully comply with the court order made today.\u201d The ACCC challenge to the products, which began in March last year, followed years of criticism by consumer groups. In 2010 the consumer group Choice gave Nurofen\u2019s pain-specific range a Shonky award, saying \u201cthe shonkiest aspect of this type of marketing is that the fast-acting painkillers labelled for specific pain types are more expensive \u2013 costing almost twice as much in some stores we surveyed \u2013 than their \u2018all-pain\u2019 fast-acting equivalent, Zavance caplets, which contains a comparable fast-acting form of ibuprofen.\u201d Rod Sims, the chairman of the ACCC, said in a statement that the watchdog had launched legal proceedings \u201cto ensure that consumers are given accurate information when making their purchasing decisions\u201d. \u2022 On 14 April 2016 this article was amended. A previous version said the specific-pain products had been removed from retail shelves. A further amendment on 14 April clarified that all the products in the Nurofen Specific Pain range had the same active ingredient, rather than all Nurofen products.",
