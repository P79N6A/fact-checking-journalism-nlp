    "webTitle": "Oil workers do not speak out on safety for fear of the sack, union says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Safety on North Sea oil platforms is being compromised because the workforce is scared to speak out, a three-day conference to mark the 25th anniversary of Britain's worst offshore accident will be told on Tuesday. In addition, the dismantling of a specialist offshore safety division set up by the government after the Piper Alpha accident will make things worse and should be reversed, Jake Molloy, Aberdeen-based regional organiser of the RMT union, will warn. Oil &amp; Gas UK, the lobby group for the major oil companies, has issued its latest annual health and safety report before the Piper 25 conference in Scotland, outlining a 48% reduction in the number of reportable oil and gas releases over the last three years, plus an all-time low in 2012 in the incidence of \"over-three-day injuries\". But Molloy said these statistics were irrelevant if those employed offshore were still too frightened to report safety breaches because they believed they could lose their job. \"Overall safety in the North Sea has improved since Piper Alpha but I have got two safety representatives in my office now saying they cannot do what they are meant to,\" he said. \"You can have all the statistics and the technology in place but it does not make a blind bit of difference if people are under pressure, being bullied, or just disengaged.\" Molloy said oil companies subcontracted almost all North Sea work to third-party contractors, meaning those employers are more scared of losing their multimillion-pound deals through lost work time than interested in listening to difficult issues raised by their employees. Some managers rule in a climate of fear where employees dread an \"NRB\" (not required back) on the grounds of a one-off complaint about their behaviour, he claimed. He said even safety representatives feared their employers and did not have the authority to halt operations as they do in Norway, where the overall industry safety record is much better. The decision by the government to dismantle the offshore safety division inside the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) and subsume its functions inside a newly created energy division covering onshore and other installations is also troubling the RMT. \"HSE says this restructuring will make no difference but I remain to be convinced, as does the rest of the trade union movement in Scotland. We are also worried that the role of the HSE is being diluted,\" Molloy said. He has the backing at the law firm Pinsent Masons, whose health and safety expert, Anna Austin, has expressed concern about the change. \"The challenge that faces the proposed energy division is to maintain the same level of expertise in its regulation of offshore safety \u2026 it remains to be seen whether this can be done,\" she said. Kevin Myers, the deputy chief executive of the HSE, wrote an open letter on the organisation's website, in which he insisted he was committed to strengthening offshore safety and promised the appointment of more offshore safety inspectors. Regulation would remain \"business as usual from an external point of view \u2026 We're all agreed on the need for a robust regulatory regime offshore \u2013 we owe it to those who have lost their lives in the industry and to those who still work there,\" he wrote. The offshore safety division was established in line with the recommendations of Lord Cullen, as part of his report into the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, in which 167 workers were killed after a gas leak and explosion on the Occidental Petroleum-owned platform. No criminal charges were brought against Occidental. The Piper 25 conference, organised by Oil &amp; Gas UK, will hear from Lord Cullen, the HSE and major oil companies, as well as Molloy. An Oil &amp; Gas UK spokesman said: \"The UK oil and gas industry places a major focus on engaging the workforce in safety issues because evidence shows that the involvement of workers is important in ensuring continuous improvement in this area. \"Not only is training provided by the industry for safety representatives, along with the industry, trade unions and Health and Safety Executive, workforce safety representatives provide leadership to Step Change in Safety, the organisation with the goal of making the UK the safest place to work in offshore oil and gas. \"The HSE also provides a telephone number on which offshore workers can anonymously report any concerns they have about safety, to ensure that everyone is heard by the relevant authorities.\" Two leaks a day Oil companies are leaking crude or other chemicals into the North Sea at the rate of two incidents a day, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The latest petroleum operations notice, covering the period between 5 and 29 April, shows more than 50 separate cases in which BP, Shell and others have been forced to report spillages. BP reported releasing an unspecificed \"product\" from the Marnock field on 27 April with a further \"mineral\" release from the Andrew field just 24 hours earlier. Most of the cases involve small amounts of fluid and are often blamed on human or equipment failure, according to the reports, but the sheer volume of accidents raises questions about wider offshore safety.",

    "webTitle": "All eyes on Mark Carney's first move as Bank of England's new governor", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne will doubtless lay the compliments on thick when he says a public goodbye to Sir Mervyn King in his annual Mansion House speech this week. Unrivalled record of public service; towering intellect; seen Britain through some pretty hairy moments; nation should be eternally grateful: that sort of thing. In truth, the chancellor is keen for King to go and the new Mark Carney era to begin. He has a new court favourite, handpicked from the ranks of the international central banking community, who has been brought in with the task of providing the escape velocity for the economy that King promised but did not deliver. In recent months, King has become something of a Cardinal Wolsey figure: the elder statesman upon whom the young prince relied but who has fallen out of favour after years of devotion to the state. Wolsey failed to get Henry VIII his divorce from Catherine of Aragon; King has failed to get Osborne his economic recovery. Carney is the Thomas Cromwell to King's Wolsey, and like Cromwell will be a force to be reckoned with. The Bank has seen its powers greatly enhanced as a result of the financial crisis, and is now responsible for financial stability as well as monetary policy. One of the new governor's first tasks will be to decide, after discussions with his colleagues on the monetary policy committee, whether the Bank wishes to give forward guidance about the likely path of interest rates. Last week's resignation of Paul Tucker, and the scheduled retirement next year of the other deputy governor, Charlie Bean, gives Carney scope to appoint his own people to the top jobs at the Bank. While Osborne has the final say on the choice of the two deputy governors, he is certain to rubberstamp whoever Carney chooses. Before considering the challenges facing the new governor, it is worth assessing the record of the man he is replacing. King's three biggest achievements were the creation of the UK model of central bank independence from the policy vacuum that existed after Black Wednesday in 1992; his bracingly refreshing approach to the special pleading of the City; and his willingness to set all the monetary policy dials to \"go\" when the economy hit the skids in 2008-09. His three big failings were the \"ivory tower\" approach to policymaking in the pre-crash years, when the governor's preoccupation with monetary policy blinded him to the growing fragility of the financial system; the delay in spotting during the year that separated the run on Northern Rock from the collapse of Lehman Brothers that interest rates were too high; and being overzealous in backing Osborne's fiscal policy. Funnily enough, it was the cover King provided for austerity that has led to the cooling of relations with Osborne. When advising the new chancellor, the governor insisted that public spending cuts and tax increases planned by the Treasury would not derail growth because the Bank could stimulate the economy using monetary policy. There are reasons why the strategy has not worked, some of them \u2013 like the crisis in the eurozone \u2013 beyond King's control. But like Henry VIII, Osborne is no longer interested in excuses; the next election is less than two years away and he wants action. Carney may be lucky enough to arrive just as four years of stimulus are starting to have an effect. The forward-looking reports on manufacturing, services and construction improved in June. There are signs of life in the housing market. Unemployment is edging down. The City is pencilling in growth of 0.5-0.6% in the second quarter, double that in the first three months of the year. All the new governor may have to do is reassure the markets that the stimulus is not going to be withdrawn any time soon, say some suitably upbeat things about the UK being over the worst, and bingo! Job done. It may, of course, not be quite so simple as that. There are those both in the government and in the City who question whether recovery is genuine. Real incomes remain under pressure and the global economy has turned down since the start of the year. Add in the impact of austerity, and it's easy to envisage a slowing of activity in the second half of 2013. King, for months past, has been voting for the MPC to do more to stimulate activity, voting in a minority of three to increase the Bank's quantitative easing programme by \u00a325bn. Carney, it must be assumed, shares King's views, otherwise there is little point in him being appointed. So how does he play his first meeting of the MPC, which will be held in his first week at Threadneedle Street? The recent run of modestly good data means there is no obvious reason why the six MPC members who have been steadfastly voting for no change in policy are going to change their mind. Indeed, there would be questions asked about their independence if they did switch their votes simply in order to make life easier for the new governor. But if Carney ends up on the losing side, it will immediately raise doubts about how effective he is going to be. Losing a vote when you have been at the Bank of England for more than 20 years, as King has, is one thing; to lose your first vote when you have been brought as a miracle worker is another. Carney could, of course, decide to vote with the majority if he senses that he cannot win the MPC over. That, though, would be just as big a PR disaster, since it would give the impression that the new governor had bottled it. None of this will come as a surprise to Carney, who is smart enough to know that this is potentially a serious problem. What may surprise him is the way in which his setbacks will be reported. Carney screws up is a better headline than Carney's steady hand on the tiller. All of which makes the new governor's choice of personnel even more interesting. Does he bring two new deputy governors in from outside or does he pick the internal candidates: Spencer Dale, the chief economist, for Bean's job; and Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street's director of financial stability, for Tucker's? Carney has already crossed swords with Haldane about new rules for bank regulation, and he may find Dale's approach to the economy overcautious, but even so it would be risky to thwart the ambitions of both men. Why? Because the Bank's dual mandate means Carney will need good people to help him manage a more complex institution. Because the new governor is going to have his work cut out with an economy riddled with deep structural problems. And because bringing in your own people smacks of rule by faction, which \u2013 as Cromwell found \u2013 is dangerous when things go wrong.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne will doubtless lay the compliments on thick when he says a public goodbye to Sir Mervyn King in his annual Mansion House speech this week. Unrivalled record of public service; towering intellect; seen Britain through some pretty hairy moments; nation should be eternally grateful: that sort of thing.</p> <p>In truth, the chancellor is keen for King to go and the new Mark Carney era to begin. He has a new court favourite, handpicked from the ranks of the international central banking community, who has been brought in with the task of providing the escape velocity for the economy that King promised but did not deliver.</p> <p>In recent months, King has become something of a Cardinal Wolsey figure: the elder statesman upon whom the young prince relied but who has fallen out of favour after years of devotion to the state. Wolsey failed to get Henry VIII his divorce from Catherine of Aragon; King has failed to get Osborne his economic recovery.</p> <p>Carney is the Thomas Cromwell to King's Wolsey, and like Cromwell will be a force to be reckoned with. The Bank has seen its powers greatly enhanced as a result of the financial crisis, and is now responsible for financial stability as well as monetary policy. One of the new governor's first tasks will be to decide, after discussions with his colleagues on the monetary policy committee, whether the Bank wishes to give forward guidance about the likely path of interest rates.</p> <p>Last week's resignation of Paul Tucker, and the scheduled retirement next year of the other deputy governor, Charlie Bean, gives Carney scope to appoint his own people to the top jobs at the Bank. While Osborne has the final say on the choice of the two deputy governors, he is certain to rubberstamp whoever Carney chooses.</p> <p>Before considering the challenges facing the new governor, it is worth assessing the record of the man he is replacing. King's three biggest achievements were the creation of the UK model of central bank independence from the policy vacuum that existed after Black Wednesday in 1992; his bracingly refreshing approach to the special pleading of the City; and his willingness to set all the monetary policy dials to \"go\" when the economy hit the skids in 2008-09.</p> <p>His three big failings were the \"ivory tower\" approach to policymaking in the pre-crash years, when the governor's preoccupation with monetary policy blinded him to the growing fragility of the financial system; the delay in spotting during the year that separated the run on Northern Rock from the collapse of Lehman Brothers that interest rates were too high; and being overzealous in backing Osborne's fiscal policy.</p> <p>Funnily enough, it was the cover King provided for austerity that has led to the cooling of relations with Osborne. When advising the new chancellor, the governor insisted that public spending cuts and tax increases planned by the Treasury would not derail growth because the Bank could stimulate the economy using monetary policy.</p> <p>There are reasons why the strategy has not worked, some of them \u2013 like the crisis in the eurozone \u2013 beyond King's control. But like Henry VIII, Osborne is no longer interested in excuses; the next election is less than two years away and he wants action.</p> <p>Carney may be lucky enough to arrive just as four years of stimulus are starting to have an effect. The forward-looking reports on manufacturing, services and construction improved in June. There are signs of life in the housing market. Unemployment is edging down. The City is pencilling in growth of 0.5-0.6% in the second quarter, double that in the first three months of the year. All the new governor may have to do is reassure the markets that the stimulus is not going to be withdrawn any time soon, say some suitably upbeat things about the UK being over the worst, and bingo! Job done.</p> <p>It may, of course, not be quite so simple as that. There are those both in the government and in the City who question whether recovery is genuine. Real incomes remain under pressure and the global economy has turned down since the start of the year. Add in the impact of austerity, and it's easy to envisage a slowing of activity in the second half of 2013.</p> <p>King, for months past, has been voting for the MPC to do more to stimulate activity, voting in a minority of three to increase the Bank's quantitative easing programme by \u00a325bn.
