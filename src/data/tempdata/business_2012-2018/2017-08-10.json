      "bodyText": "Middle-aged men from disadvantaged backgrounds are twice as likely to be single as those from rich families, according to a new study that highlights the lack of social mobility in Britain. Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that men\u2019s marriage prospects are linked to their upbringing, and that the disparity between those from well-off and poor families has widened in recent years. The study found that one in three men from disadvantaged backgrounds were single at the age of 42, compared with one in seven from rich backgrounds. The IFS said this was the result both of lower marriage rates and a higher likelihood of relationship breakdown among men from low-income families. Men from low-income households were more than twice as likely to be divorced as those from high-income backgrounds \u2013 11% rather than 5% \u2013 and almost twice as likely never to have been married (36% rather than 20%). The thinktank said it had long been established that the sons of richer parents tended to have higher incomes than those with poor parents, but it noted that the gap was widening. In 2012, employed 42-year-old men whose parents were among the richest fifth of households earned an average of 88% more than those from the poorest families. In 2000, the equivalent gap was 47%. The income gap was reduced to 66% after tax. The IFS said men from disadvantaged backgrounds were also losing out by not being able to attract or keep a partner. Even among men in couples, the partners of men from richer backgrounds earn 73% more than the partners of men from poorer families. \u201cFemale earnings are an increasingly important component of household income and so these trends significantly reduce the household incomes of men who grew up in poor families compared with those of men who grew up in rich families,\u201d the IFS said. \u201cAnd this is a new phenomenon. Amongst men born 12 years earlier, the differences in partnership status and partner earnings by family background were considerably smaller.\u201d Men from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely to be out of work as those from richer backgrounds, the study found. Only 7% of men growing up in the richest fifth of households were out of work at the age of 42 in 2012 \u2013 a year when the economy was growing only sluggishly \u2013 while more than 15% of men from the poorest fifth of households were out of work. Men from poorer backgrounds are also more than twice as likely to receive disability benefits as those from better-off families, at 11% rather than 4%. Chris Belfield, a research economist at IFS and an author of the paper, said: \u201cFocusing solely on the earnings of men in work understates the importance of family background in determining living standards. \u201cAs well as having higher earnings, those from richer families are more likely to be in work, more likely to have a partner and more likely to have a higher-earning partner than those from less-well-off backgrounds. And all these inequalities have been widening over time.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Adani fined for dumping coal-laden stormwater into sea at Abbot Point", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An Adani company has been fined by the Queensland government for its unauthorised release of coal-laden stormwater into the sea at its Abbot Point port during a cyclone in March. The coal port operator, which dumped water containing more than eight times the permitted amount of sediment during Cyclone Debbie on 27 March, was issued a $12,190 penalty for a technical breach on 20 July. The company could face a multimillion-dollar fine if found guilty of causing environmental harm. The fine did not relate to stormwater released into the neighbouring Caley Valley wetlands, which is still subject to an ongoing investigation, the department of environment and heritage protection told the Guardian in a statement. The infringement notice was issued to Abbot Point Bulk Coal Pty Ltd, a company which its Indian-listed parent has been trying to sell to a tax haven company linked to the Adani family for more than four years. Australian corporate records show Abbot Point Bulk Coal Pty Ltd is a subsidiary of the Indian stockmarket-listed company Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZ), more than half of which is owned by the Adani family. However, in financial reports APSEZ said it sold its entire interest in the Abbot Point port operations to a private Singapore-based company, Abbot Point Port Holdings Pte Ltd, during the Indian financial year 2013. The Singapore company is in turn held by Atulya Resources Limited, an Adani family-linked company registered in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. While APSEZ has taken the debt from buying Abbot Point off its books, the sale has never been recorded as completed. But the companies behind Adani\u2019s proposed expansion of Abbot Point, which would boost its export capacity for its proposed Carmichael mine, are all ultimately owned by the tax haven company. The Abbot Point operator was granted a temporary licence to discharge stormwater with up to 100mg per litre of \u201csuspended solids\u201d as high rainfall from Debbie lashed the north Queensland coast. But 10 days later, the company told the department it had breached the licence with a release recording sediment at 806mg a litre. \u201cThis stormwater was discharged to the surrounding marine waters,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cThe company\u2019s environmental authority and [temporary emissions licence] contained strict conditions that should have been adhered to in ensuring the environment was protected, especially during extreme weather events. \u201cTemporary emissions licences and environmental authorities are not taken lightly by the department and there can be harsh penalties for companies that breach their approvals.\u201d The department said Adani had until 17 August to contest the fine in court. Adani has rejected claims by conservationists that coal-laden water had contaminated the nearby Caley Valley wetlands and possibly coastal waters near the Great Barrier Reef marine park. \u201cEHP\u2019s investigations into releases into the wetlands is ongoing,\u201d the department said. The department\u2019s director-general, Jim Reeves, had previously flagged that the \u201cserious penalties\u201d for corporations causing environmental harm through licence breaches included fines of up to $3.8m for deliberate breaches and $2.7m for accidents. An Australian Conservation Foundation campaigner, Basha Stasak, said Adani\u2019s failure to abide by \u201ca relaxed special licence from the Queensland environment department to release pollution into the ocean\u201d showed the company \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted\u201d. \u201cIf Adani can\u2019t safely operate the Abbot Point coal terminal, how can they be trusted to build Australia\u2019s biggest coal mine? \u201cThis is not a company that should be trusted with our Great Barrier Reef, our clean water or the fate of the endangered black throated finch.\u201d Adani had been asked for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lego has replaced its British chief executive, the first non-Danish person to run the toy company, after just eight months, saying that at the age of 61 he was never expected to be in the position long-term. The toymaker said Bali Padda would make way for Niels Christiansen, a 51-year-old former chief executive of Danfoss, a Danish manufacturing and technology company. Lego\u2019s chairman, J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp, who was chief executive for 12 years until December, said the move was not down to Padda\u2019s performance but because it had always been understood he would only do the job for a few years at most because of his age. Under Knudstorp, Lego enjoyed a decade of growth, tying up with movie franchises such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and Indiana Jones in deals spanning Lego sets, video games, movie franchises and smartphone applications. The success story continued with the launch of The Lego Movie in 2014. But while Lego now vies with the Barbie doll maker Mattel to be the world\u2019s largest toy manufacturer, revenue growth slowed from 25% in 2015 to just 6% last year \u2013 the lowest annual increase in nine years \u2013 with sales of 37.9bn Danish krone (\u00a34.6bn). A spokesman for the maker of plastic bricks said it had been a mutual understanding from the outset between the company and Padda, who has worked for Lego for 15 years. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in a position in his life to be in the role for a long time. It might have been five years but it wouldn\u2019t have been 10 years. We found the right person faster than expected \u2026 it is not related at all to the performance of the company.\u201d Padda, who joined Lego in 2002 and was part of the senior management team through its years of rapid growth, will remain in the top job until 1 October, when Christiansen takes over, and will stay on at the family-owned company in an advisory role. Punjab-born Padda moved to the UK with his parents as a child. He said: \u201cTo me it has been an honour to be part of the Lego group for 15 years in all the different roles I have had \u2013 and I feel privileged to have worked with so many wonderful, talented people. Knudstorp said: \u201cBali has been part of the Lego group family for the past 15 years. He played an integral role in its turnaround and during his time as chief executive he created a solid foundation from which to continue to transform the company. He is a great friend and a wonderful ambassador for the brand.\u201d The company is based in Billund, Denmark, and was founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen, a master carpenter, in 1932. The first toy was a wooden duck, and it proved such a big hit he focused entirely on making toys using the brand name Lego, derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, meaning \u201cplay well\u201d. The first Lego piece rolled off the production line in 1949 and the company started exporting in 1956. The toy bricks are now sold in more than 130 countries, with China earmarked as a target for major growth. The company is still controlled by the founding Kristensen family, which has a 75% stake. Between 1932 and 1998, Lego never posted a loss. But by 2003 it was in trouble, with sales down 30% year on year and $800m (then \u00a3480m) of debt. Knudstorp led the turnaround, which included selling the company\u2019s controlling stakes in its Legoland theme parks, expanding its franchise deals with Lego sets based on Hollywood films such as Star Wars, and introducing the Lego Friends range aimed at girls. Melissa Symonds, a director at the consumer research group NPD, said Lego had stood the test of time because of its broad appeal. \u201cLego has appeal for all ages and genders, with the versatility of the little brick allowing endless variations of play,\u201d she said. Lego\u2019s Batman Movie MiniFigures is the bestselling toy so far in 2017, according to NPD analysis. The toymaker announced in December it would raise prices in the UK by 5% in 2017, in response to the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Danny Cox, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said changes in management at any company could be challenging. \u201cBusinesses need to operate with stable management teams and low turnover in the board room, as leadership change is unsettling even when smooth and pre-planned,\u201d he said. \u201cTo go through this process many times in short order becomes a greater challenge as teams take time to adapt to changes in senior personnel, their style and vision \u2013 and ultimately this can impact on performance.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Asda workers are facing redundancy or a dramatic cut in their working hours as Britain\u2019s third-largest supermarket chain looks to cut costs. Asda has begun a consultation with 3,257 employees in 18 underperforming stores, singled out as overstaffed relative to their current sales performance. The Guardian has learned Asda is also looking at staffing levels in a further 59 of its supermarkets, though at present this is an informal process. The retailer is not looking to cut jobs in these stores but wants staff to agree to work in different departments when required. The GMB union said it had been contacted by worried Asda workers \u201cfearing for their jobs\u201d after new business plans were shared with store managers that included a substantial reduction in staff hours worked. The 18 stores facing staff cuts include branches in Halifax in West Yorkshire, Broadstairs in Kent and the Basildon Eastgate store in Essex. Staff will face a series of one-to-one meetings over the next three weeks. The eventual job-loss figure is expected to be in the hundreds. Last week Asda posted its worst annual figures since being taken over by Walmart in 1999, as fierce competition in the UK supermarket sector took its toll. The supermarket chain admitted its performance was \u201cbehind expectations\u201d after pre-tax profit for 2016 fell 19% to \u00a3791.7m. Accounts filed at Companies House also showed sales fell to \u00a321.6bn from \u00a322.3bn, as shoppers flocked to cheaper rivals. The supermarket industry is going through massive change as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are forced to cut costs to respond to the threat posed by the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as grocery sales moving online. In a sign of how the balance of power is shifting, Aldi overtook Waitrose in 2015 and then, in February, sailed past the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth-biggest grocer. Lidl is expected to overtake Waitrose this year. The two currently sitneck and neck with 5.1% of the market, according to the consumer consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. Tesco is axing 2,300 staff this year as part of a cost-cutting programme that is hitting head office workers as well as staff based at its Cardiff call centre \u2013 due to close early next year. At the weekend it was revealed that Sainsbury\u2019s plans to cut 1,000 head office jobs. In recent years Asda has trailed behind Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons and is the worst-performing member of the \u201cbig four\u201d. Its deteriorating performance led to the replacement of chief executive Andy Clarke last summer with the Walmart executive Sean Clarke parachuted in to lead a turnaround. He has focused on dropping prices, boosting the quality of food ranges and improving customer service. Bryan Roberts, an analyst at TCC Global, said all the major supermarkets were trying to become more efficient as they juggled higher payroll costs following this year\u2019s hike in the national minimum wage, and inflation linked to Brexit\u2019s blow to sterling. \u201cYou need to be careful that you are cutting away fat without cutting into the muscle,\u201d he said. Good customer service was a point of difference for Asda in its battle with the discounters, he added. Last year Asda cut 750 jobs at its Leeds head office and in store. The process saw the closure of staff canteens in all stores and an end to shop-floor services such as photo-processing and pizza-making. \u201cWe are currently in discussions with a number of our stores about changes that are needed to the number of hours required to run that store for our customers,\u201d said an Asda spokesman. \u201cIt is common practice for a supermarket to need to make changes to hours based on the changing shopping habits of customers. We understand that any conversations about change are unsettling, but it is always our upmost priority to find alternative roles or working patterns for impacted colleagues.\u201d Roberts said Asda was \u201con the up\u201d with the most recent set of industry figures showing it had pulled in an extra 398,000 shoppers in the 12 weeks to 16 July. The Kantar data showed Asda\u2019s sales for the period grew by 1% compared with the same period a year ago. Asda said like-for-like sales fell 2.8% in the first three months of 2017, which was marginally better than the 2.9% drop recorded in the last three months of 2016. Its second-quarter performance will be revealed on Thursday when Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, updates investors.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Has the Bank of England got the hang of this public consultation lark? On the vexed question of whether the nation\u2019s banknotes should contain traces of animal products, 88% of respondents to the Bank\u2019s survey said they shouldn\u2019t. Threadneedle Street\u2019s response to the respondents? Tough luck, we\u2019re sticking with our polymer mix. It didn\u2019t put it like that, of course. Rather than deploying traces of earnest verbiage, the Bank opted for excess. The decision was reached after \u201ccareful and serious consideration\u201d. The Bank \u201cfully recognises the concerns raised by members of the public\u201d. It understands not all parties will feel their concerns have been addressed. But the decision stands. It is also justified, for reasons that were explained more succinctly. It would cost \u00a316.5m over a decade to switch the formula. The only viable alternative uses palm oil and the Bank\u2019s suppliers were unable to commit to finding the highest level of sustainable sources. A return to cotton-paper notes is a non-starter because the polymer ones last longer, are harder to counterfeit and have a lower carbon footprint. All those points seem reasonable, even if some vegans and some religious groups would reject them. But they are also mostly the same points the Bank made last year when the affair blew up. So what was the point of asking the public? If an 88% majority \u2013 albeit on a low response rate of 3,544 people \u2013 can be ignored, why bother to consult? It doesn\u2019t make you any more open-minded. Does the Pru have eyes for Asia? Part of the success of M&amp;G, it was always understood, lay in the fact that the Prudential has let the fund manager do its own thing. The two head offices sit next to each other in the City but operational autonomy since acquisition in 1999 was supposed to suit both sides. Other insurance giants, like Aviva, have suffered agonies over the years in their attempts to get their in-house asset managers to attract outside funds. M&amp;G, with an independent identity, has made the process look a breeze. Even in the past six months, the enviable sum of \u00a37.2bn arrived from outside. Now the Pru wants to merge the asset manager with its UK life insurance operation. Why mess with a winning formula? Why saddle the clever-clogs fund managers with the burden of working with boring old life insurers? The arguments presented by the Pru chief executive, Mike Wells, make sense in the abstract. The once-distinct savings and investments markets are blending into one. The financial products created and distributed by the Pru and M&amp;G increasingly look alike. Besides, it is argued, collaboration has happened for years and, note, \u00a3132bn of M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a3281bn under management is Pru money. There are also \u00a3145m of annual savings to be made, albeit for a hefty upfront outlay, as both sides equip themselves with slicker technology. Well, yes, it all sounds in tune with the fashionable idea that investment firms must get bigger, leaner and more tech-savvy when titans such as BlackRock are on the prowl. All the same, it is quite possible that more could turn out to mean less. The risk is that M&amp;G\u2019s culture is diluted in the mash-up. But maybe it is a risk worth taking if, actually, the Pru\u2019s long-term ambition is to sell or demerge the UK operation to concentrate on its booming operation in Asia. A bigger UK business, wrapped up neatly via a merger of its two biggest parts, might be viewed as better equipped for independent life. Wells said nothing to encourage the long-standing break-up theory. On the other hand, while extolling the wonders and efficiencies that will arrive via the UK merger, he never once committed to long-term ownership of the unit. An internal restructuring was a moment to do so, and he dodged the question. The Pru, more than ever, seems to be looking to Asia. Co-op Bank shows signs of flagging loyalty Nothing, it seemed, could shake the loyalty of the Co-op Bank\u2019s customers. Former chairman Paul Flowers did his stuff on the tabloid pages and one funding crisis was followed by another, but the customers stuck with their bank. It is only now the odd dent is appearing. About 25,000 customers, or 2% of the total, closed their current accounts in the first half of this year. It\u2019s hard to know if that was caused by long-term weariness, suspicion about the hedge fund ownership, or just competitive action. Whatever the explanation, Liam Coleman is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the outflow. We all should be. Once upon a time, the Co-op Bank was seen as a possible source of serious competitive challenge to the big banks. It was going to buy 600 branches from Lloyds until previous management \u2013 prodded by the Bank of England \u2013 had to confess they couldn\u2019t afford to pay. These days the Co-op Bank has just 95 branches. It is soon to be rebooted with a life-saving \u00a3700m capital injection thanks to the hedge funds, who, one suspects, are right to think there is a small but sound operation at the heart of the business. But proving the point will remain the goal for some time yet. Profitability is a \u201cmedium-term\u201d ambition, says the bank, which is deliberately vague.",

On the vexed question of whether the nation\u2019s banknotes should contain traces of animal products, 88% of respondents to the Bank\u2019s survey said they shouldn\u2019t. Threadneedle Street\u2019s response to the respondents? Tough luck, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/10/bank-of-england-to-keep-animal-fat-in-banknotes-despite-complaints\">we\u2019re sticking with our polymer mix</a>.<br></p> <p>It didn\u2019t put it like that, of course. Rather than deploying traces of earnest verbiage, the Bank opted for excess. The decision was reached after \u201ccareful and serious consideration\u201d. The Bank \u201cfully recognises the concerns raised by members of the public\u201d. It understands not all parties will feel their concerns have been addressed. But the decision stands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/10/bank-of-england-to-keep-animal-fat-in-banknotes-despite-complaints\">Bank of England to keep animal fat in banknotes despite complaints</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also justified, for reasons that were explained more succinctly. It would cost \u00a316.5m over a decade to switch the formula. The only viable alternative uses palm oil and the Bank\u2019s suppliers were unable to commit to finding the highest level of sustainable sources. A return to cotton-paper notes is a non-starter because the polymer ones last longer, are harder to counterfeit and have a lower carbon footprint.</p> <p>All those points seem reasonable, even if some vegans and some religious groups would reject them. But they are also mostly the same points the Bank made last year when the affair blew up. So what was the point of asking the public? If an 88% majority \u2013 albeit on a low response rate of 3,544 people \u2013 can be ignored, why bother to consult? It doesn\u2019t make you any more open-minded.</p> <h2>Does the Pru have eyes for Asia?</h2> <p>Part of the success of M&amp;G, it was always understood, lay in the fact that the Prudential has let the fund manager do its own thing. The two head offices sit next to each other in the City but operational autonomy since acquisition in 1999 was supposed to suit both sides.<br></p> <p>Other insurance giants, like Aviva, have suffered agonies over the years in their attempts to get their in-house asset managers to attract outside funds. M&amp;G, with an independent identity, has made the process look a breeze. Even in the past six months, the enviable sum of \u00a37.2bn arrived from outside.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/prudential-may-relocate-m-and-g-funds-brexit-vote\">Now the Pru wants to merge the asset manager with its UK life insurance operation. </a>Why mess with a winning formula? Why saddle the clever-clogs fund managers with the burden of working with boring old life insurers?</p> <p>The arguments presented by the Pru chief executive, Mike Wells, make sense in the abstract. The once-distinct savings and investments markets are blending into one. The financial products created and distributed by the Pru and M&amp;G increasingly look alike. Besides, it is argued, collaboration has happened for years and, note, \u00a3132bn of M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a3281bn under management is Pru money. There are also \u00a3145m of annual savings to be made, albeit for a hefty upfront outlay, as both sides equip themselves with slicker technology.</p> <p>Well, yes, it all sounds in tune with the fashionable idea that investment firms must get bigger, leaner and more tech-savvy when titans such as BlackRock are on the prowl. All the same, it is quite possible that more could turn out to mean less. The risk is that M&amp;G\u2019s culture is diluted in the mash-up.</p> <p>But maybe it is a risk worth taking if, actually, the Pru\u2019s long-term ambition is to sell or demerge the UK operation to concentrate on its booming operation in Asia. A bigger UK business, wrapped up neatly via a merger of its two biggest parts, might be viewed as better equipped for independent life.</p> <p>Wells said nothing to encourage the long-standing break-up theory. On the other hand, while extolling the wonders and efficiencies that will arrive via the UK merger, he never once committed to long-term ownership of the unit. An internal restructuring was a moment to do so, and he dodged the question. The Pru, more than ever, seems to be looking to Asia.</p> <h2>Co-op Bank shows signs of flagging loyalty</h2> <p>Nothing, it seemed, could shake the loyalty of the Co-op Bank\u2019s customers. Former chairman Paul Flowers did his stuff on the tabloid pages and one funding crisis was followed by another, but the customers stuck with their bank.</p> <p>It is only now the odd dent is appearing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/10/co-operative-banks-losses-narrow-to-135m-amid-restructuring\">About 25,000 customers, or 2% of the total, closed their current accounts in the first half of this year</a>. It\u2019s hard to know if that was caused by long-term weariness, suspicion about the hedge fund ownership, or just competitive action. Whatever the explanation, Liam Coleman is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the outflow.</p> <p>We all should be. Once upon a time, the Co-op Bank was seen as a possible source of serious competitive challenge to the big banks. It was going to buy 600 branches from Lloyds until previous management \u2013 prodded by the Bank of England \u2013 had to confess they couldn\u2019t afford to pay. These days the Co-op Bank has just 95 branches.</p> <p>It is soon to be rebooted with a life-saving \u00a3700m capital injection thanks to the hedge funds, who, one suspects, are right to think there is a small but sound operation at the heart of the business. But proving the point will remain the goal for some time yet. Profitability is a \u201cmedium-term\u201d ambition, says the bank, which is deliberately vague.</p>",

It\u2019s possible that Bell is also steeped in neoclassical economic beliefs, but in the hope that his good work at the Resolution Foundation might have loosened those chains, he could do enormous further service by speaking up to debunk a few economic myths. When he writes \u201cthere is not some magic bullet\u201d, it resonates with the now discredited \u201cmyth\u201d that \u201cthere is no magic money tree\u201d, employed by Thatcher, Cameron and May. After all, from his time in the department he must surely have been aware that in 2013, tucked away in the bundle of Treasury documents tabled by the then chancellor, George Osborne, on budget day, was one with this paragraph: \u201cFor example, it is theoretically possible for monetary authorities to finance fiscal deficits through the creation of money. In theory, this could allow governments to increase spending or reduce taxation without raising corresponding financing from the private sector. Adair Turner, Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, has suggested this could be a tool to use in extreme circumstances.\u201d Clearly such money could be used to increase spending to build houses and improve the lot of workers, both of which Bell recommends. David Murray Wallington, Surrey \u2022 Torsten Bell\u2019s assertion that \u201ca period of prolonged fiscal consolidation is a very silly time to be making major tax cuts\u201d is a welcome reminder that it doesn\u2019t have to be like this. For the past seven years those holding the reins of power have consistently told us that there is no alternative, that we cannot carry on living beyond our means, and that the greatest gift is a low-tax economy. Those politicians, paralysed in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire and by the wider housing crisis, and distracted by the Brexit agenda, have no answers. But the rest of us are crying out for the kind of vision and courage displayed by the 1945 government that laid the foundations of the welfare state and built the council houses in which so many of us were happy to grow up. An early general election will provide an opportunity to test these competing visions \u2013 let\u2019s hope the Tories don\u2019t opt for the \u201clipstick on a pig\u201d solution again (Tories count cost of hiring strategist, 9 August). Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 As we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis, could we ask Conservative and Lib Dem politicians, together with the media, to stop blaming the last Labour government for the financial meltdown? The responsibility for the crash lies with the banks \u2013 although they seem unable to accept that or change their ways. Ed Runham Matlock, Derbyshire \u2022 On Wednesday, the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, I popped into my local HSBC bank. The cashier suggested I should take out a loan to \u201ctreat yourself to a new car\u201d. I am 58. My current income is \u00a3300 a month. It seems the banks learned nothing from the crash and are happy to play silly buggers with our economy once again for a quick profit. Alan Cleaver Whitehaven, Cumbria \u2022 Katie Allen offers a first-class analysis of the decoupling of wage growth from high rates of employment (Record employment rate tells skewed tale about jobs market, 7 August). The major economic task, if this trend is to be reversed, is to ramp up productivity. This will take time as well as new investment in skills, transport, and housing. But might I set out the bones of a programme that would quickly set us on a path towards higher incomes for low earners? Trade union activism has set off a domino effect against bogus self-employment in the gig economy. A swift legislative response to the Taylor review is now required to effect wholesale change that produces strong upward pressure on wages. A crucial test here will be to extend the protection of the national minimum wage to those who are wrongly labelled \u201cself-employed\u201d. Next, the Low Pay Commission should be tasked with setting higher minimum wage rates in those sectors of the economy that could easily afford to pay it without shedding jobs. Moreover, companies should be required to publish the pay ratio between their highest and lowest paid staff, including contract and agency workers, and to peg subsequent increases at the bottom of the pay scale to those at the top. A requirement to offer all workers on zero-hours contracts the option of a fixed-hours alternative would also help. Finally, the welfare system needs to keep up with the changing composition of the workforce. Universal credit, in its current form, fails in this task. By penalising households with one parent working full-time and another seeking to enter part-time work, universal credit makes it much more difficult for families to escape poverty.

    "webTitle": "Markets jittery over North Korea as UK trade deficit widens - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The increasingly tense confrontation between the US and North Korea has again sent investors fleeing from equities and into safer areas such as gold and government bonds. It was a down day across Europe, while Wall Street was also suffering from the growing uncertainty. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The showdown between the two nations has scared off many investors. Whenever dealers hear the word \u2018war\u2019 they usually run for the hills, and that is exactly what we have seen today. While tensions are running high, traders will be reluctant to be long... US equity markets are holding up better than their European equivalents, but a global story like this will shake investors out of the stock markets. US equities, and in particular, the Dow Jones had a great run recently and the political uncertainly between the two countries has encouraged profit taking. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 108.12 points or 1.44% to 7389.94, wiping around \u00a327bn off the value of the UK\u2019s top companies and marking its worst one day performance since 18 April this year Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.15% to 12,014.30 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.59% lower at 5115.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.76% to 21,681.61 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.38% at 10,450.0 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.02% to 833.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 165 points or 0.74%, on track for its worst day since the end of June. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Meanwhile the Vix volatility index has jumped 27% on the North Korea situation, hitting a three month high of 14.2. The fall in the FTSE 100 is due in the most part to the global concerns following the growing tensions between the US and North Korea, but there are other factors. For a start, some 40 points of the current 114 point or 1.52% decline is due to companies being quoted ex-dividend. Then there is the widening UK trade deficit, as well as news that the NIESR think tank had edged its growth forecast lower. And housebuilders have been hit by signs of the weakening housing market. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The housing market decline evident within London over recent months appears to be spreading across the country, with the latest report from RICS highlighting a slowdown in sales. Yesterday\u2019s report from the London School of Economics and VATT suggested the recent stamp duty changes are having a significant negative effect on housing transactions, and today we are seeing that borne out in the RICS data. The continued slowdown we are seeing in house price growth and housing sales is proving a drag on the housebuilder sector, with Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey suffering heavily today. The market slide is continuing, as investors flee to safer areas given the tensions between the US and North Korea. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The US open did nothing to dispel the day\u2019s tremulous trading, instead causing the European indices to intensify their own losses. The Dow Jones plunged more than half a percent after the bell, wiping off 130 points to leave the index teetering just above 21900. That\u2019s its worst price since the end of July, raising questions of whether this is the end of the Dow\u2019s recent record run, or just a brief diversion until the US/North Korea situation cools and a parade of proper, Grade A data arrives (for example, next week is looking pretty jam-packed). The Dow\u2019s drop had serious implications for the rest of the global markets, as investors voiced their concerns about the nuclear threat posed by two very spoilt children. The FTSE is now down a whopping 1.6% \u2013 and while roughly third of that decline stems from a chunk of the index going ex-dividend, the rest certainly doesn\u2019t. Not only is the war of words (let\u2019s hope their spat remains verbal) between Trump and Kim Jong Un weighing on the FTSE, but also the disappointment of June\u2019s 9 month high UK trade deficit. There were similarly alarming slides in the Eurozone. The DAX gradually saw its losses widen to 130 points, sending the German index to a fresh 12 week nadir, while the CAC dropped 0.7% to lurk just above 5100. Opec has forecast higher demand for crude in 2018, and said a rise in the oil price suggested its moves to curb the glut of supply could be having an effect. In its monthly report, the oil producers organisation said demand next year would reach 32.42m barrels a day, up 220,000 from its previous prediction. The news has helped push Brent crude 0.9% higher to $53.19 a barrel. US markets have opened lower, with investors nervy amid the rhetoric from the US and North Korea. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 79 points or 0.36% in early trading, pushing it back below the 22,000 level, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.43% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.65% lower. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is 1.26% lower and set for its worst day since mid-April. But around 40 points of the near 100 point decline is due to a number of major companies being quoted ex-dividend, when shareholders no longer have the right to the payout. Also from the US, producer price inflation came in weaker than expected, another suggestion that any imminent rate rise from the Federal Reserve is unlikely. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: US PPI comes in well below expectations, suggesting that there is little need for imminent additional policy tightening. Nonetheless, we still see some potential for higher inflation to year end. The US PPI report for July is surprisingly low, falling 0.1% month on month (consensus was looking for a 0.1% rise), which brings the year on year rate down to 1.9% from 2%. The market and ourselves had been looking for 2.2% or 2.3% year on year reading. Core (excluding food and energy) similarly fell one tenth of a point. This is the first month on month drop in the headline rate since August 2016 and on the face of it a suggests pretty benign inflation backdrop right now... It is a surprise because the building blocks pointed to a much strong reading. The combination of the 10% fall in the US dollar helping to nudge up import prices, rising commodity prices (such as oil, which rose 18% trough to peak between June and July) and the underlying strength in the manufacturing sector helping to give a bit more pricing power to producers. Today\u2019s softer outcome suggests some downside risk for tomorrow\u2019s CPI report, but with the economy growing reasonably and creating jobs in significant numbers, coupled with the factors we cited regarding PPI mean we still think inflation pressures will pick-up over coming months. Newsflash from America: The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen slightly. Around 244,000 new \u2018initial jobless\u2019 claims were filed last week, up from 241,000 in the previous seven days. That\u2019s still a low figure, by historical standards, showing how the US labor market remains pretty solid. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy only grew by 0.2% in the last three months, according to the latest estimate from The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research Research. If NIESR are right, that means that growth slowed in July, following 0.3% growth in April-June. It\u2019s much slower than the UK\u2019s trend growth rate, of around 0.5-0.6%, and dangerously close to stagnation. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic Forecasting at NIESR, said: \u201cWe estimate that economic growth decelerated to 0.2 per cent in the three months to July, compared with 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2017. The service sector, which was the main driver for economic growth in the second quarter, appears to have slowed. We see a modest recovery in the second half of this year in response to strengthening global growth and a weaker currency, but on the flip side, consumer spending is likely to be weighed down by weak wage growth and investment spending held back by Brexit-related uncertainty. Further out, we see quarterly economic growth strengthen somewhat to 0.4-0.5 per cent as the economy rebalances away from domestic demand and towards net trade. Economic growth however, remains below its long-run average growth rate of 0.6 per cent because of subdued productivity growth\u201d. Mike Jakeman, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. argues that there is only a small chance that the United States and North Korea end up going to war. But while that\u2019s a relief, Jakeman also fears that Trump\u2019s \u201cbellicose rhetoric\u201d is dangerous, and could drive the two sides into conflict. He says: \u201cRhetoric between the US and the North has intensified over the past year, as evidence has mounted that North Korea is capable of attaching a miniaturised warhead to the top of an intercontinental missile. US intelligence agencies now believe North Korea can do this. The remaining challenge for the North is manufacturing a warhead that can survive the heat of re-entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere from space. However, North Korea\u2019s complete dedication to its nuclear programme, combined with the accelerating progress of recent months, means that this final hurdle is likely to be cleared shortly. Mr Trump believes that the previous US policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d failed because it permitted the development of the North\u2019s missiles and warheads. But there is little indication that his bellicose rhetoric is intimidating North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. Indeed, so far as Kim Jong-un is strengthened by evidence of the US\u2019s threat to the North, it cements him in his position and justifies his own aggression. The danger in the US\u2019s strategy of matching the North\u2019s shrill rhetoric is that the escalating threats lead each to assume the other is moving closer to an attack, until such a confrontation becomes inevitable. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes this risk remains low\u2014a nuclear war would have catastrophic consequences\u2014but that it is rising in proportion to the strengthening of the rhetoric. The positions of two of the three of the main actors are clear. The North will continue to develop its nuclear weapons programme regardless of the US\u2019s threats or any economic pressure generated by tighter international sanctions. China will recalibrate its trade and diplomacy with North Korea in line with UN sanctions, but will avoid instability. The US\u2019s position is the most fluid. A pivot from aggression to containment is likely in the medium term, but the risk of an attack to attempt to damage North Korea\u2019s military capabilities in the short term has risen again.\u201d The 2% jump in British exports to Europe in April-June shows why we need a full trade deal with the EU after Brexit, says the Institute of Directors. The US stock market is expected to fall when it opens in three hours time. New York traders will probably be cautious, following North Korea\u2019s dismissal of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018fire and fury\u2019 threat, as a \u2018load of nonsense\u2019. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down nearly 50 points,. That would drag it below the 22,000 mark, hit for the first time this month. Heightened geopolitical tensions will weigh on shares today, predicts Marketwatch: David Madden of CMC Markets reckons traders are on \u2018red alert\u2019, in case the situation deteriorates further. Madden adds: In tense situation like this, equity markets are move lower exceptionally fast, and investors don\u2019t want to be caught on the wrong side of the markets, so they are getting out now. Traders would require nerves of steel to starting buying into the stock market now, given standoff between the US and North Korea. Damian Green, the UK\u2019s first secretary of state and effectively deputy prime minister, has urged the US government to use United Nation\u2019s processes to resolve the North Korea crisis after President Donald Trump threatened \u201cfire and fury\u201d against the Pyongyang regime. Green was asked by reporters on a visit to Edinburgh whether he thought Trump\u2019s rhetoric was unhelpful or wise given the escalating tensions. He replied: \u201cI think the sensible way for people to proceed now is to work through the UN process: that\u2019s what the British government has been supporting and will continue to support. \u201cWe think that over the past months the North Korean government has not been behaving properly and I hope they respond to pressure from the UN.\u201d Asked what the UK government\u2019s position was on the crisis, he underlined the UK\u2019s preference for a UN-brokered resolution. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously in all our interests to make sure that nothing escalates. We are very strongly in support of the UN process, which has and continues to put pressure on North Korea to stop acting in an irresponsible way and we will continue strongly to support the UN process which will I hope help to deescalate tensions.\u201d Britain\u2019s exports to the EU jumped by 2% in the last three months, but exports to non-EU countries actually fell by 1.4%, according to today\u2019s trade data. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says it shows that certain promises made during the EU referendum are unfulfilled. Cable explains: \u201cAs with the extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS, the export boom dreamed up by the Brexiteers is nowhere to be seen. \u201cThe fall in the pound since the referendum has not given a significant boost to UK exporters, but has instead driven up the cost of imports for both businesses and consumers. \u201cAs any half-decent economist will tell you, countries trade most with their closest neighbours. That is why Europe remains by far the UK\u2019s most important export market. \u201cThis underlines the need to protect UK exporters and control our trade deficit by remaining in the single market and customs union.\u201d The selloff in the financial markets is accelerating, as nervousness over the North Korean situation continues to grip trading floors. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has now slid by 80 points, or 1%, and other indices are all in the red too. European investors are following the lead from Asia overnight, where most markets fell and the South Korean won hit a one-month low. The potential of armed conflict between North Korea and the US is a serious concern for investors. The news that Pyongyang is officially working on a plan to attack Guam has added to concerns, deterring them from holding riskier assets. Instead, they\u2019re looking to hold gold (at a two-month high today), the Japanese yen, and US government bonds. Joshua Mahony of IG says For now, tensions are high, yet in all likeliness we will see this intensity simmer down somewhat, with both sides standing to lose more than they would gain from military action. Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is also disappointed by Britain\u2019s trade data: A fall in exports and rise in imports caused the monthly trade deficit to nearly double. And, a deficit of \u00a38.9bn in the second quarter of 2017 suggests that net trade made no contribution to growth in the quarter. Evidence of rebalancing, at least in the \u2018hard\u2019 data, remains absent.\u201d No sign of Britain\u2019s economy rebalancing here.... Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, fears that Britain\u2019s trade gap will get worse before it gets better. He says: \u201cThe export-driven pickup in manufacturing, hoped for by some, has yet to materialise in the UK, despite survey data from the sector remaining reasonably optimistic. Instead, Manufacturing Production remained flat on the month while the goods trade balance fell further into negatives. \u201cFollowing a large currency shock, the sort we saw in the aftermath of the referendum, adjustments in trade balance typically follow a \u201cJ-Curve\u201d, at first getting worse before they improve. Of course, it\u2019s a long way from economic theory to reality and the length of this adjustment process is highly variable and difficult to predict, but June\u2019s data suggest we\u2019re not quite at the bottom yet, to say the least.\u201d Here\u2019s what a J-Curve looks like, via the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies: More details here, for readers who enjoy an economics lecture. In theory, a weak currency ought to help a country\u2019s exporters and improve its trade figures. But today\u2019s data show that this isn\u2019t really happening in Britain, as it continues to consume more goods and services than it sells to the rest of the world. That\u2019s because modern trade is complex, with many companies buying raw materials or parts from abroad before selling their finished goods overseas. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) explains: \u201cThe sharp deterioration in the UK\u2019s net trade position in June was disappointing, and means the trade deficit in the second quarter of this year came in slightly higher than in the previous quarter. Taken together with the recent jump in the current account deficit, signals the continued weakness of the UK\u2019s external position. The widening in the UK trade deficit in June was largely driven by a sharp rise in imports. \u201cBusinesses continue to report that the slump in the value of sterling since the EU referendum remains something of a double-edged sword, as many exporters are also importers, and so face higher input costs due to the weakening currency. While stronger global economic growth may help to boost the UK\u2019s export performance over the second half of the year, it is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent an overall weakening in growth. This chart, from today\u2019s trade reports, underlines how there\u2019s been no real improvement in Britain\u2019s trade gap since the Brexit vote: Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, warns there are \u201cscant signs\u201d in today\u2019s data that net trade could give Britain\u2019s economy a growth burst. Ben Wright of the Daily Telegraph agrees that the goods trade figures are bad: The ONS has also reported that UK manufacturing output was flat in June, meeting City forecasts. However, the wider measure of industrial production jumped by 0.5% in the month - beating expectations. Economist Rupert Seggins reminds us that Britain hasn\u2019t achieved a trade surplus in almost 20 years..... Britain\u2019s worsening trade gap was driven a 4.9% slump in the volume of goods exported in June. That\u2019s the worst performance since June 2016, the month of the Brexit referendum. Newsflash! Britain\u2019s trade deficit WIDENED by \u00a32bn in June, dashing hopes that the gap between imports and exports might have narrowed. The UK\u2019s total trade deficit in goods and services hit \u00a34.6bn in June, up from a (downwardly revised) \u00a32.5bn in May. That\u2019s the widest deficit in nine months. The Office for National Statistics blames a surge of imports during June. It says: This was mainly due to an increase in imports of both goods and services of \u00a31.7 billion. Of this, imports of goods contributed \u00a30.6 billion, with imports in machinery and transport equipment (specifically mechanical machinery, aircraft and road vehicles) from EU countries up by \u00a30.5 billion. The goods deficit swelled to \u00a312.7bn, the ONS adds, a worse reading than expected. More to follow The pound has fallen back through the $1.30 mark this morning, to a three-week low of $1.2952. That\u2019s partly because the dollar is strengthening, as investors look for safe havens. The news that North Korea was formulating an attack on Guam sent shares down across Asia. Sam Chi Yung of South China Financial Holdings said: \u201cThe North Korea situation is still unstable and investors are controlling risk and taking profit after recent gains.\u201d One of Donald Trump\u2019s assistants, Sebastian Gorka, spoke about the situation on Radio 4 today: \u201cDonald Trump has been unequivocal: he will use any appropriate measures to protect the United States and her citizens. We do not telegraph our future scenarios and how we are going to react,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you show players around a table your poker hand, you will lose that game. It is not a good idea in cards, it is a very bad idea in geopolitics.\u201d European stock markets have also added to yesterday\u2019s losses in early trading. The French, German and UK markets are all in the red in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 tumbled by 40 points to a one-week low. Mining shares are leading the fallers, reflecting concerns that the North Korea crisis could hurt the economy and dent demand for commodities. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE suffered another sharp fall at the open, as the latest developments in the US/North Korea situation weighed on its commodity stocks..... It appears that Pyongyang\u2019s detailed strike plan against Guam has created a sour backdrop to trading. (The FTSE 100\u2019s decline is also partly because some major companies have gone \u2018ex-dividend\u2019, meaning new shareholders won\u2019t get the next divi payment). The growing tensions between North Korea and the United States are continuing to weigh on the financial markets today. The gold price has hit a two-month high this morning, at $1,280.5 per ounce, as investors remain jittery following Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018fire and fury\u2019 threat earlier this week. Overnight, North Korea raised the stakes further by outlining a plan to fire a missile into the water near Guam, the US territory in the Pacific. General Kim Rak Gyom, the head of the country\u2019s strategic forces, declared that Trump was \u201cbereft of reason\u201d, in a statement that could rile the US president. My colleague Julian Borger reports: The response from Pyongyang was its most public and detailed threat to date, and evidently meant to goad the US president. Trump had \u201clet out a load of nonsense about \u2018fire and fury\u2019 failing to grasp the ongoing grave situation. This is extremely getting on the nerves of the infuriated Hwasong artillerymen of the KPA.\u201d This is causing understandable concern over the border in South Korea. South Korea\u2019s Kospi stock market index has fallen by 0.4% today, adding to the 1% wiped off shares on Wednesday. The South Korean Won is also suffering, falling by 0.8% to a four-week low against the US dollar. Although the City isn\u2019t panicking, it is certainly watching the situation closely. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says investors are either sitting on the side-lines or looking to sell risky assets and buy safer ones. The escalation of the rhetoric between the US and North Korea is keeping market participants on their toes and with no fresh economic reports the price action is dictated by the headlines. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover whether the weak pound is helping Britain\u2019s factories, and making a dent in her trade deficit. The City is bracing for new UK trade figures at 9.30am; economists predict that the total gap between everything the UK imports and exports narrowed slightly in June, after jumping to \u00a33.1bn in May. HSBC say: Trade volume growth appears to be moving in the right direction, with exports up 3.8% 3m/3m in May 2017, and imports growing more slowly at 2.8%. And the surveys back up anecdotal evidence that UK exports are responding to sterling weakness. However, so far, this has done little to reduce the trade deficit in absolute terms. We expect another relatively hefty deficit in June. New industrial production figures are also being released, and may show that manufacturing output was flat in June, month-on-month. A strong reading might raise hopes that Britain\u2019s growth rate in the second quarter of 2017 could be revised up, from the first estimate of 0.3%. On the corporate front, mining giant Glencore, the Co-operative Bank, estate agent Savills and sofa chain DFS are all reporting results.

US intelligence agencies now believe North Korea can do this. The remaining challenge for the North is manufacturing a warhead that can survive the heat of re-entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere from space. However, North Korea\u2019s complete dedication to its nuclear programme, combined with the accelerating progress of recent months, means that this final hurdle is likely to be cleared shortly.</p> <p> Mr Trump believes that the previous US policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d failed because it permitted the development of the North\u2019s missiles and warheads. But there is little indication that his bellicose rhetoric is intimidating North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. Indeed, so far as Kim Jong-un is strengthened by evidence of the US\u2019s threat to the North, it cements him in his position and justifies his own aggression.</p> <p> The danger in the US\u2019s strategy of matching the North\u2019s shrill rhetoric is that the escalating threats lead each to assume the other is moving closer to an attack, until such a confrontation becomes inevitable. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes this risk remains low\u2014a nuclear war would have catastrophic consequences\u2014but that it is rising in proportion to the strengthening of the rhetoric. The positions of two of the three of the main actors are clear. The North will continue to develop its nuclear weapons programme regardless of the US\u2019s threats or any economic pressure generated by tighter international sanctions. China will recalibrate its trade and diplomacy with North Korea in line with UN sanctions, but will avoid instability. The US\u2019s position is the most fluid. A pivot from aggression to containment is likely in the medium term, but the risk of an attack to attempt to damage North Korea\u2019s military capabilities in the short term has risen again.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-598c463ce4b0cd59a34da341\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-10T11:44:32.211Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/10/markets-north-korea-tensions-uk-trade-gap-factory-production-business-live?page=with:block-598c30f0e4b0cd59a34da2de#block-598c30f0e4b0cd59a34da2de\">The 2% jump in British exports to Europe in April-June</a> shows why we need a full trade deal with the EU after Brexit, says the Institute of Directors.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/895597004172271616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nice analysis of UK trade figures from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllieRenison\">@AllieRenison</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sdkBkWbYHp\">pic.twitter.com/sdkBkWbYHp</a></p>&mdash; Andy Bruce (@BruceReuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/895597004172271616\">August 10, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-10T12:18:50.189Z\">at 1.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-598c3837e4b0e6bf8f5907dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-10T10:50:37.750Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US stock market is expected to fall when it opens in three hours time.</strong></p> <p>New York traders will probably be cautious, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/10/north-korea-details-guam-strike-trump-load-of-nonsense\">North Korea\u2019s dismissal of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018fire and fury\u2019 threat, as a \u2018load of nonsense\u2019</a>. </p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down nearly 50 points,.

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank lost 25,000 current account customers in the first half of the year amid uncertainty created by its race to raise \u00a3700m to bolster its capital position. Even so, the chief executive thanked customers for their loyalty as the bank reported a narrowing in its first-half losses to \u00a3135m, from \u00a3177m. Liam Coleman added that there had been uncertainty about the bank \u201cand regrettably this is reflected in some customers deciding to move their accounts\u201d. He said this was 2% of its current account customers and that the outflows had moderated during May and June. In total, deposits, from which the bank generates most of its funding, fell by \u00a31.5bn from the end of December to \u00a320.9bn. The bank has sought a long-term solution over its future since 2013 when its financial weakness was exposed, and it was mired in scandal after its former chair Paul Flowers was convicted for drug offences. It has amassed more than \u00a32.6bn of losses since its problems were uncovered and will only say it hopes to achieve profitability in the medium term. After a series of rescue funds injected by hedge funds, the bank\u2019s former owner, the Co-operative Group of grocers and funeral homes, is on course for its stake to drop to 1%. \u201cFollowing a period of uncertainty around the future of the bank, I\u2019d like to express my thanks to our customers for their loyalty and our colleagues, regulators and wider stakeholders for the support they have shown,\u201d Coleman said. The figures included a \u00a39.2m provision for the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. The results benefited from a \u00a312.7m fall in costs as 897 staff left, taking the workforce to 3,313, with further job cuts likely as it attempts to stem its losses. Co-operative Bank has 95 branches after closing 10 this year. The bank hopes its ethical policies, which have been in place for 25 years, will continue to attract and keep customers despite the changes to its ownership structure. There have been concerns that the Co-operative Bank will not be able to continue using its name because of a reliance on hedge funds for its financing, but Coleman said the name was \u201cbased on how we operate and not our ownership\u201d. \u201cThis is a great bank,\u201d he added, describing its performance as resilient. He hopes to attract current account customers by offering a donation to homelessness charity Centrepoint. About 6% of current account customers left after the 2013 debacle, but numbers rose between 2014 and 2016, before slipping in the first half of this year. The bank acknowledged it had been facing a \u201cheightened degree of regulatory supervision\u201d from the Bank of England since its near collapse in 2013 and was raising fresh capital to meet longer-term UK bank regulatory requirements. The \u00a3700m is being raised in a complex restructuring after its attempts to find a buyer failed. There are two parts to the deal. The hedge funds are putting up to \u00a3250m of new funds into the bank and \u00a3433m of bonds need to be converted to shares. Retail investors who own bonds will take losses of at least 55% and be offered cash rather than shares. Five hedge funds \u2013 Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital, Blue Mountain and Cyrus Capital \u2013 have led the discussions with the bank over its future. The fundraising is expected to be completed next month. Coleman aims to attract new customers, including small businesses. Four years ago, the bank had ambitions to expand but had to abandon an attempt to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. \u201cWe believe the recapitalisation will enable the bank to move forward with confidence. We will be investing in the brand and renewing marketing efforts,\u201d he said. Co-operative Bank also relies on the backing of the regulatory division of Bank of England for its strategy. In the pages of risk disclosures and legal warnings in its interim report, it points out: \u201cDeficiencies against regulatory requirements and expectations have existed for some time and will continue for some years to come while the bank implements its strategy. \u201cThe successful implementation of the bank\u2019s strategy depends on the [regulatory] authorities not taking enforcement action against the bank regarding any continuing and intervening deficiencies to required regulatory standards.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade position with the rest of the world worsened in June as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote failed to lift sales of UK-made goods abroad. The trade in goods deficit widened unexpectedly to \u00a312.7bn, from \u00a311.3bn in May, as exports fell by 2.8% but imports rose by 1.6% according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the biggest deficit in nine months and much wider than economists\u2019 forecasts of \u00a311bn. The figures are the latest sign that a weak pound is failing to boost exports, despite making British goods cheaper abroad. The pound is 13% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the EU referendum, at $1.2988. It is down 15% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1052. Weaker exports in June were driven by a 7.9% fall to countries outside the EU, while goods exported to EU member states rose by 2.7%. \u201cThe UK is becoming more and not less dependent on the European Union, whatever the result of the referendum last year,\u201d said Edward Hardy, an economist at World First. \u201cThe numbers are a firm signal that the continent is still the place to be for selling overseas and making the most of the weaker pound.\u201d But he said UK corporations were still not seizing the opportunity, with the weaker exchange rate yet to feed through to higher exports, as well as being countered by a booming import trade. The broader deficit in goods and services \u2013 which includes imports and exports of services such as banking and legal advice \u2013 increased by \u00a32bn in June to \u00a34.6bn, as imports rose by 3.3% but exports fell by 0.7%. In the second quarter overall, the goods and services deficit widened slightly by \u00a3100m to \u00a38.9bn, as increases in exports were closely matched by increases in imports. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the trade figures were disappointing and businesses needed more support from the government. He said: \u201cAs the Brexit negotiations unfold, safeguarding the favourable terms of trade that UK firms currently enjoy with partners and markets in Europe and beyond must be a key priority. More must also be done to provide greater practical and frontline assistance to UK businesses looking to trade in both current and new markets.\u201d Separate figures on production and construction from the ONS confirmed the UK growth was sluggish in the second quarter, when the economy grew by 0.3%. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the pace of economic growth slowed to 0.2% in the three months ending in July. Amit Kara, the head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the thinktank, said: \u201cWe see a modest recovery in the second half of this year in response to strengthening global growth and a weaker currency but, on the flipside, consumer spending is likely to be weighed down by weak wage growth and investment spending held back by Brexit-related uncertainty.\u201d The ONS figures showed UK manufacturing failed to grow in June, with output flat over the month following a 0.1% fall in May. The broader measure of industrial production, which includes mining and utilities as well as manufacturing, rose 0.5%, beating economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.1% increase. In the second quarter overall, industrial production fell by 0.4% compared with the first quarter. It was dragged down by a 0.6% fall in manufacturing, in part because of a sharp fall in car production. Construction output fell by 1.3% between April and June, after growth of 1.1% in the first three months of the year.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Dame Helen Alexander obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was not only being a woman that made Helen Alexander different from her predecessors when she was appointed president of the CBI, the British employers\u2019 organisation, for two years from 2009. She was also relatively young for the role, and hers was a calm, even self-effacing, personality \u2013 a quality not always associated with CBI presidents. And, unlike the others, she was not a big company person, having made her name as chief executive of the Economist, the weekly magazine-format newspaper, during its period of rapid global expansion between 1997 and 2008. All this helped to make Helen, who has died aged 60 of cancer, the ideal CBI leader at a time when the economy was in deep trouble and trust in business was rapidly collapsing. She was a good listener, and a great networker, and she was unflappable even though there was plenty to flap about. There was not an ounce of pomposity in her, she carried no political baggage, and by no stretch of the imagination could she be dismissed as a fat cat. Traditionalists wondered how someone from such a different background would go down with the business grandees who sat on the CBI president\u2019s committee and were accustomed to seeing one of their peers chairing their meetings. But this turned out to be a non-issue. She quickly won over the chairs of the FTSE 100, and the membership followed suit. She was fascinated by what made businesses work, and loved visiting them all over the UK. Her set piece speeches were thoughtful and clear rather than hectoring \u2013 and most of the politicians listened. What was needed at this time of financial crisis was a leadership style that was collegiate, reflective and, when necessary, decisive \u2013 one that was firmly built on solid personal values. That was exactly what Helen provided. Reporting to her as director general, I knew that here was someone who could absolutely be trusted both to be supportive when the wheels were wobbling, and straight with her guidance if things were seriously going off track. At one level, she was a product of the establishment, a graduate of the prestigious St Paul\u2019s girls\u2019 school, west London, and Hertford College, Oxford, where she gained a geography degree (1978). But there was much more to her than that. To broaden her international experience, she took an MBA at the Insead graduate business school in Fontainebleau, France (1984), and she was always proud of her forebears. Her father, Bernard Alexander, was a British lawyer who worked for the UNHCR in Geneva, where Helen was born; her mother, Tania (nee Beckendorff) was a Russian emigre born in St Petersburg. Her Russian grandmother, Moura, had been a glamorous figure, the lover of Maxim Gorky and later of HG Wells \u2013 again, not the kind of background usually associated with CBI presidents. She started out with the publishers Gerald Duckworth (1978-79) and Faber &amp; Faber (1979-83) before joining the Economist Group as a marketing manager in 1985. Discreet, well connected, and with an eye for detail, she went on to be someone whom business people and others wanted on their boards, and she served on plenty, including at different times British Telecom, Centrica, Rolls-Royce and the Tate. She chaired the Franco-British Colloque, an annual talkfest of the great and the good, the Port of London Authority, Incisive Media and the UBM events business, a position she held until her death. She was from 2011 chancellor of Southampton University, where she was a striking figure at its graduation ceremonies and particularly engaged with the connection between research and industry. Through her illness, she remained active and forward-looking. Her views on the benefits of diversity in business were expressed most clearly last November in the independent but government-backed Hampton-Alexander Review. This focused on the need to get more women involved in senior positions in British business, and not just at board level. The argument was based on economics more than on fairness: bridging the UK gender gap in work by 2025 had the potential to add 5 to 8% to GDP on top of business-as-usual forecasts, the review claimed. That is what you would get from drawing on the UK\u2019s entire talent pool more completely, and creating many more female employees. Helen was appointed DBE in 2011, and a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur in 2015. She did not set out to be a role model, but that is what she became \u2013 and not just for women. Business leadership, she demonstrated, did not have to come at the expense of family life. It was always clear \u2013 not in an obtrusive or clumsy way, but never leaving any room for doubt \u2013 where her priorities lay: with her husband, the media executive Tim Suter, and their children, Nina, Gregory and Leo, all of whom survive her. The family played together, visiting all the Olympic Games from Athens onwards, and made big decisions together, including those arising during Helen\u2019s illness. It was on these solid foundations that her successes were built. Richard Lambert Fiammetta Rocco writes: Helen Alexander brought many talents to the Economist Group, but it was easy for outsiders, when faced with her charm, her inclusive nature and her passion for team-building, to overlook the strategic thinker behind the smile. When appointed chief executive in 1997, she took over a newspaper on the rise, but her early years were marked by having to manage the fallout from the troubled acquisition of the Journal of Commerce, a bi-weekly US periodical covering shipping and global trade that faltered badly when print media began the move over to the internet, with a knock-on effect on the Economist\u2019s finances. Her tenure also covered 9/11 and its aftermath and the Iraq war, which was accompanied by a crash in print advertising. Helen\u2019s previous experience as the Economist\u2019s circulation director helped counteract the drop in ad revenue. When she was first put in charge of it in 1987, the weekly circulation was well under 400,000. She pursued an expansionist strategy that was determined and persistent but never headstrong, ensuring that circulation profitability kept the ship steady when advertising slumped. In 2004 the Economist\u2019s circulation broke through 1m for the first time; by the time she stepped down in 2008 it was selling nearly 1.4m copies a week. Global political turmoil has since continued to help boost circulation, and Helen\u2019s careful management of the balance between print and online media has also proved farsighted. As a previous managing director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, she was quicker than many other senior managers in the Economist Group to recognise the importance of digitisation, while insisting at the same time that such investment be strategic and accompanied by a careful oversight of costs. She was, above all, a great delegator. Unlike her predecessors, she appointed a publisher, David Hanger, to run the Economist newspaper business while she oversaw the whole group. She trusted her team. As one editor put it: \u201cPeople always felt they worked with Helen, not for her.\u201d \u2022 Helen Anne Alexander, business executive, born 10 February 1957; died 5 August 2017",

      "body": "<p>It was not only being a woman that made Helen Alexander different from her predecessors when she was appointed president of <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the CBI</a>, the British employers\u2019 organisation, for two years from 2009. She was also relatively young for the role, and hers was a calm, even self-effacing, personality \u2013 a quality not always associated with CBI presidents. And, unlike the others, she was not a big company person, having made her name as chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/\" title=\"\">the Economist, the weekly magazine-format newspaper</a>, during its period of rapid global expansion between 1997 and 2008.</p> <p>All this helped to make Helen, who has died aged 60 of cancer, the ideal CBI leader at a time when the economy was in deep trouble and trust in business was rapidly collapsing. She was a good listener, and a great networker, and she was unflappable even though there was plenty to flap about. There was not an ounce of pomposity in her, she carried no political baggage, and by no stretch of the imagination could she be dismissed as a fat cat.</p> <p>Traditionalists wondered how someone from such a different background would go down with the business grandees who sat on <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/about/how-we-work/\" title=\"\">the CBI president\u2019s committee</a> and were accustomed to seeing one of their peers chairing their meetings. But this turned out to be a non-issue. She quickly won over the chairs of the FTSE 100, and the membership followed suit. She was fascinated by what made businesses work, and loved visiting them all over the UK. Her set piece speeches were thoughtful and clear rather than hectoring \u2013 and most of the politicians listened.</p> <p>What was needed at this time of financial crisis was a leadership style that was collegiate, reflective and, when necessary, decisive \u2013 one that was firmly built on solid personal values. That was exactly what Helen provided. Reporting to her as director general, I knew that here was someone who could absolutely be trusted both to be supportive when the wheels were wobbling, and straight with her guidance if things were seriously going off track.</p> <p>At one level, she was a product of the establishment, a graduate of the prestigious St Paul\u2019s girls\u2019 school, west London, and Hertford College, Oxford, where she gained a geography degree (1978). But there was much more to her than that.</p> <p>To broaden her international experience, she took an MBA at the Insead graduate business school in Fontainebleau, France (1984), and she was always proud of her forebears. Her father, Bernard Alexander, was a British lawyer who worked for the UNHCR in Geneva, where Helen was born; <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1479087/Tania-Alexander.html\" title=\"\">her mother, Tania (nee Beckendorff)</a> was a Russian emigre born in St Petersburg. Her Russian grandmother, Moura, had been a glamorous figure, the lover of Maxim Gorky and later of HG Wells \u2013 again, not the kind of background usually associated with CBI presidents.</p> <p>She started out with the publishers Gerald Duckworth (1978-79) and Faber &amp; Faber (1979-83) before joining the Economist Group as a marketing manager in 1985. Discreet, well connected, and with an eye for detail, she went on to be someone whom business people and others wanted on their boards, and she served on plenty, including at different times British Telecom, Centrica, Rolls-Royce and the Tate.</p> <p>She chaired <a href=\"http://powerbase.info/index.php/Franco-British_Colloque\" title=\"\">the Franco-British Colloque</a>, an annual talkfest of the great and the good, the Port of London Authority, Incisive Media and the UBM events business, a position she held until her death. She was from 2011 chancellor of Southampton University, where she was a striking figure at its graduation ceremonies and particularly engaged with the connection between research and industry. Through her illness, she remained active and forward-looking.</p> <p>Her views on the benefits of diversity in business were expressed most clearly last November in the independent but government-backed <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ftse-women-leaders-hampton-alexander-review\" title=\"\">Hampton-Alexander Review</a>.

      "bodyText": "EU finance ministers will discuss how to force home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb to pay their fair share of taxes and in the right tax domains next month after the French minister for the economy described the current situation as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The European commission announced on Thursday that a joint proposal from France and Germany would be discussed at a meeting in Tallinn, Estonia, on 16 September. Brussels will also advise on how best to deal with the so-called sharing economy, in which Airbnb is a major player. It was revealed this week that Airbnb paid less than \u20ac100,000 (\u00a390,336) in French taxes last year, despite the country being the room-booking firm\u2019s second-biggest market after the US. In response, the French economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, informed the national assembly that the EU\u2019s Franco-German axis would be proposing a pan-European clampdown. \u201cThese digital platforms make tens of millions of sales and the French treasury gets a few tens of thousands,\u201d the minister said, adding that the current setup was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Le Maire further claimed in parliament that an ongoing consultation being led by the commission and the OECD to address the tax question were \u201ctaking too much time, it\u2019s all too complicated\u201d. Many digital platforms operating in the EU have a base in Ireland, including Airbnb, where they can exploit a low corporation tax regime. Le Maire said: \u201cEverybody has to pay a fair contribution.\u201d In Brussels, a commission spokeswoman, Vanessa Mock, told reporters that the issue was sensitive as any reforms needed agreement from all member states. \u201cTax is complicated and it is a unanimity issue and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t necessarily race into a new area like this without reflecting on the best approach to taxing a digitalised economy ... It\u2019s essential we maintain a level playing field,\u201d she said. Mock added that developments in the field of the sharing economy would be looked at \u201cvery closely\u201d and that Brussels would bring its own ideas to the table. Airbnb insists that it does not make \u201cimportant, long-term business decisions on the basis of taxation\u201d and that it follows rules and pays all the tax it owes in the places it does business. The platform, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, contends that the overwhelming amount of money generated by Airbnb stays with hosts and their communities. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe follow the rules and pay all the tax we owe in the places we do business. Our France office provides marketing services and pays all applicable taxes, including VAT. The Airbnb model is unique and boosted the French economy by \u20ac6.5bn last year alone. It empowers regular people, boosts local communities and is subject to local tax. It also makes Airbnb fundamentally different to companies that take large sums of money out of the places they do business.\u201d However, the company has endured a difficult summer in the face of growing antipathy towards its business model in popular tourist destinations across Europe, in particular Spain, for causing an influx of holidaymakers at certain locations and making it more difficult for traditional hotels. Paris city council has already voted to make it mandatory from 1 December to obtain a registration number from the town hall before posting an advertisement for a short-term rental on its website. The ruling potentially makes it harder for property owners using Airbnb to exceed the 120 days a year legal rental limit for a main residence, and easier for the authorities to collect local taxes. In Barcelona, where tensions have been rising for years over the surge in visitors, the impact of sites such as Airbnb on the local housing market has led to anti-tourist protests. In Mallorca and San Sebasti\u00e1n, an anti-tourism march is being planned for 17 August to coincide with Semana Grande, a major festival of Basque culture. In Ibiza, the authorities are placing a cap on the number of beds for tourists. Owners will also be banned from renting their homes, or rooms within them, via websites such as Airbnb and Homeaway unless they obtain a licence. Owners face fines of up to \u20ac400,000 if they break the law. The websites face the same fine for letting people advertise without a valid licence number.",

    "webTitle": "No more conflicts of interest? Bank of England to name troubleshooter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is to task a senior executive with monitoring conflicts of interest among staff to avoid a rerun of the circumstances that led to the resignation of Charlotte Hogg as deputy governor. The newly created role of conflicts officer will report to both the governor, Mark Carney, and Anthony Habgood, the chair of the court which oversees the Bank. The post was announced following a report by Threadneedle Street\u2019s non-executive directors commissioned after Hogg\u2019s departure in March. The report also recommends that the Bank\u2019s head of compliance role be turned into a more senior position and that a system be put in place to capture and review data on relationships and conflicts. Hogg resigned after the Treasury select committee of MPs published a highly critical report, prompted by her failure to disclose that her brother works for Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank. A scion of one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile political families, Hogg had initially insisted that officials at Threadneedle Street knew Quintin Hogg worked at Barclays before admitting she had not disclosed the role, in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct she had helped to write. The report by the non-executives said her case provided lessons for the Bank, including stronger checks before appointments and greater clarity about who takes decisions about conflicts. \u201cIndividuals are responsible for full, timely and accurate disclosures of relevant personal information, including making appropriate disclosures in the context of specific decisions. But it should be for others within the Bank to decide whether individual disclosures could represent a conflict, and how conflicts should be handled. This is particularly important for situations that could be perceived as conflicts, as individuals are typically not best placed to judge how their personal circumstances may be reasonably viewed by others,\u201d the report said. Before Hogg resigned, there was no requirement for any conflicts to be considered during the recruitment process or by the panel interviewing senior executives. The report sets out the procedures on conflicts adopted when Hogg first joined the Bank in 2013 in the new role of chief operating officer. The usual processes were not followed and there was only a informal exchange of emails with the then chair of the court. \u201cA more structured approach may have resulted in Ms Hogg\u2019s brother\u2019s role being registered at the outset,\u201d the report said. The Treasury select committee had previously said she missed three opportunities to disclose her brother\u2019s role and did not disclose his position in strategy at Barclays in her application for deputy governor in December 2016. She only did so when she was preparing to appear at the select committee in late February in a pre-appointment hearing for her new role as deputy governor for markets and banking. Hogg was once regarded as a potential successor to Carney. Her parents had leading roles in Sir John Major\u2019s government and her grandfather Quintin Hogg, better known as Lord Hailsham, was a prominent Tory. Her former roles as chief operating officer and deputy governor have now been split, with Sir David Ramsden, the Treasury\u2019s chief economic adviser, named deputy governor and Joanna Place, who was previously the human resources director, becoming chief operating officer. Nicky Morgan, the new chair of the Treasury select committee, said she expected Ramsden to be called to an appointment hearing by the MPs. \u201cI expect that the committee will want to hear from the court of directors to discuss the lessons that have been learned, and how they intend to implement the review\u2019s recommendation,\u201d she added. The Bank also includes detail of how other conflicts of interest are handled. The Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, a non-executive director of court, recuses himself from discussions on the Co-operative Bank because of his position on the board of Unity Trust Bank, in which Co-op used to have a 26% stake. John Stewart, a former non-executive of the court, recused himself from meetings in 2014 and 2015 in relation to Legal and General, the insurer which he chaired at the time. Carney said the recommendations in the review would be adopted by the Bank. \u201cIn addition to ensuring that we meet best practice, addressing the review\u2019s recommendations will give everyone who works at the Bank greater clarity on what is expected, and will help reassure all of those to whom we are accountable that we have an effective and robust approach to conflicts management,\u201d he said.",

The post was announced following a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Documents/ieo/nedreview0817.pdf\">report by Threadneedle Street\u2019s non-executive directors</a> commissioned after Hogg\u2019s departure in March.</p> <p>The report also recommends that the Bank\u2019s head of compliance role be turned into a more senior position and that a system be put in place to capture and review data on relationships and conflicts.</p> <p> Hogg resigned after the Treasury select committee of MPs published a highly critical report, prompted by her failure to disclose that her brother works for Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/10/charlotte-hogg-a-family-tree-deeply-rooted-in-the-british-establishment\">scion of one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile political families,</a> Hogg had initially insisted that officials at Threadneedle Street knew Quintin Hogg worked at Barclays before admitting she had not disclosed the role, in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct she had helped to write.</p> <p>The report by the non-executives said her case provided lessons for the Bank, including stronger checks before appointments and greater clarity about who takes decisions about conflicts.</p> <p>\u201cIndividuals are responsible for full, timely and accurate disclosures of relevant personal information, including making appropriate disclosures in the context of specific decisions. But it should be for others within the Bank to decide whether individual disclosures could represent a conflict, and how conflicts should be handled. This is particularly important for situations that could be perceived as conflicts, as individuals are typically not best placed to judge how their personal circumstances may be reasonably viewed by others,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Before Hogg resigned, there was no requirement for any conflicts to be considered during the recruitment process or by the panel interviewing senior executives. </p> <p>The report sets out the procedures on conflicts adopted when Hogg first joined the Bank in 2013 in the new role of chief operating officer. The usual processes were not followed and there was only a informal exchange of emails with the then chair of the court. \u201cA more structured approach may have resulted in Ms Hogg\u2019s brother\u2019s role being registered at the outset,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The Treasury select committee had previously said she missed three opportunities to disclose her brother\u2019s role and did not disclose his position in strategy at Barclays in her application for deputy governor in December 2016.

      "bodyText": "Armed police have been called to Heathrow airport after passengers became angry that a British Airways flight was delayed for two days. People were left stranded when technical problems grounded the Boeing 747 due to fly from Heathrow to Las Vegas on Sunday. They thought they would be on their way the following day but a problem with their baggage meant the rescheduled flight was also held. Cabin crew reportedly informed the cockpit that tensions were mounting and, after a lengthy wait, the passengers were taken off and armed Met police officers were called to meet the plane. Jim Allison, who was on the plane, described the experience as \u201cterrible\u201d, saying he hoped never to have to deal with BA again. \u201cLearn how to take care of customers and actually fly and we will talk,\u201d he tweeted. Allison said he managed to make the journey at the third attempt, but only with the help of a rival airline. Emily Joyce was trying to travel to Vegas for her honeymoon, for which she said she had been saving for three years. She said the two days in limbo had been the \u201cworst ... ever\u201d, but she too had managed to make it at the third attempt. She said BA\u2019s Heathrow staff were \u201cnowhere to be found\u201d and that the firm had \u201ctotally failed us and ruined our honeymoon\u201d. The problems follow a series of IT issues and an industrial dispute that have hit the airline this year. It was reportedly facing a bill of at least \u00a3100m in compensation, additional customer care and lost business as the result of an IT issue in May. More than 1,000 flights were disrupted at Heathrow and Gatwick, with every one grounded on Saturday 27 May and hundreds more cancelled at Heathrow the following day. The airline has also been involved in a long-running pay dispute with its cabin crew, with the Unite union threatening another walkout in the final two weeks of August, including the busy bank holiday. Should that go ahead, cabin crew will have been on strike for the whole of July and August, the union said, accusing BA of making a \u201chalf-hearted offer\u201d in its attempt to alleviate the situation. Unite also said it was pursuing legal action over allegations that BA has imposed sanctions on striking staff. BA said: \u201cWe fully appreciate how frustrating this experience has been, and have apologised to our customers for the long delay to their flight. We provided refreshments, hotel accommodation and help with expenses during the delay, and the flight has now departed.\u201d A spokesperson for Heathrow airport declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The property market has ground to a halt, with activity back to 2011 levels in some parts of the UK, according to the official surveyors\u2019 body, which blamed \u201cpolitical uncertainty\u201d and forecast flat prices and rents for at least the next year. A large majority of surveyors in both London and south-east England are reporting falling prices, though the national picture is balanced by price rises in the West Midlands, the south-west and Northern Ireland. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( Rics) said: \u201cRecord low stock numbers, political uncertainty and the aftermath of tax changes are obstacles hindering the UK housing market, with price growth and sales activity subdued during the month of July.\u201d Its poll of valuers around the UK found \u201cthe softest reading since early 2013\u201d, while south-east England posted \u201cthe weakest reading for this part of the country since 2011\u201d. Homes over \u00a31m are having the most difficulty finding buyers, with many sellers having to accept price cuts. \u201cAt a national level, 68% of contributors identified homes valued over \u00a31m as experiencing the greatest deviation when agreeing final prices.\u201d Mark Everett of the Michael Everett estate agency in Epsom told the survey: \u201cThe market is desperately price-sensitive and too much stock is unrealistically overpriced.\u201d In Ipswich, David Knights of David Brown &amp; Co said: \u201cThe election result and all the talk of Brexit has had a profound effect on the market, and with high stamp duty charges, sales as well as new instructions are now suffering. Add to this the holiday season and the market is not very clever.\u201d In East Grinsted, Phillip Hiatt of Your Move said: \u201cVendors of older stock [are] having to look at price reductions to achieve a sale.\u201d In London, surveyors blame stamp duty, changes in tax on buy-to-let properties and Brexit for a sharp slowdown in the market. Stamp duty on a \u00a31m home in London \u2013 not uncommon in many parts of the capital \u2013 now costs a buyer \u00a343,750, prompting campaigners to call for cuts to the tax. \u201c[George] Osborne\u2019s hike in stamp duty has had a negative effect. Removing interest relief for landlords is causing some to sell, [with] few sales now to investors,\u201d said Allen Fuller estate agents in Putney. Rents are also falling in the capital. Simon Aldous of Savills said: \u201cRents continue to fall slowly. We have seen seven consecutive quarters of marginal falls in rents.\u201d But in other parts of the UK, valuers are reporting buoyant activity. In Liverpool, Derek Coates of Venmore described July as \u201ca strangely busy month considering external factors and the time of year. The investor market has been extremely busy, particularly from out-of-town investors.\u201d The net balance of surveyors reporting price rises fell from +7% to +1% in July, signalling that prices were broadly flat across the country. In London, the net balance reporting price rises was strongly negative, at -48%. Surveyors were also asked by Rics to give their forecast on house prices. \u201cNear-term price expectations continue to signal a flat trend over the coming three months at the headline level. Over the next 12 months, respondents remain more optimistic, with a net balance of +28% anticipating an increase in prices, albeit this was the least positive reading since last July, at the time of the EU referendum results. Again, central London continues to exhibit the most cautious 12-month projections relative to all other parts of the UK.\u201d Rics said it expected rents to rise no more than 2% nationally over the next year. \u201cAlthough tenant demand continued to edge higher, it did so at the slowest quarterly pace going back nearly 20 years. Meanwhile, landlord instructions continued to fall, with 8% of respondents reporting a decline instead of an increase in listings. \u201cThe sustained lack of supply means rents are expected to grow, albeit only modestly in the coming three months.\u201d",

We have seen seven consecutive quarters of marginal falls in rents.\u201d</p> <p>But in other parts of the UK, valuers are reporting buoyant activity. In Liverpool, Derek Coates of Venmore described July as \u201ca strangely busy month considering external factors and the time of year. The investor market has been extremely busy, particularly from out-of-town investors.\u201d</p> <p>The net balance of surveyors reporting price rises fell from +7% to +1% in July, signalling that prices were broadly flat across the country. In London, the net balance reporting price rises was strongly negative, at -48%. <br></p> <p>Surveyors were also asked by Rics to give their forecast on house prices. \u201cNear-term price expectations continue to signal a flat trend over the coming three months at the headline level. Over the next 12 months, respondents remain more optimistic, with a net balance of +28% anticipating an increase in prices, albeit this was the least positive reading since last July, at the time of the EU referendum results. Again, central London continues to exhibit the most cautious 12-month projections relative to all other parts of the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Rics said it expected rents to rise no more than 2% nationally over the next year. \u201cAlthough tenant demand continued to edge higher, it did so at the slowest quarterly pace going back nearly 20 years. Meanwhile, landlord instructions continued to fall, with 8% of respondents reporting a decline instead of an increase in listings. </p> <p>\u201cThe sustained lack of supply means rents are expected to grow, albeit only modestly in the coming three months.\u201d </p>",
