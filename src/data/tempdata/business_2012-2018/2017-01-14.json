      "bodyText": "The biggest shakeup in the water industry since privatisation nearly 30 years ago will begin in April, with business customers for the first time allowed to shop around beyond their local supplier for the cheapest deal. For years, small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 along with consumers \u2013 have demanded the water industry be deregulated to allow them to choose between suppliers, as they currently do for energy. From 1 April, 1.2m eligible businesses, charities and public sector organisations in England will for the first time be able to switch water supplier, as they already can in Scotland. The move is seen as the precursor to allow households to similarly shop around for a cheaper water supplier. Companies \u2013 particularly retailers \u2013 operating multiple sites around the country are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries, as they will be able to contract a single supplier that will in turn send one bill to cover all locations. Under the existing water supply regime set up when the industry was privatised in 1989, small and medium businesses \u2013 along with domestic consumers \u2013 can only buy water from their local supplier, such as Yorkshire Water, Severn Trent or Thames Water. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said the change could deliver \u00a3200m in benefits to customers and the UK economy. On Thursday, representatives of the water regulator Ofwat will be in London to spell out how in greater detail how the new regime will operate. A new national awareness campaign to show off the benefits of switching supplier will be also be showcased before its launch on 23 January. The initiative has already had a huge impact on the industry. Last summer the UK\u2019s largest supplier, Thames Water, announced it had agreed to sell its book of business customers to Scottish supplier Castle Water. Several other domestic water firms have now set up new separate trading divisions, or joint ventures, that will be selling their services to business-only customers. So far 14 water companies have applied to become licensed retailers, and further applications are pending, according to Ofwat. The industry has a spent the last year preparing for the changes, and private company Market Operator Services Ltd (MOSL) has been set up to create the IT infrastructure to enable switching to happen. Consumer groups will be hoping that it is a success and encourages the government to allow consumers to also switch water suppliers \u2013 as has become the norm in the energy sector. But householders who expect such a move to substantially lower their water bills could be disappointed. Unlike in the energy sector, the regulator still sets out what the private water companies can charge customers, according to a highly complicated set of formulae. In September, Ofwat published figures that suggested the financial benefits from opening the residential market to competition could be worth \u00a32.9bn over 30 years, which amounts to just \u00a38 per customer per year. In a feasibility study sent to ministers, Ofwat said a liberated domesticated water market would allow several new entrants to come into the market. They would buy water in bulk from the existing major suppliers, and sell it on to households. In such a market, companies could go a step further and offer households a super-package of all their utilities, which could include their gas and electricity, and even other services such as telecoms. Cathryn Ross, Ofwat\u2019s chief executive, has argued greater competition would benefit customers by encouraging firms to offer better services, such as allowing them to manage their bills with a mobile phone app. \u201cThe uncomfortable truth is that, when it comes to retail offers, water companies provide an analogue service in a digital age,\u201d she said. Water UK, which represents the water companies, has said extending retail competition to more than 20m households could secure potential benefits, but warned it would also be \u201ca major undertaking and so deserves to be given very careful consideration\u201d. In recent years the provision of water has become increasingly politicised. The average water bill in the UK is \u00a3396 a year; however that masks big regional differences. Customers in the south-west pay more than \u00a3540 a year, while those in the Severn Trent area pay \u00a3333. Many of the UK\u2019s water companies are now owned by private equity or foreign investment funds, which bought the businesses because they provide steady profits. In January 2016 Ofwat was heavily criticised by MPs on the public accounts committee, who blamed the regulator for allowing water bills to rise too much. The committee said that water firms had gained at least \u00a31.2bn over five years to 2015 from bills being higher than necessary.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory and the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union will cast a long shadow over the global elite\u2019s annual gathering in the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week. This year, 3,000 politicians, business leaders, economists, entrepreneurs, charity leaders and celebrities will head to the World Economic Forum (WEF) to discuss the state of the world. As usual there\u2019ll be big speeches, ultra-tight security, and experts in every field under the wintry sun. There\u2019ll also be plenty of champagne and canapes for delegates gathering in expensive hotels to discuss issues such as inequality and the backlash against globalisation. But this year\u2019s WEF won\u2019t be the same. Twelve months of seismic shocks have shaken Davos Man and Woman\u2019s world view, and left them struggling to understand and address the new reality. These seven key themes will dominate this year\u2019s meeting: Trump and the rise of populism The official theme of this year\u2019s forum is \u201cresponsive and responsible leadership\u201d. It\u2019s a timely issue, as Donald Trump heads to the Oval Office. Trump is the living, breathing, tweeting antithesis of the WEF and its belief in \u201cmulti-stakeholder\u201d solutions: the idea that big problems are solved by working together, rather than by isolationism and protectionism. The president-elect\u2019s ability to tap into public anger and disenchantment has shocked Davos into talking of a crisis of western democracy. WEF founder Klaus Schwab wants leaders to respond to populism by sticking to their core values and \u201chonestly explaining the breadth and complexity\u201d of the world\u2019s problems. But he admits that regaining public trust is a daunting task. \u201cThere has to be a recognition that we are in unmapped territory that placed the status quo, and by extension leaders themselves, into question,\u201d he said. Trump won\u2019t be at Davos, but one of his top advisers, financier Anthony Scaramucci, will outline the new administration\u2019s priorities on Tuesday. The Obama era will be represented by outgoing vice-president Joe Biden, who will hold meetings and keep pushing his Cancer Moonshot project. Reform of capitalism Eight years after the financial crisis, Davos recognises that stronger economic growth alone isn\u2019t enough to fix the world\u2019s problems. WEF\u2019s global risks report, released last week, argues that a \u201cgrowing mood of anti-establishment populism\u201d means market capitalism must now be reformed, and several panels will examine how this could happen. One panel will consider the plight of the \u201csqueezed and angry\u201d middle classes, with contributions from International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. Davos will also examine whether it\u2019s time to give all citizens a basic income, to cushion them from the impact of technological change. \u201cMachines, the argument goes, can take the jobs, but should not take the incomes: the job uncertainty that engulfs large swaths of society should be matched by a welfare policy that protects the masses, not only \u2018the poor\u2019,\u201d said World Bank senior economist Ugo Gentilini. \u201cHence, basic income grants emerge as a straightforward option for the digital era \u2013 one seemingly backed by Silicon Valley and trade unions alike.\u201d China Being lectured on the importance of \u201cinclusive globalisation\u201d by a communist leader will be a new experience for Davos delegates. Trump\u2019s election is expected to create a vacuum in global leadership, and Xi Jinping could be the man to fill it. He\u2019ll become the first Chinese president to attend Davos, and will lead an unprecedented 80-strong delegation of business leaders, economists, academics and journalists. Xi will deliver the opening plenary address on Tuesday, and use it to defend cooperation and economic globalisation. He\u2019s expected to warn that countries could face rising confrontation, poverty and war if they descend into protectionism and isolationism. With Trump committed to withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Xi can now push for a Beijing-led trade deal. But he\u2019ll also face pressure from European leaders, who are unhappy about Chinese firms dumping cheap exports, including steel, on their markets. Climate change Environmental issues are as important as ever this year, with campaigners worried that the Trump administration will scrap US commitments to tackling global warming. A group of scientist are setting up an \u201cArctic Basecamp\u201d summit in Davos, to lobby delegates about the dangers of climate change. Temperatures at the top of the world were \u201calarmingly high\u201d last Christmas, they say, with some parts of the Arctic region 20C warmer than usual. Former US vice-president Al Gore is attending, as is Christiana Figueres, who led the UN convention on climate change. They should find a receptive audience: environmental issues dominated the WEF\u2019s annual survey of global risks for 2017 behind the threat of nuclear war. Robotic risks The \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d will once again be a key theme at this year\u2019s Davos, where the focus will be on the problems created by technologies such as smart robots and driverless cars. The WEF will examine whether the loss to these innovations of millions of jobs is undermining social cohesion and contributing to the rise of populist parties. Davos will also consider whether increased use of artificial intelligence and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d are laying firms open to a new wave of cyberthreats and security beaches. This area of technology has until now been only lightly regulated; is the world ready to hand more decision-making powers to machines? Delegates will also ponder the dangers posed by \u201cweaponised\u201d AI systems and smart robots. The WEF warns that autonomous weapons systems could be designed to \u201cswarm\u201d over a nation\u2019s existing military defences, overwhelming them in a massive coordinated attack. \u201cThis risks upsetting the global equilibrium by neutralising the defence systems on which it is founded,\u201d it goes on. \u201cThis would lead to a very unstable international configuration, encouraging escalation and arms races and the replacement of deterrence by pre-emption.\u201d Brexit A year ago, it was hard to find many people at Davos who though that Britain either should, or would, vote to leave the European Union. Like Trump\u2019s victory, the Brexit vote dealt a blow to WEF\u2019s underlying principles \u2013 and fuelled the argument that they don\u2019t really understand today\u2019s world. On Friday, chancellor Phillip Hammond will outline his vision for the UK-EU relationship, and its implications for investment and migration. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley will give his views, amid fears that the City could lose tens of thousands of jobs. London mayor Sadiq Khan is taking his fight against a \u201creckless\u201dBrexit to Davos. He will give a speech to business leaders, and hold talks with other politicians as part of his push for \u201cprivileged access\u201d to the single market. Helping the developing world More than half of the sessions at Davos are on the subject of social inclusion and development, as the WEF tries to live up to its commitment to improve the state of the world. A sprinkling of celebrity stardust among the snow may help get these issue noticed. Musician Shakira will discuss her work establishing schools for underprivileged children in Colombia, and actor Forest Whitaker will outline his foundation\u2019s efforts to foster peace and reconciliation in disadvantaged parts of the world. They\u2019re both collecting awards from the WEF \u2013 along with musician Anne-Sophie Mutter for her support for young musicians. Hollywood star Matt Damon is also back at Davos, to promote his Water.org charity, which seeks to end deaths from unclean drinking water.",

He\u2019ll become the first Chinese president to attend Davos, and will lead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/china-xi-jinping-world-economic-forum-davos-donald-trump\">an unprecedented 80-strong delegation of business leaders, economists, academics and journalists</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a60ca54c85189f619a01b8c49b68688392785db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a60ca54c85189f619a01b8c49b68688392785db/408_258_1401_841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese President  Xi Jinping\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xi Jinping will be the first Chinese president to address the WEF.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Xi will deliver the opening plenary address on Tuesday, and use it to defend cooperation and economic globalisation. He\u2019s expected to warn that countries could face rising confrontation, poverty and war if they descend into protectionism and isolationism.</p> <p>With Trump committed to withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Xi can now push for a Beijing-led trade deal. But he\u2019ll also face pressure from European leaders, who are unhappy about Chinese firms dumping cheap exports, including steel, on their markets.</p> <h2><strong>Climate change</strong></h2> <p>Environmental issues are as important as ever this year, with campaigners worried that the Trump administration will scrap US commitments to tackling global warming. A group of scientist are setting up an \u201cArctic Basecamp\u201d summit in Davos, to lobby delegates about the dangers of climate change. Temperatures at the top of the world were \u201calarmingly high\u201d last Christmas, they say, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/extraordinarily-hot-arctic-temperatures-alarm-scientists\">some parts of the Arctic region 20C warmer than usual</a>.</p> <p>Former US vice-president Al Gore is attending, as is Christiana Figueres, who led the UN convention on climate change. They should find a receptive audience: environmental issues dominated the WEF\u2019s annual survey of global risks for 2017 behind the threat of nuclear war.</p> <h2><strong>Robotic risks</strong></h2> <p>The \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d will once again be a key theme at this year\u2019s Davos, where the focus will be on the problems created by technologies such as smart robots and driverless cars. The WEF will examine whether the loss to these innovations of millions of jobs is undermining social cohesion and contributing to the rise of populist parties.</p> <p>Davos will also consider whether increased use of artificial intelligence and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d are laying firms open to a new wave of cyberthreats and security beaches. This area of technology has until now been only lightly regulated; is the world ready to hand more decision-making powers to machines?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/13/army-of-staff-descends-on-davos-to-serve-wef-super-rich\">Army of staff descends on Davos to serve WEF super-rich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Delegates will also ponder the dangers posed by \u201cweaponised\u201d AI systems and smart robots. The WEF warns that autonomous weapons systems could be designed to \u201cswarm\u201d over a nation\u2019s existing military defences, overwhelming them in a massive coordinated attack.</p> <p>\u201cThis risks upsetting the global equilibrium by neutralising the defence systems on which it is founded,\u201d it goes on. \u201cThis would lead to a very unstable international configuration, encouraging escalation and arms races and the replacement of deterrence by pre-emption.\u201d</p> <h2>Brexit</h2> <p>A year ago, it was hard to find many people at Davos who though that Britain either should, or would, vote to leave the European Union. Like Trump\u2019s victory, the Brexit vote dealt a blow to WEF\u2019s underlying principles \u2013 and fuelled the argument that they don\u2019t really understand today\u2019s world.</p> <p>On Friday, chancellor Phillip Hammond will outline his vision for the UK-EU relationship, and its implications for investment and migration. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley will give his views, amid fears that the City could lose tens of thousands of jobs.</p> <p>London mayor Sadiq Khan is taking his fight against a \u201creckless\u201dBrexit to Davos. He will give a speech to business leaders, and hold talks with other politicians as part of his push for \u201cprivileged access\u201d to the single market.</p> <h2><strong>Helping the developing world</strong></h2> <p>More than half of the sessions at Davos are on the subject of social inclusion and development, as the WEF tries to live up to its commitment to improve the state of the world. A sprinkling of celebrity stardust among the snow may help get these issue noticed.</p> <p>Musician Shakira will discuss her work establishing schools for underprivileged children in Colombia, and actor Forest Whitaker will outline his foundation\u2019s efforts to foster peace and reconciliation in disadvantaged parts of the world. They\u2019re both collecting awards from the WEF \u2013 along with musician Anne-Sophie Mutter for her support for young musicians.</p> <p>Hollywood star Matt Damon is also back at Davos, to promote his Water.org charity, which seeks to end deaths from unclean drinking water.</p>",
