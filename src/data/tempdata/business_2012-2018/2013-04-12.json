      "bodyText": "The big six energy suppliers have been accused of \"cold-blooded profiteering\" after official figures showed they had more than doubled their retail profit margins over the last 18 months and were now earning an average of \u00a395 profit per household on dual-fuel bills. The industry regulator Ofgem, which produced the estimates, said profits per household would reach \u00a3100 over the next 12 months. Other new figures obtained from British Gas, EDF and the four other suppliers showed their profit margin from power generation \u2013 a separate part of the business \u2013 averaged more than 24% in 2011. They are believed to have risen since. The escalating earnings were condemned by fuel poverty campaigners, rival energy companies and the shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint. They have led to further calls for the gas and electricity market to be reformed to break the stranglehold the big six have on supply, and will increase pressure on energy executives who are due to appear before parliament's energy and climate change committee on Tuesday as part of an inquiry under the title \"energy prices, profits and poverty\". Sam Robertson, a campaigner with Fuel Poverty Action, said millions of UK households facing a choice of whether to heat or eat would be left wondering what difference an extra \u00a395 could have made. \"This cold-blooded profiteering has to stop, but piecemeal market reforms will not go far enough, especially given the threat of a dash for gas that will send bills through the roof,\" Robertson said.

That is up from an average bill in 2011 of \u00a31,030 and a profit margin of 3.2%, according to figures provided earlier by the companies but only now published by Ofgem. The 2011 figures \u2013 the first the companies provided under the regulator's drive to bring more transparency to the market \u2013 also revealed the profit margins of the big six on their power generation divisions.

      "bodyText": "Vincent Tchenguiz made \"surreptitious recordings\" in order to spy on ex-Israeli intelligence officers he had drafted in to his Mayfair offices to help fight a string of legal battles, the Guardian has learned.

Tchenguiz has accused them of defrauding him, while they in turn claim that he has breached a contract with them. Both deny the tit-for-tat allegations made against each side.

A spokesman for Tchenguiz said: \"Any hostility was well placed and justified.\" Originally operating out of Tel Aviv, Black Cube was drafted in to play an important role in multiple legal disputes involving Tchenguiz-linked companies, which threatened to engulf the businessman's multi-billion pound investment empire. These disputes emerged in the wake of the 2008 failure of Icelandic bank Kaupthing, from which he and his brother Robert Tchenguiz had borrowed huge sums. At one stage both brothers had been incorrectly suspected of a corrupt relationship with former Kaupthing executives, leading to now notorious raids by the Serious Fraud Office two years ago.

He was also a regular visitor to Mayfair nightclub Annabel's. Tchenguiz insists Black Cube never had an entitlement to 1% of Project Athena. According to its website, Black Cube provides \"creative intelligence\" and claims to specialise in \"untangling complex setbacks and creating unique business opportunities\". Recordings of private conversations between Black Cube staff are understood to have been made in Tchenguiz's offices, which he shared with the intelligence experts until their departure. Tchenguiz is thought to have been advised that the surveillance was lawful, because he believed he had grounds to suspect Black Cube. It is not the first time Tchenguiz has fallen out with figures close to him and accused them of defrauding him.

      "bodyText": "\u2192It is tempting from a UK perspective to regard events in Cyprus as a case of domestic violence within the eurozone that doesn't much affect us. That would be mistake. The serving of \"poison\" to Cyprus, as the country's parliamentary president put it this week, amounts to another statement by Germany that the hard way is the right way. There will be no slackening in the austerity message ahead of September's election, and thus no meaningful debate on how creditors and debtors are going to live in harmony. Minor accidents like Cyprus, it seems, will simply be allowed to happen and eurozone lenders will try to minimise the bill for themselves. Progress on banking union, supposedly last year's big step forward, has been negligible and there's an unfilled hole at the centre. The European stability mechanism (ESM) was intended to deal with insolvent banks, but then it turned out the fund would not deal in \"legacy\" issues. That's not an advance. Thus every bailout remains an ugly scrap in which, as in Cyprus, heroic assumptions are made about recovery and business confidence across the continent is jolted. Is the next crisis Portugal mark 2, or Slovenia? Only then will companies and large depositors discover whether a Cypriot-style savings-grab is the new template. Add up the austerity, the mixed messages and the backtracking and it's no surprise that the IMF expects the euro area GDP to contract 0.2% this year, after contraction of 0.4% last year. For the UK economy euro recession is impossible to ignore. \"Engineering a recovery while our main trading partner is in a downturn is a difficult undertaking,\" said the Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, in January. You bet. The economy is not rebalancing in favour of manufacturing. Britain's trade deficit in goods widened to \u00a39.4bn in February, we learned this week, and factory production is back at levels seen last September. A government desperate for growth \u2013 any growth \u2013 is reduced to trying to pump up the housing market by underwriting sub-prime mortgages. Stagnation and indecision in euroland are infecting not just the economy but economic policy. Hope springs eternal that Germany, after the election, will finally decide how far it is prepared to go to save the single currency. Well, maybe. But it's a reasonable guess that markets, currently understanding of Angela Merkel's political bind, will demand a quick answer. And a post-election mini-revolt in the eurozone debt markets would be no bad thing: the current muddle-through approach is leading nowhere. \u2192BP's pay structure, according to remuneration chief Antony Burgmans, employs a \"relatively simple\" system. Relative to what, he doesn't say, but it's a challenge for ordinary mortals to keep track of the moving parts. The annual cash bonus scheme alone has 13 \"measures and targets\". Then there's the deferred bonus, and the performance share scheme, not forgetting basic salary and pension. Thankfully, somebody is paying attention. He is Guy Jubb of Standard Life Investments, who told the board at this week's shareholder meeting to \"raise its game\". He's right about the complexity, and he's also right when he says the executives have the potential to receive \"significant rewards for achieving unchallenging performance targets\". The giveaway is the table that illustrates what chief executive Bob Dudley should receive in a year in which he achieves merely an \"on target\" performance \u2013 a cool $10m (\u00a36.5m), even if the share price went sideways. How is that possible for a middling performance? It's because long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) have become vastly inflated over the years. Once upon a time, 100% of salary for an LTIP was seen as the largest carrot that could be offered to an executive. These days Dudley can earn 550% of salary under his LTIP. In cash terms, today's \"on target\" performance equates to yesterday's hit-the-ball-out-of-the-park performance. Jubb calculates that by merely coming third out of five in a league table of oil companies ranked by total shareholder return (TSR), BP's chief executive can receive shares equivalent to nearly two-thirds of his $1.7m salary. Third out of five? If BP really believes that's worthy of a \u00a31m bonus it should drop the pretence that Dudley's package is driven by tough performance targets. The company was very pleased that 94% of voting shareholders backed the pay report. The reason for that, one suspects, is that executive payouts from incentive schemes have been depressed by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Now that the effect of the disaster on the share price will drop out of the three-yearly TSR calculations, Dudley's generous rewards for \"on target\" results are much more likely to materialise. Complexity and the redefinition of success are how boardroom pay outstripped shareholders' gains in the past. It's happening again. BP is probably not unique. \u2192HBOS famously ignored a cardinal rule of banking: never take an equity stake in a company to which you are a lender. If you do, you are no longer a bank but a private equity house and there's trouble in store in the event of a restructuring. Some of HBOS's early loan-plus-equity adventures turned out spectacularly well, such as Sir Philip Green's takeover of Arcadia, the Top Shop group, in 2002. But that doesn't deflect from the wisdom of the basic risk-management principle that lenders should not dabble in the shares of a customer. Less remembered is how far HBOS was prepared to go. Ray Perman's lively book \u2013 Hubris: how HBOS wrecked the best bank in Britain \u2013 recalls the detail of Green's attempt (eventually abandoned) to buy Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004. In that case, HBOS would have been a major lender in the \u00a39.5bn offer. But the bank's chairman, Lord Stevenson, was also lined up to be a non-executive director of Green's bid vehicle. It is hard to think of a more glaring example of a conflict of interest. Perman reports that arrangement caused one of the few rows within the HBOS board. It also caused a fuss in the outside world at the time, but should have caused more. It was an early clue that HBOS directors had deluded themselves that traditional rules of banking didn't apply to them.",

Between April 2007 and the end of 2012, the FCA's predecessor rejected one appointment out of every 7,566 applicants for the financial services sector, according to figures first published by Reuters.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/other/approval.pdf\" title=\"\">\"fitness and probity\" test</a> is designed to ensure only the most competent people take up risky roles in finance to prevent a repeat of the banking crisis.</p> <p>A spokesman for the FCA refused to state how the test works or give examples of sample questions, but said it involves criminal record checks and county court judgements on debts.</p> <p>He declined to state whether a criminal conviction would automatically lead to someone failing the test, but the guidelines state \"particular attention\" is paid to \"offences of dishonesty, fraud, financial crime\u2026 [and] money laundering\".</p> <p>The spokesman said the FCA only carries out interviews for people applying for the most senior positions.

      "bodyText": "Just 30 out of 227,000 people have failed the City regulator's \"fit and proper\" test to take on some of the most risky jobs in British banks since the onset of the financial crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the new industry watchdog, said it has blocked just one in every 7,566 person applying to be come an FCA \"approved person\" in the last six years. The FCA, which replaced the Financial Services Authority this month, said the test covered bankers' \"honesty, integrity and reputation\", \"competence and capability\" and \"financial soundness\". Four people failed the test last year, while 24,319 applicants passed. Between April 2007 and the end of 2012, the FCA's predecessor rejected one appointment out of every 7,566 applicants for the financial services sector, according to figures first published by Reuters. The \"fitness and probity\" test is designed to ensure only the most competent people take up risky roles in finance to prevent a repeat of the banking crisis. A spokesman for the FCA refused to state how the test works or give examples of sample questions, but said it involves criminal record checks and county court judgements on debts. He declined to state whether a criminal conviction would automatically lead to someone failing the test, but the guidelines state \"particular attention\" is paid to \"offences of dishonesty, fraud, financial crime\u2026 [and] money laundering\". The spokesman said the FCA only carries out interviews for people applying for the most senior positions. He was unable to say whether applicants' morality and ethics are specifically tested. The regulator said the number of failures is low because it also encourages some applicants, put forward for the test by their employers, to withdraw from the process because they are unlikely to pass. \"In addition to 30 applications for approval being formally refused since 2007, during the same period, more than 7,000 applications were withdrawn after submission \u2013 many of which were after close scrutiny by the FSA,\" the FCA said. However, 97% of applicants were successful, even when the 7,000 withdrawals are included in calculations. Critics of the banking sector argue that it has yet to show the cultural changes that have been called for by the wider public and trumpeted internally by the likes of Barclays. John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, told Reuters: \"We have a cultural problem that has brought banking to its knees and cost the taxpayers a fortune and these people continue as if it's business as usual.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of gold fell to its lowest level in more than 18 months on Friday night amid fears that sales of the precious metal forced on Cyprus by its desperate financial plight would lead to wholesale dumping by hard-pressed countries in the coming months. At the end of a week dominated by the plight of the troubled Mediterranean island, gold slid below $1500 an ounce for the first time since July 2011 in anticipation that Cyprus would seek to raise \u20ac400m (\u00a3340m) by offloading a chunk of its reserves. Share prices also fell on the major European bourses after the gathering of EU finance ministers in Dublin made it clear that there would be no increase to the \u20ac10bn earmarked for Cyprus \u2013 even though the expected cost of the bailout has been raised by \u20ac6bn to \u20ac23bn. A Cyprus government spokesman said the increase would not lead to more money being taken from savers in the country's banks. Although both Portugal and Ireland were granted an additional seven years to pay back their loans as a reward for sticking to their austerity programmes, help for Cyprus will be limited to extra investment from Europe's structural fund. A spokesman for the German government said the contribution to Cyprus's bailout would not change despite the deteriorating financial health of the country, but Angela Merkel's government supported easier terms for Portugal \u2013 which tabled fresh measures to save more than \u20ac1bn from its budget \u2013 and Ireland. Portugal's prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, said tentative cuts had been outlined. \"We have already presented to our partners some possibilities that will require further work next week when the Troika visits Portugal,\" he said. \"We have a [bailout] agreement with our partners and we need to stick to it.\" Most major European stock markets saw falls of more than 1%, with weak economic news from the US adding to the downward pressure on gold. While Cyprus's gold sale in itself is small, heavily indebted eurozone nations such as Italy and Portugal could also find themselves under increasing pressure to put their bullion reserves to work. \"If Cyprus can break the gold market, then [there are] many reasons to be worried, with Slovenia, Hungary, Portugal, Spain and Italy in line,\" Milko Markov, an investment analyst at SK Hart Management, said. \"It is a make-or-break moment for gold \u2026 if the market can't handle the reallocation and Cyprus, then there is really a need for a bear market.\" David Owen, chief European economist at investment bank Jefferies, said: \"As with Greece, we should not be under any illusion that we have seen the last of the Troika warning about Cyprus's debt dynamics. The draft EC report [that suggested another \u20ac6bn from Cyprus] saw as a worst case scenario Cypriot GDP falling by around 15% in the next two years before output stabilises. However, Greek GDP has now fallen for three years since its bailout, to date by around 20%, with forward looking indicators still pointing down.\" Figures released on Friday showed that European industrial production rose by 0.4% in February, but analysts said the outlook remained bleak. David Brown, of New View Economics said: \"Annual growth remains in deep negative territory pulled down by severe recession forces sweeping through the eurozone. ECB hopes that the eurozone economy will pick up later this year are simply wishful thinking while a large part of the eurozone economy is suffering such serious austerity and economic sentiment remains so vulnerable.\"",

      "bodyText": "America's budget wrangling is holding back recovery in the world's largest economy, according to a leaked draft of forecasts from the International Monetary Fund that coincided with data showing a dip in consumer confidence and weaker spending in the nation's shopping malls. Official figures from Washington showed that retail sales in March dipped by 0.4% in March \u2013 worse than Wall Street had been anticipating and the second monthly fall since payroll taxes and income tax rose at the start of 2013. Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said: \"This weakness is possibly linked to increased payroll and income tax hikes which took effect at the start of the year, and will inevitably add to worries that the US economy is slowing as we move into the spring as automatic budget spending cuts come into force. With this in mind, the Fed will be more cautious about sending signals that it is preparing to ease back on policy stimulus.\" Meanwhile, the monthly snapshot of sentiment conducted by Michigan university showed consumer confidence dropped to its lowest in nine months. The downbeat news came as the Bloomberg news agency reported that the International Monetary Fund would trim its growth forecast for the US in next week's half-yearly World Economic Outlook. Bloomberg said a leaked draft of the WEO showed that growth in the world's biggest economy would be 1.7% in 2013, down from 2% in January when the IMF last updated its predictions. The report said automatic cuts as part of the deal between the White House and Congress to tackle America's budget deficit were the reason for the lower forecast for US growth this year. Action by Tokyo to combat inflation has led to the Fund increasing its estimate of Japanese growth in 2013 from 1.2% to 1.5%, but there has been no change in its forecast of a 0.2% contraction in the eurozone economy. The forecasts may be updated before their official release next Tuesday, but the draft leaked to Bloomberg has the global economy expanding by 3.4% in 2013, down from 3.5% in January.",

But it looks slightly more benign than his index-rattling efforts last month, when he said the Cyprus deposit-raid <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/25/cyprus-bailout-dijsselbloem-chaos-markets\">might be a blueprint for all future EU bailouts</a>.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe/jeroen-dijseelbloem-outlook-for-ireland-is-rather-positive-1.1357692\">interview with the Irish Times</a> he says the outlook for Ireland - one of five EU countries to receive a bailout (if you count Spain's banks) - is \"rather positive\". He dances around the notorious \"template\" comments about Cyprus, stressing that \"we have to work towards a different way of working with banking crises in the future.\" But he uses a phrase - bail-in - that is a euphemism for tapping savers' deposits above \u20ac100,000 (and bondholders too). So the issue of deposit raids - Cypriots are facing a bigger wipeout than first thought after events of recent days - won't go away. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a post-crisis situation you need mechanisms to deal with these problems. We are working on those \u2013 in the resolution and recovery directive there will be a way of dealing with a \u2018bail-in\u2019, giving us the instruments to do bailins in a proper way.</p> </blockquote> <p>He goes on to say that deposits above \u20ac100,000 are still fair game.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be a hierarchy and the uninsured depositors will be at the end of the hierarchy...

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has arrived in Berlin and is meeting with his German counterpart, Angela Merkel. Shortly after arriving, Merkel showed Cameron around the grounds of her country mansion posing for pictures and doing lots of statesman-like pointing into the distance. They then headed inside for a fireside chat to sort out all of Europe's problems. And with two of Europe's most powerful leaders settling in for the night, it marks a good point to end today's live coverage of the eurozone crisis. Thank you for all your comments and enjoy the weekend, we'll be back on Monday. As promised, here's the family portrait of the EU ministers at their meeting in Dublin. David Cameron has arrived at Angela Merkel's country retreat and both are posing for photos with their spouses. Meanwhile, to get you in the mood, the Open Europe blog has written a list of 10 things Cameron shouldn't say to Merkel. These include: \"I always thought the ECB should become more activist.\" and \"Can you point me to that no-bailout clause in the EU treaties again?\" Elsewhere, the often amusing Angela Merkel twitter feed has tweeted about David Cameron bringing his family to stay in Germany overnight. (see 12.33pm) Over in Lisbon, the Portuguese government has presented new spending cut plans to the EU after a court rejected its initial \u20ac1.3bn austerity measures for this year. The cuts are required as part of the agreement for its \u20ac78bn bailout. The government will implement new spending cuts worth \u20ac600m at all ministries and bring forward the same amount of reductions envisaged for 2014. In return, eurozone finance ministers will extend Portugal's loan maturity date by seven years. The eurozone finance ministers have finally made it out for their group photo. Will upload a picture shortly. The photographer just shouted \"and one more but look happier!\" Just to add some context, the last time gold fell below $1,500 an ounce was in July 2011 Gold prices are plunging today despite poor US retail figures today and declining consumer confidence, which usually leads to a boost for gold as a save haven. It is now down 3% today to $1,497 an ounce. Silver is also suffering. It won't be much help for Cyprus, who are considering selling its gold reserves to raise funds for its bailout agreement. The eurozone finance minster meetings is Dublin continue, and they must've got really stuck into their discussions because they are now running late for their family photo which was due 15 minutes ago. Latest estimates are that they will be ready in 10 minutes, unless negotiations over where in the lineup each minister stands have reached an impasse. One topic that hasn't been covered in discussions today has been the concern over Slovenia (see below). Staying in Slovenia, the head of the country's largest bank said the government's estimate that around \u20ac1bn is needed to recapitalise the country's three main lenders is correct, despite the OECD questioning it earlier this week. Janko Medja, head of Nova Ljubljanska Banka, said plans to sell a bank, as suggested by the Slovenia PM, won't happen for at least a year. On Tuesday the OECD had said it believed the government may have underestimated the amount needed for recapitalising the banks. In Slovenia, seen as the next eurozone country to fall into trouble, privatisation plans will be put to the country's parliament in two weeks, according to the PM. The plan to sell off state assets, including a bank, is aimed at avoiding a bailout. PM Alenka Bratusek said she would send a stability programme to EU partners by May 9. The country needs to raise \u20ac3bn to cover its budget deficit, recapitalise its state-owned banks and repay maturing debt. Bratusek said We will immediately start processes to privatise one or two companies. My wish is that one of those would be a bank President of the European Council tweets It has just been pointed out by AP that the German man arrested trying to board a plane in Athens with gold in his luggage didn't have half a ton, but just 7kg. A decimal point went astray in the original story. Police found 7.185kg, not 7,185kg. It's not just the weight of the gold that has changed, it's value also fell 3% this week, below $1,530, to its lowest point in almost a year. Dijsselbloem says there will be on pressure put on Cyprus to sell its gold to fund the bailout. He said Selling some gold has always been a option put forward by the Cypriot authorities, but this is a decision to be made independently and it is not any demand from the Troika or Eurogroup. And with that, the press conference has now ended. Draghi confirms that he has told the Cyprus president that he cannot sack the country's bank governor, Panicos Demetriades. He said the independence of the ECB is enshrined in EU law and will not interfere in the running of the bank. Olli Rehn, the Finnish finance minister, says the \u20ac17bn Cyprus bailout was for net financing needs, while the new figure of \u20ac23bn is for gross financing. The \u20ac23bn figure came from a leaked document which an exasperated Rehn said shouldn't be relied on. It's like comparing apples with pears and ending up with oranges. That's what happens when you write stories based on leaked documents. Also asked how Cyprus will return to growth in just two years, he said There is a lot of uncertainty for the exact growth of Cyprus Interesting that the predictions are already being questioned when the loan hasn't even arrived yet. The eurozone finance ministers have issued a joint statement on Cyprus. Here's a slice to whet your palate: The Eurogroup notes with satisfaction that the Cypriot authorities have implemented decisive bank resolution, restructuring and recapitalisation measures to address the fragile and unique situation of Cyprus' financial sector. The Eurogroup commends the authorities for their demonstrated resolve in implementing these important measures in a tight timeframe and reiterates its appreciation for the efforts made by the Cypriot citizens over the last weeks. The ECB head Mario Draghi is at the Dublin press conference but has decided he has \"nothing to add\" to proceedings. Austrian finance minister Maria Fekter says talk of increasing the \u20ac10bn Cyprus loan was not discussed in meetings this morning. He also urges the Troika group of lenders and Greece to accelerate talks. Dijsselbloem says Ireland is a living, breathing example that the adjustment programme works. He adds that ministers would like to extend loans to Ireland and Portugal by another seven years. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, is now taking at the eurozone meeting in Dublin. The conference can be watched here He is currently running through the discussions that have been held, in particular the loan to Cyprus, which could be approved by April 24. An unusual tale from Greece, where a German national has been arrested for trying to board a plane at Athens International Airport with half a ton of gold in his luggage. Officials also found nearly \u20ac300,000 in cash, according to Greek website ekathimerini.com As Mike van Dulken points out David Cameron is on his way to Germany to meet up with Angela Merkel, and this time he's bringing the family. Samantha Cameron and their three children will be coming with him, making it the first official trip they've been on with the prime minister. Since the weekend is approaching, they've been invited to stay with Merkel and her publicity shy husband Joachim Sauer, at her Meseberg residence - the equivalent of Chequers. Official conversation will focus on the Syrian conflict, European reform and the forthcoming G8 summit. Confirming the line of Luxembourg's finance minister earlier, the German government has said the \u20ac10bn IMF loan is non-negotiable. Eurozone finance ministers in Dublin gave political backing for the loan, but German government spokesmen said the amount was \"not up for negotiation\" The international credit programme of about \u20ac10bn is of course very high in relation to the size of the Cypriot economy. Adding to Cyprus's woes on learning the bailout needed has increased to \u20ac23bn, Luxembourg's finance minister, Luc Frieden, told German radio this morning that the IMF's \u20ac10bn contribution cannot be increased. He said I believe the policy will be that the volume will remain at \u20ac10bn. I know that right now [financing needs] are somewhat higher for the period from 2013-2016, but we cannot do any more. Back in Dublin, our correspondent Henry McDonald writes Ireland's finance minister has said he has secured a deal to extend Ireland's bank debt maturities by seven years. Michael Noonan said he reached the agreement with the Republic's EU partners as he arrived in Dublin Castle this morning for the EU finance ministers' summit. Eurogroup ministers are meeting first to discuss the proposed deal for Ireland and Portugal which would give both countries more time to repay the EU portion of the two countries' bailouts. Speaking on his arrival at the meeting, Noonan said he was reasonably optimistic. He said: \"The discussions I have had over the last 48 hours were quite successful and there is certainly agreement in principle now. \"Whether there is any particular difficulty that arises from colleagues or not, we won\u2019t know until it is openly discussed at meetings, but I am reasonably optimistic.\" Eurozone industrial output fell more than expected in February. It dropped 3.1% compared with a year earlier and was up just 0.4% compared with January. Bad news was compounded by a revision of January figures from -0.4% month-on-month to -0.6% As we look forward to the eurozone finance ministers' meeting in Dublin, where it's hoped the refinancing of Cyprus can be agreed, here's a quick reminder of what money the country needs. According to Reuters, Cyprus needs \u20ac23bn from the second quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2016. The eurozone bailout fund will give \u20ac9bn, the IMF \u20ac1bn and Cyprus must find \u20ac13bn. The \u20ac10bn international bailout will go on: \u20ac2.5bn on recapitalising the remains of the banking sector \u20ac4.1bn on redeeming maturing government debt \u20ac3.4bn to cover fiscal needs of Cypriot government And Cyprus will make up its contribution from: Up to \u20ac10.6bn from resolution on Laiki bank, losses imposed on junior shareholders and deposit for equity swap of uninsured depositors at Bank of Cyprus Up to \u20ac600m from corporate tax rise to 12.5% from 10% and doubling capital gains tax to 30% Around \u20ac400m from gold sales Up to \u20ac1bn from debt rollover \u20ac1.4bn from privatisation \u20ac100m from a reduction in interest rates on its Russian loans A full breakdown of the numbers can be found here UK construction output rose in February by 5.5% compared with January, but fell 7% year-on-year, according to the ONS. The previous year-on-year numbers in January was -7.9%. Bloomberg is running an article that, it claims, contains a draft of the International Monetary Fund's world economic outlook due to be released next week. It contains a lowered forecast for US economic growth, Bloomberg says, will GDP expanding by 1.7% instead of 2% due to the automatic budget cuts and tax changes that have kicked in this year. The global economy has been inched lower as well, from 3.5% to 3.4%. The Press Association is quoting a Treasury source, saying that George Osborne will attend the gathering of EU finance ministers but it will be \"rather low key from a UK perspective.\"This means that the UK won't be extending any bilateral loans to Cyprus and will not be closely involved in discussions about a banking union and the eurozone-wide banking supervisor. UK banks are not expected to be subjected to the authority. The treasury minister, Greg Clark, will also be attending. This WSJ comment piece about Cyprus is being tweeted this morning. The intro is pointed. The FTSE got off to a negative start this morning, down 20.31 points or 0.3% at 6395. Reuters attributes this to profit taking - the FTSE has been on a good run - and concerns that Cyprus and others will require deeper bailouts. Meanwhile, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index has also slipped 0.3% in early trading. Richard Perry, chief strategist at Central Markets, said: There is the potential that Cyprus may need more money, and that may be a reason for investors to book a bit of profit on the back of the recent strong run. Mind out markets, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and head of the Eurogroup, has given an interview. But it looks slightly more benign than his index-rattling efforts last month, when he said the Cyprus deposit-raid might be a blueprint for all future EU bailouts. In his interview with the Irish Times he says the outlook for Ireland - one of five EU countries to receive a bailout (if you count Spain's banks) - is \"rather positive\". He dances around the notorious \"template\" comments about Cyprus, stressing that \"we have to work towards a different way of working with banking crises in the future.\" But he uses a phrase - bail-in - that is a euphemism for tapping savers' deposits above \u20ac100,000 (and bondholders too). So the issue of deposit raids - Cypriots are facing a bigger wipeout than first thought after events of recent days - won't go away. He says: In a post-crisis situation you need mechanisms to deal with these problems. We are working on those \u2013 in the resolution and recovery directive there will be a way of dealing with a \u2018bail-in\u2019, giving us the instruments to do bailins in a proper way. He goes on to say that deposits above \u20ac100,000 are still fair game. There will be a hierarchy and the uninsured depositors will be at the end of the hierarchy... I can\u2019t speculate on what the outcome is, but they\u2019re definitely included in the proposal that\u2019s now on the table [to deal with future crises]. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, says today's meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers and heads of central banks in Dublin will be picketed by members of the Republic's largest police union. Up to 30 members of the Garda Representative Association's central executive have gathered outside Dublin Castle where the Eurogroup event for finance ministers is taking place. The GRA say they have staged the picket in protest at what they call the \"unfairness\" of cuts imposed on rank and file police officers in the state. GRA general secretary PJ Stone said this morning: \"We have been badly treated by our political masters, and having been repeatedly denied the opportunity to directly negotiate our pay, we must express our anger and frustration through our continued placard protest.\" Their placards include: \"IRELAND Support your Police\" and \"IRLAND Unterstutze Deine Polizei\". The sight of the union representing more than 11,000 Gardai picketing their own government organised pan-European event will be an embarrassment for the Fine Gael-Labour coalition. Ireland holds the EU Presidency up until midway through this year. The stability of the European financial system and the growth prospects for the Union are a key topic for today. Tomorrow, ministers will look at more information sharing between tax authorities. The sharing of information is to combat tax evasion is also on the agenda at Dublin Castle. Morning all - it is a day of gatherings for the eurozone. Given that it is the year of the gathering in Ireland (to celebrate the country's considerable cultural and genealogical wattage), there is appropriately enough a meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers in Dublin. They will discuss the ongoing crisis in Cyprus and then move on to the imminent one in Slovenia before, reportedly, agreeing to extend the bailouts for Ireland and Portugal. But the latter might not be announced until tomorrow. In Berlin, David Cameron is meeting Angela Merkel. The election clock is ticking for both of them, with Merkel's coming later this year. Right now, one of them is more likely to be returned to power than the other - but Cameron still has two years to ensure that the eurozone does not continue to destabilise the UK economy and his election chances.",
