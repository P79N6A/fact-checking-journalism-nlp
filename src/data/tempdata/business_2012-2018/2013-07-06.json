The symbolism will seem very apt this week as the stadium hosts another underperforming British institution, Marks &amp; Spencer, whose directors will trot out in front of their adoring shareholders for the annual general meeting. While a potential banana-skin should be avoided when first-quarter trading numbers are simultaneously announced (they come against weak comparators) M&amp;S knows there are few easy fixtures on current form. Whatever its trading is like, there will probably be more chants about overpaid stars presiding over years of uninspiring results. That might mean more pressure on struggling chief exec Marc Bolland, who has much in common with McClaren. Both men's results have disappointed, while each is prone to uttering clich\u00e9s in a Dutch accent. Bolland is now desperate for a few wins before next season if he's to a) get his contract renewed and b) persuade City wags from invoking another McClaren comparison: currently he's the wally who is Bolly. Dry and mighty There is an old \u2013 almost certainly apocryphal tale \u2013 about the designer Tom Ford ringing up the Gucci publicity department and demanding that they stop giving Victoria Beckham free samples since photographs of her wearing his clothes were damaging the brand. The spinners are said to have replied that there was nothing they could do since the singer had actually been spending her own money buying the frocks, to which Ford apparently screeched: \"Well, stop her!\" If that one seems like a juvenile concoction by a catty rival, then you may prefer a similar tale about the Beckhams with a far more positive spin. Victoria's sainted hubby David effectively launched the Superdry clothing brand into the mainstream when he sported one of its Osaka 6 T-shirts on the cover of his 2005 calendar \u2013 a spot of luck that the label has looked back from only briefly since. The SuperGroup company floated in 2010 and the shares boomed \u2013 before crashing after a string of novice mistakes. But they have now been ticking up for a year and are 57% ahead of the float price, as the firm prepares to announce \u00a350m of profits this week. It's a sign of how the company has matured that only missing that figure would surprise. Even in fashion, it seems, some things do grow up. More questions for Icap boss \"Icap chief executive Michael Spencer could get a grilling from shareholders at the broker's annual meeting on the gloomy outlook and over whether the firm will get dragged into the Libor rate-rigging scandal\". That was Reuters's teaser to the inter-dealer broker's 2012 AGM, but the firm has thoughtfully saved investors from having to ponder any further topics at the 2013 version this week, as the firm's issues have changed about as much Spencer's hairstyle. The finance sector is obviously still struggling and if the Icap story has moved on at all, it's because concerns about Libor have become more pressing. In January the company said it was being investigated by the Financial Services Authority and it was then forced last month to issue a denial that anybody at the company was \"aware of any corrupt payment from any source at any time\", following reports that a top Icap exec knew of arrangements that regulators allege were part of a rigging scheme. Still, at last year's meeting 15% of shareholders that aren't Spencer failed to back the remuneration report. The chief exec will be hoping that at least that story changes in 2013.",
