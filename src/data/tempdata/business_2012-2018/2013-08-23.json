      "bodyText": "The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate six furniture and carpet retailers, including Carpetright and sofa specialist ScS, over the use of exaggerated discount claims. The retailers are accused of inflating prices for short periods in order to mislead shoppers into believing they are getting a bargain during sale periods. The announcement came before the bank holiday weekend, when many furniture and carpet retailers are holding sales, and is another blow for an home furnishings retail industry struggling while the housing market has been in the doldrums. The OFT said an initial investigation had found systematic inflation of the original price, known as the \"reference price\", to show customers what a good deal they are getting. Typically, just 5% of products were sold at the artificially inflated reference price, while a significant number of products were found to have never been sold at that price level. Although the OFT did not officially name the retailers under investigation, ScS and Carpetright both confirmed they had been contacted by the OFT this week as part of the investigation. Carpetright said in a statement that it \"strives to operate fully within all laws and regulations at all times. Carpetright is co-operating fully with the OFT and will respond to the letter in due course.\" The other retailers are thought to be Dreams, DFS, Furniture Village and Steinhoff, the owner of Harveys and Bensons for Beds. DFS, Dreams and Steinhoff declined to comment. Furniture Village said it was aware of the OFT investigations but added that it would be inappropriate for it to comment or confirm its involvement until its findings were published. It said: \"Furniture Village is fully supportive of any initiative which ensures that, industry-wide, future pricing policies and practices are fair and accurate.\" Gaucho Rasmussen, an OFT director, said: \"OFT research has found that reference pricing can mislead consumers into thinking the item they have bought is of higher value and quality.\" He said the exaggerated discount claims also pressured shoppers to buy immediately so they did not miss out on a deal , and could impair their judgment so that they did not search for better offers. The OFT warned shoppers to carefully assess the deals on offer over the bank holiday weekend. \"We would recommend that consumers ask sales staff when and for how long the reference price was used and also how many sales they achieved at this price. This will help them to determine whether they are getting a good deal,\" said Rasmussen. The British Retail Consortium queried the way the OFT had handled the revelation of its investigation ahead of one of the busiest trading weekends of the year. The industry trade body suggested the watchdog had breached its own guidance, which said it should not advise if a business was being investigated. Although the OFT has not revealed the names of the companies, they have been widely reported. Helen Dickinson, the BRC's director general, said: \"The BRC recognises that there is an important role for the OFT to play, but we are concerned about the apparent lack of process and consultation in this investigation.\" The retailers have been asked to stop the pricing practices and to agree legally enforceable undertakings to stop them being used again. They have been given until the autumn to agree how they are going to change their practices with the OFT. If they fail to do so, the OFT can take court action, which could lead to fines worth up to 30% of their relevant turnover in extreme circumstances. The revelation of the OFT investigation comes just days after Tesco was fined \u00a3300,000 for misleading shoppers with a \"half-price\" promotion on strawberries. Birmingham crown court found the strawberries had been on sale at the higher price for just two out of the 14 weeks that they were available in store.",

It was at that time the third-largest server manufacturer in the US. But it didn't sell a single one.</p> <p>The cost of building a \"cloud service\" like Google's has only gone up: in its latest results, it revealed that it invested $1.6bn on data centres just in the three months from April to June. That's now become Google's typical spending \u2013 $4bn a year \u2013 on the systems that it uses to index the web, answer searches, serve adverts, handle email, store photographs and provide maps and Street View photos.</p> <p>And it's far from alone. Globally, spending on data centres will hit $143bn this year, according to the research group Gartner, and $149bn next year, continuing a slow but steady growth. The cause? \"Big data\", as companies try to cope with a growing flood of information about their business and others', as well as the rush to enable \"cloud computing\" \u2013 so that data can be accessed from anywhere you have an internet connection.</p> <p>Handling \"big data\" for millions of people generally involves billion-dollar cheques. That was the price Apple spent on its third data centre \u2013 in Malden, North Carolina \u2013 covering 500,000&#xa0;sq ft (4.65 hectares) and cooled by water from nearby rivers.</p> <p>It's not alone: Google, Facebook, US phone company AT&amp;T and services company Wipro also have centres there, attracted by cheap electricity and plenty of space in the rural state; one centre can cover as much space and use as much electricity as a small town. They are power-hungry and data-hungry. The servers needed to process the data have to be arranged in racks, with cooling air forced over them; storage is arranged in racks of hard drives which are set up in the expectation that some will fail, but be replaced. The data enters and exits via thick fibre-optic cables routed through the floor.</p> <p>Yet two things you'll rarely find in data centres are people or light. Many operate as \"lights-out\" systems, because the machines don't need to be watched; they can be remotely monitored. But that need to make data move quickly means it's important to build data centres near to their users. Hence Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/dublin/index.html\" title=\"\">built one near Dublin</a> covering 4.45 hectares (11 acres) and costing \u20ac75m. Unusually, it's air-cooled.</p> <p>Even so, building data centres is increasingly becoming a tussle between access to space, and rapidity of connection. Ahead of the 2012 London Olympics, some IT administrators in the financial centres of Canary Wharf in east London fretted that they wouldn't be able to get enough electricity to power their new centres \u2013 which had to be located close to dealing-room floors in order not to give up precious milliseconds of valuable trading time. Some considered briefly moving out of London \u2013 but relented and now benefit from the extra power sources installed to deal with them.</p>",

And it's far from alone. Globally, spending on data centres will hit $143bn this year, according to the research group Gartner, and $149bn next year, continuing a slow but steady growth. The cause? \"Big data\", as companies try to cope with a growing flood of information about their business and others', as well as the rush to enable \"cloud computing\" \u2013 so that data can be accessed from anywhere you have an internet connection. Handling \"big data\" for millions of people generally involves billion-dollar cheques. That was the price Apple spent on its third data centre \u2013 in Malden, North Carolina \u2013 covering 500,000 sq ft (4.65 hectares) and cooled by water from nearby rivers. It's not alone: Google, Facebook, US phone company AT&amp;T and services company Wipro also have centres there, attracted by cheap electricity and plenty of space in the rural state; one centre can cover as much space and use as much electricity as a small town. They are power-hungry and data-hungry. The servers needed to process the data have to be arranged in racks, with cooling air forced over them; storage is arranged in racks of hard drives which are set up in the expectation that some will fail, but be replaced. The data enters and exits via thick fibre-optic cables routed through the floor. Yet two things you'll rarely find in data centres are people or light. Many operate as \"lights-out\" systems, because the machines don't need to be watched; they can be remotely monitored. But that need to make data move quickly means it's important to build data centres near to their users. Hence Google built one near Dublin covering 4.45 hectares (11 acres) and costing \u20ac75m. Unusually, it's air-cooled. Even so, building data centres is increasingly becoming a tussle between access to space, and rapidity of connection. Ahead of the 2012 London Olympics, some IT administrators in the financial centres of Canary Wharf in east London fretted that they wouldn't be able to get enough electricity to power their new centres \u2013 which had to be located close to dealing-room floors in order not to give up precious milliseconds of valuable trading time. Some considered briefly moving out of London \u2013 but relented and now benefit from the extra power sources installed to deal with them.",

      "bodyText": "Nasdaq's CEO, Robert Greifeld, broke his silence about the stock exchange's unprecedented two-hour outage on Thursday, but his television interview received low marks from some investors who remained baffled by the shutdown. Greifeld spoke with cable-news channel CNBC in a 15-minute interview in which he provided more details about the glitch that halted trading of some stocks across 13 major exchanges. He revealed that the exchange had taken only 30 minutes to fix the software problem, which had sent stock quotes only to big professional investors while small investors could not see quotes. Greifeld said the exchange intentionally kept service out for hours to perform technical checks. The primary complaint from many traders was that Nasdaq did not keep them informed. Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told reporters, \"The worst part of all of this is the lack of disclosure. The lack of transparency. This is inexcusable.\" Greifeld bristled at Levitt's statement, telling CNBC: \"I have to disagree in a quite an emotional way with that statement.\" He said the exchange provided updates to major investment banks, investors and other exchanges, if not the press and the general public. \"We have to focus on the operational aspects of the problem while the problem is transpiring,\" he told host Andrew Ross Sorkin. The decision to update market players but not the public struck some as a feint. \"I don't see why they couldn't do both,\" said Josh Brown, a vice president at Fusion Analytics and market commentator. Howard Lindzon, the CEO of social media investing site StockTwits and the manager of several small funds, said Greifeld's explanation left him unconvinced. \"I think the market is so complex and the machinery is so complex and ... I don't think there's anything you can do any more. It's so botched,\" Lindzon said. He added: \"They can't be shamed into fixing the system.\" Greifeld made oblique references to an external problem that may have shaken Nasdaq's system and forced the exchange to engage in \"defensive driving\", but he did not elaborate. \"I think where we have to get better is what I call defensive driving,\" Greifeld said. \"Defensive driving means what do you do when another part of the ecosystem, another player, has some bad event that triggers something in your system?\" Some could not square Greifeld's explanation of the internal Nasdaq software glitch with his references to \"another player,\" which he noted again later: \"We spend a lot of time and effort where other things happen outside our control and how we respond to it. This is an example of that.\" Brown, of Fusion Analytics, said Greifeld's actions counted more than his tone. \"I thought they did a better job fixing the problem than communicating about it,\" Brown said, noting that trading resumed without incident. \"The first thing they did was halt trading so that we didn't have one of those Facebook fiascos. They probably averted chaos. I thought they actually handled things really well, it's just that they were really bad about getting out front.\" Michael Driscoll, a former Bear Stearns trader who now teaches at Adelphi University, said he doubted Greifeld could have said anything that would have comforted investors. \"It was a slow thursday in August when there was not much going on,\" Driscoll said. \"I'm not sure they could have handled it. It was three hours. What's the difference?\" Driscoll, Brown and Lindzon all chalked up the computer errors to the price of doing business in the modern world. \"It's going to happen again,\" Driscoll said. \"It's the nature of computers. The Securities and Exchange Commission said it was monitoring the situation.",

This is inexcusable.\"</p> <p>Greifeld bristled at Levitt's statement, telling CNBC: \"I have to disagree in a quite an emotional way with that statement.\"</p> <p>He said the exchange provided updates to major investment banks, investors and other exchanges, if not the press and the general public. \"We have to focus on the operational aspects of the problem while the problem is transpiring,\" he told host Andrew Ross Sorkin.</p> <p>The decision to update market players but not the public struck some as a feint. \"I don't see why they couldn't do both,\" said Josh Brown, a vice president at Fusion Analytics and market commentator.</p> <p>Howard Lindzon, the CEO of social media investing site StockTwits and the manager of several small funds, said Greifeld's explanation left him unconvinced.</p> <p>\"I think the market is so complex and the machinery is so complex and ... I don't think there's anything you can do any more. It's so botched,\" Lindzon said. He added: \"They can't be shamed into fixing the system.\"</p> <p>Greifeld made oblique references to an external problem that may have shaken Nasdaq's system and forced the exchange to engage in \"defensive driving\", but he did not elaborate.</p> <p>\"I think where we have to get better is what I call defensive driving,\" Greifeld said. \"Defensive driving means what do you do when another part of the ecosystem, another player, has some bad event that triggers something in your system?\"</p> <p>Some could not square Greifeld's explanation of the internal Nasdaq software glitch with his references to \"another player,\" which he noted again later: \"We spend a lot of time and effort where other things happen outside our control and how we respond to it. This is an example of that.\"</p> <p>Brown, of Fusion Analytics, said Greifeld's actions counted more than his tone.</p> <p>\"I thought they did a better job fixing the problem than communicating about it,\" Brown said, noting that trading resumed without incident. \"The first thing they did was halt trading so that we didn't have one of those Facebook fiascos. They probably averted chaos. I thought they actually handled things really well, it's just that they were really bad about getting out front.\"</p> <p>Michael Driscoll, a former Bear Stearns trader who now teaches at Adelphi University, said he doubted Greifeld could have said anything that would have comforted investors.</p> <p>\"It was a slow thursday in August when there was not much going on,\" Driscoll said. \"I'm not sure they could have handled it. It was three hours. What's the difference?\"</p> <p>Driscoll, Brown and Lindzon all chalked up the computer errors to the price of doing business in the modern world.</p> <p>\"It's going to happen again,\" Driscoll said. \"It's the nature of computers.</p> <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said it was monitoring the situation.</p>",

Well, shares in Microsoft are up more than 8% in pre-market trading after Steve Ballmer's retirment was announced.</p> <p>A quick bit of background on Ballmer and his long career at Microsoft from the company's website:</p> <p>He joined Microsoft in 1980 (five years after Microsoft was created) and was the company\u2019s first business manager. Before becoming CEO in 2000, his roles at Microsoft included senior vice president of sales and support, senior vice president of systems software and vice president of marketing.</p> <p>Ballmer was born in March 1956, and he grew up near Detroit where his father worked as a manager at Ford Motor Co. Ballmer earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics and economics from Harvard University. He worked for two years at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. as an assistant product manager and attended Stanford University Graduate School of Business before joining Microsoft.</p> <p>The press release on today's retirement announcement is <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2013/aug13/08-23AnnouncementPR.aspx\">here</a>.</p> <p>You can watch Ballmer getting very excited about his long-time professional home in footage from 2001 here: \"I.

That follows a recent flurry of surveys and official numbers suggesting activity is picking up across a broad range of sectors.</p> <p>Among those economists is Philip Shaw, at Investec, who had this to say in a preview:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First estimates showed GDP rose by 0.6% in Q2, with all broad sectors enjoying an expansion. Since then there has been an upward revision to construction, from +0.9% to +1.4%. Meanwhile the ONS based its 0.6% estimate of services growth on a 0.1% contraction on the month in the sector in June (latest prevailing figures were for May). Given the buoyancy of various surveys, June\u2019s data (also due on Friday) might be stronger than this, prompting services to be nudged up slightly. On balance, we expect a small upward revision to GDP to +0.7%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Still, <strong>the majority of economists expect the headline growth number to be unchanged at 0.6%</strong>. This latest take on GDP will have more details on what was driving growth in the second quarter, with the first breakdown on expenditure. Capital Economics says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We suspect that household spending was responsible for the lion\u2019s share of Q2\u2019s increase.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is not what the government will want to hear, of course, given all its vows to rebalance the economy away from so much dependence on consumer demand. Earlier this week, the business lobby group CBI, upgraded its forecast for UK growth in 2013 to 1.2%, double the chancellor\u2019s forecast at the budget. However, the CBI, which has long been a supporter of the government\u2019s austerity drive and promises to cut the deficit, warned that ministers\u2019 push for rebalancing was taking longer than expected. John Cridland, the CBI\u2019s director general, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy has started to gain momentum and confidence is picking up, but it\u2019s still early days.</p> <p>We need to see a full-blown rebalancing of our economy, with stronger business investment and trade before we can call a sustainable recovery.

Consumer confidence in the currency bloc improved more than expected this month, according to the European Commission. Its measure of confidence rose to a two-year high of -15.6 points from -17.4 in July. That beat expectations of a smaller improvement to -16.5 points. That is all from the live blog today. Thank you for reading. We will be back next week with more news from around financial markets and the global economy. Steve Ballmer has written to Microsoft employees explaining his retirement rationale. Details of the letter and the search for a successor are in our story. A few minutes after the opening bell on Wall Street and the Nasdaq appears to have to opened without a glitch after yesterday's lengthy shutdown. Microsoft shares have shot up more than 8% on the news of Ballmer's retirement. The main indices just after the open: Nasdaq +0.6% Dow Jones industrial average +0.2% S&amp;P 500 +0.3% Some Twitter reactions to Ballmer's retirement news: Oh dear. Quite often when a chief executive announces his or her retirement the shares fall and commentators and journalists do a quick back of the envelope \"they are worth x to the company\" calculation. Well, shares in Microsoft are up more than 8% in pre-market trading after Steve Ballmer's retirment was announced. A quick bit of background on Ballmer and his long career at Microsoft from the company's website: He joined Microsoft in 1980 (five years after Microsoft was created) and was the company\u2019s first business manager. Before becoming CEO in 2000, his roles at Microsoft included senior vice president of sales and support, senior vice president of systems software and vice president of marketing. Ballmer was born in March 1956, and he grew up near Detroit where his father worked as a manager at Ford Motor Co. Ballmer earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics and economics from Harvard University. He worked for two years at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. as an assistant product manager and attended Stanford University Graduate School of Business before joining Microsoft. The press release on today's retirement announcement is here. You can watch Ballmer getting very excited about his long-time professional home in footage from 2001 here: \"I. Love. This. Company\" Microsoft has announced its CEO Steve Ballmer will retire within 12 months. He will remain CEO until a successor is named. A quick lunchtime roundup of where things stand on financial markets. A key level in traders' sights right now is 2% for German benchmark bond yields. Confirmation of German growth at 0.7% has added to selling pressure German government bonds from yesterday's stronger PMI surveys and has seen Bund yields climb to their highest level in a year and a half. Yields on benchmark 10-year Bunds are up 4 basis points at 1.96%. Rainer Guntermann at Commerzbank comments: The bond market safe havens have so far failed to benefit from currency turmoil in emerging markets. Against the backdrop of uncertainty about the further course of US monetary policy and better economic prospects, yields of 10-year Bunds look set to rise to 2% near-term. This is how things are looking on stock markets, where there has been support from the UK's upward GDP growth revision, traders say: FTSE 100 +0.5% at 6482 CAC40 -0.3% at 4047 Dax Unchanged at 8401 In the US, futures point to a flat start on Wall Street after yesterday's upheaval when the Nasdaq was down for a large part of the trading session. As the debate over Greece's prospects of needing and getting another bailout continues, the government has been trying to drum up new investment from abroad. Who better to ask than a billionaire? The Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, met Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal on Thursday to discuss investment opportunities, government officials say. Reuters reports: \"It was a customary visit, there is interest in investing in Greece,\" said a government official who declined to be named. The prince, ranked 26th on the Forbes global ranking of billionaires, owns large stakes in Citigroup, and Apple Inc. among other companies. A nephew of Saudi King Abdullah, Bin Talal is also the owner or part-owner of luxury hotels including the Plaza in New York, the Savoy in London and the George V in Paris. Greece is looking to attract investors into its asset sales program, which includes its gas company DEPA, utility Public Power Corp., the Athens international airport, refiner Hellenic Petroleum and its two main ports to help chop its debt load. Ireland's central bank has released numbers showing the number of mortgages in arrears rose in the second quarter. The Central Bank of Ireland says 12.7% of home mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) were in arrears of more than 90 days at end of June 2013, up from 12.3% at end of March 2013. It adds: The number of PDH accounts in longer-term arrears over 180 days increased by 3.8% during Q2 2013, while quarter-on-quarter growth in the number of accounts in arrears over 720 days was 11.3%. European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Ewald Nowotny has played down chances of a rate cut and has pretty much reinforced the ECB's forward guidance. Speaking from Jackson Hole in an interview with Bloomberg, the Austrian central bank chief said there was no tightening on the horizon either. The full Bloomberg story is here. Key comments from Nowotny include: \"I would not see many arguments now for a rate cut.\" At the same time, he ruled out an early monetary tightening, saying: \u201cThe most recent developments will have no immediate effects on the policy of the European Central Bank.\u201d \u201cIt is a weak recovery, but it is a recovery.\u201d Meanwhile, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, has told the Handelsblatt newspaper that he welcomes the prospect of the ECB raising interest rates once the economy improves: Low rates are above all an expression of insecurity on debt markets. That cannot last forever - even if it is a relief to the federal budget. The central bank has announced it will raise rates again when the economy improves. That is good. My colleague, Heather Stewart, has been looking at those UK GDP numbers: Britain's recession-scarred economy expanded more quickly than first thought in the second quarter of the year, by 0.7%, stoking hopes that recovery is taking hold. In its second estimate of growth from April to June, the Office for National Statistics said GDP grew more strongly than its first estimate, of 0.6%. The 0.7% jump was the strongest since the third quarter of last year, when the economy was boosted by the Olympics. The upturn is also more broad-based than first thought, according to the breakdown of the data, helping to assuage fears that the UK is in an unsustainable \"Alice in Wongaland\" recovery, too dependent on consumer spending. Her full story is here. The Labour party have reacted to the UK growth upgrade. Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, says: These figures confirm that after three wasted years of flatlining we finally have some welcome but long overdue growth. But for all George Osborne's complacent claims that the economy is now fixed, for ordinary people things are getting harder. While millionaires have been given a huge tax cut most people are still seeing prices rising much faster than wages. And real risks remain. The governor of the Bank of England is right to warn that the recovery is weak, and it is the slowest on record. The UK Treasury sends this reaction to the upward revision to UK growth in the second quarter and they go for \"rescue to recovery\" again: This data confirms that the British economy is moving from rescue to recovery, supported by balanced growth across the economy. It\u2019s particularly encouraging that growth in exports and investment contributed well over half of the second quarter growth rate. There is still a long way to go, but the economy is on the right track and the government is committed to its economic plan that has already cut the deficit by a third and enabled the private sector to create over 1.3m new jobs. Some more reaction now to that news that UK growth was upgraded to 0.7% in the second quarter from a previous official estimate of 0.6%. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit: The details show a very encouraging picture of a broad-based upturn across almost all sectors of the economy (the exception being falling energy output). Importantly, the upturn was not simply fuelled by surging spending by households. Instead, exports and business investment were key drivers of the expansion, pointing to a rebalancing of the economy away from domestic consumption. Meanwhile we await reaction from the Treasury, which has been tweeting about, erm \u2026 coastal communities James Knightley at ING Financial Markets has this analysis of the upward revision to UK GDP growth - now seen at 0.7%, versus the previous official estimate of 0.6%. He questions what progress has been made in reining in public finances: In terms of the output data, manufacturing and agriculture were revised higher, but utilities were downwardly revised to leave total production industries output unchanged at 0.6%. However construction was nudged up to 1.4%QoQ from 0.9% initially reported with services output remaining at 0.6%. This release provides the first detailed expenditure breakdown and it shows household spending rose 0.4%QoQ while investment jumped 1.7% and exports rose 3.6%. Government spending increased 0.9%, backing up data from the public sector finances that the government hasn\u2019t been particularly \u201csuccessful\u201d in its austerity drive. With business surveys suggesting that the UK started the third quarter on a firm footing and with sentiment continuing to strengthen it points to an encouraging outlook for the UK, particularly given that the UK\u2019s biggest trade partner, the Eurozone, is also posting better numbers. With inflation remaining sticky and the economy continuing to create jobs we continue to believe that the first Bank of England rate hike is more likely to come in early 2015, rather than 3Q16 at the earliest as suggested by the BoE. So the UK has matched Germany's second quarter growth rate at 0.7%. That was faster than most economists had expected with the majority forecasting growth would be 0.6%, as estimated in the first take from the Office for National Statistics. This second take includes expenditure data and suggests the biggest boost in Q2 came from net trade - that will be music to the ears of ministers pushing for a rebalancing of the economy away from Britain's long-standing dependence on consumer demand. The pound has strengthened against the dollar in the wake of the stronger-than-expected numbers and the FTSE 100 stock index has extended gains - it is currently up 15 points at 6462. The Office for National Statistics has released its latest estimate of economic growth in the second quarter and now says growth was 0.7%. Its previous estimate was 0.6%. For the first quarter, the ONS puts quarterly growth at 0.3%. Governments in emerging markets have been grappling with tumbling currencies this week as fears intensify that the much-heralded end of US cheap money is at last nigh. Brazil's central bank stepped in overnight to shore up the real Reuters outlines the moves: Brazil's central bank announced a currency-intervention program on Thursday that will provide $60bn worth of cash and insurance to the foreign-exchange market by year-end, a move aimed at bolstering the country's currency, the real, as it slips to near five-year lows against the dollar. The bank said in a statement it will sell, on Mondays through Thursdays, $500m worth of currency swaps, derivative contracts designed to provide investors with insurance against a weaker real. On Fridays, it will offer $1bn on the spot market through repurchase agreements. Both are designed to prevent companies and individuals with dollar obligations from scrambling to the market at the same time, afraid that waiting will force them to pay more to buy dollars. When that happens, the real tends to weaken further and faster. Heather Stewart provided this wide-ranging guide to the challenges facing emerging markets earlier this week. Some Twitter reactions include (but don't expect anything from the Brazilian central bank's feed, last updated January 2011): We will have more on the latest moves in increasingly unsettled emerging markets in a moment, but a quick look first at stocks in Europe this morning. Germany's Dax has slipped some 20 points, or 0.2%, to 8378 while the CAC40 in France is down 25 points, or 0.6%, at 4034. In THE UK, the FTSE 100 is hovering around the unchanged mark, currently up a point at 6448. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK sends through this market overview: Promising data from both China and Europe have again given financial markets reasons for optimism, and this has allowed traders to focus on growth rather than tapering, for the moment at least. The strong PMI numbers from these two key regions has allowed risk assets to recover ground lost after the release of the Fed minutes, with equity markets across Asia posting healthy gains overnight. Resource prices have reacted well to the upbeat economic news from around the globe, and this translated into particularly strong performances from the mining stocks. Oil and gas made and held modest gains, and both industrial and precious metals are higher. Over to Greece now, where there are reports of tax inspectors protesting in front of the finance ministry against possible sackings or transfers of their colleagues. As EKathimerini reports: The tax inspectors\u2019 union, POE-DOY, said that it would continue its protests, as the government aims to place 25,000 civil servants in a mobility scheme by the end of the year. I am going to Jackson, says Christine Lagarde, but presumably not to mess around. The IMF director, who may or may not be familiar with the Johnny Cash song, is in Jackson Hole and was tweeting about it yesterday. She joins a host central bankers and other bigwigs at the annual powwow in the mountains. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s annual economic policy symposium has one very notable absence this year, however. As James Saft at Reuters writes, US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will not be attending. The risk in all transitions is a destabilizing void, and at this year's Jackson Hole Federal Reserve conference a policy void is leading the agenda. Despite this being the eve of what may be the most important rollback of monetary policy ever, Ben Bernanke has passed on the chance to make a valedictory address. This marks first time a sitting Federal Reserve chairman has missed the event since 1987, when Alan Greenspan stayed home just days after being confirmed by Congress for the job. Read Saft\u2019s full piece here. The Jackson Hole agenda is here. Any attendees, may enjoy our Guardian travel piece on the ski resort. Ahead of the Office for National Statistics\u2019 second take on UK GDP numbers at 9.30am, as mentioned, some economists believe that second quarter growth could be revised higher to 0.7% from 0.6% in its first estimate a month ago. That follows a recent flurry of surveys and official numbers suggesting activity is picking up across a broad range of sectors. Among those economists is Philip Shaw, at Investec, who had this to say in a preview: First estimates showed GDP rose by 0.6% in Q2, with all broad sectors enjoying an expansion. Since then there has been an upward revision to construction, from +0.9% to +1.4%. Meanwhile the ONS based its 0.6% estimate of services growth on a 0.1% contraction on the month in the sector in June (latest prevailing figures were for May). Given the buoyancy of various surveys, June\u2019s data (also due on Friday) might be stronger than this, prompting services to be nudged up slightly. On balance, we expect a small upward revision to GDP to +0.7%. Still, the majority of economists expect the headline growth number to be unchanged at 0.6%. This latest take on GDP will have more details on what was driving growth in the second quarter, with the first breakdown on expenditure. Capital Economics says: We suspect that household spending was responsible for the lion\u2019s share of Q2\u2019s increase. That is not what the government will want to hear, of course, given all its vows to rebalance the economy away from so much dependence on consumer demand. Earlier this week, the business lobby group CBI, upgraded its forecast for UK growth in 2013 to 1.2%, double the chancellor\u2019s forecast at the budget. However, the CBI, which has long been a supporter of the government\u2019s austerity drive and promises to cut the deficit, warned that ministers\u2019 push for rebalancing was taking longer than expected. John Cridland, the CBI\u2019s director general, said: The economy has started to gain momentum and confidence is picking up, but it\u2019s still early days. We need to see a full-blown rebalancing of our economy, with stronger business investment and trade before we can call a sustainable recovery. We hope that will begin to emerge next year, as the eurozone starts growing again. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. We start the day with news that German growth was the strongest for more that a year in the second quarter. Official statistics put the quarterly rate of GDP expansion at 0.7%, confirming an earlier estimate, thanks to support from domestic demand and construction spending. Carsten Brzeski at ING Financial Markets comments: Simply wonderful. German second-quarter GDP growth is like one of your all-time favourite movies: you never get tired of watching it. The second estimate of the statistical office confirmed the impressive growth comeback of the German economy, posting GDP growth of 0.7% QoQ. Interestingly, growth was mainly driven by domestic factors, with the weather-driven catching up of the construction sector (+2.6% QoQ) outshining all other components. Still, the increase of private consumption (+0.5% QoQ), public consumption (+0.6%) and even investment (+0.9%) shows that the current German growth model is much more than a beggar-thy-neighbour model. Coming up we will have coverage of the latest GDP data for the UK, with official figures at 9.30am expected to confirm an initial estimate that growth in the second quarter was 0.6%. Still, some economists think the Office for National Statistics could report a slightly stronger 0.7% - matching that growth seen in Germany - in this second take on the growth numbers. At 3pm eurozone consumer confidence numbers are out for August and economists are looking for a slight improvement. The consensus in a Reuters poll is for the reading to edge up to a slightly less negative -16.5 from -17.4 the month before. James Howat at Capital Economics comments: Consumers should have been encouraged by the news that the eurozone economy finally began to recover in Q2. In particular, the labour market shows tentative signs of stabilising after the jobless count fell in June. Stock markets in Europe this morning are expected to add to gains made on the back of yesterday\u2019s relatively upbeat PMI surveys. The reports from data company Markit showed both services and manufacturing shrinking in France but Germany enjoyed the strongest manufacturing activity in more than two years and for the eurozone as a whole the picture was also brighter. We will also be following the latest news and commentary on Greece\u2019s public finances after Jeroen Dijsselbloem, leader of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, admitted yesterday that Greece will need another bailout next year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's recession-scarred economy clocked up growth of 0.7% in the second quarter of the year, faster than previously thought, stoking hopes that a solid recovery is finally taking hold. The Office for National Statistics upgraded its initial 0.6% estimate, putting the pace of growth at 0.7%, its strongest since the third quarter of last year when the economy received a temporary fillip from the Olympics. The bounceback is more broad-based than first thought, according to the breakdown of the data, helping to assuage fears that Britain is in an unsustainable \"Alice in Wongaland\" recovery, too dependent on consumer spending. Business investment was up 0.9%, the ONS said, while household spending expanded by 0.4%. Exports rose at 3.6%, the fastest pace since late 2011. Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS, who upgraded the bank's GDP growth forecasts after the news, to 1.3% this year and 2% in 2014, said: \"The recovery is taking on a more normal shape.\" Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit, said: \"Importantly, the upturn was not simply fuelled by surging spending by households. Instead, exports and business investment were key drivers of the expansion, pointing to a rebalancing of the economy away from domestic consumption.\" A few months ago, Britain appeared to be flirting with a renewed recession, after a deep fall in output in the final quarter of 2012. The improving economic climate in the eurozone, boosting demand for British exports in our main market, and growing consumer confidence as the housing market thaws, have helped to create a more optimistic mood. The Treasury, which is hoping a full-blown recovery is under way after almost two years of persistent economic weakness, seized on the widespread nature of the expansion signalled in the figures. A spokeswoman said: \"It's particularly encouraging that growth in exports and investment contributed well over half of the second quarter growth rate. There is still a long way to go, but the economy is on the right track.\" David Kern, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Business investment is still too weak in spite of the modest rise, but the figures support our view that Britain's trading position is improving. Although the rebalancing towards net exports is taking some time, we have seen a significant narrowing of the trade deficit in the first half of this year.\" Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"These figures confirm that after three wasted years of flatlining we finally have some welcome but long overdue growth. But for all George Osborne's complacent claims that the economy is now fixed, for ordinary people things are getting harder.\" As it updated its data with more detailed information, the ONS confirmed that all four main sectors of the economy \u2013 agriculture, production, construction and services \u2013 had expanded for the first time since the third quarter of 2010, just after the coalition came to power. In services, which makes up more than 75% of the economy, the strongest growth was in distribution, hotels and restaurants, where output was up 1.7%. Construction saw a healthy 1.4% rise, stronger than the initial estimate of 0.9%, echoing growing confidence from builders about the outlook; while manufacturing output \u2013 key to the government's hopes of rebalancing the economy \u2013 rose 0.7% over the quarter, compared with the first estimate of 0.4%. Looked at over the longer term, construction output is nevertheless 0.5% below the same period last year; and manufacturing production is about 10% lower than its peak before the financial crisis. Relatively strong retail sales, employment data and business surveys have all raised hopes recently that the recovery will continue in the second half of 2013, as confidence improves. But some analysts still caution that, with fresh austerity measures due to bite over the next year, the nascent recovery looks too reliant on Britain's shoppers. Melanie Bowler, an economist at Moody's, said that while she expected GDP to continue growing for the rest of the year, question marks remained about the longer-term sustainability of the recovery. \"The risks are weighted to the downside for the remainder of 2013 and indeed for the next couple of years. In particular, dependence on private consumption as the key contributor to economic growth is a concern for the UK, where fiscal austerity is likely to hold down domestic activity for some time.\" Danny Gabay, of City consultancy Fathom, said the coalition's recent measures to kick-start the housing market could tip the balance towards consumer spending. \"We expect household consumption to strengthen through the second half of this year, as a number of government schemes designed to promote lending, even to the riskiest of prospects, start to bear fruit.\" Workers' pay rose by 2.4% in the second quarter, the fastest pace since mid-2000 \u2013 but the ONS stressed that this partly resulted from unusually high April bonus payments after some were deferred payouts to benefit from Osborne's 5p cut in the top rate of tax.",

    "webTitle": "Nasdaq glitch prompts two-hour shutdown and fears over stability", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A glitch in the Nasdaq stock market resulted in an unprecedented shutdown of trading of over 2,000 major US stocks and options for more than two hours, creating confusion around the shares of the biggest companies in America and resulting in calls for greater regulation. Nasdaq shut down for over three hours in the middle of the day as it investigated the outage. Trading resumed at 3.25pm ET. The company said the the failure resulted from a glitch in software that publishes the prices of stocks listed on the exchange. Some of the largest American companies, including Apple and Facebook, are listed on Nasdaq; about 20% of the S&amp;P 500 companies call Nasdaq their home exchange. Despite the closure the exchange ended the day up 38 points or 1.1% at 3638.71. Because other exchanges depend on Nasdaq's pricing software for accuracy, the outage affected a host of other exchanges, ranging from NYSE Euronext to systems that serve primarily professional investors who trade in large blocks of thousands of shares at a time. By one estimate, the halt locked up roughly $5.7tn in shares. Nasdaq said it would not automatically cancel any pending stock trades, instead advising investors to cancel their own trades before the system goes back up. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates stock exchanges, said it is monitoring the situation. \"The market being down for an hour is just shocking. It's not the kind of thing that's happened before,\" said David Lauer, an independent consultant on the technical aspects of stock markets. \"You're not going to have confidence in the markets and keep your life savings and retirement in the markets if you keep seeing this happen.\" \"It's really shocking. We're stuck,\" said Ramon Verastegui, head of global engineering and strategy at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \"If we want to trade Apple, we can't.\" The outage refocused attention on a series of prominent failures in market technology that have shaken the nerves of investors. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs made a mistaken options trade that rippled across the markets and affected a number of financial institutions. Nasdaq opted to cancel the mistaken orders. Similar glitches have been if not common, then recurring since the famous 2010 \"flash crash\" that resulted in short-term panic but no long-term changes to trading practices. \"I would not want to speculate other than to say this is huge. Everything is halted in the market,\" said Sal Arnuk at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Options trading was also halted, the exchange said. The failure is sure to refocus attention on regulatory efforts to strengthen the technological backbone of the major stock exchanges. Currently, exchanges can voluntarily choose to have their backup plans reviewed by the SEC, which then audits their technological systems. One potential rule, known as Regulation SCI, would require major exchanges to submit to the audits. That regulation is pending comment. Lauer said the shutdown should be a wake-up call to regulators to monitor exchanges, which he said have not kept up with the speed of current technology. \"We have an overly complex system, and it's complex to the point of dysfunction,\" he said. When Facebook floated in May last year, early trading was delayed for hours as the exchange systems seemed unable to cope with the scale of the share offering and failed to send electronic reports to traders to confirm whether stock had been bought and sold. Swiss banking group UBS later launched a lawsuit against the exchange claiming it lost \u00a3240m in the bungled listing. \"I can't remember this happening in recent memory,\" said Christopher Nagy, president of consultancy firm KOR Trading and a former head of trading at TD Ameritrade.

      "body": "<p>A glitch in the Nasdaq stock market resulted in an unprecedented shutdown of trading of over 2,000 major US stocks and options for more than two hours, creating confusion around the shares of the biggest companies in America and resulting in calls for greater regulation.</p> <p>Nasdaq shut down for over three hours in the middle of the day as it investigated the outage. Trading resumed at 3.25pm ET.</p> <p>The company said the the failure resulted from a glitch in software that publishes the prices of stocks listed on the exchange. Some of the largest American companies, including Apple and Facebook, are listed on Nasdaq; about 20% of the S&amp;P 500 companies call Nasdaq their home exchange. Despite the closure the exchange ended the day up 38 points or 1.1% at 3638.71.</p> <p>Because other exchanges depend on Nasdaq's pricing software for accuracy, the outage affected a host of other exchanges, ranging from NYSE Euronext to systems that serve primarily professional investors who trade in large blocks of thousands of shares at a time. <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/08/22/5-7-trillion-locked-up-by-nasdaq-trading-halt/\">By one estimate</a>, the halt locked up roughly $5.7tn in shares.</p> <p>Nasdaq said it would not automatically cancel any pending stock trades, instead advising investors to cancel their own trades before the system goes back up.</p> <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates stock exchanges, said it is monitoring the situation.</p> <p>\"The market being down for an hour is just shocking. It's not the kind of thing that's happened before,\" said David Lauer, an independent consultant on the technical aspects of stock markets. \"You're not going to have confidence in the markets and keep your life savings and retirement in the markets if you keep seeing this happen.\" </p> <p>\"It's really shocking. We're stuck,\" said Ramon Verastegui, head of global engineering and strategy at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \"If we want to trade Apple, we can't.\"</p> <p>The outage refocused attention on a series of prominent failures in market technology that have shaken the nerves of investors. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs made a mistaken options trade that rippled across the markets and affected a number of financial institutions. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324165204579026611410016876.html\">Nasdaq opted to cancel the mistaken orders</a>.</p> <p>Similar glitches have been if not common, then recurring since the famous 2010 \"flash crash\" that resulted in short-term panic but no long-term changes to trading practices.</p> <p>\"I would not want to speculate other than to say this is huge. Everything is halted in the market,\" said Sal Arnuk at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Options trading was also halted, the exchange said. </p> <p>The failure is sure to refocus attention on regulatory efforts to strengthen the technological backbone of the major stock exchanges.</p> <p>Currently, exchanges can voluntarily choose to have their backup plans reviewed by the SEC, which then audits their technological systems. One potential rule, <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171513148#.UhZRzL_UPrQ\">known as Regulation SCI</a>, would require major exchanges to submit to the audits. That regulation is pending comment.</p> <p>Lauer said the shutdown should be a wake-up call to regulators to monitor exchanges, which he said have not kept up with the speed of current technology. \"We have an overly complex system, and it's complex to the point of dysfunction,\" he said.</p> <p>When Facebook floated in May last year, early trading was delayed for hours as the exchange systems seemed unable to cope with the scale of the share offering and failed to send electronic reports to traders to confirm whether stock had been bought and sold. Swiss banking group UBS later launched a lawsuit against the exchange claiming it lost \u00a3240m in the bungled listing.</p> <p>\"I can't remember this happening in recent memory,\" said Christopher Nagy, president of consultancy firm KOR Trading and a former head of trading at TD Ameritrade.</p> <p>The US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it was monitoring developments and was in touch with the exchanges on the matter.</p> <p>The failure at Nasdaq is the latest of several high-profile glitches to hit US markets. The incidents \u2013 including the \"flash crash\" in 2010, errors related to the Facebook flotation and Knight Capital's disastrous trading blowup last year \u2013 have undermined market confidence.

      "bodyText": "This week New Zealand beat Australia on two measures. First, the same-sex marriage law came into effect; and second, its reserve bank introduced some \"macro-prudential\" tools for its banking system. There aren't many buzzwords in financial policy circles, but for the past two or three years \"macro-prudential tools\" has been the key phrase for many on how the financial system needs to respond to the global financial crisis. Macro-prudential tools are essentially regulations imposed by the central bank or regulator, but different from those usually put in place to protect individual borrowers. They have a broader focus (hence \"macro\") and are designed to protect the banking system as a whole \u2013 and in turn the broader economy. They include limits on the loan-to-value ratio (LVR) that banks can hold on mortgages. LVR measures the size of the loan against the value of the property. The idea is that capping the LVR reduces the level of risk in the banking system as a whole. If someone buys a house for $500,000 and needs to take out a $490,000 loan, that is a more risky loan for the bank than a loan of $400,000. In the first case the loan-to-value ratio is 98%, in the second it is 80%. But curbing risky lending practices and keeping the financial system more secure is only part of the value of macro-prudential tools, the theory maintains. They are also designed to limit housing price bubbles because, in effect, they put a cap on the amount of borrowing. And so this week the New Zealand Reserve Bank announced that \"from 1 October banks will be subject to restrictions on high loan-to-value ratio (LVR) housing mortgage loans\". The banks will \"be required to restrict new residential mortgage lending at LVRs of over 80% to no more than 10% of the dollar value of their new housing lending flows\". It justifies this move by suggesting that it is \"concerned about the rate at which house prices are increasing and the potential risks this poses to the financial system and the broader economy\". Central banks worry about rapidly increasing housing prices because they increase the risk of an equally rapid move in the opposite direction at a later date. The NZ Reserve Bank also notes that its country's household debt amounts to 145% of household income. This figure might give some in Australia pause for thought, because its total debt to disposable income is 147% (down from a record high of 153% in June 2007). New Zealand isn't the only place where such measures are being advocated. Last week, the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman for the first time advocated macro-prudential tools for the US in his widely read blogthe New York Times. He argued that the tools of fiscal and monetary policy had failed. The \"great moderation\" of the 1990s and 2000s had been shown to be a bit of a dream, he wrote. And the GFC was the wake-up. Krugman noted: \"At the very least it means that we need 'macroprudential' policies \u2013 regulations and taxes designed to limit the risk of crisis \u2013 even during good years, because we now know that we can't count on an effective clean-up when crisis strikes.\" So is Australia's Reserve Bank thinking of implementing such measures? While our housing market is improving, it remains much weaker than in previous booms. In the minutes of the August monetary policy meeting (where interest rates are decided), the RBA notes that while building approvals had increased, \"dwelling investment had thus far experienced a muted recovery relative to past cyclical upturns\". So they don't seem too worried about the current 40-year low mortgage rate spurring a boom. In a speech in July on \"Economic Policy After the Boom\", the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, said that while he wasn't personally \"averse\" to macro-prudential tools, he did not think Australia had reached the point where they needed to be considered. One indication of how different the housing market is compared with the early 2000s is the increase in credit by investors and owner-occupiers. But for the RBA, the use of macro-prudential tools has another advantage. If low interest rates do not lead to a housing price boom it means they can keep rates down even while the economy improves. This, in turn, helps make conditions easier for export industries by preventing the exchange rate rising. Regardless of what the RBA executives say now, you can bet they will be watching closely to see how it works out in New Zealand.",

And not only that; because the price has gone up you are now willing to sell things you were not going to sell. And Morrison needs to buy them. Right now there are fishing boats in Indonesia that are not very seaworthy, but they sort of get the job done. But the fisherman actually values his life and so sells the boat to a people-smuggler and uses the money to help buy another boat. Now along comes Morrison saying he will buy any boat that is being planned to be sold to asylum seekers. And of course to do this, as with the garage sale records, he'll have to offer a higher price \u2013 otherwise why bother sell to him? Now this might sound good to the fisherman \u2013 he can now sell his boat to Morrison and get more money. But the people-smugglers' demand doesn't go down just because they didn't get a boat. So they can raise their price higher to get your boat, or because Morrison needs to get your boat, the people-smuggler doesn't even need to pay more, they just need to let it be known that they will pay more. Best of all, the people-smuggler knows that because of the demand from asylum seekers he can either raise his prices in a pretty inelastic market, or he can just increase the number of people on each boat he charters. So the higher the prices people-smugglers have to pay, the less safe it will likely become for asylum seekers because it's pretty clear that the more people on these boats the less safe they are. But also all Indonesian fishermen now know there is a ready buyer for their boats. They also know those boats will be sold at much inflated prices than there was before. And so suddenly, as with the garage sale record seller, there is now an increased supply of boats because (to use economic speak) the demand curve has shifted out. There is now more demand and at a higher price for each boat than there was before. This won't stop people-smugglers buying boats, but it will encourage people who had never before thought of selling their boat to asylum seekers to now do so, because they know that, if they intended to do so, Morrison is there with his cheque book to buy them. And the difference between Morrison and a normal buyer is that Morrison needs to buy your boat. If you sell it to the people-smuggler he fails. That creates a heck of a price boom in boats. But Indonesia is rather big. The one thing it is not suffering from is a shortage of boats, and certainly not now that there is a ready buyer for boats. But this new policy also creates a demand for boat repair, because any old boat already unfit for sea journey that was never going to be sold to a people-smuggler, if repaired, can now be sold, and it is worth paying the repair now because the price you can sell it for has increased. And thus Morrison's policy is increasing the supply of not just boats but poor quality boats. So the asylum seekers will be likely paying more money to people-smugglers, or being forced to go to sea on poorer conditioned boats with more people on them. News Corp has reported that Morrison \"declined to say how many boats could be bought back or for how much, saying he did not want to encourage owners to take advantage of the scheme\". The problem is the mere announcement has already ensured that will happen.",
