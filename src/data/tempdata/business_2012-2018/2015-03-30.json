      "bodyText": "Britons enter the five-week election campaign more upbeat about the economy than at any time in almost 13 years, according to the latest snapshot of confidence from the polling organisation Gfk. Against a backdrop of falling inflation and a boost to spending power from plunging energy prices, Gfk said all five of its measures of consumer confidence had picked up in the past month. The people polled said they were more positive about their own personal finances and the state of the economy than they were in February, with more prepared to make a major purchase. Despite David Cameron\u2019s hopes that rising living standards would translate into a boost for the Conservatives, opinion polls have so far not detected any real change in voting intentions. Even so, Nick Moon, Gfk\u2019s managing director of social research, said the report should be good news for the prime minister following the official launch of the election campaign on Monday. \u201cAt +4, the index is the highest it has been for almost 13 years, and it has gone up a striking eight points in just three months,\u201d he said. \u201cReaction to the budget has thus far been muted, but if people warm to it over the next few weeks, then we may well see a further increase in the index next month. A consistently rising index in the runup to the election is likely to be good news for the government.\u201d Gfk\u2019s records of consumer confidence show that in the past 40 years there has been a tendency for more respondents to be pessimistic than optimistic. However, consumer confidence has gradually been rising since hitting a trough of almost -40 percentage points during the worst of the recession in 2008. The flatlining of the economy in 2011 and 2012 meant that by early 2013, consumer confidence was still at -30 points, but the subsequent pickup in activity brightened the mood. The survey showed that it has taken time for falling unemployment and lower oil prices to show up in the views of consumers about their own finances, with a balance of -2 points saying their situation had improved over the past year. This was a slight improvement on the -3 points recorded in February. But a majority of consumers (+7 points) believe their personal finances will improve over the next 12 months, and there is also an expectation (+6 points) that the economy will thrive. Signs from the Bank of England that the date of the first increase in interest rates has been pushed back is thought to be one additional factor boosting confidence among those paying a mortgage. Data released by Threadneedle Street on Monday showed that demand for mortgages was at its strongest level in six months in February amid evidence of a price war among lenders. The average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit fell below 2% for the first time ever, the Bank\u2019s data showed, while five-year fixed-rates edged close to 3%. During February, 61,760 mortgages were approved for house purchases, compared with an average of 60,750 over the previous six months, the Bank said. Despite the improvement in recent months, demand for home loans is almost 20% below its recent peak in January 2014. Mortgage brokers said fierce competition between lenders was increasing the options for borrowers, as well as pushing interest rates down to record lows. Borrowers taking out mortgages with smaller deposits have also seen price cuts in recent months, with the average rate for a 95% home loan falling to 4.67% in February, although at 90% loan-to-value the average rate edged up slightly to 3.77%. Brian Murphy, head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau brokers, said the data showed that momentum was returning to the mortgage market. \u201cThe combination of low inflation, moderating house price growth and a delay in the base rate rise seems to be working in consumers\u2019 favour,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to recap the main points, now the debate has finally wound up. A defiant Alexis Tsipras has vowed to win an honourable compromise from Greece\u2019s lenders, after negotiations over economic reforms dragged on without a deal. Greece\u2019s PM told parliament tonight that: \u201cIt is true that we are seeking an honest compromise with our lenders but don\u2019t expect an unconditional agreement from us,\u201d Tsipras vowed to stop \u2018the bleeding\u2019 in Greece, and repeatedly argued that the country needs a new debt restructuring deal. Greece has a simple choice, he argued, between surrendering, or changing the policies that have caused such economic misery. He pledged to end the \u2018pillaging\u2019 of the middle classes, and revealed that a new clampdown on unpaid taxes had already delivered 100 million euros. Tsipras also ruled out raising sales taxes on food and medicine, or shaking up the labour market, as these \u201cred line\u201d measures could plunge Greece back into recession. Tsipras called on the centre-right opposition party, New Democracy, to back him in negotiations with the ECB, IMF and EC. He also offered the prospect of a new deal, centered around growth, this summer. GREEK PM TSIPRAS SAYS THIRD BAILOUT WILL NOT BE UNDER DISCUSSION IN JUNE GREEK PM TSIPRAS SAYS LENDERS HAVE COMMITTED TO START DEBT RELIEF TALKS IN JUNE But he did not give many firm details on the reform plans which creditors demand from Greece before unlocking any bailout payments. Tsipras was criticised by opposition leaders, including ND\u2019s Antonis Samaras, for provoking fights in Europe, and for creating deadlock by failing to deliver a credible reform plan. Tsipras, Samaras declared, had promised to win money without conditions, but had ended up committing to conditions without getting any money Samaras also claimed that Tsipras\u2019s party, Syriza, is badly split over his reform plans. Tonight\u2019s debate came after Greece and its creditors held more meetings over the list of economic reforms which Athens must provide, before bailout funds are unlocked. Back tomorrow (or later today, if you\u2019re still awake in Greece) for another crack at it all. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Greece\u2019s embattled prime minister Alexis Tsipras has ended tonight\u2019s raucous parliamentary debate with a vow to act on his far left party\u2019s pre-election pledges. And that will start with the reinstatement of collective work agreements, reports Helena Smith. Red lines, says Tsipras, have to be respected. \u201cI asked representatives of opposition parties to support us because what we want are red lines not of every party but the country,\u201d he tells the 300-seat House. And what a long debate it has been: More thoughts from Helena: Tonight\u2019s debate has been quite tetchy, with two opposition leaders clashing with speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou. Pasok\u2019s Evangelos Venizelos chastised Konstantopoulou for being \u201crude\u201d and said \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you ring the bell all the time\u201d. It\u2019s her bell, Benny! A row then broke out with New Democracy\u2019s leader, Antonis Samaras..... Hot off the press, tomorrow\u2019s edition of the Guardian argues that Greece and its creditors need to meet halfway to avoid the crisis Here\u2019s a flavour: If Greece dropped out of the eurozone, in an accidental \u201cGrexit\u201d, the consequences would be far-reaching. Not only would it damage the EU\u2019s monetary union, the EU itself would be weakened geopolitically. Mr Tsipras must show he has the credentials to be a realistic partner. But, equally, Greece\u2019s lenders must walk a fine line to prevent a breakup of the European project. Just as importantly for the EU\u2019s democratic credibility, there must be room for negotiation. In Greece as in any country, it is never a good thing when voters\u2019 choices end up being ignored. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: Golden Dawn leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos has addressed parliament, fresh from prison and speaking with the moral upper hand (barely a month before the far-right group\u2019s leadership goes on trial for using the group as a political front to run a criminal organisation). Michaloliakos is making much of the fact that some MPs have been gagged because they have been behind bars and unable to protest against the \u201censlaving memorandum.\u201d He is now railing against the proposed reforms as leaked by Bloomberg today. The far-right leader says: \u201cGolden Dawn is opposed to every privatisation of sectors of our economy which are linked to our national independence.\u201d Alexis Tsipras has the floor again. He\u2019s telling parliament that Greece will seek a new contract for growth when its existing bailout expires this summer, not another memorandum laden with austerity. He also repeats his earlier point, that Greece needs a debt restructuring deal: Back in Athens, Greece\u2019s former deputy PM has been lecturing the current government about its predicament: Evangelos Venizelos argued that there was no way out of repaying Greece\u2019s commitments: Greece\u2019s debt deadlock didn\u2019t prevent the US stock market rebounding, with Wall Street closing 1% higher tonight. Tsipras doesn\u2019t get any cheer from the communist KKE party,; their leader blasts him for agreeing to extend the current bailout programme until the end of June. Potami party leader Stavros Theodorakis has offered Tsipras some support, saying his party will back him over restructuring Greece\u2019s debt mountain. But Potami continue to support Greece\u2019s bailout programme; Theodorakis argues that agreed measures should generally be implemented. Next up ........ the leader of Greece\u2019s extremist, neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn. It\u2019s Nikos Mihaloliakos\u2019s first contribution in parliament since he was released from custody a week ago, after 18 months detention (the maximum allowed under Greek law). He is due to stand trial next month on charges of participating in and directing a criminal organization. No need to summarise Samaras\u2019s speech - Diane has done it for us  Antonis Samaras also tried to prise open the fractures within the Syriza party, saying is is divided over the route forward. Samaras has urged the Greek government to meet the 450m euro repayment owed to the IMF on April 9th. Failure to do so would be extremely serious, he warns..... Samaras is piling into Tsipras with some tasty one-liners. All good knock-about stuff, but we\u2019re not getting much actual progress on Greece\u2019s problems..... Samaras says his party are prepared to offer Tsipras support, but only on measures that they would choose to implement themselves. And he criticises the PM for demanding support, without revealing exactly what his reform plans will be. Former prime minister Antonis Samaras is now responding to Alexis Tsipras. Samaras defends his own track record, saying Greece was on course to exit its bailout under his leadership. He also criticises Tsipras for still failing to allow MPs to debate the bailout extension agreed in February, or even to tell parliament exactly what was agreed then. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Tsipras\u2019s address to parliament: Not the most rousing speech in Alexis Tsipras\u2019s career. And not the most informative either. I don\u2019t think we actually learned anything about the state of the negotiations over Greece\u2019s reform programme. The speech did avoid any direct attacks on Greece\u2019s lenders, but the PM made up for that with a swathe of attacks on opposition parties, particularly Antonis Samaras\u2019s New Democracy party. No olive branch for them! Tsipras ended his speech by urging citizens to continue to stand by his government, and calling on other parties to speak the truth too. More applause, as Tsipras vows not to deceive the Greek people. Tsipras then takes a pop at his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, for failing to tackle tax evasion even after the government received a list of Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. Tsipras says he wants to reach a fair compromise with Greece\u2019s lenders, but not a full-scale surrender to their demands. He\u2019s received a couple of rounds of applause, and one ripple of dissent, but MPs are being generally quiet (so far). Tsipras in brief: You\u2019re either with us, or you\u2019re with the Institutions (the former Troika) Tsipras then asks the opposition parties if they will support his efforts, or simply be a mouthpiece for Greece\u2019s creditors. Greece faces a straight choice, says Alexis Tsipras, between unconditional surrender, and reversing the disastrous policies that have caused such damage to the Greek economy. The four-month bailout extension agreed last month is an opportunity to reshape Greece\u2019s future, Tsipras says. And he then declares that Greece needs debt restructuring if it is ever to repay its debts. Our strategy is bearing fruit, Tsipras insists, and denies that Syriza is dragging Greece deeper into trouble: It is time to face the truth, Tsipras says. And he accuses the previous government of misleading the people about the health of the public finances. The brilliant Diane Shugart is tweeting the details: Alexis Tsipras begins his speech by telling MPs that his government has been delivering on its pledge to \u2018turn the page\u2019, and end Greece\u2019s existing as a country governed by memorandums imposed by its creditors. We are delivering on our election pledges every day, and support for our plans have grown since January\u2019s election, he says. Alexis Tsipras is speaking to MPs now -- there is a live feed here (no translation from Greek, though). Is Greece\u2019s unpopular property tax (an annual levy of real estate) going to be abolished or not? Efi Efthimiou of financial news website Capital GR hears that it is definitely being ditched, as Syriza promised in the past. There have been persistent rumours, though, that it would be included in the reforms being drawn up in Brussels...... The debate on Greece\u2019s reform plan, and the laborious route towards a deal, is now expected to start in 20 minutes. Tension is building in Athens ahead of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech in parliament, which should start shortly.... Despite the continuing worries about Greece\u2019s financial predicament, leading shares were on the rise, helped by positive comments from China suggesting it will implement measures to boost its economy if necessary, and a number of takeover deals in the US. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 36.41 points or 0.53% at 6891.43 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.83% to 12,086 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.98% higher at 5083.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.2% to 23,260.57 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.89% better at 11,529.1 The Athens stock market edged up 0.53% to 772.71 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 276 points or 1.56% higher. The FT\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, Peter Spiegel, has a good take on the talks around Greece\u2019s reform plans, as negotiations drag on tonight. People on both sides of the talks say that despite three days of talks, the list is not comprehensive as yet. \u201cThere was no such thing as an original list,\u201d insists an official from one of the bailout monitoring institutions. \u201cThere were contributions, tables, pieces of paper.\u201d Indeed, on the Greek side, some involved in the discussions say a fuller, longer, and more detailed document is in the works. They argue the issue is not, as many among the bailout monitors claim, a lack of detail. The issue is getting all the details \u2013 some 72 reforms, according to one person in the Athens camp \u2013 into a well-organised document, in English, without mistakes in substance or politics. Peter has also heard that eurozone finance ministers are very unlikely to meet this week, pushing a decision on Greece\u2019s reform list (when it\u2019s finished) until next week at the earliest EU officials said they don\u2019t expect to be back and in full force from the Easter holiday until next Tuesday, leaving very little time for any decision to release bailout funding before Greece must make a \u20ac450m payment to the International Monetary Fund next Thursday, April 9. All eyes are on whether Athens has enough cash on hand to make that payment. It could be a nerve-fraying week. Riot police have been deployed outside Athens University after a group of protesters occupied the main building today. They are supporting a hunger strike being conducted by prisoners; calling for maximum security prisons to be closed, and anarchist campaigners to be released from custody. Here\u2019s a summary of the leaked Greek reform proposals: Government officials are refusing to confirm the details of the Bloomberg story, says Helena Smith in Athens: If true, the report would suggest that prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration has put the emphasis on shifting reform onus to wealthier Greeks, starting with a crackdown on deposits held abroad. That would fit perfectly with the government\u2019s mission. Taxes have also been raised for the rich - in addition to new levies that will be slapped on luxury goods (including a \u201cfat tax\u201d for foods with high sugar content). Bloomberg is reporting more details of the proposed Greek reforms: Greece\u2019s bid to bolster its finances relies on taxing capital transfers and fighting tax evasion, according to a list of reforms submitted to European negotiators. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s coalition targets revenue of as much as \u20ac875m from the \u201cintensification of audits on lists of bank transfers and offshore entities,\u201d according to a 15-page draft document detailing reform proposals in exchange for more emergency loans from the euro area and the International Monetary Fund. Seeking a strategy that passes muster with European officials now withholding bailout funds, Greece\u2019s government foresees a net increase of \u20ac3.7bn in receipts this year. Measures include as much as \u20ac400m from streamlining income-tax rules and at least another \u20ac350m from auctions of television-broadcast licenses, according to the list, which was seen by Bloomberg News. Back with the US, and more signs of an improving housing market. Pending home sales rose 3.1% in February, according to the National Association of Realtors, compared to expectations of a 0.4% increase. This was the highest level in around 18 months. But January\u2019s figure was revised down from 1.7% to 1.2%. An update on the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitive easing programme: US stock markets have opened strongly after a series of deals gave investors a lift. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 250 points in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has jumped by 1%, following news that insurer UnitedHealth was paying $12.8bn for pharmacy benefit firm Catamaran, Israeli pharmaceuticals group Teva would buy drug developer Auspex Pharmaceuticals for $3.5bn and Ireland\u2019s Horizon agreed to buy US drugmaker Hyperion Therapeutics for $1.1bn. Global markets were already on the front foot on hopes that China would introduce more stimulus measures to boost its economy. Late on Friday, Fitch downgraded Greece\u2019s default ratings and unsecured currency bonds from B to CCC, ahead of its next scheduled review on 15 May. It said: Fitch believes that developments in Greece warrant such a deviation from the calendar and our rationale for this is laid out below. It listed a number of reasons for the downgrade: Lack of market access, uncertain prospects of timely disbursement from official institutions, and tight liquidity conditions in the domestic banking sector have put extreme pressure on Greek government funding. We expect that the government will survive the current liquidity squeeze without running arrears on debt obligations, but the heightened risks have led us to downgrade the ratings. The damage to investor, consumer, and depositor confidence has almost certainly derailed Greece\u2019s incipient economic recovery. The damage will take time to repair even if prospects for a successful programme completion improve over the coming days or weeks. We have revised down our growth forecast significantly to 0.5% this year from 1.5% in January 2015 and 2.5% in December 2014, with risks to growth on the downside. Liquidity conditions faced by firms will have worsened substantially, in our view, due to increased government arrears to suppliers and bank funding strains. The agreement reached in February to extend the EFSF programme to end-June after several weeks of brinkmanship supports our base case scenario that Greece and its creditors will ultimately reach a compromise deal. However, progress since then has been slow. It is unclear when the earliest disbursement could take place and what will be required for this to happen. In the coming days, Greece has been asked to submit a more detailed list of reforms to the Eurogroup. If this is accepted, it would bring the government closer to a partial disbursement before fully completing the programme review. However, in our view, it is likely that the Eurogroup will want the Greek government to demonstrate they have implemented some part of this list before funds are disbursed. This pushes back the probable disbursement date well into April at the earliest. The full report is here. Over in Helsinki, Angela Merkel has warned that Greece\u2019s reform programme must \u201cadd up\u201d, while insisting that Germany wants to avoid Grexit. And her counterpart, Alex Stubb, has told reporters that Greece cannot expect its aid conditions to be changed, and time is running out. The German chancellor told a press conference that:. \u201cThe question is can and will Greece fulfil the expectations that we all have... \u201cThere can be variation as far as which measures a government opts for but in the end the overall framework must add up.\u201d Merkel added that she is waiting to see how the talks with officials from Greece\u2019s creditors (taking place now) pan out: \u201cWe saw this in Ireland when a new government changed parts of the programme. But in the end the financial stability of the country must be restored. Greece is talking with the institutions now. We are waiting on these talks. And we will wait for the evaluation of the institution.\u201d (quote via Reuters). And here are more details: HELSINKI - MERKEL SAYS MAJORITY OF GREEKS WANT TO STAY IN EURO ZONE, GERMAN POLICY HAS ALWAYS BEEN GEARED TOWARDS THIS MERKEL SAYS NOT SURPRISED THAT DEBATE OVER GREEK REFORMS IS TAKING A LONG TIME, THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE FINLAND\u2019S STUBB SAYS TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR GREECE, CONDITIONS FOR AID WILL NOT BE CHANGED A quick recap. Greek officials are sitting down with their creditors in Brussels for another round of talks over the country\u2019s reform plans, as time continues to run short. Greece had been expected to present a final programme by today. But after a weekend of talks on the proposals submitted on Friday, Athens appears as far away as ever from receiving any of the \u20ac7bn of bailout funds that are outstanding. Germany has insisted that Greece has not yet presented adequate plans, and cautioned that money won\u2019t be released until reforms have been approved by the Athens parliament. The Commission says that talks are continuing in an attempt to reach a credible and comprehensive conclusion. Without a breakthrough, Greece is still expected to run out of funds in April. Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist, at DailyFX, explains: \u201cInvestors fear that if external funding is not secured, a cash crunch and subsequent default may lead to the country\u2019s exit from the Eurozone. Such an outcome would be unprecedented, carrying with as-yet unknown implications for the financial markets at large. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras is due to speak to the Greek parliament this evening, from 8pm local time or 6pm GMT. Members of his own Syriza party sound increasingly concerned about the situation, and unhappy that measures including privatisating Greece\u2019s Piraeus Port are going ahead. Greece is proposing around \u20ac3bn of new tax revenue \u2013 partly from fighting tax evasion, and partly from raising VAT rates on Greece\u2019s island and through a property tax he\u2019d vowed to abolish. Its lenders, though, are concerned that the government is still not delivering reforms on pensions and the labour market. The uncertainty has weighed on Greek bonds today, pushing yields higher. On the economic front, though, the picture is brighter - with eurozone economic sentiment hitting a 44-month high. And the eurozone\u2019s flirtation with negative inflation may be ending - Germany\u2019s CPI has turned positive, while Spanish prices are falling at a slower rate. German\u2019s inflation rate has inched back into positive territory, in the latest sign that the eurozone is not sinking into a deflationary slump. The German consumer prices index rose by 0.1% annually on a harmonised basis, with prices up by 0.5% month-on-month. Tomorrow we get the overall inflation figure for the eurozone, which is expected to rise from -0.3% to -0.1%. Alexis Tsipras has reminded us that sixty-three years ago today, Greek communist and resistance hero Nikos Beloyannis was executed. The arrest and subsequent death of Beloyannis, on espionage charges, provoked an international outcry, and was commemorated in this painting. Heads-up. Angela Merkel is visiting Finland today, for talks with prime minister Alex Stubb. He\u2019s just given her a warm welcome to a rather chilly Helsinki. Press conference due soon, where they should discuss the state of the eurozone. Greece\u2019s new president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, is visiting Cyprus for his first official visit since taking office -- as is traditional for all new Greek presidents. Pavlopoulos held talks with Cyprus\u2019s president, Nicos Anastasiades (a veteran of Cyprus\u2019s own bailout crisis). The two men have addressed the media, and pledged that the two countries\u2019 ties will remain very strong regardless of the economic crisis. Anastasiades told reporters that Cyprus backs the Greek government, saying: \u201cWe expressed our determination for the unwavering support of the Greek government in its effort to deal with the economic and humanitarian crisis.\u201d Over in Athens, heated debate over the government\u2019s proposed reforms has prompted frantic negotiations within the ruling Syriza party. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Demands for Greece to forge ahead with reforms have, more than ever, begun to weigh heavily on the governing Syriza party. Cadres are now speaking of \u201copen warfare\u201d among the various factions of the far-left group with militants holding back-to-back meetings in fury over perceived red lines being transgressed. Officials coalesced around Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis\u2019s Left Platform, who are attached to unions and federations, are insistent that Syriza keeps to the anti-austerity programme on which it was elected. Many are saying openly that \u201crupture\u201d with the euro zone would be preferable to \u201cbetraying voters\u201d by rolling back on pre-election promises. The prospect of the government caving in to creditor demands for privatizations \u2013 following deputy premier Yannis Dragasakis\u2019 announcement in China on Saturday that the Greek state will sell its majority stake in the port of Pireaus - has prompted the biggest backlash. Lafazanis came out all guns over the weekend rejecting denationalizations outright. Theodoros Dritsas, alternate minister for shipping and the Aegean, who had announced that all privatisations would be cancelled before the government had even held its first cabinet meeting, also ratcheted up the pressure. \u201cThe position announced in the programme statements [of Syriza] regarding the issue of privatising the Pireaus port authority was clear,\u201d he thundered reiterating that the leftist-led administration would never endorse the sale. Dragasakis, who is in charge of economic policy, said he expected the sale of a 67% in the Pireaus Port Authority (OLP) to begin within weeks [sending its shares rallying this morning]. China\u2019s conglomerate, Cosco, which already runs two of the port\u2019s piers, was likely to be the favoured bidder, he said. In a front page editorial this morning Ta Nea opined that just like its predecessors, the Syriza-dominated government would be forced to cave in to selling off the port. It wrote: \u201cThe Chinese have been here for some time \u2013 and it is accepted that their activities have worked positively for the wider region.\u201d Prime minister Alexis Tsipras spent much of the weekend (and is likely to spend much of the debate in parliament tonight) trying to placate militants over the government\u2019s moves. The European Commission\u2019s top spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, is briefing Brussels journalists on the situation in Greece now. Schinas has confirmed that the negotiations between the two sides are ongoing (reminder, they are due to restart in under an hour). The goal of the talks is to deliver an economic reform programme that is \u201ccredible and comprehensive\u201d, Schinas says. And he adds that deputy finance officials (known as the eurozone working group) will discuss the issue on Wednesday. Over in Berlin, the German government is warning that Greece has not yet submitted a firm list of proposals to its creditors. The finance ministry spokesman also cautioned that bailout funds will not be released until some measures have actually been approved by Greek MPs in Athens. Here\u2019s the news flashes: GERMAN FIN MIN SPOKESMAN SAYS THERE IS NO DATE FOR A EUROGROUP MEETING ON GREECE YET GERMAN FIN MIN SPOKESMAN SAYS BEFORE GREECE CAN GET FURTHER AID PARLIAMENT IN ATHENS MUST PASS FURTHER REFORM MEASURES Britain\u2019s banks are to be tested on their ability to cope with a dramatic slowdown in China, a eurozone recession, the worse deflation since the 1930s and UK interest rates being cut to zero. These new stress tests, just announced by the Bank of England, have a more international flavour than last year\u2019s edition. However, they don\u2019t include the specific risk of Greece leaving the euro. Our City editor Jill Treanor has just been briefed on the plans, and tweets: European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has welcomed the jump in economic confidence: This morning\u2019s rise in economic sentiment means confidence is now at its highest since July 2011, points out Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He adds: A third successive, and markedly, increased rise in overall Eurozone economic sentiment to a 44-month high in March indicates that a more favourable growth environment in the Eurozone is increasingly being fostered by the much more competitive euro, low oil prices and major ECB stimulus. Consumer confidence across the Eurozone rose to a near eight-year high in March while sentiment improved in most business sectors. Italy has also reported an increase in economic confidence, suggesting that Europe\u2019s economy is, finally, strengthening after several tough years. European companies are increasingly confident about their economic prospects, the EC\u2019s latest survey has found. The Commission\u2019s economic sentiment index jumped to 103.9 this month, beating expectations. This \u201ccontinues the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2015\u201d, says the EC. It suggests that the ECB\u2019s new stimulus programme, and the impact of weak oil prices, are cheering business leaders, and that Greece\u2019s ongoing debt problems are not causing too much alarm. Consumer sentiment has also picked up, hitting an eight-year high (but still below its long-term average) Britain\u2019s housing market is picking up pace, according to new data from the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals hit a six-month high of 61,760 in February, up from 60,707 in January, and beating analyst expectations. China\u2019s main stock market has hit a seven-year high, driven by stimulus hopes. Shares in infrastructure companied rallied after the government fleshed out its new \u201cNew Silk Road\u201d plan to boost trade and economic relations with the rest of Asia, Africa and Europe. That plan will include hefty investment in railways, roads, power grids, oil and gas pipelines. Hints of more central bank stimulus measures (see earlier) also helped to push the Shanghai Composite index up by 2.6% to its highest level since March 2008. The uncertainty over Greece\u2019s financial situation is weighing on its bonds this morning. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Greek debt has inched up to 11.11%, from 11.04% on Friday night And Greece\u2019s two-year bond yields has risen from 20.4% to 20.8%, implying an even higher risk of default. This follows the news that Greece still hasn\u2019t presented an acceptable list of solid economic reforms to its lenders, despite the weekend\u2019s negotiations. One senior euro zone official told Reuters last night that: \u201cGreece did not submit a reform list on Friday. They just showed some ideas over the weekend. The discussions from Friday to Sunday were meant to help the Greeks prepare a list for tomorrow..... We still look forward to receiving something on Monday.\u201d German TV news programme Tagesschau has heard a similar story this morning: Greece\u2019s stock market isn\u2019t sharing in this morning\u2019s rally. The main ATG index has dropped by 1.4% in early trading, with bank shares among the fallers. But....shares in Piraeus Port Authority have jumped by 8.5%, following reports that the government will press on with plans to privatise it. Such a move will not please members of the Syriza party, though. Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas has insisted that the government hasn\u2019t given up its demand for debt relief. He told financial daily Naftemporiki that: \u201cThe government has not abandoned any claim regarding its aim to make the country\u2019s debt viable..... either there will be a haircut or it will be extended, or ....linked to an increase in output or exports, or there will be a lower interest rate. Talks between Greece and its creditors over its economic reform plans are due to start at 1pm in Brussels (or noon BST), according to the FT\u2019s bureau chief Peter Spiegel: European stock markets are rallying in early trading, following Asia\u2019s lead, on hopes of more stimulus measures in China. The FTSE 100 has jumped 47 points, or 0.7%, to 6902. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC indices are both up over 1%. Traders are citing comments made by People\u2019s Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan over the weekend. He warned that China\u2019s growth rate had fallen \u201ca bit\u201d too much and that policy makers have scope to respond. A hint of more central bank action? Across the eurozone in Spain, prices are still falling, but at a slower rate. Spain\u2019s harmonised consumer prices index dropped by 0.7% this month, data released this morning showed, compared with -1.2% in February. Greece\u2019s MPs will get an update on the situation this evening, when prime minister Alexis Tsipras addresses parliament. The session starts at 8pm local time, or 6pm BST, according to Enikos. Greece had hoped that eurozone finance ministers might meet this week to agree to hand over some aid funds. But that now looks unlikely, as Europe heads towards the Easter break. According to Greek newspaper Kathimerini, a Eurogroup meeting is unlikely \u201cnext week or even the week after\u201d. That could be problematic for Greece, as it is due to repay \u20ac450m to the IMF a week on Thursday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Another week of tension over Greece\u2019s bailout lies ahead, as Athens struggles to persuade its creditors to unlock bailout funds before it runs out of money next month. The two sides spent the weekend locked in talks, over the reform proposals which the Greek government submitted on Friday night. Athens appears to have made some concessions, including various measures to raise \u20ac3bn in extra taxes. But officials from ECB, IMF and and EU are apparently still not convinced that the plans go far enough. The FT has a good take of the weekend\u2019s talks. Greece struggles to accommodate lenders as cash dwindles Here\u2019 s flavour: Greek officials said Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, had given ground on two key demands made by creditors: increasing value added taxes for Greek islands, a measure previously repudiated by Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, and retaining an unpopular property tax that Mr Tsipras had vowed to abolish. The property tax concession appeared to be the centrepiece of the new plan. It would raise an estimated \u20ac2.5bn of a predicted \u20ac3bn in new revenues, which Greek authorities estimated would put their primary budget surplus \u2014 the amount of revenue taken in, minus spending, not counting interest on debt \u2014 at almost \u20ac3.5bn for 2015. But the list failed to include reforms to labour laws and Greece\u2019s pension system \u2014 two areas that monitors have insisted are essential to finalising the bailout programme. They remained \u201cred lines\u201d, said Greek officials. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras is standing firm too, insisting over the weekend that his government would not accept any \u201crecessionary measures\u201d, such as slashing wages or making it easier to fire workers. And with Fitch downgrading Greece\u2019s credit rating late on Friday night, investors are getting edgier... Also coming up today: The Bank of England is publishing details of new stress tests for Britain\u2019s banks. They\u2019re expected to assess if the banks have enough capital to handle global risks such as a foreign currency crisis, a geopolitical crisis and tumbling commodities and stock markets. The latest Eurozone consumer confidence survey is due at 10am BST. And German inflation data is released at 1pm BST. It\u2019s likely to show that prices are rising slightly year-on-year, after dipping into negative territory last month. Spanish inflation data is also out this morning.",

We expect that the government will survive the current liquidity squeeze without running arrears on debt obligations, but the heightened risks have led us to downgrade the ratings.</p> <p>The damage to investor, consumer, and depositor confidence has almost certainly derailed Greece\u2019s incipient economic recovery. The damage will take time to repair even if prospects for a successful programme completion improve over the coming days or weeks. We have revised down our growth forecast significantly to 0.5% this year from 1.5% in January 2015 and 2.5% in December 2014, with risks to growth on the downside. Liquidity conditions faced by firms will have worsened substantially, in our view, due to increased government arrears to suppliers and bank funding strains. </p> <p>The agreement reached in February to extend the EFSF programme to end-June after several weeks of brinkmanship supports our base case scenario that Greece and its creditors will ultimately reach a compromise deal. However, progress since then has been slow. It is unclear when the earliest disbursement could take place and what will be required for this to happen.</p> <p>In the coming days, Greece has been asked to submit a more detailed list of reforms to the Eurogroup. If this is accepted, it would bring the government closer to a partial disbursement before fully completing the programme review. However, in our view, it is likely that the Eurogroup will want the Greek government to demonstrate they have implemented some part of this list before funds are disbursed. This pushes back the probable disbursement date well into April at the earliest.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=982091\"><strong>here.</strong></a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5519455de4b04783d0da01c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-30T13:00:19.822Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Merkel: Greece's plan must &quot;add up&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1519a5bcbf08efeea951c0ea52909995c38a94b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1519a5bcbf08efeea951c0ea52909995c38a94b7/0_229_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb and German Chancellor Angela Merkel giving a joint news conference in Helsinki.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb and German Chancellor Angela Merkel giving a joint news conference in Helsinki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LEHTIKUVA/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in Helsinki, Angela Merkel has warned that Greece\u2019s reform programme must \u201cadd up\u201d, while insisting that Germany wants to avoid Grexit.</strong></p> <p>And her counterpart,<strong> Alex Stubb</strong>, has told reporters that Greece cannot expect its aid conditions to be changed, and time is running out.</p> <p>The German chancellor told a press conference that:. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cThe question is can and will Greece fulfil the expectations that we all have...</p> <p>\u201cThere can be variation as far as which measures a government opts for but in the end the overall framework must add up.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Merkel added that she is waiting to see how the talks with officials from Greece\u2019s creditors (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/mar/30/eurozone-greece-battles-to-unlock-bailout-funds-business-live#block-551930b4e4b04783d0da01b1\">taking place now</a>) pan out:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe saw this in Ireland when a new government changed parts of the programme.

Is it a collapse in UK prices provoked by the popping of the London property bubble? Or a breakup of the eurozone triggered by a Greek exit? Neither, actually. The Bank\u2019s sights are trained on distant horizons \u2013 the global economy and, specifically, a deflationary spiral aided and encouraged by a slowdown in China and a fall in the value of the renminbi. Quite right, too. Deflation and China are the biggest risks in the system. The assumption that the Chinese economy can expand at least 7% a year, whatever the financial weather, is too widely believed. Too much comfort is taken from the fact that China successfully led the world out of the 2007-09 crisis by launching a massive programme of infrastructure investment. But what is often overlooked is that China\u2019s ability to repeat the trick has, almost certainly, evaporated. There is too much debt in the country \u2013 $26tn by some counts \u2013 and its leaders know that the economy needs to tilt further towards consumption. The Bank\u2019s \u201cstress scenario\u201d imagines what would happen if global growth disappoints, investors flock to US assets and Chinese rebalancing arrives too late. Short answer: Chinese property prices plunge, investment withers, the renminbi depreciates against the dollar, commodity prices fall further and China\u2019s major trading partners are whacked. At this point, the Bank\u2019s disclaimer should be noted. It is not making an economic forecast, nor is it describing \u201ca set of events that is expected, or likely, to materialise\u201d. Fair enough. Indeed, the Bank will stress for a scenario in which Chinese growth falls to 1.7%, a gloomier figure even than most bears of China predict. But there are serious investors who think 3% is possible and who point to current weak data as evidence. Equally, it makes sense to test what happens if the UK suffers a serious dose of deflation. Seven quarters in a row of deflation sounds highly improbable. On the other hand, inflation has consistently undershot the Bank\u2019s own forecasts since 2012, and we\u2019re now at 0%. Stress-testing banks is one of the clear advancements in policymaking since 2009. But the imagined stresses have to be credible. These are. The fear that the next crisis will come from emerging markets is uncomfortably plausible. Quindell finds redemption in a sale Quindell, some thought, was a pack of cards that would collapse with the departure of founder Rob Terry last November. But it turns out there is a substantial business there. Better than that, somebody wants to own it. Australian legal outfit Slater &amp; Gordon is buying the professional services division, which chases personal injury claims, for \u00a3637m in cash. In addition, Quindell will get a cut of any winnings that flow from 53,000 claims for clients\u2019 noise-induced hearing loss. The sale of 90% of Quindell will fund a special dividend of up to \u00a3500m, worth at least 100p a share, which will sound sweet to those who bought at 35p-50p in the wake of Terry\u2019s messy departure. Tough luck on those that paid 600p-ish a year ago, but they now know they were buying into an \u201caggressive\u201d investment. The word was used twice in different contexts by Quindell. The first mention described the growth strategy. The second was PwC\u2019s verdict on ways in which Quindell recognised revenues and deferred case acquisition costs \u2013 \u201cat the aggressive end of acceptable practice\u201d. Unfortunately, other policies were unacceptable, or \u201cnot appropriate\u201d, in the auditor\u2019s coy language. Chairman David Currie has surely done the right thing in accepting Slater &amp; Gordon\u2019s cash: after Quindell\u2019s hellish year, certain value is better than more wild optimism. But a full postmortem on past accounting is required. No need to keep shareholders in the dark \u201cIs this more exciting for you, Rory? You\u2019re out.\u201d One assumes that was not how Royal Bank of Scotland parted company with Rory Cullinan, the banker briefly infamous for complaining to his daughter via Snapchat that he was stuck in a boring meeting. But why is Cullinan going only a month after being promoted to head the investment bank? We must assume a falling-out with chief executive Ross McEwan over the future of the rapidly shrinking division. The boss always wins those scraps \u2013 except when the opponent is the chancellor, as Stephen Hester, McEwan\u2019s predecessor, found out. But shareholders deserve more information. RBS\u2019s statement was ridiculous. It said it had \u201creached agreement\u201d with Cullinan that he should leave the company, as if that were a goal.

In the last month, McDonald\u2019s has tried other interesting ways to reverse its declining sales. A week ago, on 24 March, McDonald\u2019s organized a marketing \u2018I\u2019m lovin\u2019 it 24\u2019 campaign in 24 cities in 24 different countries. In Philippines, a toll booth became a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru that offered free toll and a free breakfast. In Milan, McDonald\u2019s threw a pajama party complete with a golden arches bed. In Stockholm, the company launched a Big Mac clothing and lifestyle collection at a McWalk fashion show. The collection is up for sale on bigmacshop.se. The profits will be donated to Ronald McDonald House Charities. The company\u2019s most recent campaign \u201cpay with lovin\u2019\u201d, which allowed selected customers to pay with a dance, a hug or a fist bump, failed to boost sales.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is to impose a series of tests on large UK banks to establish whether they are able to withstand a dramatic slowdown in China, a contraction in the eurozone, the worst deflation since the 1930s or a fall in UK interest rates to zero. The Co-operative bank \u2013 which failed last year\u2019s tests \u2013 is no longer included in the annual assessments of the industry\u2019s financial strength as it is too small, leaving six banks and the Nationwide building society to be tested. The banks are Barclays, HSBC, Santander UK, Standard Chartered and the two bailed-out banks, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. The Bank will give more weight to international scenarios, devised after talks with the International Monetary Fund, than it did in the 2014 tests, which had a domestic emphasis. Last year\u2019s tests were designed to meet those imposed by the European Banking Authority, which is not conducting tests this year. The City is expecting this year\u2019s tests to focus on the strength of HSBC and Standard Chartered, although a scenario for the UK is included, under which inflation is negative for seven consecutive quarters \u2013 the largest fall in prices for 80 years \u2013 and the bank rate cut to zero from the 0.5% level at which it has been stuck since the banking crisis. Banks are being asked to test their ability to withstand shocks over a five-year period to the end of 2019 and be expected to maintain a minimum amount of capital and meet a leverage ratio \u2013 a tougher measure of financial strength \u2013 while ensuring lending to the real economy grows 10% over the five-year period. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank, said last year\u2019s results showed the UK banking system was stronger than it had been before the 2008 crisis. \u201cThis year\u2019s test will have a different focus and is equally important. By assessing the resilience of the UK banking system against a major shock, we will improve further our ability to identify vulnerabilities and we will ensure that banks have plans in place to address a wider range of problems,\u201d Carney said. The severity of the test\u2019s imagined downturn in China \u2013 with growth falling to about 1.6% growth \u2013 is likened to the scale of the fall in house prices in the UK used last year, when house prices were assumed to collapse by 35%. Chinese economic growth is about 7%. Under such scenarios, the eurozone GDP troughs at -2.1% in the first quarter of 2016, while the UK economy would contract by 2.3% in 2015 before recovering. Oil prices would fall to $38 a barrel and other commodity prices would also be weak. A tougher test is being imposed on the investment banking arms of banks to assess their ability to cope with a seizure in the financial markets and the event of their biggest clients \u2013 be they rival banks or major companies \u2013 defaulting. The Bank said the Co-op had been left out because it had no plans to increase the size of its balance sheet, which has been scaled back from the height of its problems in 2013, when a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was uncovered and hedge funds stepped in to bail it out. \u201cIt\u2019s significantly smaller than the other banks included in the 2015 stress test. So the resilience of Co-operative Bank is unlikely, on its own, to have a material impact on the resiliences of the financial system,\u201d the Bank said. The test for world GDP is more severe than the risks estimated by the IMF, which said in October that there was a one in 20 chance of global growth below 2.5% in 2015. The Bank is asking banks to factor in world GDP falling to 0.9% in 2015 \u2013 after contracting for a period of the year \u2013 and 0.7% in 2016. Even so, the contraction in economic activity across the world\u2019s biggest economies is less than that experienced amid the recent global financial crisis although such cumulative falls have not taken place since the second world war. There is no assumption in the tests that Greece will pull out of the eurozone. \u201cAs a forward-looking regulator our job is never complete,\u201d said Carney. \u201cOur focus is clear. To promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom, we are committed to ensuring that our major banks are resilient, that they can weather shocks without calling on taxpayer support, and that they can continue to lend even in adverse conditions.\u201d Threadneedle Street has pointed out that these estimates are not forecasts but scenarios intended to put banks under pressure. The banks being tested account for 70% of the stock of lending to UK businesses and about 75% of the stock of UK mortgage lending. Banks will need to have a capital ratio of 4.5% and meet a leverage ratio of 3% to pass the test. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) could require banks to strengthen their capital position by raising new funds or selling off businesses. But, even if banks meet the hurdle rates, the PRA could still demand action if it is concerned. It could impose new capital requirements across the sector.",

The government has put several options on the table, including a government-backed reinsurance pool or a mutual insurer that provides cyclone-specific cover. Such a scheme would probably involve the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC), an authority set up by the Howard government in 2003 to protect against claims of terrorism losses. In the existing scheme, insurance companies pay premiums to the ARPC to reinsure the risk of commercial property damage from terrorism, and the authority reimburses losses above a certain threshold. The assistant treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, announced on Monday that the government would ask a new taskforce to examine ways to address insurance premiums in northern parts of the country. \u201cInsurance costs in north Queensland are five times higher than in Sydney and Melbourne for strata insurance, and two-and-a-half times higher for home insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest driver of these higher prices is cyclone risk. Similar issues exist in other cyclone-prone regions of northern Australia.\u201d The taskforce, to be headed by a senior government official, would consult the insurance industry and other stakeholders before presenting a final report in six months. \u201cThe taskforce will examine whether the government could provide support to a reinsurance pool or a mutual insurer that provides cyclone-specific cover,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cThe taskforce would also assess the merits of other policy options that currently exist or are put forward by stakeholders during consultation.\u201d The chief executive of the Insurance Council of Australia, Rob Whelan, welcomed the taskforce, but called for a focus on disaster mitigation and improving community resilience. \u201cThe best long-term and sustainable way to reduce insurance premiums is to reduce the damage that extreme weather causes,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cImproving the resilience of homes and businesses in cyclone-prone regions has a direct impact on insurance.\u201d Frydenberg said the government would launch a comparison website for home and contents insurance this week. \u201cImproving affordability will address concerns around under-insurance, ease cost-of-living pressures for families and support the economic development of northern Australia,\u201d he said.
