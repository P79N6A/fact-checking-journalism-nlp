      "bodyText": "And finally.... European stock markets have closed for the day, with gains across the board - driven by optimism over the Middle East situation. Here's the closing prices: Emerging stock markets also did well today, as Jessica Hinds of Capital Economics explains: Growing signs that Western military intervention in Syria may be avoided provided a further boost to emerging market equities on Tuesday. The MSCI Emerging Market Index rose to its highest level in three months in local currency terms. Besides fading fears about Syria, we think there are two other key reasons why investors have recently regained some of their appetite for emerging market equities. First, the latest data from China suggest that its economic slowdown has bottomed out, easing concerns about the knock-on impact elsewhere, and particularly on the rest of Asia. And second, worries about the Fed scaling back its bond-buying programme also appear to have abated in the wake of last week\u2019s US Employment Report. And on that note, I'm off for the day. Have a good evening all. Back tomorrow for (yet) more of the same..... GW Latest news from Italy... insiders are suggesting that it's very unlikely that a vote on Silvio Berlusconi's future will take place tonight (see 4.39pm for background) Reuters reports: Following a tense day in which centre-right leaders threatened to pull out of Letta's coalition, potentially triggering snap elections, there were signs that members of the cross-party panel may avert a confrontation. The centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which has the largest number of members on the 23-member committee, has said it will vote down three motions that would delay the hearings but the committee may delay a vote to win more time, according to two sources close to the committee. \"There won't be a vote tonight,\" one parliamentarian, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. \"The chairman of the panel is working to head off a vote.\" Two different demonstrations took place in Athens tonight. One protest was held by teachers and university university staff against government cutbacks and layoffs, while employees from a mining company held a separate demo against plans to privatise their firm. Over in Paris, a protester climbed a statue in the Republic Square to hold up a placard calling for a levy on the profits of firms in the CAC 40, to fund the country's pension schemes: Confirmation via M&amp;G's Bond Vigilantes that Spain's borrowing costs are now below Italy's, due to the political drama being played out in Rome (see 4.39pm) I mentioned this morning that French industrial production had shrunk again in July, by 0.6% month-on-month, dashing hopes of a rise (see 8.21am for details and graphs). Economist Shaun Richards has taken a deeper look at the numbers, and warns that French industry is withering: He writes here: If we look at the underlying indices we see that French industrial production is at 97.8 and manufacturing is at 98 if we take the working-day and seasonally adjusted numbers. We can learn a lot by simply looking backwards as they were 100.2 and 100.1 respectively in April which again challenges the growth agenda somewhat. But I wish to go deeper and give you the numbers from the beginning of this series and when you see them you will get my point. In January 1990 they were 104.1 and 111.7 respectively. They are extraordinary declines are they not? I would like to emphasise the manufacturing numbers as I have just scanned the 1990s and there is no reading as low as that of July 2013 that I can see. It peaked at 122.1 in December 2000 which means that it has fallen by just under 20% since then. Is that trend the future for manufacturing in France? Shaun is also good value (as ever) on today's protests: Today opens with news of a strike against pension reform in France. However this \u201creform\u201d only currently applies to the private-sector as we note that the larger potential deficit in public-sector pensions is being ignored. How very Euro area! It remains to be seen if the strike spreads to the public-sector. Also as some of the reforms are well beyond the term of President Hollande\u2019s office (2020-35) we see not only some can-kicking here but also another entry in a possible \u201cgenerational war\u201d. After all he promised retirement at 62 not so long ago but the young will find that much harder after these reforms. Perhaps another form of strike will also be on French minds today as the national football team has not scored for five matches and it time for another round of World Cup qualifiers. I\"m almost certain this isn't part of the cycling proficiency test.... Over in Italy, a cross-party parliamentary committee will meet tonight at 8pm local time (7pm BST) to resume talks on whether Silvio Berlusconi should be barred from the Senate. The discussions, following Berlusconi's final appeal defeat over a tax fraud conviction, began yesterday. Berlusconi's allies have been piling on the pressure today, warning that the former leader's PDL party could withdraw from the coalition government if the hearing goes against Berlusconi. PDL secretary Angelino Alfano took to Facebook today to criticise the \"amazing\" and \"unbearable\" actions of the centre-left PD party, for pushing on with this week's hearings. PD, of course, are the PDL's coalition partners. Alfano also claimed: They prefer to bring the country to its knees just to eliminate their historic political enemy via judicial means. The PDL want the decision on Berlusconi's fate delayed while an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights is heard. Renato Brunetta, floor leader of the PDL in the lower house, warned that Enrico Letta's government could crash down if PD, and the radical Five-Star Movement, press on with expulsion. Brunetta told RAI state radio: If the Democratic Party and Grillo's people decide this evening to vote against the proposals, the Democratic Party will bring down the Letta government. A full Senate vote would still need to take place before Berlusconi could be expelled. But the situation is causing some concern in the financial markets -- as flagged up earlier, Italian government debt is no longer seen as safer than Spanish. Italian 10-year bonds are trading at yields of 4.531% today, compared to Spain's 4.518%. Car workers, from Peugeot Citroen's doomed Paris plant at Aulnay-sous-Bois took part in the the protest march in the French capital today. One carried a banner calling for a return to the \"37.5 years\" -- the old minimum career before qualifying for a pension. Good luck with that ... Relations between Peugeot's workers and management have been quite fraught since it announced plans to shut the Aulnay-sous-Bois factory in 2014. The company's bosses are in Frankfurt this week for the French city's Auto Show, where chief executive Philippe Varin warned that further cutbacks will be needed to revive the group's fortunes. Varin told Reuters that discussions were underway about cutting production further: Speaking at the Frankfurt auto show, Varin confirmed that production line shutdowns were \"exactly the discussion we are having\" but said he would present cutbacks to unions before announcing details. Asked whether more than one line would have to go, Varin replied: \"That is part of the negotiation ... It also depends on our assumptions for the market and our market share - discussions are ongoing.\" Decent turnout in Paris for today's protests too: Today's demonstrations in France are hardly a repeat of 1968 and all that. Associated Press reports that they're not even up the 2010 vintage, when anger over President Sarkozy's pension reforms sparked days of protests and petrol shortages. Here's AP's take: A nationwide strike against the French government's plan to plug a 20-billion-euro hole in the country'spension system has elicited the equivalent of a Gallic shrug. The strike called by four unions on Tuesday against the Socialist government's proposed reform had almost no impact on traffic across France's rail, bus and subway systems or other public services. That's a sharp contrast to the sometimes violent protests that erupted the last time a French government attempted to reform its retirement system. Demonstrations in Paris and 180 other towns and cities were taking place, but with some moderate unions declining to participate, mobilization withered. The French plan would gradually extend the number of years employees must pay contributions to claim a full pension, from 41.5 years now to 43 years in 2035. Over in Nicosia, the Bank of Cyprus is holding an AGM -- and facing the wrath of customers who lost large sums of money through the country's bailout deal. Economics history professor Alex Apostolides is there, tweeting the key events. It's shake-up time on Wall Street. Tech firm Hewlett-Packard, Bank of America and aluminium producer Alcoa are all being given the order of the boot from the Dow Jones industrial average. They'll be replaced by Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa. Apparently it will make the Dow more representative (it only holds 30 companies). The index has only been revised some 53 times since it was created in 1907... ...however, there's already a backlash, with claims that the move will give Goldman too much influence on the Dow. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted index, so a one dollar move in any constituent's share price has the same impact (regardless of whether the company's share price is $1 or $100). Goldman's share price is around $159, compared to Bank of America's $14, so Goldman will have much more influence on the way the Dow moves (there's a more detailed explanation on Business Insider). It's official, the Bank of England is considering bringing in plastic bank notes (as flagged at 11.57am) And they'll be 30% smaller: A couple more snaps from Lyon as the nationwide day of protest action against France's pension reforms picks up pace: One group of protesters in Lyon lugged a makeshift coffin along with them. Just in, new photos from Marseille showing that the march against the French government's pension reforms is underway. Thousands of people took part in the march, according to the Corbis photo agency, with some people carrying flares (thus the smoke). This is just one of the 180 or so protests scheduled for today. However, as flagged up earlier, France's transport system is holding up well -- suggesting that this won't be a repeat of the violence of 2010 when Nicolas Sarkozy's government tried to reform the pension system. Europe's plans to impose a financial transaction tax appear to be on the ropes. Reuters has got its hands on a legal opinion from Brussels' own lawyers, which concludes that the FTT is illegal. Although it's not a binding recommendation, it could well signal that the idea of levying a flat fee on stocks, bonds, derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending is doomed. Eleven countries have said they would impose an FTT. Supporters say it would combat short-term speculation in the markets, and make the banks pay back some of the cost of the financial crisis. However, critics have warned it would drive financial trade out of Europe -- with the UK bringing legal action against the FTT (even though Britain isn't joining). Here's the story: Exclusive: EU lawyers say transaction tax plan is illegal I mentioned in yesterday afternoon's liveblog that Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal had all tumbled down an annual ranking of happiness published by the UN. Now, Business Insider have just launched a nifty map showing which are the happiest, and least happy, places to live: In the City, shares in Gulf Keystone Petroleum have spiked 27% after the firm won a closely watched court case over the ownership of a big oil field in Kurdistan. Judge Christopher Clarke told a \"packed courtroom\" (apparently) at the London Courts of Justice that GKP , and it alone, owns the Shaikan Field. Cue much action as investors try to pile into GKP -- which was already a popular share with small punters. Our markets reporter Nick Fletcher has the full story: A judge in London dismissed a claim by US-based Excalibur Ventures that it had the right to 30% of Gulf's assets in northern Iraq. The case has been overshadowing Gulf for three years, but now it has been resolved analysts believe it could be attractive to larger rivals wanting to increase their presence in the region. Gulf Keystone Petroleum wins long standing court case In France, people are gathering at 180 cities to protests against Francois Hollande's pension reforms, although (as expected) the turnout is limited (so far). Hardline FO union leader Jean-Claude Mailly has told France 2 TV that he doesn't expect a \"tidal wave\" of opposition, despite worker anger over Hollande's proposal that they pay larger contributions and wait longer until they retire. Marches are due to begin at 2pm local time, or 1pm BST, with Mailly planning to lead a rally in Paris. The head of the CGT union, Thierry Lepaon, has suggested that turnout this afternoon will be \"surprising\". However, it appears that neither Mailly nor Lepaon are demanding that Hollande drops his plans for pension reforms (as explained earlier, France will face a \u20ac20bn pensions black hole by 2020 unless changes are made). Instead, today's march is being billed as a show of force. Lepaon explained: People are very worried It's important for workers to know they need to show their strength on social issues. Reuters reports that there's been limited disruption to transport links so far. Heads-up: The Bank of England is considering introducing plastic bank notes in the UK, and will release details of its plans this afternoon. My colleague Katie Allen reports: Notes made of polymer, a plastic-like material, are thought to be more durable than notes printed on cotton paper, as they are currently in Britain. Such shinier, non-tear notes are already used in a number of countries, including Canada, the home country of the new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. More here: UK mulls switch to plastic bank notes This won't be news to Radio 5 Live listeners, of course: Speaking of Greece... the government has announced this morning that it has achieved a primary surplus so far this year. This means the Athens government had money left over after paying its bills, if you exclude the cost of servicing its debt pile. The Greek finance ministry said that the central government had a primary budget surplus of \u20ac2.92bn between January and August, the finance ministry said. Dragging Greece's finances back to a primary surplus is a key goal of the Greek bailout plan -- it should make it easier to haggle additional help from its lenders next year (if needed). However, a caveat is needed -- as Reuters explains: It is not directly comparable with its bailout targets as it excludes the budgets of local government and social security funds and includes one-off revenue from euro zone central banks. It is also on a cash basis, whereas the budget figures against which Greece's performance will be judged are based on an accrual basis, which classifies revenues and expenses differently. Still, deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras is upbeat, declaring that; The target to reach a surplus at the end of the year becomes more and more feasible. There are also likely to be anti-austerity protests in Greece this month, after school teachers voted last night to hold rolling strikes against the Athens government's 'mobility scheme' (through which thousands of jobs could be cut). As Greece's Kathimerini explains: High school teachers have opted to launch rolling five-day strikes from September 16 to protest the government\u2019s decision to place hundreds of educators in a civil service mobility scheme. Optimism that the Syrian crisis is easing have driven shares up worldwide today, with the Dubai stock market closing 8.5% higher in the last few minutes. The Abi Dhabi exchange is up 5.5%. This follows the news that France will bring a resolution to the UN Security Council to put Syria's chemical weapons stocks beyond use (see Matt Weaver's Middle East liveblog for details) Europe's stock markets have also been pushed higher by decent economic data from China early this morning (industrial production rose 10.4%, while retail sales gained 13.4%). Germany's DAX was the biggest riser in Europe, while Italy's FTSE MIB was the weakest (reflecting political jitters - see 9.19am): The oil price is also down, with a barrel of New York crude trading $1 lighter at $108.51. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, comments: An easing of geopolitical tensions regarding Syria, with Russia backing a proposal for surrender of weapons to avoid US intervention, has given sentiment a further boost, as has a second batch of positive overnight macro data from China. Possibility of Fed tapering just round the corner, but markets look to have priced this in.... (I still say delayed on latest data, especially jobs, being mixed) and are more concerned with geopolitical stability. Dow Jones Newswires has more details of Christine Lagarde's comments about the \"beautiful ship\" that is the eurozone this morning (see 9.55am) in Paris: Greater fiscal integration would help the euro zone absorb shocks for individual countries, it would help with governance, and would limit contagion, Ms. Lagarde said. The head of the IMF, a former French finance minister, identified several areas for work. She said Europe has made significant progress on increasing oversight of national budgets, but the rules will only be good if they are properly enforced. Ms. Lagarde also called for a stronger risk-sharing mechanism, such as a rainy day fund, and said there needs to be a credible pan-European backstop for the resolution of banks. Progress has been made on a backstop for banks via its bailout fund--the European Stability Mechanism--but more clarity is needed, she added. \"It's really a question of making the ESM readily available in a clear articulated and simple way,\" she said. More here. Over in Paris, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has declared that the eurozone is a \"beautiful ship\" that needs a few urgent modifications to sail the troubled waters of the world economy. Lagarde made the comments at a conference on creating fiscal union for the EU, as she called on European politicians to urgently conclude their work on banking union. Lagarde said: We very much think of the euro area as a beautiful ship that has been built, nurtured .. for the soft seas, but which is not yet completely finished for the rough ones. A lot has been done in relation to banking union. If I have a message today it is that that particular part of the ship needs to be finished, needs to be completed and speed is of the essence. (quotes via Reuters) It's the latest analogy to explain the euro - back in July, Mario Draghi famously described the euro as a bumblebee (harking back to the myth that bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly). With 12 days to go until the crunch German elections, we've rounded up a handful of little-known facts about chancellor Angela Merkel Six things you didn't know about Angela Merkel Courtesy of Stefan Kornelius, foreign editor of S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. Just in: The Italian recession is deeper than thought. New data released this morning shows that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013, worse than the 0.2% first estimated. That means that Italian GDP is 2.1% less than a year ago, not the 2% as initially thought. As if prime minister Enrico Letta didn't have enough to worry about with Silvio Berlusconi's fate still in the balance. ISTAT, Italy's statistics body, reported that household spending continued to shrink in the face of Italy's economic woes, falling by 0.4% during the April-June quarter. Capital spending and imports also dropped, by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both cases. The year-on-year data underlined how Italy's economy has suffered over the last 12 months. Consumption is down by 2.4%, capital expenditure is 5.9% lower, while imports are down 4.6%. Exports are 0.2% higher than a year ago. Here's the details: Over in the bond markets, Italian government borrowing costs have risen above Spain's for the first time in 18 months. It means Italy is being priced as a (slightly) bigger risk than Spain, in a sign that the Berlusconi Conundrum is dragging Italy towards a new crisis. Italian 10-year bond yields are trading at 4.485% this morning compared to 4.481% for Spain. That's must be a minor relief for Madrid, whose borrowing costs have been pushed up by allegations of government corruption and fears over bad bank debts. And Berlusconi's future remains unclear. A Senate committee is due to reconvene tonight to continue discussing whether to kick him out of the Senate following his tax fraud conviction last month. Politicians continue to warn that Berlusconi could retaliate to any expulsion by withdrawing support for the coalition government. Elsewhere in the UK economy, house prices continue to romp ahead. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reports that prices are rising at the fastest pace in seven years, fueling fears that the markets is getting out of control: Soaring house prices spread across UK as surveyors warn of another bubble We have good news for the UK economy this morning (as jefferd points out in the comments): Jaguar Land Rover will be hiring 1,700 new employees in the West Midlands, to support the production of a new range of sports cars based on cutting edge, lightweight aluminium technology. Jaguar Land Rover creates 1,700 jobs and invests \u00a31.5bn in aluminium cars The luxury carmaker will invest \u00a31.5bn to produce new models for both Jaguar and Land Rover, and the first new car to feature the technology will be a mid-sized sports sedan from Jaguar, launched in 2015. It will also be the first vehicle to feature an engine built at JLR's new \u00a3500m engine manufacturing facility near Wolverhampton. The JLR chief executive, Ralf Speth, said the new investment and jobs were \"further evidence\" of the company's commitment to the UK car industry and its supply chain. Speaking at the Frankfurt motor show on Tuesday, he said the new aluminium features signalled JLR's \"ambitions to push the boundaries and redefine premium car ownership\". It marks an impressive revival for JLR, as Sky's Joel Hills explains: France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, has admitted this morning that France is unlikely to hit its target of a budget deficit of 3.7% of GDP for 2013. Speaking on French radio, Moscovici warned that: The public deficit will be slightly higher than expected, This echoes a warning from the country's auditor back in June. Moscovici added that more than two-thirds of the adjustments in the 2014 budget will come from savings on government spending rather than tax rises. Worth remembering that a 3.7% deficit was already some way over the EC's target of 3%, with Paris having been granted two more years to get its borrowing into line. We also have disappointing economic data from France this morning. Industrial production shrank by 0.6% in July, dashing analyst hopes for a 0.6% rise. Manufacturing output fell by 0.7% during the month, INSEE reported, and is 1.1% smaller compared to a year ago. July's drop was driven by a 4.2% decline in \"the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products\", followed by energy, mining, and food production. France officially exited recession in the April-June quarter. This data suggests the summer could be a struggle. Here's the full breakdown: France's SNCF rail company is warning customers to expect a limited service today due to the strike action, with some trains cancelled on national, inter-city and TGV lines. There are already signs that today's strike is hitting French transport links. According to this status update page, there are delays of up to one hour on the line to Paris's Orly Airport. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and the business world. After a quiet summer, anti-austerity protests will return to the streets of the eurozone today as French unions hold a day of protest action against Francois Hollande's pension reforms. Let by the hardline CGT union, demonstrations will take place in 180 locations across France - as workers show their anger against Hollande's proposal to make them pay larger contributions and wait longer to collect their pensions. Student unions and far-left groups are also expected to join the protests, in the latest expression of disquiet against Hollande's government. The plans are meant to target France's pensions black hole, which is on track to hit \u20ac20bn by the end of the decade. As Reuters explains: The draft pension law, to be presented to cabinet on September 18th and sent to parliament shortly thereafter, aims to wipe out an annual deficit that will otherwise hit \u20ac20bn in 2020. Its main effect is to extend the pay-in period for pension contributions to 43 years by 2035 from 41.5 now. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault's government submitted a new reform draft to France's top administrative court on Friday adding an amendment that will reduce advantageous conditions for pensioners who have more than three children starting in 2020. Analysts have criticised the bill as being too timid, but the CGT argues that it places an unfair burden on workers. Opinion poll data released last night found that 61% of the public back the protestors, with four in five saying they are concerned about their pensions. However, the word from France is that today's protests are likely to be subdued, with some moderate unions declining to take part. It's unlikely to be a repeat of the pension protests that gripped the country for days in 2010. Still, it should give an insight into the public mood in France, which faces many more tough decisions to bring its deficit into line in the years ahead. I'll try to track the protests through the day, along with other key events as usual.",

First, the latest data from China suggest that its economic slowdown has bottomed out, easing concerns about the knock-on impact elsewhere, and particularly on the rest of Asia. And second, worries about the Fed scaling back its bond-buying programme also appear to have abated in the wake of last week\u2019s US Employment Report.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on that note, I'm off for the day.

We can learn a lot by simply looking backwards as they were 100.2 and 100.1 respectively in April which again challenges the growth agenda somewhat. But I wish to go deeper and give you the numbers from the beginning of this series and when you see them you will get my point. In January 1990 they were 104.1 and 111.7 respectively.</p> <p>They are extraordinary declines are they not? I would like to emphasise the manufacturing numbers as I have just scanned the 1990s and there is no reading as low as that of July 2013 that I can see. It peaked at 122.1 in December 2000 which means that it has fallen by just under 20% since then.

Its main effect is to extend the pay-in period for pension contributions to 43 years by 2035 from 41.5 now.</p> <p>Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault's government submitted a new reform draft to <strong>France</strong>'s top administrative court on Friday adding an amendment that will reduce advantageous conditions for pensioners who have more than three children starting in 2020.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>Analysts have criticised the bill as being too timid, but the CGT argues that it places an unfair burden on workers.</p> <p>Opinion poll data released last night found that 61% of the public back the protestors, with four in five saying they are concerned about their pensions.&#xa0;</p> <p>However, the word from France is that today's protests are likely to be subdued, with&#xa0;some moderate unions declining to take part. It's unlikely to be a repeat of the pension protests that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/19/france-pension-protests-nicolas-sarkozy\">gripped the country for days in 2010</a>.</p> <p>Still, it should give an insight into the public mood in France, which faces many more tough decisions to bring its deficit into line in the years ahead.</p> <p><strong>I'll try to track the protests through the day, along with other key events as usual.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-10T07:00:05.374Z\">at 8.00am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plastic banknotes with a see-through image of Britannia are likely to replace traditional paper notes from 2016 under plans being drawn up by the Bank of England. The Bank said the wipe-clean polymer notes will be less tatty, tougher to counterfeit and last up to six times longer than cotton-paper based notes. They will also be 15% smaller, bringing English notes into line with sizes in other countries, but will remain larger than existing euro notes. The public will have the chance to look at and feel the new notes at shopping centres across the country in a consultation process that starts immediately, with the new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, taking a final decision on the go-ahead in December. The Sir Winston Churchill \u00a35 note will be the first to be made in polymer and launched in 2016, with the Jane Austen \u00a310 note following in 2017. All the notes will continue to feature the Queen and use existing colours. Plastic notes have been in circulation in Australia for more than two decades and are being rolled out in Canada, Carney's home country, but the Bank said its polymer project began long before the new governor was appointed. Scotland and Northern Ireland, where seven banks have the right to issue notes, will be free to continue with paper notes, opening up the possibility that cash machines in Carlisle will issue in plastic but across the border in Gretna will continue to supply in paper. The Bank of England said that in tests, the new plastic notes do not melt until at least 120C and survive washing machines much better than existing paper notes. Despite being made from polymer pellets, the Bank said the notes will be more environmentally friendly as the manufacturing process does not use the same intensity of water as cotton-paper manufacture. The new notes will cost around 50% more to produce, but the Bank estimates it will save \u00a3100m as it will need to replace the notes far less frequently. But the Bank ruled out importing plastic money from China. The notes will continue to be produced at the Bank's ultra-secure plant in Debden, Essex, although subcontracted to a private company, likely to be either De La Rue, the existing maker, or Innovia, which manufactures most of the polymer notes currently in circulation across the world. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charles Bean, said there was no question that the introduction of plastic notes was a \"done deal\" and promised to listen to feedback from the public before going ahead. \"Polymer banknotes are cleaner, more secure and more durable than paper notes. They are also cheaper and more environmentally friendly. \"However, the Bank of England would print notes on polymer only if we were persuaded that the public would continue to have confidence in, and be comfortable with, our notes. The results of the consultation programme on which we are embarking will therefore form a vital part of our assessment of the merits of polymer banknotes.\" In recognition of the need for groups such as the blind to handle the change, the Bank will continue to issue notes in size-ascending order, so the new fivers and tenners will continue to be slightly different in size. There is no switchover date yet proposed for when or if \u00a320 notes \u2013 the most common note in circulation \u2013 will be changed to polymer. In Canada, where high-value notes are already made of polymer and lower-denomination notes will be introduced later this year, there have been some complaints that the notes tend to stick to each other. But the Bank of England said it did not expect this to be an issue, although it did accept that brand new notes will have a more slippery texture than cotton-paper ones. The extended time scale for the introduction of the notes has been put in place to allow the cash handling industry, retailers and ATM and vending machine operators time to mange the transition. ATMs will be able to hold, say paper \u00a320 notes and plastic \u00a310 notes, but will not able to issue plastic \u00a310 notes alongside paper \u00a310 notes as they will be different sizes. But because the polymer notes will be thinner, cash machines will be able to stock more, and operators say the machines will be less likely to jam. But it is security and counterfeiting that the Bank of England places at the heart of the new notes. Evidence from Australia and other countries such as New Zealand, Singapore, Mexico and Nigeria, where polymer notes are common, is that after their introduction counterfeiting reduced substantially. Last year the Bank of England removed 719,000 counterfeit notes from circulation, a relatively high rate compared with other countries. Shoppers in Northern Ireland will already be familiar with polymer notes, since a limited-edition note was circulated in 2000 by Northern Bank to mark the millennium. If the new notes go ahead, removal of paper notes is expected to be relatively swift, taking no more than eight months.",

      "body": "<p>Plastic banknotes with a see-through image of Britannia are likely to replace traditional paper notes from 2016 under plans being drawn up by the Bank of England.</p> <p>The Bank said the wipe-clean polymer notes will be less tatty, tougher to counterfeit and last up to six times longer than cotton-paper based notes. They will also be 15% smaller, bringing English notes into line with sizes in other countries, but will remain larger than existing euro notes.</p> <p>The public will have the chance to look at and feel the new notes at shopping centres across the country in a consultation process that starts immediately, with the new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, taking a final decision on the go-ahead in December. The Sir Winston Churchill \u00a35 note will be the first to be made in polymer and launched in 2016, with the Jane Austen \u00a310 note following in 2017. All the notes will continue to feature the Queen and use existing colours.</p> <p>Plastic notes have been in circulation in Australia for more than two decades and are being rolled out in Canada, Carney's home country, but the Bank said its polymer project began long before the new governor was appointed.</p> <p>Scotland and Northern Ireland, where seven banks have the right to issue notes, will be free to continue with paper notes, opening up the possibility that cash machines in Carlisle will issue in plastic but across the border in Gretna will continue to supply in paper.</p> <p>The Bank of England said that in tests, the new plastic notes do not melt until at least 120C and survive washing machines much better than existing paper notes. Despite being made from polymer pellets, the Bank said the notes will be more environmentally friendly as the manufacturing process does not use the same intensity of water as cotton-paper manufacture.</p> <p>The new notes will cost around 50% more to produce, but the Bank estimates it will save \u00a3100m as it will need to replace the notes far less frequently. But the Bank ruled out importing plastic money from China. The notes will continue to be produced at the Bank's ultra-secure plant in Debden, Essex, although subcontracted to a private company, likely to be either De La Rue, the existing maker, or Innovia, which manufactures most of the polymer notes currently in circulation across the world.</p> <p>The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charles Bean, said there was no question that the introduction of plastic notes was a \"done deal\" and promised to listen to feedback from the public before going ahead. \"Polymer banknotes are cleaner, more secure and more durable than paper notes. They are also cheaper and more environmentally friendly.</p> <p>\"However, the Bank of England would print notes on polymer only if we were persuaded that the public would continue to have confidence in, and be comfortable with, our notes.

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover is creating 1,700 new jobs at Solihull in the West Midlands to support the production of a new range of sports cars featuring the latest lightweight aluminium technology. The luxury carmaker will invest \u00a31.5bn to produce new models for both Jaguar and Land Rover, and the first new car to feature the technology will be a mid-sized sports sedan from Jaguar, launched in 2015. It will also be the first vehicle to feature an engine built at JLR's new \u00a3500m engine manufacturing facility near Wolverhampton. The JLR chief executive, Ralf Speth, said the investment and jobs were further evidence of the company's commitment to the UK car industry and its supply chain. Speaking at the Frankfurt motor show on Tuesday, he said the new aluminium features signalled JLR's \"ambitions to push the boundaries and redefine premium car ownership\". Unite, Britain's biggest union, welcomed the new jobs at the Solihull plant and described the company as a \"great British success story\". Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: \"This new investment in jobs and skills ought to maintain its global reputation for world class vehicles. \"The UK workforce, with their skills and dedication, are at the heart of this success story. This investment is their due reward and we are delighted that JLR has committed further to Britain.\" Owned by India's Tata, JLR has announced almost 11,000 new jobs for UK manufacturing over the last three years, providing a boost to the sector at a time when other carmakers, including Ford, have been closing factories in Britain and cutting jobs. JLR has estimated that a further 24,000 jobs will be created in the wider supply chain a result of its investments. The carmaker has been held up my ministers as a poster child for British manufacturing and exports, and the business secretary, Vince Cable, said on Tuesday that \"this ground-breaking project takes Jaguar on to the next level\". The company is showcasing the potential of the new all-aluminium technology at the Frankfurt show with the C-X17, its first sports 4x4 crossover concept vehicle. \"The inherent flexibility of this all-new technology will enable the Jaguar Land Rover business to not only enter but aggressively compete in new segments, creating new markets for both brands,\" the carmaker said. JLR, which employs 25,000 people in the UK, already builds the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, Discovery and Defender at its Solihull plant. Pre-tax profit rose 11% to \u00a31.7bn in the year to 31 March, while revenue rose 17% to \u00a315.8bn.",
