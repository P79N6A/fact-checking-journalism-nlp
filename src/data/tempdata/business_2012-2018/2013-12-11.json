The 81% taxpayer-owned bank received the penalty after being found to have stripped out codes used in international payments systems that could have identified it was moving money for countries subject to sanctions. RBS said it \"deeply regrets\" busting sanctions through a series of transactions that date back to when Fred Goodwin was running the Edinburgh-based bank. The problems were uncovered by his successor, Stephen Hester, who left in September, during a review of the risks facing the bank shortly after its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008.

      "bodyText": "Argos has been hit by a wave of complaints from frustrated shoppers after technical glitches caused queues outside its new hi-tech stores. The retailer planned to open six of the digital stores, which have swept aside their traditional laminated catalogues, order slips and tiny pens in favour of iPads, and replaced advertising posters with huge electronic screens. None of the revamped stores has opened. However, a glitch on Argos's website allows shoppers to order goods online to pick up at those outlets. Many shoppers did so, only to discover they could not then pick up the items they wanted. Shoppers took to Facebook and Twitter to vent their anger as they turned up at stores in Chancery Lane, Marble Arch and Old Street in London this week only to be turned away or to find the shutters down. Queues were reported at Chancery Lane, Old Street and Old Kent Road as disappointed shoppers were not allowed in or werelet in one at a time to pick up goods and pay in cash. Trade journal Retail Week reported that Argos staff were completing transactions outside the Old Street store and that customers had been told the new digital systems had crashed. On Wednesday night Argos's website continued to show goods in stock at the closed stores. As queues formed outside the Old Kent Road store in south London on Sunday, shoppers were told it remained closed because of \"browser failure\". One shopper tweeted: \"Chaos at @Argos_Online Old Kent Road. Staff are doing their best but queues outside prove there's been a real operational SNAFU.\" One shopper described the situation outside Chancery Lane on Saturday as \"farcical\" while another who had reserved an item at the Old Street store only to find it closed said that it was \"shocking stuff\". The problems only affect the six digital stores while the rest of Argos's 732 outlets in the UK and Ireland continue to trade as normal. But the glitches at the new outlets, framed as the future of Argos at a press launch just over two weeks ago, are an embarrassing hiccup for the company. The stores, which the retailer clearly expected to be operational ahead of the important Christmas sales period, are an important step in its five-year plan to secure the firm's future by turning it into a \"digital retail leader\". John Walden, managing director, said: \"Two weeks ago we hosted an early press preview of our digital concept stores, and announced that we hoped to open six stores by Christmas. Our teams continue to progress towards this goal including testing and finalising the systems that support improved customer journeys. As planned we are providing a limited service from these stores while our testing is completed.\" The company has yet to give a firm opening date for the stores and refused to comment on the nature of its technical problems.",

As the financial crisis hit, it was unable to sell long-distance US operator Greyhound, which was the original plan. The result was a long struggle to pay down debt that ended in failure when the desperately-needed UK west coast mainline franchise did not materialise (the Department for Transport bungled the bidding process). An embarrassing \u00a3615m rights issue followed this May and FirstGroup's share price, once 700p, completed its journey to 100p, roughly where it started life at flotation in 1995. So, in theory, FirstGroup is vulnerable to a spot of agitation from the wings.

But that's the only solid part of Sandell's pitch. Its two big ideas \u2013 put Greyhound up for sale and spin off the rest of the US division, including the yellow bus student operation, via a US listing \u2013 pile assumption upon assumption. Bidders, apparently, are queuing up to buy Greyhound. Really? If they are, they are free today to make silly offers. As for a spin-off of FirstGroup US, Sandell claims a \"yield-hungry North American shareholder base\" would pay a premium. Again, the assertion looks like a piece of wishful thinking that rests on the uncertain premise that FirstGroup's share price labours under a conglomerate discount. The time to test that view is surely when the businesses themselves have been made to perform better. As Liberum's analyst puts it: \"Selling underperforming assets when they are cyclically depressed is unlikely to realise more value than restructuring them.\" Quite. FirstGroup, for the time being, should refrain from hopeful instant cures and stick to the harder road of making day-to-day improvements. Sandall's talk of an instant gain in shareholder value of 50% under its plan is finger-in-the-air stuff. The open question is whether a shake-up of executive management is required to inject urgency into FirstGroup's self-help programme.

The tax, which will be levied on larger stores which sell alcohol and tobacco, is set to come in next year.",

It suggests a lower risk of further political brinkmanship around budget policy precipitating another government shutdown or debt ceiling crisis, which would damage the US economy and perceptions of US sovereign creditworthiness.</p> <p>But the proposal does not increase the federal government debt ceiling, which Congress will need to raise again by 7 February to give the Treasury the borrowing capacity it needs to meet its payment obligations and avoid further recourse to extraordinary measures.</p> <p>The fiscal scope of the two-year proposal agreed between Senate Budget Committee chairman Patty Murray and House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan is modest. The estimated reduction in the budget deficit of $20bn-$23bn over 10 years is only 0.1% of GDP.</p> <p>The proposal, announced ahead of Friday's self-imposed deadline, has yet to pass Congress. If it is passed the appropriations committees would then need to agree spending bills by 15 January to prevent another potential government shutdown.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a bipartisan agreement in the Congress Budget Committee suggests that the bouts of political disagreement that have destabilised US budget policymaking may become less frequent and intense. It even suggests some potential political capacity for a more substantive, longer-term agreement on revenue and expenditure reforms that could help reduce the US government's debt/GDP ratio over the medium to long term.</p> <p>As part of the reported agreement, the indiscriminate expenditure sequester would be loosened by $63bn over two years and replaced by revenue increases and more targeted expenditure cuts worth an estimated $85bn.</p> <p>As we have previously stated, we expect to resolve the Rating Watch Negative on the US 'AAA' sovereign rating by end-1Q14 after conducting a review, although timing will reflect the resolution of the FY14 budget discussions and further debt ceiling developments. The review will focus on projections for US public finances and our assessment of the impact of the debt ceiling crisis on US creditworthiness.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-11T16:29:15.398Z\">at 4.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a88ee9e4b07fd4d02fa424\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-11T16:13:59.040Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the European trading day glides to a halt, here's a flavour of Michael Hewson's late-afternoon note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a bit of a slow start Europe\u2019s markets did try and edge slowly higher today before losing momentum and slipping back, as investors weighed up the impact of the news that US politicians appear to have put the dysfunction of October behind them and agreed a budget for the next two years.</p> <p>While on the face of it this is a positive, and removes one of the uncertainties that has lingered in the background for months on end, it does remove one obstacle to an eventual start to a possible Fed taper next week, which could be another reason why stocks are finding it difficult to rally right now.</p> <p>&#xa0;Banking stocks have been the laggards of the day&#xa0;<strong>with Royal Bank of Scotland</strong>&#xa0;and Lloyds both lower on further negative news flow from the sector.</p> <p>RBS is the largest faller in the aftermath of the resignation of finance director Nathan Bostock after a mere 10 weeks in the job.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Bank of England's new 'forward guidance' on interest rates probably hasn't had much effect on the UK economy or the speed of the recovery, despite all the media attention on governor Mark Carney's big idea.</strong></p> <p>That's according to BoE&#xa0;policymaker Martin Weale, anyway, in a speech given in London this lunchtime. <strong><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech697.pdf\">It's online here</a>.</strong></p> <p>Weals suggested that forward guidance may have <strong>simply \"codified\" what most people expected</strong> - that the UK central bank wasn't ready to raise rates. He pointed out that&#xa0;there is <strong>little sign of higher inflation expectations</strong> following the&#xa0;Bank's promise not to consider raising rates until the unemployment rate has fallen to 7%.</p> <p>Weale also argued that it is theoretically possible that forward guidance would boost output by up to 0.75%, but suggested that \"unless people have taken an&#xa0;unusual interest in what my colleagues and I have&#xa0;said about policy\", the actual impact will be rather less. <em>Too modest?</em></p> <p>He also offered some support for the policy (<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6ef4724a-04bf-11e3-9ffd-00144feab7de.html#axzz2mylAHdhp\">having raised objections when it was introduced in August</a>):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As many people have pointed out, a distinguishing feature of a state-contingent policy is that people cannot be certain about the date at which the&#xa0;relevant state, in our case unemployment of seven per cent, will be reached.</p> <p>Some of the MPC\u2019s critics have suggested that this is a&#xa0;weakness of the policy. I should say that I regard it as a strength.</p> <p>The future is uncertain and no one can change that. What is important is that the MPC reacts appropriately to events as they evolve.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And here's Weale's conclusion, in which he explains his doubts over the power of the policy:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A theory-based analysis suggests that the effect [of forward guidance] should be powerful, provided that the policy leads to markedly lower expectations of the future path of interest rates&#xa0;and thus on the date of the first increase in Bank Rate. The magnitude of the effect is nevertheless very sensitive to the precise assumptions made about the workings of the economy.</p> <p>But, if, the policy simply clarifies what policy-makers would have done anyway, the impact on the date of the first expected rise in&#xa0;Bank Rate is not likely to be large. In any case, since the policy is state dependent rather than&#xa0;time-dependent, the MPC can respond to the actual impact of the policy; we do not need a precise estimate&#xa0;of this in advance.</p> <p>An informal survey of market traders suggests that they believe that, up to two years ahead, expected rates are about \u00bc point lower than they would have been without forward guidance.</p> <p>If such views were held&#xa0;throughout the economy, it is possible that output would be raised by \u00bd - \u00be per cent with an effect on&#xa0;inflation of just over \u00bc per cent.</p> <p>But, if the policy has not yet been understood by households, the initial&#xa0;impact is likely to be lower, perhaps appreciably lower than this.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's a graph:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-886ab0bb-9c03-4f75-a814-ab171c00d2f2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386769525945/dfa326e6-d28e-4bc2-a4a2-c8916c0a0fa8-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Forward guidance graph\" width=\"392\" height=\"366\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Martin Weale</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52a86476e4b08659a9047052\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-11T13:25:31.114Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Simon Chouffot</strong>, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says the record fine imposed on Lloyds over its staff bonus schemes shows that the government is still being too soft on banking greed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"The people who run Britain's&#xa0;banks seem to hold the public in total contempt - pressurising staff into ripping the rest of us off.

      "bodyText": "And that's a good moment to finish. Back tomorrow -- fog permitting! Good night. GW European stock markets have closed in the red, with small losses across the board. The FTSE 100 finished 15 points lower, while the FSTEurofirst index of major companies across the region lost around 0.5%. It looks like a mixture of profit taking, and speculation that the Federal Reserve is more likely to taper its QE programme next week now that the political situation in Washington is calmer (see 4.09pm for Capital Economics's reasoning). Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, explains: Markets have again experienced fear as the dominant force, and have once more headed south, with next week's FOMC decision looming large on the horizon. Traders of the 'buy-on-dip' or 'risk-on' mindset are thin on the ground, and prudence appears to be the option of choice for the time being. Rating agency Fitch says the bipartisan budget proposal announced last night shows \"an improvement in the functioning of budget policymaking\", but cautions that the US debt ceiling must be addressed by early February. Fitch said the deal could pave the way for a \"substantive, long-term\" deal to lower America's debts in the long term. It probably won't decide whether to change its rating from AAA/ \"rating watch negative\" until the first quarter of 2014 -- giving it time to watch events play out. Here's Fitch's statement: The US bipartisan budget proposal announced on Tuesday signals an improvement in the functioning of budget policymaking, Fitch Ratings says. It suggests a lower risk of further political brinkmanship around budget policy precipitating another government shutdown or debt ceiling crisis, which would damage the US economy and perceptions of US sovereign creditworthiness. But the proposal does not increase the federal government debt ceiling, which Congress will need to raise again by 7 February to give the Treasury the borrowing capacity it needs to meet its payment obligations and avoid further recourse to extraordinary measures. The fiscal scope of the two-year proposal agreed between Senate Budget Committee chairman Patty Murray and House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan is modest. The estimated reduction in the budget deficit of $20bn-$23bn over 10 years is only 0.1% of GDP. The proposal, announced ahead of Friday's self-imposed deadline, has yet to pass Congress. If it is passed the appropriations committees would then need to agree spending bills by 15 January to prevent another potential government shutdown. Nevertheless, a bipartisan agreement in the Congress Budget Committee suggests that the bouts of political disagreement that have destabilised US budget policymaking may become less frequent and intense. It even suggests some potential political capacity for a more substantive, longer-term agreement on revenue and expenditure reforms that could help reduce the US government's debt/GDP ratio over the medium to long term. As part of the reported agreement, the indiscriminate expenditure sequester would be loosened by $63bn over two years and replaced by revenue increases and more targeted expenditure cuts worth an estimated $85bn. As we have previously stated, we expect to resolve the Rating Watch Negative on the US 'AAA' sovereign rating by end-1Q14 after conducting a review, although timing will reflect the resolution of the FY14 budget discussions and further debt ceiling developments. The review will focus on projections for US public finances and our assessment of the impact of the debt ceiling crisis on US creditworthiness. As the European trading day glides to a halt, here's a flavour of Michael Hewson's late-afternoon note: After a bit of a slow start Europe\u2019s markets did try and edge slowly higher today before losing momentum and slipping back, as investors weighed up the impact of the news that US politicians appear to have put the dysfunction of October behind them and agreed a budget for the next two years. While on the face of it this is a positive, and removes one of the uncertainties that has lingered in the background for months on end, it does remove one obstacle to an eventual start to a possible Fed taper next week, which could be another reason why stocks are finding it difficult to rally right now. Banking stocks have been the laggards of the day with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds both lower on further negative news flow from the sector. RBS is the largest faller in the aftermath of the resignation of finance director Nathan Bostock after a mere 10 weeks in the job. Mr Bostock\u2019s departure, coming so after he joined the bank, surely begs the question as to what must be going on behind the scenes at the state owned bank. RBS shares are down 3% in late trading, while Lloyds have fallen 1%. Speaking of the Fed..... Capital Economics reckons there's just over 50% chance that the US Federal Reserve will start to wind in its stimulus programme next Wednesday They predict that the Fed will cut the bond-buying programme from $85bn/month to $75bn, although it's a tight call. From their latest analyst note: We suspect that the renewed strength of employment growth in the past few months will be just enough to persuade the Fed to begin tapering its monthly asset purchases at next week's two-day FOMC meeting, which concludes on Wednesday 18th December. It will be a close call either way, however. The odds that a majority of Fed officials will vote to delay the taper until early in the new year aren't that much lower than 50% either. Assuming we are right, we would anticipate a small $10bn reduction in purchases to $75bn per month, evenly split between Treasury Securities and MBS. We also expect the Fed to take steps to strengthen its forward guidance on rates, in an attempt to offset the impact of its taper action on long-term borrowing costs. So what's changed since September, when the Fed decided to sit tight? Three things, they say: \u2022 The US jobs market looks stronger. The monthly non-farm payrolls have shown steady job creation, and the unemployment rate has dropped \u2022 Expectations of future rate rises are now 'under control' - unlike a few months ago, when the markets were pricing in a rise in borrowing costs: The Fed can take credit for that, with officials repeatedly stressing in recent months that the timing of the QE taper and the first rate hike are completely separate. \u2022 The fiscal situation looks more secure, especially after last night's deal. For a start, the small-scale budget deal that was announced late Tuesday evening would replace some of the additional sequestration spending cuts next year with longer-term savings. More importantly, this is a two-year deal that will provide some much needed stability. Some commentators, though, reckon the US economy is still too weak for the Fed to be considering cutting its stimulus - especially as there are no signs that American inflation is getting out of control. We'll find out in a week's time.... Not that we Brits bang on about the weather, or anything, but it really has been foggy over the City today: JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is cheered that Democrats and Republican reached a budget accord last night. Dimon also said he was \"less worried\" about the consequences of the Federal Reserve slowing its bond-purchase stimulus scheme. Reuters reports: The agreement on the federal budget was good for business confidence, Dimon said at an investor conference in New York, adding he would send thank-you notes to congressional leaders. Over in Greece, there have been protests as officials from the county's Troika of lenders returned to Athens for fresh talks. Once again, cleaning staff who lost their jobs through the government's cuts programme gathered outside the finance ministry to change slogan as officials from the IMF, the ECB and the EC arrived. Here's some photos from outside the ministry of the protests.... ...and IMF mission chief Poul Thomsen arriving. While the mission chiefs are back in Athens, the full team of technical Troika staff aren't expected to return until January. Wall Street opened calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average easing down 26 points, or 0.17%, to 15944. Traders and economists are chewing through the US budget deal -- Goldman Sachs reckons the agreement (to increase spending by around $63bn) will reduce the 'fiscal drag' caused by tightening policy by 0.1% of GDP. The Bank of England's new 'forward guidance' on interest rates probably hasn't had much effect on the UK economy or the speed of the recovery, despite all the media attention on governor Mark Carney's big idea. That's according to BoE policymaker Martin Weale, anyway, in a speech given in London this lunchtime. It's online here. Weals suggested that forward guidance may have simply \"codified\" what most people expected - that the UK central bank wasn't ready to raise rates. He pointed out that there is little sign of higher inflation expectations following the Bank's promise not to consider raising rates until the unemployment rate has fallen to 7%. Weale also argued that it is theoretically possible that forward guidance would boost output by up to 0.75%, but suggested that \"unless people have taken an unusual interest in what my colleagues and I have said about policy\", the actual impact will be rather less. Too modest? He also offered some support for the policy (having raised objections when it was introduced in August): As many people have pointed out, a distinguishing feature of a state-contingent policy is that people cannot be certain about the date at which the relevant state, in our case unemployment of seven per cent, will be reached. Some of the MPC\u2019s critics have suggested that this is a weakness of the policy. I should say that I regard it as a strength. The future is uncertain and no one can change that. What is important is that the MPC reacts appropriately to events as they evolve. And here's Weale's conclusion, in which he explains his doubts over the power of the policy: A theory-based analysis suggests that the effect [of forward guidance] should be powerful, provided that the policy leads to markedly lower expectations of the future path of interest rates and thus on the date of the first increase in Bank Rate. The magnitude of the effect is nevertheless very sensitive to the precise assumptions made about the workings of the economy. But, if, the policy simply clarifies what policy-makers would have done anyway, the impact on the date of the first expected rise in Bank Rate is not likely to be large. In any case, since the policy is state dependent rather than time-dependent, the MPC can respond to the actual impact of the policy; we do not need a precise estimate of this in advance. An informal survey of market traders suggests that they believe that, up to two years ahead, expected rates are about \u00bc point lower than they would have been without forward guidance. If such views were held throughout the economy, it is possible that output would be raised by \u00bd - \u00be per cent with an effect on inflation of just over \u00bc per cent. But, if the policy has not yet been understood by households, the initial impact is likely to be lower, perhaps appreciably lower than this. And here's a graph: Simon Chouffot, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says the record fine imposed on Lloyds over its staff bonus schemes shows that the government is still being too soft on banking greed: \"The people who run Britain's banks seem to hold the public in total contempt - pressurising staff into ripping the rest of us off. Businesses are supposed to serve customers - but with banks, it's the other way around.\" \"Issuing fines after the latest scandal happens to be unearthed will not fundamentally change the relationship between banks and society. The Government must get a grip on the culture of greed in the sector and ensure it starts contributing positively to society. Worth noting that Lloyds says it has now mended its ways.... after continuing to use incentive schemes such as the 'champagne bonus' more than two years after the taxpayer bailed it out. Back in the markets, and the big three European indices are all positive -- as traders take some comfort from the d\u00e9tente between Democrats and Republicans over the US budget (see opening post onwards for details and reaction). BAE Systems is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 2.5%, with analysts predicting defence stocks will benefit from the increased US spending. Liberum Capital analysts: This is progress and will allow budget prioritisation. Economists say the US economy will benefit too: FTSE 100: up 25 points at 6551, +0.4% German DAX: up 29 points at 9143, +0.3% French CAC: up 33 points at 4124, + 0.8% The boss of Tesco Bank also agrees that whopping bonuses for bank sales staff are counter-productive. Our Money editor, Patrick Collinson, argues that Lloyds didn't heed banking scandals of the past when it offered its staff hefty bonuses for selling products, and demotion if they failed. Here's a flavour: The FCA uncovered incentives such as \"champagne bonuses\" and \"grand in your hand\" that owe more to the culture of Wall Street trading that a high street bank giving advice on the hard-earned savings of the Mr and Mrs Migginses of Britain. If Lloyds staff failed to meet their targets, they could lose nearly half their salary. No wonder desperate employees ended up flogging policies to themselves and their family members to keep food on the table. As usual, the directors of the bank will be contrite, will say that lessons have been learned, and that it's different this time. But one important fact should always be remembered about Britain's bankers. How many have been jailed since the start of the financial crisis? None. Until the penalties become personal, the likelihood of any lessons being learned will remain at zero. More here: Lloyds has failed to learn the lessons of previous mis-selling fines Back on Lloyds........ and unions are saying that they warned against the kind of sales targets at the heart of today's record fine (details from 9.21am) Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: Despite the countless reports and investigations into the conduct of the banks the industry clearly has not learned the lessons of the financial crisis nor heard the concerns of customers and staff in order to adequately change. (reminder, our news story on the fine is here) Nikos Magginas, economist at National Bank, agrees that there are some glimmers of hope amid the news that Greece's unemployment rate has hit a new high of 27.4%. Magginas said (via Reuters): The decline in the number of those employed was the lowest since early 2010. The data shows a stabilisation trend in the jobless rate and a slowdown in new job losses, helped by a strong performance in tourism. Looking for more details of how Lloyds staff were lured into mis-selling products by a flawed bonus structure, leading to today's record fine of \u00a328m? Look no further.... Lloyds mis-selling scandal: Q&amp;A It includes what to do if you think you were caught up in the scandal. In Italy, prime minister Enrico Letta has warned MPs that the country will slide into chaos unless they back him in a confidence vote due later today. Letta urged politicians to throw their weight behind his reform programme, ahead of the first test of his parliamentary muscle since Silvio Berlusconi quit his coalition -- trimming Letta's majority. Letta was also scathing over Italy's failure to reform, saying MPs had avoided meaningful changes for 20 years. Reuters has the details: \"I'm determined to work with everything I have to prevent the country falling back into chaos,\" he said, pledging to throw his weight behind efforts to fight a growing tide of political disillusion and hostility to the European Union. He said the next 18 months would be devoted to a broad package of institutional reforms aimed at creating a stable basis for economic growth, which he said should reach 1 percent in 2014 and 2 percent in 2015. As well as a new electoral law and measures to untangle the conflicting web of powers between different levels of the administration, he promised to overhaul parliament to remove the Senate's power to vote no confidence in the government. He said the upper house would become a review chamber for legislation passed in the lower house, removing one of the key factors causing stalemate in the Italian political system. On the economic front, he promised to rein in the deficit, cut Italy's towering public debt, the second highest in the euro zone as a proportion of the overall economy, lower taxes on families and companies, reduce unemployment and boost public investment. Privatisations would continue and the government would consider allowing employees to buy shares in the post office and other public companies, he said. The lower house of parliament is expected to hold a confidence vote in the early afternoon, followed by the Senate tonight. Letta is expected to win both votes. Greece's unemployment rate has risen to a new record high, but there may still be some reasons for optimism. ELSTAT, the country's statistics body, reported that the number of people classed as unemployed rose by 14,023 between August and September. That pushed the jobless rate up to 27.4% in September, up 0.1 percentage point on August's 27.3%. The number of unemployed people rose by 14,023 persons in September to 1,376,463, a 1% increase during the month. But the number of people in work also rose, by 5,397, to 3,639,429. Those classed as inactive (not working or looking for work) dropped by 5,296 persons, which may suggest more people are now trying (and failing) to find a job. Still, on an annual basis, the unemployment total is up by 5.9% and the employment total is down by 1.5%. And the youth jobless rate remains a scar, at 51.9%. The data is seasonally adjusted. ELSTAT's believes there has been \"a relative stability in the estimated seasonally adjusted unemployment rate\" since the summer, but we'll need to wait several more months until the picture becomes clear. Here's the official release. And here's some reaction: Fog update: it's not cleared yet: Here's our news story on the fine imposed on Lloyds for operating flawed bonus schemes for its staff: Lloyds Banking Group fined record \u00a328m in new mis-selling scandal Now here's an idea to keep Britain's bank bosses in line: The Independent's Ben Chu points to the scale of the bonuses which Lloyds offered its staff to encourage them to sell products: Back in Europe, the Finnish prime minister says he's not given up hope of a proper deal on banking union before the end of the year (despite the limited progress made last night). That's via his official spokesman. Champagne bonus, anyone? The FCA's ruling against Lloyds includes detail of the bonus schemes that drove staff to sell inappropriate products to its customers: \u00b7 Variable base salaries Advisers could be automatically promoted and get a pay increase or be automatically demoted and have a pay reduction depending on their sales performance. For a Lloyds TSB adviser on a mid-level salary, not hitting 90% of their target over a period of 9 months could see their base annual salary drop from \u00a333,706 to \u00a325,927; and if they were demoted by two levels their base pay would drop to \u00a318,189 \u2013 almost a 50 per cent salary cut. In the worst example that the FCA saw, an adviser sold protection products to himself, his wife and a colleague in order to hit his target and prevent himself from being demoted. \u00b7 Bonus thresholds Both firms had in place thresholds that meant should a certain sales target be reached large bonuses could be earned. At Lloyds TSB this incentive was called the \u2018champagne bonus\u2019 and could see an adviser receiving 35% of their monthly salary as a bonus as soon as they reached their sales target. And here's the full statement from Lloyds: Lloyds Banking Group accepts the findings of an FCA investigation into its historic systems and controls governing bancassurance legacy incentive schemes for branch advisers, and has agreed to pay a fine of \u00a328m. The Group launched its new strategy in 2011 to fully refocus the business on its customers. As part of that approach, the Group has been addressing historic issues and ensuring that customers get fair and appropriate outcomes. As soon as these issues were identified in 2011, the Group acted immediately to make significant changes to ensure that all its schemes focused on doing the right things for customers and providing good service. The FCA has acknowledged that we have made substantial improvements to systems and controls governing incentives. Lloyds Banking Group has co-operated fully throughout the enforcement investigation and has agreed with the FCA the next steps with regard to customers. The Group has already commenced a review to address potential customer impacts that may have occurred as a result of these failings. We are already contacting customers, and will continue to contact potentially affected customers over the coming months. Customers do not need to take any action at this stage to be included in the review and they will be contacted in due course. The Group recognises that its oversight of these particular schemes during the period in question was inadequate and apologises to its customers for the impact that they may have had. We are determined to ensure that any customer impacts are dealt with quickly and fully. Lloyds has accepted the FCA findings, and says the record \u00a328m fine won't have a 'material impact' on the group. 11-Dec-2013 09:27 - LLOYDS BANKING GROUP SAYS ACCEPTS FINDINGS OF FCA INVESTIGATION INTO SALES PRACTICES 11-Dec-2013 09:26 - LLOYDS BANKING GROUP SAYS COST OF FCA ENFORCEMENT AND REVIEW IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE MATERIAL IMPACT ON GROUP The FCA's description of Lloyds' sales practices is depressing, but it's not a shock. Back in March, my colleague Hilary Osborne exposed how there was still a dangerous \"'sell, sell, sell\" culture at the heart of Halifax, a key part of Lloyds Banking Group. She wrote: An employee of Britain's biggest banking group has described a \"disheartening and demotivating\" sales culture that pressurises staff into selling financial products to customers in order to meet strict points-based daily targets. The man, who did not wish to be named, but we will call David Elliott, works as a financial consultant for Halifax. He says his job chiefly entails trying to sell insurance to customers. \"I've been a counter clerk, banking adviser, financial adviser and now I'm a financial consultant \u2013 so I've been at every level there is in a retail bank. It gradually gets worse the higher you climb the ladder and now I'm at the highest seller point in banking and the pressure is abnormal,\" he says. More here: Exposed: bank's high-pressure sales culture continues Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s director of enforcement and financial crime, said that the watchdog's investigation found serious problems at Lloyds: The findings do not make pleasant reading. Financial incentive schemes are an important indicator of what management values and a key influence on the culture of the organisation, so they must be designed with the customer at the heart. The review of incentive schemes that we published last year makes it quite clear that this is something to which we expect all firms to adhere. Customers have a right to expect better from our leading financial institutions and we expect firms to put customers first \u2013 but firms will never be able to do this if they incentivise their staff to do the opposite. McDermott added that Lloyds TSB and Bank of Scotland have made \"substantial changes\" in recent months, reviewing its sales practices and paying compensation to those affected. Just in: the UK's Financial Conduct Authority has hit Lloyds Banking Group with the biggest ever fine levied for retail banking misbehaviour in the UK, after using unacceptable sales targets to motivate its staff. The FCA has penalised Lloyds \u00a328m, after an investigation found widespread evidence that the bank ran flawed sales incentive schemes that encouraged staff to sell products to customers regardless of whether they were in their best interest. In a damning indictment of how Lloyds ran its business, the FCA explained that staff at Lloyds TSB Bank and Bank of Scotland were put under undue pressure to hit sales targets or risk losing bonuses. These bonuses could be almost half of an employee's wage packet. The products in question were mainly investment products (such as share ISAs) and protection products such as PPI. At one stage, staff were offered \"a grand in your hand\" for hitting a particular target. In one instance an adviser sold protection products to himself, his wife and a colleague to prevent himself from being demoted, the FCA said. Lloyds's fine was increased by 10% because regulators had warned that its incentive schemes were poorly managed, and because it was fined for the unsuitable sale of bonds in 2003 \"caused in part by the general pressure to meet sales targets\". The FCA also found that Lloyds staff received bonuses even if the bank knew they'd sold unsuitable products: 229 advisers at Lloyds TSB received a bonus even when all of their assessed sales were deemed unsuitable or potentially unsuitable; and 30 advisers received a bonus in the same circumstances on more the one occasion. European finance ministers, incidentally, didn't make as much progress as we'd hoped over banking reform last night. After a long, drawn-out meeting, ministers agreed some broad details, but couldn't decide one key question -- how to share the cost of dealing with a failed bank. The FT's Peter Spiegel and Alex Barker stayed up late for the action (or lack or) and reported: A marathon negotiating session in Brussels produced a draft compromise, broadly based on Germany\u2019s revised position, which sets out how eurozone countries cede power to a central bank resolution authority and establish a common funding network. While the basic parameters are likely to survive in a final deal, several countries raised strong objections to Berlin-backed conditions that slowly phase in a single resolution fund \u2013 and gives big countries a greater say on when it can be used. These voting arrangements and financing details \u2013 including the unaddressed issue of what happens should the bank resolution funds be exhausted \u2013 will be left to a final emergency meeting next Wednesday, on the eve a summit of EU leaders. Here's their full story: EU sets out framework for banking union City traders also faced a challenge to find their offices in the fog gripping London today -- as this lovely picture shows: There's a pretty muted reaction in the City, with the FTSE 100 up just 6 points. It's being dragged down a little by Royal Bank of Scotland - whose shares have fallen 1.6% as investors react to the news that finance director Nathan Bostock is resigning, apparently to join Santander. Traders are also calculating that the outbreak of peace on Capitol Hill will encourage the Federal Reserve to begin slowing its stimulus programme, currently pumping $85bn into the system each month. The Financial Times reckons the deal is a decent start on the long road to dealing with America's debts: Due to its limited nature, the deal does not tackle broader fiscal problems affecting the US, such as the long-term cost of health and pension plans which could become more expensive as a consequence of the ageing population. It also does not contain big changes to the tax code, which many on Capitol Hill want to see transformed. \u201cThis bipartisan deal looks like a good step, but it doesn\u2019t address the real drivers of our long-term debt,\u201d said Michael Peterson, president of the Peter G Peterson Foundation, which advocates for a bigger deficit reduction deal. \u201cWe should all welcome our lawmakers coming together on a budget agreement that would end the recent cycle of governing by crisis. But make no mistake \u2013 we still have a lot more to do to put our nation on a sustainable fiscal path. FT: US Congress strikes budget deal Marketwatch points out that some in the Republican party could oppose it - -suggesting a battle to get it through the House of Representatives House Speaker John Boehner praised the deal but didn\u2019t address whether it can pass the House. \u201cWhile modest in scale, this agreement represents a positive step forward by replacing one-time spending cuts with permanent reforms to mandatory spending programs that will produce real, lasting savings,\u201d he said in a statement. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who may run for president, quickly came out against the deal, calling it \u201cirresponsible\u201d and charging that it doesn\u2019t reduce the U.S. debt. Marketwatch: Murray, Ryan reach two-year U.S. budget deal Business Insider breaks down the numbers; The legislation provides $63 billion in sequester relief over two years, which is split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. This is offset by targeted spending cuts and non-tax revenues that total $85 billion. Ryan and Murray said that the deal reduces the deficit between $20 and $23 billion. Murray said that the deal includes an additional $6 billion in revenue from additional federal worker pension contributions. Military employees take the same hit in the deal. BI: BUDGET DEAL REACHED \u2014 Here's What You Need To Know And here's the Guardian's take: Aspects of the deal may alarm both parties, particularly Democrats, who are being asked to accept additional spending cuts, no new taxes and increased pension contributions from public sector workers. Nevertheless the prospect of ending years of political deadlock appeared to satisfy political leaders of both parties, whose expectations have been lowered by the recent government shutdown and a virtual standstill on a host of other issues. US congressional leaders unveil two-year budget deal The deal doesn't address one problem, though -- America's debt ceiling. Congress still needs to agree to raise US borrowing limits in February 2014, or risk a default. The thawing of relations between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill may mean the debt ceiling is less of a poisoned pill? Here's Michael Hewson of CMC Markets's take: The new deal, if approved by Congress, which seems likely, would last until 2015, and ease the severity of some recent budget cuts, with slightly higher spending levels of $63bn. This agreement, while a positive for markets, would then remove one potential land mine for markets ahead of February\u2019s debt ceiling deadline, which still remains unresolved. It is likely that neither side will be pleased with the deal on the margins, but the hope is that enough Democrats and Republicans will be able to swallow it to be able to push it through Congress. The agreement reached by Ryan and Murray comes to $85bn -- made up of $63bn in cancelled sequestor cuts, and and around $22bn in deficit reduction. Small beer, compared to America's $17 trillion national debt -- but enough to avert another shutdown in January. Chris Weston of IG says it's a cause to celebrate: Finally US politics is starting to look like it can actually function without political partisanship or using the economy or markets as a bargaining tool like we\u2019ve seen over the recent year. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, reckons the deal means investors should fret less about America's fiscal problems in 2014. He told CNBC the deal was good for stocks: The short-term fiscal easing next year, the fact that Congress after years of dysfunctional behaviour has reached a compromise on their own without a crisis \u2013 all of those things are positive. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and the business world. There's a sense of relief in the financial world this morning after an unexpected burst of bipartisan co-operation in Washington. Democrats and Republicans negotiators have agreed a deal to set spending levels until 2015 - averting the risk of a repeat of the government shutdown which gripped the markets in October. In a welcome development, Senate Budget Committee chairman Senator Patty Murray, and her House counterpart Paul Ryan, stood shoulder-to-shoulder to announce the proposal, which could be voted through within days. Ryan declared: I think this agreement is a clear improvement on the status quo. It makes sure we don\u2019t lurch from crisis to crisis. The plan hammered out by Murray and Ryan is significant for two reasons -- it eases some of the pain of looming spending cuts (the sequester), and it could end the damaging pattern of deadlock between the two parties. President Obama hailed both sides for breaking \"the cycle of short-sighted, crisis-driven decision-making to get this done.\" Under the agreement, federal spending would be fixed at around $1.012tn -- a compromise between the two sides. It means an extra $63bn in government spending over the next two years -- which should please the International Monetary Fund, which feared the US was tightening fiscal policy too fast. That's got implications for the European economies too -- the sequester threatened to knock the eurozone's already weak recovery off course. As our Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts explains, the deal is not without its critics: Rather than raising new taxes to pay for the sequester relief \u2013 something Republicans were implacably opposed to \u2013 negotiators agreed to raise additional government revenue through fees, such as airport charges and by demanding that federal workers pay more toward their pensions. Union umbrella group, the AFL-CIO, has already hit out at the proposal, arguing that federal workers were acting as a \u201cpunching bag\u201d for Republicans. The deal still needs to be voted through Congress. And it doesn't fix America's fiscal challenges - but it's a start. As Murray put it: For years we have lurched from crisis to crisis. That uncertainty was devastating to our fragile economic recovery. Reaction to follow, along with other details of the day ahead....",

      "body": "<p><strong>I have successfully avoided reading anything about this Volcker Rule for around three years. Why are you harshing my mellow?</strong></p> <p>Let\u2019s strike a deal: you can resume ignoring the Volcker Rule shortly but pay attention just today, because it\u2019s a really important day in the history of US financial regulation, and it could change the way the entire financial system works. So just take a few minutes and then go back to ignoring it.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s a compelling offer. I can\u2019t wait to start ignoring this tomorrow. Okay, so talk me through this. Start at the top. Paul Volcker \u2013 why do we care what he thinks about the financial system? I mean, everyone\u2019s a critic, right?</strong></p> <p>Paul Volcker is not just a critic. He\u2019s the 86-year-old former chairman of the Federal Reserve and all-around wise man in finance who believes the financial system is not working the way it should be.</p> <p>Three years ago, when Congress was talking about Dodd-Frank financial reform, he started worrying about something: banks were taking big risks by investing their money in stocks, bonds, commodities and other risky assets. That was called proprietary trading, and it was kept hidden from the public.</p> <p>Volcker envisioned a day when a bank would make a big, secret stupid bet with its own money, and then it would lose so much money that it would hurt the rest of us: either the bank would be in so much trouble that our deposits would be at risk, or the bank would require a bailout, or both. Volcker wanted to find a way to prevent that. So he (and hundreds of other people) started writing the Volcker Rule.</p> <p><strong>So why is the Volcker Rule news this week?</strong></p> <p>After three years and many big fights, five big regulatory agencies have voted to pass the rule: <a href=\"go.usa.gov/ZqB4\">the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a>.&#xa0;The CFTC actually had a snow day but they voted anyway.</p> <p><strong>A snow day? What? There\u2019s barely any snow in Washington.</strong></p> <p>I know. The CFTC has a small budget. Maybe they can\u2019t afford mittens.</p> <p><strong>Also: three years! Why did it take so long?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s worse than that, actually. Volcker first started talking about the rule in 2009, so it\u2019s really more like four years. And the rules don\u2019t really go into effect until July 21, 2015 for banks overseen by the Federal Reserve. Midsize banks, with less than $50bn in assets, have until 2016. Small banks \u2013 the ones with less than $10bn in assets \u2013 don\u2019t have to start fully cooperating until 2017. So we\u2019re talking about an eight-year gestation period in some cases.</p> <p><strong>Eight years! Why is it taking so long?</strong></p> <p>A few reasons. The biggest one is that, like the Godfather, the Volcker Rule has powerful enemies. Banks didn\u2019t like it and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-08/will-the-volcker-rule-be-tough-enough-.html\">spammed regulators with nearly 20,000 comment letters</a>, not to mention all the money they spent on lobbyists to fight it.&#xa0;Another reason is that all the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323838204579000623890621830\">agencies insisted on passing the same exact version of the rule</a>, and that took ages of back and forth. It\u2019s amazing it got this far. Even now, a lot of people expect it to get watered down.</p> <p><strong>Okay, but wait. You said that Volcker was worried about banks making stupid investments.&#xa0;What\u2019s wrong with banks investing in things? If I had money, I\u2019d be investing in all sorts of things.</strong></p>  <p>Theoretically, nothing\u2019s wrong with investing, except that banks are bad at it and, as we saw in 2008, when they make bad decisions we have to bail them out. Banks lose absurd amounts of money on proprietary bets all the time; $1bn isn\u2019t unusual, and some, like the London Whale trade, lose $6bn.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how bad it is: Between 2006 and 2011, banks m<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-13/wall-street-lost-221-million-on-proprietary-trading-since-2006-gao-says.html\">ade $15.6bn on proprietary bets, and they lost $15.8bn</a>. So they came up short, with $221m in losses. You\u2019d be better off flipping a coin in many cases than betting the way a bank does.</p> <p><strong>Losing more money than you make. Hmmm. That sounds like \u2026 not a smart business model.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, but there\u2019s a reason banks stay in that business. When they hit the jackpot they really hit it. Like a gambler, that chance of a win keeps them in the game, even if it\u2019s only a temporary profit. And anyway, when banks lose money, their executives don\u2019t lose their personal fortunes for the most part. So there\u2019s really no incentive for those executives to stop allowing stupid trading decisions.</p> <p><strong>I see where that could get thorny. But has that actually happened? Has any bank lost money for its shareholders by using deposits to make bad bets?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m so glad you asked. Do you remember the London Whale scandal? <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/easy-street/jp-morgans-loss-explainer\">It\u2019s all explained here</a>, if you want to revisit it.&#xa0;The bank had a $350bn \u201cchief investment office\u201d that was fueled purely by \u201cexcess customer deposits.\u201d That bet went bad and<a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/easy-street/jp-morgans-loss-explainer\"> JP Morgan lost $6 billion</a>. The bank is so profitable that it could absorb the loss \u2013 that time. That kind of thing would be a violation of the Volcker Rule now.</p>  <p><strong>I\u2019m not sure I really understand proprietary trading and why it\u2019s a problem. Can we go over that again?</strong></p> <p>Sure. Think about it this way: for years, banks were middlemen, buying and selling things for other people. They\u2019d find a good price, and then broker a deal. They were in the moving business, shuffling securities like stocks, bonds, commodities and derivatives out the door as fast as they came in, from this guy to that guy. That is called \u201cmarket making\u201d.</p> <p>Sometimes their customers would want to take big risks, say, that General Motors stock would go down. But any bet can go wrong. So the banks would find a way to help the companies hedge their bets: if they bet that one stock or bond would go up, the bank would help them find another one that would go down. That way, the company wouldn\u2019t lose all its money on a single bet. That\u2019s called \u201chedging\u201d.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the twist: in both market-making and hedging, banks hold on to the stocks or bonds or derivatives temporarily until they find a buyer on the other side.</p> <p>But you can\u2019t see that temporary money in your account, watching all that money passing by you, walking through the building, and not want a cut, right? So more and more banks have been stepping into the center of trades, looking at what customers are doing and then taking a chunk of those deals for themselves to make a profit on the side.</p> <p><strong>I think I\u2019m getting closer to getting it. Is there a more tangible way to see it?</strong></p> <p>Okay, here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/volcker-rule-aims-fewer-risks-market\">another way to see it</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt might be easier if you think of stocks and bonds like rugs, and think of the banks like rug merchants. So what is the job of a rug merchant? He buys rugs from the makers, and sells them to other people. But he also keeps some of the inventory for himself \u2013 the rugs that he thinks will be valuable one day.</p> <p>Banks are exactly like that. They buy and sell stocks for their clients, and then there's some stuff off to the side that they are holding onto \u2013 that they think is the really good stuff. The Volcker Rule wants the banks to stop hoarding rugs, because sometimes, those rugs don't turn out to be really valuable. They turn out to be junk. And then, when the rug merchant \u2013 or the bank \u2013 has too many worthless rugs, the government tends to come in and as we know, bail them out.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <p>Buying and selling those rugs on the side is how banks do proprietary trading. Investment banks like to make investments with \u201ctheir own money\u201d in things like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities.</p> <p><strong>Wait. Why did you put \u201ctheir own money\u201d in scare quotes? Isn\u2019t it their money?</strong></p> <p>Well, banks don\u2019t really have their \u201cown money\u201d any more. A long time ago, investment banks used to be partnerships owned by small families or groups of rich men, all Rothschilds and Lazards and such, and they actually did put their own money, from their own bank accounts, into things like oil wells in Nigeria and Russia. They still made stupid bets often, but they lost only their own money if they did.</p> <p><strong>And now?</strong></p> <p>Since 2000, though, banks don\u2019t have their \u201cown money\u201d in that way. Banks now almost purely consist of other people\u2019s money. Almost all the big banks are public companies, listed on major stock exchanges. JP Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley \u2013 all public companies, just like Apple or GM. Their owners are not rich bankers; their owners are anyone who buys their stock. The benefit of being public is that banks have a lot more money to play with \u2013 all those delicious billions from shareholders! It\u2019s a nice little cushion for stupid bets.</p> <p>Plus, all the big banks get the privilege of borrowing money really cheaply from the Federal Reserve. So <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-08/will-the-volcker-rule-be-tough-enough-.html\">that\u2019s already a subsidy for them to help them make profits</a>.&#xa0;The idea that banks have their \u201cown money\u201d is a convenient illusion. If JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon or Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein or Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat allow bad trades, they don\u2019t lose any of their personal fortunes.</p> <p><strong>But isn\u2019t that what banks do? They take our deposits and take risks with them. They take those stupid risks to make more profits, probably. And when banks are profitable, isn\u2019t that better for everyone? It\u2019s better than bailing them out all the time.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s right about taking risks with deposits. But it\u2019s not just making a profit that counts \u2013 it\u2019s how they make a profit. In the words of the great Lebowski, \u201cthis isn\u2019t \u2018Nam. There are rules.\u201d It\u2019s about taking manageable risks. Usually, things like loans are manageable risks; the math on them isn\u2019t too hard, and you can generally predict the losses. <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/10/18/794518/-Scientists-Prove-Toxic-Assets-are-Impossible-to-Regulate\">Things like complex mortgage securities are not, because almost no one is smart enough to know what they\u2019re worth</a>.&#xa0;When banks take risks and make money, it\u2019s great. When they lose money, taxpayers have to step in to bail them out.</p> <p>The Volcker Rule is, for some, a way to bring back some order in the markets, a kind of nostalgia for a simpler time.</p> <p><strong>I think I read about this! The Glass-Steagall Act, right? That was a big deal for Occupy Wall Street.</strong></p> <p>Exactly. Investment banks and commercial banks were kept separated between the 1930s and 2000 by a law called Glass-Steagall. The purpose of Glass-Steagall was to prevent banks from taking stupid bets with customer money.</p>  <p><strong>What was the difference between investment banks and commercial banks?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s easy. Think of investment banks as the adrenaline-driven businesses. Investment banks mostly existed to handle the markets \u2013 stocks, bonds, commodities, derivatives, advising companies on mergers or bankruptcies. They were risky, so they weren\u2019t allowed to get bailouts or special lending rates from the government.</p> <p>Now all the big investment banks are gone. Bear Stearns and Lehman collapsed, and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were forced to become commercial banks in 2008 during the financial crisis so the government could bail them out.</p> <p><strong>And commercial banks?</strong></p> <p>Then we had banks that existed to take care of our deposits, and they weren\u2019t making bets on the markets; they were called commercial banks. Those banks took our deposits and made loans to people and companies. That kept money moving through the country and the financial system. You\u2019re part of it. Whenever you put your paycheck in your savings account, you get an interest rate, right? That interest rate is actually a rental payment from the bank to keep your money with them. In turn, by depositing the money, you\u2019re giving the bank permission to take the money in your savings account and rent it out to other people in the form of loans and mortgages.</p> <p>The banks make their profits by taking the difference between the low interest rate they pay you on savings, and the slightly higher interest rate they charge other people to borrow money.</p> <p><strong>Okay. I think I get it. All our banks are now commercial banks that hold our deposits and Paul Volcker doesn\u2019t want them to do stupid gambling things with our money.</strong></p> <p>Exactly.</p> <p><strong>And yet \u2013 good luck with that.</strong></p> <p>Exactly.</p>",

Banks didn\u2019t like it and spammed regulators with nearly 20,000 comment letters, not to mention all the money they spent on lobbyists to fight it. Another reason is that all the agencies insisted on passing the same exact version of the rule, and that took ages of back and forth. It\u2019s amazing it got this far. Even now, a lot of people expect it to get watered down. Okay, but wait. You said that Volcker was worried about banks making stupid investments. What\u2019s wrong with banks investing in things? If I had money, I\u2019d be investing in all sorts of things. Theoretically, nothing\u2019s wrong with investing, except that banks are bad at it and, as we saw in 2008, when they make bad decisions we have to bail them out. Banks lose absurd amounts of money on proprietary bets all the time; $1bn isn\u2019t unusual, and some, like the London Whale trade, lose $6bn. Here\u2019s how bad it is: Between 2006 and 2011, banks made $15.6bn on proprietary bets, and they lost $15.8bn. So they came up short, with $221m in losses. You\u2019d be better off flipping a coin in many cases than betting the way a bank does. Losing more money than you make. Hmmm. That sounds like \u2026 not a smart business model. Yeah, but there\u2019s a reason banks stay in that business. When they hit the jackpot they really hit it. Like a gambler, that chance of a win keeps them in the game, even if it\u2019s only a temporary profit. And anyway, when banks lose money, their executives don\u2019t lose their personal fortunes for the most part. So there\u2019s really no incentive for those executives to stop allowing stupid trading decisions. I see where that could get thorny. But has that actually happened? Has any bank lost money for its shareholders by using deposits to make bad bets? I\u2019m so glad you asked. Do you remember the London Whale scandal? It\u2019s all explained here, if you want to revisit it. The bank had a $350bn \u201cchief investment office\u201d that was fueled purely by \u201cexcess customer deposits.\u201d That bet went bad and JP Morgan lost $6 billion. The bank is so profitable that it could absorb the loss \u2013 that time. That kind of thing would be a violation of the Volcker Rule now. I\u2019m not sure I really understand proprietary trading and why it\u2019s a problem. Can we go over that again? Sure. Think about it this way: for years, banks were middlemen, buying and selling things for other people. They\u2019d find a good price, and then broker a deal. They were in the moving business, shuffling securities like stocks, bonds, commodities and derivatives out the door as fast as they came in, from this guy to that guy. That is called \u201cmarket making\u201d. Sometimes their customers would want to take big risks, say, that General Motors stock would go down. But any bet can go wrong. So the banks would find a way to help the companies hedge their bets: if they bet that one stock or bond would go up, the bank would help them find another one that would go down. That way, the company wouldn\u2019t lose all its money on a single bet. That\u2019s called \u201chedging\u201d. Here\u2019s the twist: in both market-making and hedging, banks hold on to the stocks or bonds or derivatives temporarily until they find a buyer on the other side. But you can\u2019t see that temporary money in your account, watching all that money passing by you, walking through the building, and not want a cut, right? So more and more banks have been stepping into the center of trades, looking at what customers are doing and then taking a chunk of those deals for themselves to make a profit on the side. I think I\u2019m getting closer to getting it. Is there a more tangible way to see it? Okay, here\u2019s another way to see it: \u201cIt might be easier if you think of stocks and bonds like rugs, and think of the banks like rug merchants. So what is the job of a rug merchant? He buys rugs from the makers, and sells them to other people. But he also keeps some of the inventory for himself \u2013 the rugs that he thinks will be valuable one day. Banks are exactly like that. They buy and sell stocks for their clients, and then there's some stuff off to the side that they are holding onto \u2013 that they think is the really good stuff. The Volcker Rule wants the banks to stop hoarding rugs, because sometimes, those rugs don't turn out to be really valuable. They turn out to be junk. And then, when the rug merchant \u2013 or the bank \u2013 has too many worthless rugs, the government tends to come in and as we know, bail them out.\u201d Buying and selling those rugs on the side is how banks do proprietary trading. Investment banks like to make investments with \u201ctheir own money\u201d in things like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Wait. Why did you put \u201ctheir own money\u201d in scare quotes? Isn\u2019t it their money? Well, banks don\u2019t really have their \u201cown money\u201d any more. A long time ago, investment banks used to be partnerships owned by small families or groups of rich men, all Rothschilds and Lazards and such, and they actually did put their own money, from their own bank accounts, into things like oil wells in Nigeria and Russia. They still made stupid bets often, but they lost only their own money if they did. And now? Since 2000, though, banks don\u2019t have their \u201cown money\u201d in that way. Banks now almost purely consist of other people\u2019s money. Almost all the big banks are public companies, listed on major stock exchanges. JP Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley \u2013 all public companies, just like Apple or GM. Their owners are not rich bankers; their owners are anyone who buys their stock. The benefit of being public is that banks have a lot more money to play with \u2013 all those delicious billions from shareholders! It\u2019s a nice little cushion for stupid bets. Plus, all the big banks get the privilege of borrowing money really cheaply from the Federal Reserve. So that\u2019s already a subsidy for them to help them make profits. The idea that banks have their \u201cown money\u201d is a convenient illusion. If JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon or Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein or Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat allow bad trades, they don\u2019t lose any of their personal fortunes. But isn\u2019t that what banks do? They take our deposits and take risks with them. They take those stupid risks to make more profits, probably. And when banks are profitable, isn\u2019t that better for everyone? It\u2019s better than bailing them out all the time. That\u2019s right about taking risks with deposits. But it\u2019s not just making a profit that counts \u2013 it\u2019s how they make a profit. In the words of the great Lebowski, \u201cthis isn\u2019t \u2018Nam. There are rules.\u201d It\u2019s about taking manageable risks. Usually, things like loans are manageable risks; the math on them isn\u2019t too hard, and you can generally predict the losses. Things like complex mortgage securities are not, because almost no one is smart enough to know what they\u2019re worth. When banks take risks and make money, it\u2019s great. When they lose money, taxpayers have to step in to bail them out. The Volcker Rule is, for some, a way to bring back some order in the markets, a kind of nostalgia for a simpler time. I think I read about this! The Glass-Steagall Act, right? That was a big deal for Occupy Wall Street. Exactly. Investment banks and commercial banks were kept separated between the 1930s and 2000 by a law called Glass-Steagall. The purpose of Glass-Steagall was to prevent banks from taking stupid bets with customer money. What was the difference between investment banks and commercial banks? It\u2019s easy. Think of investment banks as the adrenaline-driven businesses. Investment banks mostly existed to handle the markets \u2013 stocks, bonds, commodities, derivatives, advising companies on mergers or bankruptcies. They were risky, so they weren\u2019t allowed to get bailouts or special lending rates from the government. Now all the big investment banks are gone. Bear Stearns and Lehman collapsed, and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were forced to become commercial banks in 2008 during the financial crisis so the government could bail them out. And commercial banks? Then we had banks that existed to take care of our deposits, and they weren\u2019t making bets on the markets; they were called commercial banks. Those banks took our deposits and made loans to people and companies. That kept money moving through the country and the financial system. You\u2019re part of it. Whenever you put your paycheck in your savings account, you get an interest rate, right? That interest rate is actually a rental payment from the bank to keep your money with them. In turn, by depositing the money, you\u2019re giving the bank permission to take the money in your savings account and rent it out to other people in the form of loans and mortgages. The banks make their profits by taking the difference between the low interest rate they pay you on savings, and the slightly higher interest rate they charge other people to borrow money. Okay. I think I get it. All our banks are now commercial banks that hold our deposits and Paul Volcker doesn\u2019t want them to do stupid gambling things with our money. Exactly. And yet \u2013 good luck with that. Exactly.",

      "body": "<p>Bus and train company FirstGroup has dismissed a plan from one of its biggest shareholders to sell one of its US businesses to pay down debt.</p> <p>Sandell Asset Management, a hedge fund with a 3.1% stake in FirstGroup, had urged the board to sell its Greyhound coach business and school bus division, arguing this would cut debts and boost the group's languishing share price.</p> <p>In a statement on Wednesday, First Group rebuffed Sandell's proposal, saying it contained \"a number of structural flaws and inaccuracies\".</p> <p>\"The board of FirstGroup notes the recent press speculation and confirms that it has received a proposal from Sandell Asset Management,\" it said. \"The board is open to all means of enhancing long-term value and welcomes the views of the group's shareholders. The group has engaged with Sandell several times, reviewed their proposal in detail and believes that it is not compelling and contains a number of structural flaws and inaccuracies.\"</p> <p>FirstGroup has been struggling with almost \u00a32bn in debts since 2007 when it bought US-based Laidlaw, the owner of Greyhound coaches and yellow school buses. The acquisition was part of an ambitious expansion programme that has seen the Aberdeen-based company go far beyond its origins in Grampian municipal buses to become one of the world's biggest transport companies with 120,000 employees. But its growth plans were derailed last year when the UK government revoked a decision to award it the lucrative contract to run the west coast mainline rail franchise between London and Scotland, following a botched bidding process.</p> <p>In May the group tapped shareholders for \u00a3615m and cancelled its dividend, causing its share price to drop 30% in one day.</p> <p>Hedge fund boss Tom Sandell argued that selling off the American assets would deliver \"a 50% upside to shareholders\" and allow FirstGroup to shake off its \"historic poor performance\" by focusing on its UK bus and rail business. FirstGroup's shares rose over 4% on Wednesday to 120p, after the board said it was sticking to its turnaround plan set out in May that would \"deliver superior value for shareholders compared to alternatives that were considered in detail earlier this year, and which remain under review\". The next review is slated for FirstGroup's capital markets day on 23 January, when its new chairman is in post. The transport group last week appointed Aviva chairman John McFarlane to take charge in the boardroom, ending a six-month search after Martin Gilbert ended his 27-year reign in May.

      "bodyText": "Bus and train company FirstGroup has dismissed a plan from one of its biggest shareholders to sell one of its US businesses to pay down debt. Sandell Asset Management, a hedge fund with a 3.1% stake in FirstGroup, had urged the board to sell its Greyhound coach business and school bus division, arguing this would cut debts and boost the group's languishing share price. In a statement on Wednesday, First Group rebuffed Sandell's proposal, saying it contained \"a number of structural flaws and inaccuracies\". \"The board of FirstGroup notes the recent press speculation and confirms that it has received a proposal from Sandell Asset Management,\" it said. \"The board is open to all means of enhancing long-term value and welcomes the views of the group's shareholders. The group has engaged with Sandell several times, reviewed their proposal in detail and believes that it is not compelling and contains a number of structural flaws and inaccuracies.\" FirstGroup has been struggling with almost \u00a32bn in debts since 2007 when it bought US-based Laidlaw, the owner of Greyhound coaches and yellow school buses. The acquisition was part of an ambitious expansion programme that has seen the Aberdeen-based company go far beyond its origins in Grampian municipal buses to become one of the world's biggest transport companies with 120,000 employees. But its growth plans were derailed last year when the UK government revoked a decision to award it the lucrative contract to run the west coast mainline rail franchise between London and Scotland, following a botched bidding process. In May the group tapped shareholders for \u00a3615m and cancelled its dividend, causing its share price to drop 30% in one day. Hedge fund boss Tom Sandell argued that selling off the American assets would deliver \"a 50% upside to shareholders\" and allow FirstGroup to shake off its \"historic poor performance\" by focusing on its UK bus and rail business. FirstGroup's shares rose over 4% on Wednesday to 120p, after the board said it was sticking to its turnaround plan set out in May that would \"deliver superior value for shareholders compared to alternatives that were considered in detail earlier this year, and which remain under review\". The next review is slated for FirstGroup's capital markets day on 23 January, when its new chairman is in post. The transport group last week appointed Aviva chairman John McFarlane to take charge in the boardroom, ending a six-month search after Martin Gilbert ended his 27-year reign in May. McFarlane, who joined the board last week, becomes FirstGroup chairman on 1 January. FirstGroup's chief executive, Tim O'Toole, has argued First Group are making progress on their turnaround plan: last month the company reported pre-tax losses had narrowed to \u00a38m in the six months to the end of September, compared with a \u00a320.6m loss in 2012.

      "bodyText": "Men are nearly five times more likely than women to reach a senior executive position in the UK, research has shown. A survey of more than 500 men and women in 13 blue-chip companies showed that male executives were more likely to be seen as decisive and rational, while women were rated as well-organised and ethical \u2013 to the detriment of their promotion chances. \"Women are seen as being very values-led \u2026 and very good about being able to direct people to 'do the right thing',\" said Rachel Short, director of YSC business psychologists. \"Men were seen as being very good at rational and analytical decision making.\" The research is published by the 30% Club, a group of companies including Diageo, RBS and John Lewis, which has pledged to get more talented women into their boardrooms. A separate strand of the research found that men were four and half times more likely to progress to the executive suite. Although the researchers found no difference in how male and female bosses were rated, the disparity in how their strengths were perceived was in line with the classic \"think manager, think male\" findings of other research, Short said. It was unclear whether real differences existed: \"They may be contexability differences - women working in different roles, functional rather than commercial - [they may be] actual differences, stereotypes or a combination of the three.\" Speaking to the Guardian recently, Vicki Saward, strategic pursuit director at BAE Systems Detica, said she had encountered stereotypes about her maths abilities since her student days \u2013 although it had never held her back. \"There is still a perception that because you are a women you can't do maths. Recently, somebody made a comment to me 'oh you can't do maths' [and] my team cracked up\", says Saward, who holds a PhD in mathematics from Oxford University.\"People assume that I must have a comms or HR background.\" Short said women were climbing up company ladders, but warned that too many were assimilating to \"a system that rewards presenteeism and availability over time efficiency\". While this might boost the number of women executives in the short term, it could hamper progress in the long-run by preventing \"a mass systemic overhaul\" of UK corporate life. The current generation of mid-ranking women \"are not militating, they are not agitating, they are really conforming to what they believe the routes of success is\" Short said. \"They are over-assimilating to a culture that some men are now saying they don't want.\" Helena Morrissey, the high-flying fund manager and founder of the 30% Club, said: \"Men and women are different \u2013 equally intelligent but we behave differently and are motivated by different things. This new research gives more depth to the intuitive argument that balanced teams perform better, and gives companies specific actionable ideas to improve their management of all talent \u2013 regardless of gender\".",

Speaking to journalists about the decision, Devereux said: \u201cThere is no question this is a difficult day not just for Holden but for the country \u2026 we have been part of the industrialisation of this country.\u201d But he said the company had determined on Tuesday afternoon, shortly after he had reassured the Productivity Commission that no decision had been made, that \u201cbuilding cars in this country is just not sustainable\u201d. He refused to answer questions about what level of government assistance could have convinced the company to stay, saying only \u201cwe understand the point of view of the government of the day\u201d. \u201cMake no mistake we have looked at every possible option to build our next generation cars here in this country \u2026 no matter which way we applied the numbers our long-term business case \u2026 was simply not viable,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Holden has rejected claims it did not bid to supply Tony Abbott with armoured cars after reports emerged the prime minister\u2019s office was planning to ditch its fleet of Holdens for bombproof BMWs. The car manufacturer said it was also not made aware of an opportunity to supply 20 armoured cars for the G20 summit in Brisbane, but in a statement to Guardian Australia said it would be interested in tendering for that too. The nine Holden Caprices used by the government regularly are being replaced in a contract worth more than $4m to the successful tender. No official decision has been made but the Daily Telegraph reported, citing anonymous government sources, that the prime minister\u2019s office is leaning towards buying up bombproof BMWs after Holden failed to put in a bid. Holden has disputed the claim, saying it is involved in two of the bids and still hopeful of clinching the contract. A spokeswoman said the company was unaware of the separate tender to supply 20 armoured cars to international leaders during next year\u2019s G20. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no formal request from the government to supply armoured vehicles for the G20 summit but we would be interested to look at this opportunity,\u201d she said. Holden is already supplying a fleet of 60 cars to the G20, made up of 40 Caprices and 20 Calais vehicles. A spokesman for prime minister did not confirm a decision had been reached. \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on the procurement process, but the government\u2019s priority is to get a replacement fleet of armoured cars that meet security specification requirements at the best value for taxpayers,\u201d he said. The possibility of Holdens being ditched as the cars of choice for the prime minister comes as the manufacturer\u2019s future in Australia is on unstable footing. After reports the company was considering pulling out of Australia because of questions about the sustainability of its operation in the country, the government has written to Holden demanding an immediate statement on its plans for the Australian plants. However, Holden is yet to hear the outcome of an important government-commissioned report from the productivity commission which will determine whether the Coalition offers long-term government funding.",
