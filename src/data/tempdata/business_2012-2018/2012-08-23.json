      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland's involvement in the Libor rigging scandal could be worse than Barclays' and may force the state-owned bank to pay a bigger fine than its UK rival, an MP has claimed. John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury select committee, said \"City insiders\" had suggested RBS's involvement may be \"noticeably worse\" than Barclays'. Barclays was forced to pay \u00a3290m in June by US and British authorities for its role in trying to manipulate Libor, which affect the cost of borrowing for millions of customers around the world. More than a dozen banks, including RBS, are under investigation by regulators in the US, Europe and Asia for suspected rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which is used to price trillions of dollars of financial products. RBS chief executive Stephen Hester has already warned that the bank is likely to face fines. It is thought that Barclays received a reduced fine for settling early.

Mann's concerns have been heightened by City minister Mark Hoban's claim that he only learned of the scandal in recent times. Mann asked: \"Why was the City Minister kept in the dark and who else has been kept in the dark? \"If Osborne denies receiving any information there needs to be a full Cabinet Secretary investigation into the running of the UK taxpayers investment in RBS; the failure to protect future share values and the liability of both Osborne and UKFI if losses accrue to the taxpayer due to a lack of due diligence.\" Mann suggested that Osborne's position is compromised because he has based his fiscal projections on an anticipated windfall from the reprivatisation of RBS. A spokesperson for the Treasury said it would not comment on a current investigation. Mann's comments came as a former RBS trader claimed that the bank's internal checks were so lax that anyone could change Libor rates. Court documents filed in Singapore show that Tan Chi Min, who is suing RBS for wrongful dismissal, claimed that in 2008 a trader for the bank, Will Hall, changed the Libor submission even though he was part of the Japanese yen swap desk in London. The papers show that Tan, who worked for RBS in Singapore, raised the issue at his disciplinary meeting last September, saying the bank's internal procedure in London seemed to be that \"anyone can change Libor\". Tan alleges that the bank's minutes of his disciplinary meeting omitted details of this and other conversations about how traders at the bank tried to influence RBS's interbank lending rate submissions. He was sacked in November as head of delta trading for RBS's global banking and markets division for trying to improperly influence the bank's rate setters.

      "bodyText": "A former trader for Royal Bank of Scotland Group has claimed that the bank's internal checks were so lax that anyone could change Libor rates. More than a dozen banks, including RBS, are under investigation by regulators in the US, Europe and Asia for suspected rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which is used to price trillions of dollars of financial products. Barclays was fined \u00a3290m in June by American and British authorities for its role in trying to manipulate the interest rates, which affect the cost of borrowing for millions of customers around the world. Court documents filed in Singapore show that Tan Chi Min, who is suing RBS for wrongful dismissal, claimed that in 2008 a trader for the bank, Will Hall, changed the Libor submission himself even though he was part of the Japanese yen swap desk in London. The papers show that Tan, who worked for RBS in Singapore, raised the issue at his disciplinary meeting last September, saying that the bank's internal procedure in London seemed to be that \"anyone can change Libor\". Tan alleges that the bank's minutes of his disciplinary meeting omitted details of this and other conversations about how traders at the bank tried to influence RBS's interbank lending rate submissions. He was sacked from his Singapore-based role as head of delta trading for RBS's global banking and markets division in November for trying to improperly influence the bank's rate setters. Delta trading involves using derivatives to mirror the price moves in a basket of securities. Tan filed a lawsuit against the bank late last year, claiming the practice of traders making requests to the bank's rate setters was well known by RBS management. RBS is disputing the allegations, saying Tan was dismissed for gross misconduct and that it followed its company disciplinary policy in deciding to terminate his contract. It has already announced that it has sacked several employees for misconduct as a result of its investigations. Tan is claiming a loss of bonuses from the bank totalling $1.1m (\u00a3693,000) and 3.3m RBS shares. The bank reiterated that it \"continues to co-operate fully with ongoing investigations relating to the setting of Libor and other interest rates\". RBS' chief executive, Stephen Hester, has warned that the bank is likely to face fines, like Barclays. RBS is 82% owned by the British taxpayer. The Libor scandal, which has engulfed the banking industry, led to the resignation of three senior Barclays executives \u2013 chief executive Bob Diamond, his former right-hand man Jerry del Missier and chairman Marcus Agius, who was subsequently reinstated to search for a new chief executive. Barclays has appointed Sir David Walker as chairman from 1 November, when Agius will step down, but is still looking for a replacement for Diamond. Last week MPs accused Diamond of being \"highly selective\" in the evidence he gave to their emergency hearings on rigging Libor interest rates. The Treasury select committee also criticised the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, the chief City regulator, for not acting sooner: the FSA's investigation of Libor was two years behind the US. The Bank of England will take over the lead role in banking regulation next year when the FSA is disbanded. Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, has also admitted that a \"limited number\" of its staff were involved in the possible manipulation of Libor rates. HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and UBS are also under investigation. UK regulators are looking into instituting a reform of the Libor rates are set. Currently, they are compiled from a number of banks submitting their estimate of the price they would need to pay to borrow from other banks over periods ranging from overnight to 12 months, in a range of currencies.",

The announcement will not hit shares until tomorrow, as it was made after end of trading. Shares closed up 27p at 639.9p. South African president Jacob Zuma said he will appoint Commissioners to investigate what happened last week. The inquiry will look at Lonmin's conduct, in particular: \u2022 whether it exercised its best endeavours to resolve any disputes which may have arisen between Lonmin and its labour force on the one hand and generally among its labour force on the other; \u2022 whether it responded appropriately to the threat and outbreak of violence which occurred at its premises; \u2022 whether the company, by act or omission, created an environment which was conducive to the creation of tension, labour unrest, disunity among its employees or other harmful conduct; \u2022 whether it employed sufficient safeguards and measures to ensure the safety of its employees and property and the prevention of the outbreak of violence between any parties The Commission will also examine Lonmin policies generally, including the procedure, practices and conduct relating to its employees and organised labour. It will also investigate whether by act or omission, the company directly or indirectly caused loss of life or damage to persons or property. Work has resumed on the mines near Johannesburg after six days inactive, with reports of around 30% of workers returning. Lonmin has been struggling to maintain a clear position throughout the crisis, changing its mind on an almost daily basis. After 34 workers were shot dead by police, the company said illegal striking rock drill operators must return to work the following day. However, it changed its position a day later, giving an indefinite period for return so both sides could work together on a solution. The company also initially said it would not need a rights issue despite admitting it would miss targets, but 48 hours later it changed its mind. Chief executive Ian Farmer is in hospital with a serious illness, which might go some way to explaining the disorganisation. In a short statement it said: Lonmin welcomes the terms of reference announced by President Jacob Zuma for the Judicial Commission of Inquiry on the Marikana tragedy, and will co-operate fully with the commission.",

      "bodyText": "Hewlett-Packard has posted a quarterly loss of $8.9bn after a gigantic writeoff of value of its services division, as it struggles to cope with falling revenues in other core areas including PCs and printing. Its chief executive, Meg Whitman, warned that \"we are still in the early stages of a turnaround\" as she told analysts that it will be a long slog to return the Silicon Valley pioneer to growth. Its stock value shrank by 5% in after-hours trading. HP had indicated earlier in August that it would take an $8bn (\u00a35bn) charge against the shrinking value of the services firm Electronic Data Systems it bought in 2008 for $13bn. But total revenues fell by 3.6% to $8.7bn, and operating income by 6% to $3bn. The biggest drops came in the Personal Systems Group, the world's largest PC business, where revenues fell by 10% and income by 28%, and the enterprise servers and storage group, where revenues fell by 5% and income by 20%. The printing business, also the world's largest, saw revenues fall, though profits improved slightly. HP's woes reflect those of Dell, the world's third-largest PC maker, which earlier this week reported dramatically slowing revenues and profits, and blamed a slowdown in consumer and enterprise spending \u2013 a trend it does not expect to improve in the next quarter. Whitman, the third chief executive in two years, and who took over 11 months ago in a boardroom coup that ejected Leo Apotheker, who had suggested abandoning the PC business because it was too unprofitable, has been driving reorganisations, cost-cutting and job cuts to try to get the 73-year-old company back to growth and to recapture the innovation for which it became famous. The stock has lost more than half its value in the past two years. Whitman acknowledged \"the very serious executive issues\" facing HP as it tries to catch up to its rivals and cope with a weakening economy, particularly in Europe, where uncertainty caused by the eurozone crisis has delayed corporate spending. The writeoff was magnified by costs from redundancies for the first of 27,000 jobs that the company aims to cut between now and October 2014. To cope with the upheaval, HP has been expanding into technology consulting, computer software, data storage and high-end servers made for companies and government agencies. All those specialities are more profitable than the fiercely competitive PC market, where margins declined faster than sales. Whitman suggested that a combination of the growing preference for tablets and smartphones, along with expectation of new machines running Microsoft's Windows 8 due in October, was to blame. If HP's slump worsens, management warned it may have to register additional charges in the current quarter to account for trouble in other acquisitions. Without citing specifics, executives pointed to the company's software operations as one area that could be lumped with a major accounting charge. That division includes Autonomy, the UK business analysis service that HP bought for $11bn last year, but which three months ago saw senior British staff including its founder, Mike Lynch, depart amid complaints about bureaucracy at the US firm strangling Autonomy's corporate culture.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The richest 10% of households in Britain have seen the value of their assets increase by up to \u00a3322,000 as a result of the Bank of England's attempts to use electronic money creation to lift the economy out of its deepest post-war slump. Threadneedle Street said that wealthy families had been the biggest beneficiaries of its \u00a3375bn quantitative-easing (QE) programme, under which it has been buying government gilts for cash since early 2009. The Bank of England calculated that the value of shares and bonds had risen by 26% \u2013 or \u00a3600bn \u2013 as a result of the policy, equivalent to \u00a310,000 for each household in the UK. It added, however, that 40% of the gains went to the richest 5% of households. Although the Bank said it could not come up with precise figures for the gains from QE, estimates can be produced using wealth distribution data from the Office for National Statistics. These show the average boost to the holdings of financial assets and pensions of the richest 10% of households would have been either \u00a3128,000 per household or \u00a3322,000 depending on the methodology used. However, Threadneedle Street said that QE had helped all sections of the population by sparing the country from a deeper slump. The rise in asset prices after QE was announced in early 2009 followed sharp falls in the two previous years. \"Without the Bank's asset purchases, most people in the UK would have been worse off,\" it said in a paper prepared in response to queries from the Commons Treasury committee. The Bank's strategy has been criticised by groups representing savers and pensioners because of its impact on interest rates, annuity rates and gilt yields, which have all fallen since QE began, but Threadneedle Street was unrepentant. \"Economic growth would have been lower. Unemployment would have been higher. Many more firms would have gone out of business. This would have had a significant detrimental impact on savers and pensioners along with every other group in our society. All assessments of asset purchases must be seen in that light.\" The Bank paper admitted that the benefits of ultra-low borrowing costs and asset purchases had not been shared equally. \"Some individuals are likely to have been adversely affected by the direct effects of QE. Many households have received lower interest income on their deposits. \"But changes in bank rate \u2013 not asset purchases \u2013 have been the dominant influence on the interest households receive on bank deposits and pay on bank loans. \"By pushing up a range of asset prices [such as equities and bonds], asset purchases have boosted the value of households' financial wealth held outside pension funds, although holdings are heavily skewed with the top 5% of households holding 40% of these assets.\" After announcing an initial \u00a3200bn tranche of asset purchases when the economy was deep in recession in early 2009, the Bank has since expanded QE on a further three occasions and by later this year it will have bought \u00a3375bn of gilts \u2013 one third of all UK government bonds. \"The past few years have been extremely difficult for many households, with weak growth and above-target inflation being the painful but unavoidable consequences of the severe financial crisis and the associated deep recession, as well as a sharp rise in oil and other commodity prices. In response to these difficult circumstances, monetary policy has been exceptionally expansionary for an unusually long period of time. \"That has supported nominal spending and incomes in the economy as a whole, mitigating the adverse effects of the financial crisis and subsequent recession. Without the loosening in monetary policy, it is likely that the economic downturn would have been far more severe, to the detriment of almost everyone in the economy, including savers and pensioners.\" The Bank said the cut in bank rate to 0.5% \u2013 the lowest on record \u2013 had been the dominant influence on the interest households receive on bank deposits and pay on bank loans. It added that the pension income of those already receiving a pension before asset purchases began had not been affected by QE, and that the retirement incomes of people coming up to retirement in a defined benefit pension scheme were also unaffected. However, the Bank conceded that for a defined benefit pension scheme in substantial deficit, asset prices were likely to have made the shortfall bigger. \"That is because although QE raised the value of the assets and liabilities by a similar proportion, that nonetheless implies a widening in the gap between the two,\" it said. Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: \"It is asserted, but not proven, that pension savers are no worse off due to QE gilt-buying, because the value of their pension savings has gone up to offset the fall in the annuity income they will receive when converting their pension fund into a pension income. This assertion is simply not correct and the reality is very different for those recently or soon-to-be-retired. \"The fall in annuity rates since mid-2008 is over 24%. Cumulative inflation for older age groups has risen by over 20%. The FTSE is relatively unchanged and the average balanced pension fund has performed poorly, so that for people with defined contribution pensions, the impact of QE in reality has not been as the Bank of England is assuming,\" she said. The paper said the main factor behind increased pension deficits and falls in annuity incomes had not been the Bank's asset purchases, but rather the fall in equity prices relative to government bond prices. \"This fall in the relative price of equities was not caused by QE. It happened in all the major economies, much of it occurred prior to the start of asset purchases and stemmed in large part from the reluctance of investors to hold risky assets, such as equities, given the deterioration in the economic outlook as a result of the financial crisis. Indeed, by boosting the economy, monetary policy actions in the United Kingdom and overseas probably dampened this effect.\"",

Many households have received lower interest income on their deposits.</p> <p>\"But changes in bank rate \u2013 not asset purchases \u2013 have been the dominant influence on the interest households receive on bank deposits and pay on bank loans.</p> <p>\"By pushing up a range of asset prices [such as equities and bonds], asset purchases have boosted the value of households' financial wealth held outside pension funds, although holdings are heavily skewed with the top 5% of households holding 40% of these assets.\"</p> <p>After announcing an initial \u00a3200bn tranche of asset purchases when the economy was deep in recession in early 2009, the Bank has since expanded QE on a further three occasions and by later this year it will have bought \u00a3375bn of gilts \u2013 one third of all UK government bonds.</p> <p>\"The past few years have been extremely difficult for many households, with weak growth and above-target inflation being the painful but unavoidable consequences of the severe financial crisis and the associated deep recession, as well as a sharp rise in oil and other commodity prices. In response to these difficult circumstances, monetary policy has been exceptionally expansionary for an unusually long period of time.</p> <p>\"That has supported nominal spending and incomes in the economy as a whole, mitigating the adverse effects of the financial crisis and subsequent recession. Without the loosening in monetary policy, it is likely that the economic downturn would have been far more severe, to the detriment of almost everyone in the economy, including savers and pensioners.\"</p> <p>The Bank said the cut in bank rate to 0.5% \u2013 the lowest on record \u2013 had been the dominant influence on the interest households receive on bank deposits and pay on bank loans. It added that the pension income of those already receiving a pension before asset purchases began had not been affected by QE, and that the retirement incomes of people coming up to retirement in a defined benefit pension scheme were also unaffected.</p> <p>However, the Bank conceded that for a defined benefit pension scheme in substantial deficit, asset prices were likely to have made the shortfall bigger. \"That is because although QE raised the value of the assets and liabilities by a similar proportion, that nonetheless implies a widening in the gap between the two,\" it said.</p> <p>Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: \"It is asserted, but not proven, that pension savers are no worse off due to QE gilt-buying, because the value of their pension savings has gone up to offset the fall in the annuity income they will receive when converting their pension fund into a pension income. This assertion is simply not correct and the reality is very different for those recently or soon-to-be-retired.</p> <p>\"The fall in annuity rates since mid-2008 is over 24%. Cumulative inflation for older age groups has risen by over 20%. The FTSE is relatively unchanged and the average balanced pension fund has performed poorly, so that for people with defined contribution pensions, the impact of QE in reality has not been as the Bank of England is assuming,\" she said.</p> <p>The paper said the main factor behind increased pension deficits and falls in annuity incomes had not been the Bank's asset purchases, but rather the fall in equity prices relative to government bond prices.</p> <p>\"This fall in the relative price of equities was not caused by QE. It happened in all the major economies, much of it occurred prior to the start of asset purchases and stemmed in large part from the reluctance of investors to hold risky assets, such as equities, given the deterioration in the economic outlook as a result of the financial crisis. Indeed, by boosting the economy, monetary policy actions in the United Kingdom and overseas probably dampened this effect.\"</p>",
