      "bodyText": "The British economy risks splitting further along lines drawn by the Brexit vote, according to a report warning pay rises in some parts of the country have failed to match increases in worker productivity. According to the thinktank Localis, there has been a breakdown in the relationship between rising levels of worker productivity \u2013 a key measure of economic output per hour of work \u2013 and increases in pay and feelings of self-worth among employees. Leave-voting areas appear to have been short-changed the most, while remain strongholds have tended to fare much better. Some areas, including Lancashire, Cumbria and the south east midlands, have seen falling rates of pay and worker satisfaction over the last five years, despite rising levels of economic output. Other areas, such as parts of London and Oxfordshire, have seen levels of reward shift upwards over the last five years, sometimes with little improvement in productivity. Almost six in 10 people in Lancashire voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. In Cumbria 56% voted leave and in the south east midlands 55%. London was one of the most pro-remain regions with 60% of people voting to stay in the EU. Oxfordshire also voted strongly to remain. The report found that workers in large parts of the country are failing to benefit from improvements in the economy. This could cast doubt on a central plank of the government\u2019s strategy for boosting workers\u2019 pay by increasing productivity. Two-thirds of the 1,641 people polled by YouGov for the report said they feel little to no benefit when the national economy grows or if their employer does well financially. Meanwhile, half said they feel as though their colleagues and friends are paid less than their work is worth. Ministers are attempting to use the industrial strategy to boost productivity rates amid concerns failure to do so would condemn workers to sluggish pay growth that could struggle to return to pre-financial crisis levels until at least the middle of the next decade. Jack Airey, head of research at Localis, a cross-party not-for-profit thinktank, said: \u201cThe alarm bells should be ringing for some places like Cornwall, the Black Country and the Isles of Scilly, where they\u2019re being left behind by the rest of the economy. \u201cWe need to put some more thought into the industrial strategy. We\u2019re basically asking people to work harder, but for what?\u201d Many areas analysed in the report were found to have upped their productivity rates yet had seen relatively weak, sometimes negative, growth in wages. In one example, Dartford, on the edges of London, has seen economic output per head increase by close to 30% between 2010 and 2015, yet median wage growth was less than 3% over the same period. The report found the five worst areas for wage growth relative to productivity in England over the last five years were Hounslow and Camden in London, as well as Mendip in Somerset, Rushmoor in Hampshire and Three Rivers in Hertfordshire. For places getting left behind economically in the last five years, the report found pay and worker satisfaction had slipped from the national average and warned that without significant intervention from central and local government, there is a risk these places will slide further away from the rest of the country. Responding to the report, Philip Atkins, vice-chair of the County Councils Network and leader of Staffordshire County council, said: \u201cA blanket one-size-fits-all policy will not fulfil the government\u2019s pledge to create \u2018an economy that works for everyone\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Carillion bosses have been accused of demonstrating \u201cgreed on stilts\u201d by worrying more about \u201cfat pay and bonuses\u201d for bosses than looking out for signs of trouble before the company collapsed. MPs investigating the failure of the government contractor released reams of fresh evidence on Monday showing how Carillion sought to boost and protect the rewards for its top executives despite the dire state of its finances. Publishing minutes of the company\u2019s remuneration committee, which set pay and bonuses for senior managers, MPs said Carillion\u2019s directors were \u201cdoing their utmost to ensure there was no impediment to their receipt of fat pay and bonuses\u201d. Frank Field, the Labour chair of the work and pensions committee, which is investigating Carillion\u2019s collapse, said: \u201cIt\u2019s greed on stilts, pure and simple.\u201d Rachel Reeves, chair of the commons business select committee, said: \u201cThese [remuneration committee] papers are further evidence that when the walls were falling down around them, Carillion bosses were focused on their own pay packets rather than their obligation to address the company\u2019s deteriorating balance sheets.\u201d According to the documents, the remuneration committee did at one point consider asking directors to return their bonuses as problems began to mount for the firm in September last year. However, the terms and conditions they had given to the rewards were too weak, rendering clawback impossible. \u201cWhen even the Carillion RemCo [remuneration committee] considered asking for directors to return their bonuses, the system and culture was so dysfunctional, and the terms and clawback provisions so weak, that even this meek step was ruled out,\u201d Reeves added. When considering clawbacks \u2013 an arrangement for retrieving executive rewards in the event of poor performance after a bonus has been paid \u2013 the board opted to rule out extending the use of the device beyond a handful of its most senior directors. The papers show the remuneration committee feared more conservative pay arrangements for particular contracts \u201cwould have a detrimental impact on performance\u201d. The trove of information from the select committees also shows that Carillion\u2019s adviser, Deloitte, said in September that weak provisions didn\u2019t allow any bonuses paid in cash to be clawed back at all. The remuneration committee extended its clawback conditions to cover serious reputational damage and failures of risk management around that time, however, the MPs said they had seen no evidence to suggest any further attempts were made to return cash from bonuses to the business. The latest swathe of evidence against the company comes amid the continuing fallout of Carillion\u2019s collapse in January with debts to its 30,000 suppliers worth about \u00a32bn. Vaughan Engineering, a family-owned company with staff in Edinburgh, Warrington and Newcastle owed money by Carillion, revealed last week that hundreds of jobs were at risk. The company founded in 1955 could be the construction giant\u2019s first supply chain victim to fall into administration. The remuneration committee papers published by MPs also show the company sought \u201cto increase the maximum bonus opportunity\u201d in August 2016, despite a growing revolt among shareholders at the way the firm was setting pay for senior managers. Richard Howson, who headed the company from 2012 until July 2017, pocketed \u00a31.5m in 2016, including a \u00a3122,612 cash bonus and \u00a3231,000 in pension contributions. In the face of the investor feedback, Carillion\u2019s response was to \u201crebadge\u201d the bonuses rather than make any fundamental change, the papers show. The company also attempted to increase the maximum bonus level to 150% of pay in 2016, although it was forced to back down to 100% by shareholders, including the investment management giant BlackRock, which had expressed concerns. Carillion also increased its use of retention bonuses and raised the pay of some managers to prevent them leaving as the company started to issue profits warnings, the papers show. It has already been revealed that Carillion\u2019s former chairman Philip Green had only a \u201ctenuous grasp\u201d on the crisis in the firm\u2019s finances, and was working towards an \u201cupbeat announcement\u201d to the City just five days before unveiling a \u00a3845m writedown.",

    "webTitle": "Fears mount for House of Fraser as it holds funding crisis talks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House of Fraser has held emergency funding talks with specialist lenders amid mounting fears for its future as retailers battle increasingly torrid trading conditions on the high street. Executives at the department store chain, which dates back to 1849, are believed to have met with Alteri, a London-based turnaround investor that focuses on struggling European retailers. House of Fraser, which was bought by the Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in 2014, suffered a tough Christmas with store sales down 2.9% and online sales tumbling 7.5% compared with the previous year. The company, which has 59 stores and 17,500 staff, is already trying to cut its high street footprint by 30%. It is said to be looking for about \u00a340m of fresh funding from Alteri, according to the Sunday Times. Alteri is backed by the US hedge fund Apollo Global Management. A House of Fraser spokesperson said: \u201cAs you\u2019d expect in the current market, [finance] providers are keen to talk to retailers.\u201d However, they added that the terms of the company\u2019s existing banking arrangements meant it was unable to borrow from secured lenders. House of Fraser is the latest in a string of British retailers to seek fresh funds, restructurings or collapse into administration. Toys R Us, Maplin and bed specialists Warren Evans and Feather &amp; Black have all collapsed recently. House of Fraser\u2019s existing lenders are believed to have hired the accountancy firm EY to advise them on the firm\u2019s future and the chances of them recouping their loans. The syndicate of banks lending to House of Fraser, understood to include HSBC and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, turned to EY for help last week, according to Sky News. The retailer, which directly employs 6,000 staff and hosts another 11,500 concession workers, is believed to have about \u00a3400m of borrowings from banks and bond investors. The sudden drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain, causing inflation to rise and putting intense pressure on household finances already constrained by weak wage growth. The latest twist for House of Fraser came after Sanpower sold a 51% controlling stake to Wuji Wenhua, a little-known Chinese leisure group. Sales in stores for the six-week period from the beginning of Black Friday in late November to 23 December declined by 2.9%, while online sales fell 7.5% over the period. In December, the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded House of Fraser\u2019s debt to junk status as weak trading and disruption caused by the launch of the company\u2019s new website was compounded by poor sales of its own-label ranges. House of Fraser is due to announce its full-year results in mid-April, when it will also provide an update on a transformation plan to find \u00a326m of savings per year. About \u00a310m per year has already been saved, and the firm has said it made progress towards finding the remaining \u00a316m of savings in 2018.",

      "bodyText": "In the first decade of the 20th century, Standard Oil was as mighty as the tech giants of Silicon Valley are today. The company had grown from a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 to produce 87% of all US refined oil output. In 1911, the supreme court decided that Standard Oil was in breach of anti-trust legislation passed by Congress and ordered that the company be broken up. Even before the data mining revelations that have engulfed Facebook, there was pressure in the US for similar action to be taken against the social media networking site and two other globally dominant companies \u2013 Google and Amazon \u2013 that have come from nowhere in the past two decades. The argument goes like this. Data is as vital to the modern digital economy as oil was a century ago. The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon. The charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook\u2019s case) the harvesting of the personal data of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes. No question, Big Tech is more vulnerable to a backlash from Washington than it has ever been. Companies have outgrown management systems that were not designed for systemically important businesses and have used their market power to gobble up rivals. It is this charge \u2013 that the disruptive startup companies of yesteryear are today\u2019s anti-capitalists \u2013 that creates the biggest risk of anti-trust action. Those who have Facebook, Google and Amazon in their sights can draw on Adam Smith for support. In the bible of modern capitalism, the Wealth of Nations, Smith said: \u201cTo widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it.\u201d Excessive market power, in other words, is bad because it thwarts progress. Old established businesses can see off potential rivals even though the new entrants might have new and better ways of doing things. This concept, that Facebook et al are anti-capitalist, explains why the pressure for anti-trust action against them is coming from both right and left \u2013 from Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as from the leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren. After all, it\u2019s said, much of the innovation that blossomed in Silicon Valley was the result of the breakup of the telephone company AT&amp;T in 1982. AT&amp;T saw off challengers by deciding what equipment could be used on its national network: Google does the same by using algorithms to decide what comes up on an internet search. Without government action, there was no real prospect of AT&amp;T\u2019s stranglehold being broken and the same applies today given the market dominance of the big tech giants. The reality is that breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon would not be as simple as their critics think. America\u2019s anti-trust legislation is tightly defined and there is no provision for action simply because a company is deemed to be too big. What counts is whether size is being exploited to damage consumer interests. That\u2019s going to be tricky to prove. Consumers get Google and Facebook for free, while Amazon offers books \u2013 and an array of other goods \u2013 at a discount. Nor can it be said the companies are failing to invest in new products: all three companies devote an impressive share of their turnover to R&amp;D. Actually, of course, consumers are not getting Google and Facebook for free. They don\u2019t have to part with hard cash but they have to accept that their online activities will be constantly monitored so that advertisers \u2013 commercial or political \u2013 can tailor ads personally for them. People are now waking up to the terms of this Faustian bargain, which is why there will be calls for a change in US competition policy to make anti-trust action easier to prosecute. This would require an ideological shift. Americans think the reason they have a Facebook, a Google and an Amazon and the Europeans don\u2019t is that they have a more relaxed attitude towards companies growing big and powerful. The US sees winner-takes-all markets as the law of the capitalist jungle; the EU sees them as an intrinsic threat to consumers. A twin-track approach \u2013 tougher regulation of Big Tech with the threat of anti-trust action if it doesn\u2019t comply \u2013 looks likelier than an immediate recourse to breakup. There are echoes here of the financial crash of a decade ago. Back then, there were calls for a new Glass Steagall act to break up the banks into retail and investment arms, as was the case from the 1930s to the 1990s. It didn\u2019t happen. The banks expressed regret and then used their considerable lobbying power to head off or water down the threat of radical reform. Politicians talked a lot tougher than they eventually acted. They should be careful not to make the same mistake again.",

      "bodyText": "Will two tribes go to war? Even as the world\u2019s largest economies, the US and China, send conflicting signals over whether they\u2019re heading for an all-out trade war \u2013 spooking stock markets \u2013 experts doubted either side will risk escalating a dispute over trade imbalances. China\u2019s economic tsar and vice-premier Liu He told US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday that Beijing is ready to defend its interests after Donald Trump announced plans to slap tariffs on nearly $50bn in Chinese imports. But Liu\u2019s comments were cooler than the Chinese leadership\u2019s initial reaction to Trump\u2019s announcement. The Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, announced on state television: \u201cIf somebody imposes a trade war on China, we\u2019ll fight to the end.\u201d In reality, China\u2019s response has been muted, rolling out just $3bn in additional tariffs on US goods ranging from fresh fruit, nuts, wine and pork to recycled aluminum and steel pipes. It followed US tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. US pork producers squealed. The American pork industry last year sent $1.1bn in products to China, making it the No 3 market for US pork. Overall, the nation\u2019s farmers shipped nearly $20bn of goods to China in 2017, Reuters reported. \u201cWe sell a lot of pork to China, so higher tariffs on our exports going there will harm our producers and undermine the rural economy,\u201d said Jim Heimerl, president of the National Pork Producers Council. But missing from China\u2019s list of tariffs published on Friday were key US export items to the US including soybeans, sorghum and Boeing aircraft. \u201cChina is reacting mildly to a set of tariffs that have largely been rolled back for almost everyone except China,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist with the financial advisory company RSM. \u201cTrade friction is a natural state of affairs in the international economy and we\u2019re engaged in a spat.\u201d On Tuesday, the Trump administration is scheduled to detail additional tariffs. US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has said the goal is to pressure China to change practices, and plans to target 1,300 product categories, while limiting harm to US consumers and companies. But the damage to China may account for only 0.1% of its GDP. In an advisory note to investors, Capital Economics wrote that existing tariffs will have \u201ca barely perceptible impact\u201d on China\u2019s wider economy. Targeting $60bn of products by the US adds up to only 0.25% to China\u2019s GDP last year. The existing measures are unlikely to come close to reducing the annual US-China trade imbalance by $100bn as the administration has demanded. And China, holding more than $1tn of US treasury bonds, is playing with a strong hand. \u201cThe key uncertainty now is whether Trump sees the tariffs as an end in themselves, or whether they are followed by further escalation,\u201d according to the advisory note. But like many Trump administration proposals, the bluster is often more impressive than the follow-through. Even when a formal list of tariffs is published, US businesses will have 30 days to comment and China will be able to make concessions. Geoffrey Gertz of the Brookings Institution says a joint US, European and Japan effort to limit technology transfer could be more effective. He said: \u201cThere is certainly scope to pursue China through the WTO and there is a lot the US could be doing that we haven\u2019t done. But the business community remains very nervous about wide-ranging tariffs.\u201d The markets signaled their anxiety with a 730-point drop on Thursday and a further dive on Friday, the worst week for major indices in more than two years. RSM\u2019s Brusuelas said: \u201cIt\u2019s a vote of no confidence in what are clearly a set of incoherent and inconsistent trade policies.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re missing a big opportunity because there\u2019s a broad, bipartisan consensus in Washington that something needs to be done on trade, and there is a rare unanimity amongst the major trading nations that China is going to have to adjust.\u201d Other trading nations, including Canada, the EU and South Korea, are willing to confront China through multilateral actions via the WTO. \u201cThere\u2019s ample opportunity to re-task the economic relationship with China, but one could surmise that our administration\u2019s unilateral actions that demonstrate economic weakness are not the way to go,\u201d he added. A China policy veteran from the George W Bush administration, Dennis Wilder, told the Guardian he also believed the US had missed an opportunity by taking unilateral action. He said: \u201cThere was an open door with the EU, South Korea and Japan until the aluminum and steel tariffs action. But it was a mistake for the US to base that on our national security concerns and then to make our allies the primary targets. After that, it became very difficult for these countries to consider taking joint action.\u201d Wilder said he believed the Chinese leadership understood the administration\u2019s trade actions were largely related to American domestic political concerns. Beijing, he said, did not want \u201cto anger the US into more actions\u201d. The stock market is certainly hoping it\u2019s a game of paper tigers.",

      "bodyText": "Did I hear aright? Is the new, or rather \u201cretro\u201d, post-Brexit, true-blue British passport going to be manufactured in France? What a wonderful symbol of the futility and duplicity of the Brexiters\u2019 promise to \u201ctake back control\u201d! And what is this dire threat from the ubiquitous Jacob Rees-Mogg that the UK risks becoming a \u201cjoke nation\u201d by giving in on so many fronts to Michel Barnier? Surely Mr Rees-Mogg has noticed that, thanks to the disruptive antics of himself, his fellow Brexiters, their puppet master Nigel Farage, and the pernicious sway they hold over Theresa May, the UK is already a joke nation in the eyes of the rest of the world. Indeed, it is a laughing stock. As the Financial Times journalists George Parker and Alex Barker commented after following my misguided friend David Davis around: \u201cThe Brexit secretary may be enthusiastic about leaving the EU but, on his tour around European capitals, he has struggled to find interlocutors who think the project is anything other than mad at worst or an unwelcome distraction at best.\u201d Now, apart from their well-publicised objections to the continuation of present fishing arrangements, some of the leading Brexiters have been noticeably sanguine in the face of a \u201ctransitional\u201d deal heralded by many of my fellow Remainers as a rejection of most of their initial demands. They don\u2019t all agree with Farage that it is \u201ca complete sellout\u201d. This, of course, is because unless a great act of prime ministerial or parliamentary statesmanship puts an end to the farce, the Brexiters see the transitional deal as a mere postponement of their plan to take this benighted country to the edge of the cliff. It may seem like a great victory for the Remain campaign that the plan is for us to remain in the customs union and single market until the end of 2020. But I have two concerns about the optimistic approach to this. One is that unless something turns up, this could well amount to a mere postponement of disaster. The second is that, on present plans, we shall actually be departing from the EU on 31 March 2019. How do we know that, for all the patience they have exercised so far, the others would make it simple for us to rejoin the full EU, if there is a change of heart after the official beginning of \u201ctransition\u201d or \u201cimplementation\u201d? Some of us are old enough to recall decades of frustrating efforts to join in the first place. Whichever way one \u2013 at least this one \u2013 looks at it, the most sensible thing the prime minister could do is to rise to the occasion, to be true to her own instincts (and, I understand, those of her not-uninfluential husband) and make a Churchillian broadcast to the nation. In this she would explain that \u2013 God knows! \u2013 she has tried to honour the referendum result and reconcile the conflicting forces within her party, but enough is enough. It may be that the continuing and mounting damage being wreaked by the government\u2019s austerity programme will finally make more of the electorate wake up to the full implications of what 37% of them voted for. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell recently observed of that shock referendum result on 23 June 2016: \u201cIt was like a byelection where everyone\u2019s grievances piled into that one vote.\u201d I agree. The sad thing is that the vote against the misguided Cameron-Osborne austerity programme should have taken place in the general election of 2015, and not in reaction to their rash decision to call that referendum. It is, incidentally, highly unfortunate for the country that George Osborne, who claims to have had doubts about the wisdom of holding the referendum, did not stand up to be counted at the time. We shall never know, but it is my belief that a strong chancellor \u2013 which he certainly was \u2013 could have put a stop to the whole idea. To be fair, he is now trying to make amends in his new career as a journalist. In this, he differs from that old friend of mine, and predecessor of Osborne\u2019s as chancellor, the one and only Lord Lawson of Blaby \u2013 or should I say Lord Lawson of La France Profonde, which is where he actually lives. Lawson sees Brexit as a chance to complete the Thatcherite revolution \u2013 which I opposed in these columns at the time, and still do \u2013 noting, with some satisfaction, that given so many of the unfortunate economic and social consequences, even the Economist has recently registered doubts about the wonders of the Thatcherism it once espoused.
