The Wall Street Journal has reported that the two companies are in preliminary talks, representing the latest move towards consolidation in the healthcare industry during recent months. Walmart and Humana are considering numerous options including an acquisition, the Journal reported (\u00a3), while citing sources familiar with the matter. Should Walmart acquire Humana it will immediately become one of the US\u2019s largest healthcare insurers. A deal would also dwarf Walmart\u2019s previous biggest takeover, of Asda, in 1999 for about $9.5bn (\u00a36.7bn). Shares in Humana, which has a market value of around $37bn, rose by about 11% in after-hours trading on Wall Street after the Thursday report. Shares in Walmart, which is valued at about $264bn, edged down by about 1%. Stock markets in the US were closed on Friday because of Easter. America\u2019s largest health insurers have been looking for alternative deals after antitrust concerns scuppered other potential tie-ups within the sector. Humana\u2019s attempted merger with rival Aetna \u2013 as well as another prospective deal in the sector between Anthem and Cigna \u2013 were blocked last year as a result of Department of Justice antitrust lawsuits that were originally brought under the Obama administration. In July 2016, both of the large potential mergers were challenged by the department\u2019s antitrust division and several states owing to concerns over how the combined companies would increase prices to consumers, dampen competition and hinder innovation efforts. Instead, insurers have begun looking for different types of deal. The pharmacy chain CVS said in December it would buy Aetna, and Cigna announced earlier this month it would purchase Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits managerwhich acts as a middleman between the retailer and the drugs groups by maintaining lists of medicines and negotiating prices. Walmart has also made moves into the healthcare field. It already runs a large pharmacy business which has outlets in many of its stores, while the retailer has also attempted to run clinics in some of its locations.",

      "bodyText": "Even in the digital age, choosing a magazine at the supermarket checkout aisle is an enduring American tradition. Shoppers at the country\u2019s biggest retailer were spoilt for choice this week if they wanted to devour scurrilous tabloid allegations about Hollywood celebrities and the health, sexual proclivities and drinking habits of the British royal family. Impulse-buying one of the most popular women\u2019s magazines at a Walmart, though, is out of the question now that the chain has responded to pressure from an anti-pornography group by evicting Cosmopolitan from prime sites next to the cash registers and chocolate. Delighted by its success, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCSE) is approaching other leading retailers in the US to ask them to follow Walmart\u2019s lead, putting the magazine squarely on the battlefield in America\u2019s never-ending culture wars. In 2015 the conservative activists persuaded Walmart to hide Cosmopolitan\u2019s covers behind wrappers at checkout lanes in some stores, Haley Halverson, the group\u2019s vice-president of advocacy and outreach, told the Guardian. In recent months, she said, the group asked Walmart to go further after receiving complaints from parents. Describing the move as a \u201cgreat example of corporate responsibility\u201d, Halverson said that the magazine was part of the \u201chypersexualised media\u201d that \u201cbombards\u201d young girls. \u201cA lot of 14- or 15-year-old girls would pick up Cosmo because it has a One Direction band member or Selena Gomez on the cover, without really recognising there\u2019s actually very adult material,\u201d she said. \u201cThe articles are extremely graphic in describing sex acts in detail.\u201d The rapper Cardi B is on the cover of the April issue, which trails a story that promises to \u201cHeat Up Sex!\u201d with \u201cSizzling Foreplay Techniques\u201d and \u201cWarm Toys For Your Hot Spots\u201d, while \u201cmicro-cheating\u201d is under the spotlight. Cosmopolitan is not banned from Walmart. But interested parties will have to find it amid the thicket of other titles in the main magazine section, where in one store in suburban Texas on Thursday, Disney Junior magazine and a Crayola Coloring Book perched next to copies of Tactical Life gun magazine (cover story: \u201cMass Shooting Mayhem\u201d), Guns &amp; Ammo, Sniper Journal and periodicals devoted to the AK-47 and AR-15 (the latter rifle was the weapon of choice for the teenager who murdered 17 people at a Florida high school in February). Cosmopolitan was at the other end of the stand, near the bridal and home furnishings titles. Towards the rear of the store, meanwhile, a wide range of guns were in stock in the Sporting Goods section, a few metres from shin guards and badminton nets. \u201cWhile this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard,\u201d Walmart, which operates more than 5,000 US stores, said in a statement. Cosmopolitan bills itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest young woman\u2019s media brand\u201d with a \u201cmission to empower fun fearless females to own who they are and be who they want to be\u201d. It told multiple outlets in a statement: \u201cWith our focus on empowerment, we are proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world in the areas of equality, health, relationships, career, politics and social issues.\u201d Founded in 1962 and known as Morality in Media until it was renamed in 2015, the NCSE, based in Washington, linked its crusade with the #MeToo movement. Halverson claimed that Cosmo is \u201cadding to a culture that enforces male sexual entitlement. Every single issue that you pick up of Cosmopolitan will be focused on how to sexually pleasure a man in order to keep him around.\u201d The reference drew condemnation from Michelle Ruiz, a former sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan. \u201c#MeToo is about unwanted sex and sexual attention, sexual assault and harassment,\u201d Ruiz wrote for Vogue.com. \u201cShielding women from reading about the healthy sex they want to have has absolutely nothing to do with #MeToo. In fact, pulling Cosmopolitan \u2013 a magazine by (mostly) women for women \u2013 only serves to further shame women for wanting to own their sex lives. The real world took another step toward its slow and sure conversion to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Many conservatives and Christians, though, were delighted. \u201cThe false \u2018feminism\u2019 Cosmo promotes wrecks young women\u2019s lives, shatters marriages through divorce, and has led to millions of babies being aborted,\u201d Sue Ellen Browder \u2013 a former writer for the magazine, now repentant \u2013 wrote in the National Catholic Register. In a curious twist, one of Cosmopolitan\u2019s biggest critics is Victoria Hearst - the granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, the press baron who founded the corporation that publishes the magazine. In 2001 she used inheritance money to start a Christian ministry in a remote town in the Rocky Mountains and has lent her support to a campaign called Cosmo Hurts Kids. In recent months the campaign has paid for roadside billboards in conservative states that declare: \u201cCosmopolitan Magazine Contains Porn\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "\u2018Homebase is the most disastrous retail acquisition in the UK ever\u2019", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s an Aussie institution in crisis after aggressive management led to disgrace and embarrassment overseas. It also knows a thing or two about sandpaper. This is not the country\u2019s cricket side, but Bunnings, the Australian DIY retailer, that set out to conquer Britain by revamping Homebase but ended up writing off A$1bn (\u00a3547m) after a catalogue of major mistakes. The coming days will be critical to Bunnings\u2019 future in the UK, as Britons emerge from winter hibernation to go shopping, buying the plants and materials for the gardening projects, weather permitting, they will start to tackle over the Easter weekend. \u201cHomebase is undoubtedly the most disastrous retail acquisition in the UK ever,\u201d says GlobalData\u2019s retail analyst, Patrick O\u2019Brien. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a worse one that has made these kinds of losses so quickly. \u201cThe double bank holiday is extremely important for DIY retail because it sets the tone for spring/summer,\u201d he says. \u201cHow important it is to Bunnings depends on whether they are actually making a decision [about the future] or have already made it.\u201d The scale of the Homebase DIY distress became clear last month when Rob Scott, parent company Wesfarmers\u2019 managing director, announced the writedown after bungling the 2016 takeover to the point where quitting the UK becomes a real option. Perth-based Wesfarmers, one of Australia\u2019s biggest companies, bought Homebase for \u00a3340m two years ago, but by Christmas the heavy losses emerging from its UK outpost had become untenable. The chain lost nearly \u00a3100m in the last six months of 2017. Scott admitted the management team led by Bunnings veteran Peter \u201cPJ\u201d Davis had made mistakes. Perhaps the most glaring error was axing the entire Homebase senior management team and about 160 middle managers as soon as they got the keys to the stores. \u201cA lot of the issues we are dealing with today, to be frank, were self-induced,\u201d a contrite Scott said last month. Scott, who inherited the acquisition signed off by his predecessor Richard Goyder, also lamented the decision to jettison the large home furnishings business that had been a big draw for Homebase\u2019s legion of female shoppers. Faced with the might of market leader B&amp;Q, Homebase tried to attract female shoppers with \u201cpersonalised mood boards\u201d and attractive displays of cushions, throws and other nicknacks from brands including Laura Ashley and Habitat. But almost overnight that USP disappeared as the Australians chucked out the chintz en masse and turned its stores into no-nonsense DIY sheds. Bunnings Warehouse stores are definitely not designed with women in mind. With floor-to-ceiling shelving akin to the the depressing, warehouse area near the checkouts in Ikea, the industrial chic of the recently refurbished store on the outskirts of Twickenham in south-west London is clearly aimed at hardcore DIY-ers. There is a large section devoted to what looks like a breeding ground for power tools with \u00a3250 mitre saws nestling among an exhaustive selection of cordless drills. There are huge \u00a3700 four burner gas barbecues and \u00a3130 log splitters. Ideal for a large spread in the Melbourne suburbs perhaps. Not so fab for the average British back garden. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely less girlie stuff,\u201d one shopper tells the Guardian. Her partner, however, is impressed by the wide choice on offer. Bunnings stocks more than 30,000 products, or 40% more than the average Homebase ever did. Wesfarmers has now moved on to its second team of bosses, replacing Davis with Damian McGloughlin, a former B&amp;Q executive. Up to 40 stores \u2013 the ones that are losing the most money \u2013 are slated to close although industry sources suggest a more radical closure programme has also been under consideration. But even packing up and going home would be a massive headache for Wesfarmers because it is on the hook for Homebase\u2019s \u00a31bn rent bill over the length of its leases. In a recent note, the JP Morgan analyst, Shaun Cousins, calculated it would cost Wesfarmers about \u00a3600m to throw in the towel versus more than \u00a3800m to finish the job. Neither option looks attractive. A third route would be to keep the 23 converted Bunnings stores open and close the rest. \u201cThe least-bad outcome is exit,\u201d was Cousins\u2019 stark assessment. \u201cBunnings wholly underestimated the complexity of the UK market,\u201d says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. \u201cThe shop environments didn\u2019t live up to customers\u2019 expectations, while product selection failed to resonate with their core customers.

The chain lost nearly \u00a3100m in the last six months of 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23afe1803ba3dd3ae88f422b7e7225ee050b376c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23afe1803ba3dd3ae88f422b7e7225ee050b376c/0_67_5000_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Floor-to-ceiling shelving\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Floor-to-ceiling shelving is deemed to have cost Bunnings a large number of female shoppers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bunnings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scott admitted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/29/homebase-boss-opts-three-month-break-back-home-australia-bunnings\">management team led by Bunnings veteran Peter \u201cPJ\u201d Davis</a> had made mistakes. Perhaps the most glaring error was axing the entire Homebase senior management team and about 160 middle managers as soon as they got the keys to the stores.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the issues we are dealing with today, to be frank, were self-induced,\u201d a contrite Scott said last month. </p> <p>Scott, who inherited the acquisition signed off by his predecessor Richard Goyder, also lamented the decision to jettison the large home furnishings business that had been a big draw for Homebase\u2019s legion of female shoppers. </p> <p>Faced with the might of market leader B&amp;Q, Homebase tried to attract female shoppers with \u201cpersonalised mood boards\u201d and attractive displays of cushions, throws and other nicknacks from brands including Laura Ashley and Habitat. But almost overnight that USP disappeared as the Australians chucked out the chintz en masse and turned its stores into no-nonsense DIY sheds. </p> <p>Bunnings Warehouse stores are definitely not designed with women in mind. With floor-to-ceiling shelving akin to the the depressing, warehouse area near the checkouts in Ikea, the industrial chic of the recently refurbished store on the outskirts of Twickenham in south-west London is clearly aimed at hardcore DIY-ers.</p> <p>There is a large section devoted to what looks like a breeding ground for power tools with \u00a3250 mitre saws nestling among an exhaustive selection of cordless drills. There are huge \u00a3700 four burner gas barbecues and \u00a3130 log splitters. Ideal for a large spread in the Melbourne suburbs perhaps. Not so fab for the average British back garden. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely less girlie stuff,\u201d one shopper tells the Guardian. Her partner, however, is impressed by the wide choice on offer. Bunnings stocks more than 30,000 products, or 40% more than the average Homebase ever did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"480ca8b81f034e723d1e1cc7faede7ebb66f1fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/480ca8b81f034e723d1e1cc7faede7ebb66f1fa6/0_174_5000_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A large selection of power tools\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A large selection of power tools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bunnings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wesfarmers has now moved on to its second team of bosses, replacing Davis with Damian McGloughlin, a former B&amp;Q executive. Up to 40 stores \u2013 the ones that are losing the most money \u2013 are slated to close although industry sources suggest a more radical closure programme has also been under consideration. </p> <p>But even packing up and going home would be a massive headache for Wesfarmers because it is on the hook for Homebase\u2019s \u00a31bn rent bill over the length of its leases. </p> <p>In a recent note, the JP Morgan analyst, Shaun Cousins, calculated it would cost Wesfarmers about \u00a3600m to throw in the towel versus more than \u00a3800m to finish the job. Neither option looks attractive. A third route would be to keep the 23 converted Bunnings stores open and close the rest. \u201cThe least-bad outcome is exit,\u201d was Cousins\u2019 stark assessment.</p> <p>\u201cBunnings wholly underestimated the complexity of the UK market,\u201d says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. \u201cThe shop environments didn\u2019t live up to customers\u2019 expectations, while product selection failed to resonate with their core customers.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of putting the profits of speculators before the interests of staff at one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms, which is the object of a hostile takeover deal that has been labelled an \u201cabuse of capitalism\u201d. On Thursday, shareholders in GKN, which made cannonballs for the Battle of Waterloo and Spitfires for the second world war, voted to accept an \u00a38.1bn offer from Melrose, a firm that specialises in turning around failing companies and selling them on at a profit, and which has been labelled an \u201casset stripper\u201d. Some of GKN\u2019s shareholders had bought into the company only a few days before backing the takeover, prompting the Labour leader to call them speculators looking to make fast cash out of the deal. \u201cThe Tories have put the interests of City speculators over people\u2019s jobs. Labour would have stopped the takeover of GKN and, in government, we\u2019ll make our economy work for the many, not the few,\u201d Corbyn said. Referring to the front page of Friday\u2019s Daily Mail, which called the deal an \u201cabuse of capitalism\u201d, he added: \u201cYou know things are bad when the Daily Mail calls out a rigged economic system.\u201d There were calls for the government to block the deal on national security grounds because of GKN\u2019s status as a defence contractor, including from Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, who wrote to Greg Clark, the business secretary she shadows, on Friday. \u201cThis deal from its inception in January of this year has raised issues of national security. These have been recognised across political parties, by trade unions and other commentators,\u201d she wrote, in a letter seen by the Guardian. \u201cAmong the concerns are the fact that defence contracts are long term and are undermined by the short-term business model pursued by Melrose, the potential breakup of the business and the loss of jobs and skills.\u201d She added: \u201cThe history of GKN has been intertwined with our own industrial and military history \u2026 The takeover puts at risk the firm and its proud heritage. It not only endangers our national defence but our industrial strategy too.\u201d On Friday morning, Clark acknowledged he had a statutory duty under the Enterprise Act 2002 to consider the national security implications of the deal, but refused to pre-empt the deliberations. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the assessment needed to be carried out \u201cproperly and thoroughly\u201d. Addressing concerns that the takeover had been waved through by speculators, Clark said: \u201cThose shareholders that bought their shares very recently of course bought them from other shareholders that chose not in effect to back the continuing management.\u201d Later on Friday, Corbyn issued a further call to the government to halt the takeover: \u201cThis is about people\u2019s jobs, national security and our whole industrial strategy.\u201d He said Clark should \u201cstep in and act in the national interest\u201d. Clark said the government\u2019s approach, as set out in its industrial strategy, was non-protectionist. He said ministers would not \u201cpick winners as was done in the past and subsidise or protect them\u201d, saying the government would instead seek to \u201censure that our business environment is one in which there is competition, in which no incumbent is immune from the challenge of being kept efficient and strategically focused\u201d. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, was the business secretary when Kraft took over Cadbury in 2010 and, at the time, called for a change in the law to prevent hedge funds and other short-term investors influencing takeovers. On Friday, he said: \u201cWe need to move to a system with two classes of shareholders so that short-term holding for speculation cannot be given the same weight in making judgments about the long-term future of a company.\u201d",
