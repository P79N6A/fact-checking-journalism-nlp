      "bodyText": "The Institute of Directors is to put further pressure on George Osborne by urging him to take urgent steps to promote investment, as it says business is \"battening down the hatches\" for the rest of the year. The IoD said most firms had delayed investment decisions and employing new staff after taking the view that growth this year would be worse than last year. \"Business is battening down the hatches in the expectation that the recession will continue for the rest of the year. That is bad news for the economy at large, because decisions to invest money or take on more staff are being postponed until things look up,\" Graham Leach, chief economist at the IoD, said. \"Low confidence leads to delayed decisions, and delayed decisions further undermine economic confidence \u2013 it's a vicious cycle.\" Leach said the government's agenda was \"pointing in broadly the right direction, but the overwhelming opinion of our members is that they are doing too little, too slowly\". He called for cuts to red tape and simplification of employment law to \"make a real difference to the cost and complexity of doing business in the UK\". The sharp fall in manufacturing output revealed on Tuesday added to the gloom following a survey by the CBI that revealed expectations for growth during the autumn have evaporated. The figures are a blow to the chancellor, who has seen his forecasts for deficit reduction and growth skid wildly off track. Analysts said that by next April Osborne could overshoot his spending target by up to \u00a340bn if growth continues to flatline and government spending outstrips tax receipts, forcing him to accept higher debt levels or consider further austerity measures. The Institute of Directors said a poll of its members revealed a lack of confidence in the government's growth forecasts. It said most firms had delayed investment decisions and employing new staff after taking the view that growth this year would be worse than last year. The IoD joined a wide range of business lobby groups and opposition parties to call on Osborne to promote investment and growth to prevent the recession dragging into the second half of the year.Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, said the chancellor's promise to secure the recovery and get the deficit down was in tatters. \"His failed plan has delivered the exact opposite - a double dip recession which is leading to soaring borrowing. What more evidence does the government need that their plan has failed and they need to change course?\" Shadow business secretary Chuka Ummuna tweeted: \"Yet more evidence of the Government's economic incompetence but will Cameron, Clegg, Cable and co change course?\" The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding bank bailouts, showed a deficit of \u00a3557m, compared with a \u00a32.8bn surplus in the same month last year. Analysts had been expecting a surplus of \u00a32.5bn. The data heightens concerns that the government will miss its deficit reduction target. The ONS said the total deficit since April had reached \u00a347.2bn \u2013 up \u00a311.6bn on 2011 \u2013 excluding financial interventions and a one-off boost after assets from the Royal Mail's pension fund were transferred to the Treasury. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures \"continue the deterioration seen over the past few months. At this rate, borrowing for 2012/13 overall will massively overshoot the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast of \u00a3120bn, excluding Royal Mail effects, by over \u00a335bn. \"And with the recovery falling well short of the OBR's expectations, we think that the government will struggle to cut borrowing at all next year.\" July is usually a buoyant month for tax receipts, but this year the corporate sector has been hit hard by the downturn. ONS figures showed North Sea oil and gas output has been unusually low, leading to lower profits and a cut in tax payments. The impact of a near 20% drop in corporation tax receipts was to push government receipts down 0.8% in July on the same period last year. Government spending, meanwhile, grew 5.1% on the previous year, mostly on welfare payments. Lower revenues from oil and gas companies accounted for about \u00a31bn of a \u00a31.7bn shortfall in corporation tax compared with last year. The government had planned to eliminate the structural budget deficit by 2015 with a tough programme of spending cuts and tax rises. It has eliminated a quarter of the deficit so far, though this figure is in line with Labour's pre-election target and not the more aggressive plans outlined by George Osborne in the summer of 2010. Osborne has failed to meet his own targets and his tougher austerity programme and the weak economy have forced him to extend the planned fiscal consolidation by another two years. David Cameron has warned austerity could last until 2020. A Treasury spokesman blamed a cut in North Sea oil production for the bulk of the fall in corporation tax receipts. He said it was expected that government spending would increase in response to the \"weakening global economy\" and higher welfare spending, but it was still too early in the financial year to draw firm conclusions about the year as a whole. \"The government remains committed to the credible plan we have set out to deal with Britain's debts, and today's numbers emphasise how risky it would be to deliberately increase borrowing,\" he said. Manufacturers responding to the CBI's monthly industrial trends survey pointed to prolonged weakness in the economy. A balance of -21% of firms saying orders are falling compared with those saying orders are up represents the lowest return since the end of last year. The CBI said: \"Similarly, export orders have weakened with manufacturers reporting a balance of -17%. While still above the long-run average of -21%, this is the lowest figure reported since January 2012, when it reached -26%.\"Anna Leach of the CBI said: \"The economic environment for UK manufacturers remains challenging, with domestic demand relatively muted and the ongoing eurozone crisis now seeming to drag on broader global economic momentum.\"",

      "bodyText": "The head of Glencore's food trading business has said the worst drought to hit the US since the 1930s will be \"good for Glencore\" because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices. Chris Mahoney, the trader's director of agricultural products, who owns about \u00a3500m of Glencore shares, said the devastating US drought had created an opportunity for the company to make much more money. \"In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, the environment is a good one. High prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage opportunities [the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from price differences in different markets],\" he said on a conference call . Mahoney said Glencore, which reported pre-tax profits of $2.2bn (\u00a31.4bn), would be able to exploit the drought to its advantage, especially after its takeover of Canadian grain trader Viterra. \"I think we will both be able to provide the world with solutions, getting stuff to where it's needed quickly and timely, and that should be good for Glencore.\" The blistering heat in the US has destroyed 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop, pushing the price of the commodities to record highs. Overall global food prices rose by 6% in July, according to the UN. The drought is so severe that G20 nations are considering holding a crisis summit. The last severe food crisis, in 2008, sparked riots in cities from the Caribbean to the far east. The United Nations food agency warned this month that \"there is potential for a situation to develop like we had back in 2007-08.\" Abdolreza Abbassian, senior economist and grain analyst at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, told Reuters: \"There is an expectation that this time around we will not pursue bad policies and intervene in the market by restrictions, and if that doesn't happen we will not see such a serious situation as 2007-08. But if those policies get repeated, anything is possible.\" Raj Patel, an expert in the global food trade and former UN employee, said Glencore and other multinational food traders were in a \"fine position to make money from a crisis because they've pushed for an international economic system that relies on them\". \"They [Glencore] are millionaires making money from other people's misery caused by the drought,\" he said. \"It's the sad fact of how the international food system \u2013 that they pushed for and our governments gave to them \u2013 works. \"It's unsurprising that a crisis is a revenue generator.\" Oxfam has called on governments to intervene in the international food system to relieve the pressure on poor people in developing countries. \"These latest [food price] figures prove yet again that there is something fundamentally flawed in the way we produce and distribute food around the world,\" said Hannah Stoddart, Oxfam's head of economic justice policy. \"For too long our leaders have stood by complacently, while up to a billion people go hungry worldwide.\" Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of asset management firm GMO, has warned: \"We are five years into a severe global food crisis that is very unlikely to go away.\" Glencore has previously attracted attention by selling more than \u00a350m worth of wheat to the World Food Programme.",

      "bodyText": "A sharp fall in revenues from North Sea oil has played a leading role in the deterioration in the government's finances as the Treasury caught a glimpse of how the nation's coffers will look when the oil starts to run out.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Everything Everywhere, owner of the T-Mobile and Orange mobile phone networks, is to drop its widely criticised name as a consumer brand in a marketing makeover this year. In a landmark ruling by regulators Everything Everywhere on Tuesday won the right to launch the UK's first 4G mobile internet service in September, and the company will use the occasion to introduce a third brand to the public. Standing for fourth generation, 4G technology is supposed to deliver internet download speeds 10 times faster than the 3G service which helped bring the internet to mobile phones a decade ago. More bandwidth is needed to help networks keep up with the growing demand for data from smartphones. Mobile networks struggle to broadcast video over 3G \u2013 most moving images are watched on the small screen using wi-fi connections. It is hoped 4G will make smartphone video streaming an every day experience. The decision will give the UK a taste of 4G in time for Christmas, allowing it to catch up with other European nations and the United States, which already have dozens of superfast mobile networks up and running. Britain is not due to auction the extra spectrum Vodafone, O2 and Three say they need for 4G until next year. But EE has enough of its own to push the button now, giving it a six to 12-month head-start on rivals. Telecoms watchdog Ofcom has granted EE permission to flick the switch as soon as 11 September, and while the service may not be ready until a little later, EE has been installing equipment since the beginning of this year in anticipation of early roll-out. It has already covered a number of major population centres. By coincidence, the date is a day ahead of Apple's rumoured 12 September iPhone 5 unveiling. The latest Apple phone is expected to go on sale in October, although it is far from certain that the device will support 4G on the spectrum 1800MHz band being used by EE for 4G. It is thought that some of the newest Nokia smartphones, which use Windows software, will be compatible. While there will be very few 4G handsets and tablet computers in time for Christmas, EE will be able to market the service using dongles which plug into laptops to give them a mobile signal. \"This ruling could well provide a springboard for Everything Everywhere in the lucrative customer acquisition stakes,\" said Stuart Orr at management consultancy Accenture. \"This will be especially true if they are then able to offer [a 4G] enabled iPhone 5 ahead of anyone else.\" There is speculation the brand name used to plug the service could be 4G Everywhere \u2013 it was registered by the company as a trademark in May, alongside 4G Everything and 4GEE. In a statement the company said: \"We are planning to launch a new brand in the UK later this year. This new brand will sit alongside our existing brands Orange and T-Mobile. We will reveal more information on our exciting plans in due course.\" Orange, which rose to prominence through its high profile sponsorships of the BAFTA film awards and the Women's Prize for Fiction, may not be permanent fixture in the UK telecoms landscape, however. EE's owners, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, are thought to be keen to float their UK joint venture once conditions in the financial markets improve, which could eventually trigger a decision to drop their respective Orange and T-Mobile brands. EE's head start on 4G provoked a furious reaction from Vodafone, which said it was \"shocked\" at the Ofcom's decision, while O2 said it was \"hugely disppointed\". Spectrum acquired in next year's auction, currently occupied by digital TV, will not be freed up for use nationwide before next Autumn. It is thought unlikely that rival networks will seek an injunction to stop EE's launch, although legal experts say they could make complaints at a later date. \"Even if there is no reason for challenge today, the other operators will presumably be keeping the situation under review and will be looking for any possible action on the part of Everything Everywhere with their newly acquired monopoly status that could justify a complaint under UK or EU competition law,\" said Patrick Clark, telecoms expert at law firm Taylor Wessing. In a separate deal, EE confirmed on Tuesday that it had sold for an undisclosed sum a quarter of its 1800MHz holding to the UK's smallest network Three, owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. The company was obliged to sell some of its large holding as a condition of its creation through the merger of T-Mobile and Orange. Three will not be able to use the spectrum for 4G immediately, as EE is not obliged to hand it over until September 2013.",

The London-listed platinum miner was forced to warn investors that the shutdown of its Marikana mine 60 miles from Johannesburg will result in debt covenants being breached. Lonmin said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with its banking syndicate about resolving the problem. However, the company admitted that it has been forced into \"reviewing all the options available to strengthen its financial structure, including possible access to the equity capital markets\". The formal announcement that the FTSE 100 miner is considering an emergency rights issue comes just three days after it strongly dismissed reports that it was planning such a move to raise up to $1bn. In addition, last Thursday the company released a formal statement saying: \"Net debt remains well within the limits and terms of its existing bank debt facilities.\" Analysts say the company will have little choice but to tap shareholders for an extra $700m-$1bn. Experts at Deutsche Bank have said the strike will cost Lonmin at least $74m in lost production.

    "webTitle": "Best Buy suffers 91% drop in profits and disappoints analysts with new CEO", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Profits at Best Buy, the US's biggest consumer electronics retailer, plummeted 91% in the second quarter, an announcement that came a day after the company named a new chief executive. The troubled retail chain saw sales drop both in the US and internationally, but the biggest hit came from a $91m restructuring charge, primarily related to its plans to shut down a swathe of its \"big-box\" giant retail stores. Best Buy reported a profit of $12m for the quarter ended August 4 versus $128m a year earlier. The company's shares hit a nine year low in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen Monday when the firm announced takeover talks with founder Richard Schulze had collapsed and that Hubert Joly, who specialises in corporate turnarounds, would take over as CEO. The firm has been without a full-time CEO since April when former boss Brian Dunn, 51, left Best Buy with a $6.6m payoff after what the company described as \"close personal relationship\" with a 29-year-old female employee that \"negatively impacted the work environment\". Joly is the former head of Carlson, a hospitality company that owns TGI Fridays among other brands. Analysts were disappointed by his lack of retail experience. Joly, who is French, is expected to start in September when his visa is secured. \"We believe that this is a herculean task even for an accomplished retail executive and believe that Mr Joly's complete lack of retail experience will be an impediment to his success,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note. Joly faces a corporate as well as a financial challenge at the company. Schulze has offered to take the company private for $9bn. Schulze, who grew the chain from a single store and was its chief executive for 36 years, owns 20% of Best Buy. The talks stalled ahead of the appointment of Joly and the earnings announcement. Schultze said he was \"disappointed and surprised by the Best Buy Board's abrupt termination of our discussions.\" Best Buy has seen off real world rivals including Circuit City, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, to emerge as the last large electronic retail chain in the US. But it too is struggling with increased competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Along with its real-world rivals Best Buy suffers from what retail analysts call \"show-rooming\" when potential customers try products in store then go home to purchase them cheaper online. In March Best Buy announced plans to shut 50 stores as part of an $800m cost saving drive. In its latest results Best Buy said it had reduced its US big box square footage by 4% year-over-year and that domestic revenue per square foot were up 1% year-over-year. Sales from stores, call centers and websites operating for at least 14 months \u2013 known as same-store sales \u2013 fell 3.2% in the latest period. Best Buy's US same-store sales fell 1.6%, while internationally sales dropped 8.2% with the company blaming lower sales in China, Canada and \"increased competitive conditions in Europe\". Sales of mobile devices including eReaders and smartphones soared but were offset by falling sales for notebooks, TVs, cameras and other items. The company declined to give any guidance on future sales but on a conference call with analysts executives said they were more confident about the second half of their financial year, traditionally the largest sales period for retailers. Best Buy made a $1.34bn (then \u00a31bn) investment in Carphone Warehouse in the UK in 2008 and had planned to open branches across Britain. The venture failed and it shut its larger Best Buy stores in the UK. The two companies retain a joint venture called Best Buy Europe. Same-store sales at Best Buy have declined for two of the last three years. The company posted a net loss of $1.23bn on revenue of $50.7bn for the year that ended in March, its first annual loss since 1991.",

Best Buy reported a profit of $12m for the quarter ended August 4 versus $128m a year earlier.</p> <p>The company's shares hit a nine year low in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen Monday when the firm announced takeover talks with founder Richard Schulze had collapsed and that Hubert Joly, who specialises in corporate turnarounds, would take over as CEO.</p> <p>The firm has been without a full-time CEO since April when former boss Brian Dunn, 51, left Best Buy with a $6.6m payoff after what the company described as \"close personal relationship\" with a 29-year-old female employee that \"negatively impacted the work environment\".</p> <p>Joly is the former head of Carlson, a hospitality company that owns TGI Fridays among other brands. Analysts were disappointed by his lack of retail experience. Joly, who is French, is expected to start in September when his visa is secured. \"We believe that this is a herculean task even for an accomplished retail executive and believe that Mr Joly's complete lack of retail experience will be an impediment to his success,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note.</p> <p>Joly faces a corporate as well as a financial challenge at the company. Schulze has offered to take the company private for $9bn. Schulze, who grew the chain from a single store and was its chief executive for 36 years, owns 20% of Best Buy. The talks stalled ahead of the appointment of Joly and the earnings announcement. Schultze said he was \"disappointed and surprised by the Best Buy Board's abrupt termination of our discussions.\"</p> <p>Best Buy has seen off real world rivals including Circuit City, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, to emerge as the last large electronic retail chain in the US. But it too is struggling with increased competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Along with its real-world rivals Best Buy suffers from what retail analysts call \"show-rooming\" when potential customers try products in store then go home to purchase them cheaper online.</p> <p>In March Best Buy announced plans to shut 50 stores as part of an $800m cost saving drive. In its latest results Best Buy said it had reduced its US big box square footage by 4% year-over-year and that domestic revenue per square foot were up 1% year-over-year. </p> <p>Sales from stores, call centers and websites operating for at least 14 months \u2013 known as same-store sales \u2013 fell 3.2% in the latest period. Best Buy's US same-store sales fell 1.6%, while internationally sales dropped 8.2% with the company blaming lower sales in China, Canada and \"increased competitive conditions in Europe\". Sales of mobile devices including eReaders and smartphones soared but were offset by falling sales for notebooks, TVs, cameras and other items.</p> <p>The company declined to give any guidance on future sales but on a conference call with analysts executives said they were more confident about the second half of their financial year, traditionally the largest sales period for retailers.</p> <p>Best Buy made a $1.34bn (then \u00a31bn) investment in Carphone Warehouse in the UK in 2008 and had planned to open branches across Britain. The venture failed and it shut its larger Best Buy stores in the UK. The two companies retain a joint venture called Best Buy Europe.</p> <p>Same-store sales at Best Buy have declined for two of the last three years. The company posted a net loss of $1.23bn on revenue of $50.7bn for the year that ended in March, its first annual loss since 1991.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As recession deepens across southern Europe, stories abound of indebted firms and households being forced to hand over ownership of their assets to their creditors. For example, a recent report in Der Spiegel tells of a Spanish bank that evicted from his home a now unemployed man, previously earning less than \u20ac1,000 a month. The bank had happily lent him \u20ac240,000. Mass foreclosures of this kind ricochet through the economy, grinding down economic activity and compounding the \"social recession\". Iceland shows how to do things differently, with creditors bearing more of the direct cost upfront. Southern European governments \u2013 and even the creditors to southern European firms and households \u2013 would be wise to study its example. Iceland was hit by a perfect financial storm in October 2008. Its financial sector, with a balance sheet 10 times that of the country's GDP, collapsed. The national currency, the kr\u00f3na, lost 50% to 60% of its value overnight. Inflation shot above 20% within a few months. The equity market collapsed and real estate lost a more than a quarter of its value. By early 2009 it was clear that some 80% or 90% of Icelandic companies should have declared bankruptcy, including some of the biggest firms in the economy. The central bank estimated that 25% to 30% of households were in a similar position. In normal times, the occasional bankruptcy is evidence of a well-functioning economy. Mass bankruptcy in hard times is another matter entirely. For one thing, the legal system is painfully slow in clearing up even one bankruptcy, let alone thousands at a time. For another, it cannot be the case that 80% or 90% of all private activity becomes genuinely unproductive overnight. The question is how to keep firms with temporary balance-sheet problems going and at least partly covering their losses until demand improves. And how are the banks going to make money from the property they have acquired? Not by selling the house to someone evicted from their house by another bank. The bank will probably have to leave the house empty, and pay real-estate taxes and fees without receiving rental income. After the collapse of its oversized banks, the Icelandic banking sector was composed of three banks erected on the domestic operation of the fallen giants, a state run real-estate bank and few small savings and loan institutions. It was obvious that the financial sector would suffer a second collapse if all firms under water were forced into bankruptcy and if all families in a similar situation were evicted from their homes. After much heated debate, the government, the financial sector, and the federation of businesses agreed on a comprehensive debt-relief programme. The main components were as follows: \u2022 For the household sector, debt in excess of 110% of the fair value of each property was written off. Specific relief measures (administrated by a bank or a new debtors ombudsman) applied for those that could not service a reduced loan. \u2022 Low-income, asset-poor households with high-interest mortgage payment got a temporary subsidy from the government. \u2022 Small to medium sized firms could apply for debt relief if they could credibly document positive cash flow from future activities. The firm had to be willing to re-engineer its operation so as to make best use of its assets. Given those conditions, the firm could expect its debt to be written down to equal the discounted value of future earnings; or alternatively, written down to the amount that the bank or other financial firm could expect, in the best of circumstances, to gain from taking the assets over and realizing their monetary value. Hence the debt relief programmes did not create new equity on the balance sheets of firms or households. The process provoked plenty of conflicts. For example, the supreme court ruled some forms of loans in foreign currencies illegal. The government intervened to extend the ruling to all foreign exchange loans granted to households. These legal challenges have not yet been brought to an end, but so far 12% of the household sector pre-2008 debt has been written off. The bottom line is that the government, the financial sector and the business sector collectively created a situation that leaves the financial sector with as good a result in terms of total debt collection as possible without the pain of sending most of the firms and many families into bankruptcy, unemployment and dispossession. Thanks in good part to this tempered approach to debt write-down Iceland's economy is now growing faster than most countries in Europe, and unemployment is less than 5% (having hit 9.3% in early 2010). Of course, many Icelanders are still angry at the government and the banks, like their southern European counterparts. But at least they have a job, they pay property and income taxes, they service their reduced debt, and they can make plans for a vacation or a new car in two years' time. \u2022 Thorolfur Matthiasson is professor of economics at the University of Iceland and member of a parliament-appointed committee overseeing equality of treatment in debt writedowns by the Icelandic financial sector.",

      "bodyText": "Westminster will be working itself into a familiar frenzy when David Cameron embarks on his first substantive ministerial reshuffle early next month. Downing Street knows that the excitement of new faces walking to No 10 for their first cabinet meeting will be a complete irrelevance if the government is perceived to have failed in the area that always decides elections: the economy. Labour says the government has done just that: Rachel Reeves, the shadow Treasury chief secretary, describes the increased government borrowing figures as a \"damning indictment of a chancellor\" who has delivered a double-dip recession leading to \"soaring borrowing\". The Treasury played down the significance of the figures as it blamed a cut in North Sea oil production for most of the fall in corporation tax receipts, necessitating the increased borrowing. But there are deep nerves in Whitehall that George Osborne is reaching the stage where voters will make an irrevocable judgment that he has failed to deliver his two key economic pledges made during the 2010 election.

      "bodyText": "More positive news from the house building sector as Persimmon revealed a 65% jump in half-year profits with house sales up and property values rising. Underlying pretax profits hit \u00a398.7m on a revenue rise of 13% to \u00a3806.7m in the first six months of the year. The Government's NewBuy scheme to help first time buyers get a 95% mortgage has been successful for Persimmon, which has actively pushed the initiative and seen 220 new homes sold using the product. First half completions were up 6% to 4,712 new homes, with the average selling price increasing 7% to \u00a3171,206, due to the completion of more family homes. However, the company, the UK's largest homebuilder by market value, said: We expect conditions in the UK housing market to remain challenging reflecting the wider issues within the economy. However, we anticipate continued firm underlying demand for new homes but this will remain constrained by the low level of mortgage availability. We are continuing to work with the mortgage lending institutions to help provide customers with appropriate opportunities to gain access to the housing market. It comes the day after rival Bovis reported a boost in house sales, while Taylor Wimpey recorded a recent operating profit jump to \u00a3100.9m compared with \u00a3133m in the first six months of 2011. Despite the strong results, analysts seem unimpressed with some cutting their ratings. Numis downgraded its position to \"hold\" from \"add\" warning the stock trades at a premium to its assets, with better value elsewhere. Panmure Gordon cuts its rating to \"hold\" from \"buy\" after shares rose 33% since early June, saying Whilst Persimmon has delivered a very strong set of results and looks well placed for the future, this is factored into the share price in our view. Shore Capital maintains its \"sell\" recommendation, suggesting: We continue to favour Barratt which is trading at circa 28% discount to NAV [net asset value] Shares are down 15p, 2.1%, at 690.1p.",
