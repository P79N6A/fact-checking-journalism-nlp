      "bodyText": "Pressure on the government to help struggling Britons has intensified after a leading thinktank warned that falling living standards for the poor threatened the biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. The Resolution Foundation said Theresa May would need to make good on her pledge to support \u201cjust about managing\u201d households as it released a report showing that rising inflation and an end to recent strong jobs growth would hit the least well-off hardest. Its warnings chime with other forecasts for a squeeze on family budgets on the back of sluggish wage growth, welfare cuts, rising global oil prices and the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote. The drop in sterling has made imports more expensive and there are already signs that is being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s study found that the current parliament would be the worst for living standards for the poorest half of households since comparable records began in the mid-1960s and the worst since the early years of Thatcher\u2019s 1979-90 premiership for inequality. Since its sharp increase in the early 1980s \u2013 a period of high unemployment, factory closures and a cut in the top rate of tax from 83% to 60% \u2013 inequality has broadly remained flat. But the Resolution Foundation forecast that between 2015 and the next general election in 2020 incomes for the poorest half of households will fall by 2%. That compares with a rise of 4% during the last parliament and 1% between 2005 and 2010 \u2013 the five-year period that included the deepest recession since the 1930s. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain has enjoyed a welcome mini-boom in living standards in recent years. But that boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows. \u201cThe squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis tended to hit richer households the most. But this time around it\u2019s low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected. \u201cThis could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards \u2013 the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right if we are to avoid the next few years being like the 1980s without the feelgood factor.\u201d The prediction that inequality is set to start rising again is based on the thinktank\u2019s forecast that while incomes will fall for the poorer half of households they will rise by about 5% for the richest fifth over the next four years. The foundation blames the upcoming living standards squeeze on a combination of stagnating pay, rising inflation and the rollout of more than \u00a312bn of welfare cuts. It emphasised that the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote and other economic factors such as flat productivity growth were only part of the picture. The unequal nature of the squeeze would be the result of government policy on tax and benefits. \u201cThe vote to leave the European Union does not, thus far, appear to have impacted on the macroeconomy or employment, but it has hastened the end of ultra-low inflation and increased how far it is likely to rise in the next few years,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut, in some ways regardless of the average level of household income growth, Britain is also actively choosing to increase inequality. Despite welcome policies such as the national living wage, the plans the new prime minister has inherited are likely to ensure that the proceeds of growth are shared unequally and many families made worse off.\u201d The thinktank sees inequality rising to record highs by 2020 on three different measures: the 90:10 income ratio, which is the income of a household 90% up the income distribution scale, divided by that of a household only 10% of the way up; on the 80:20 ratio, calculated in a similar way from those 80% up the distribution and those 20% up; and on the Palma ratio, the income share of the top 10% divided by the income share of the bottom 40%. \u201cAll forecast measures show large increases in inequality over the next four years, with all reaching record highs by 2020-21. This is a starkly different pattern from the trend of the past 20 years, over which time inequality has been broadly flat or even declining,\u201d the report said. Underscoring the challenge for May\u2019s government as it seeks to redress deep regional imbalances in the UK, the Resolution Foundation also highlighted persistent inequalities between south-east England and the rest of the country. Incomes in the vast majority of the country were more than 10% lower than in most wealthy region, south-east England, its analysis found. North-east England and the West Midlands had the lowest levels of income, both 20% lower than in the south-east. On the capital, the report added: \u201cContrary perhaps to received wisdom London is not the region with the highest income, and once housing costs are taken into account, incomes in the region are roughly 10% lower than in the south-east.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cLiving standards reached their highest ever level in 2015, and are forecast to be higher still by the end of the parliament. \u201cMillions of people are taking home more of what they earn thanks to the government\u2019s actions to reduce income tax bills and introduce the national living wage. We are helping households with the cost of living by increasing the supply of affordable housing, banning letting agents\u2019 fees, and freezing fuel duty, and our investment to boost productivity will raise living standards in the long run.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Resolution Foundation was damning: \u201cLabour called on the government at the autumn statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, while they were going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor. \u201cIt is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the rest of us, as our country faces its biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Big international banks provide the frontline troops in the battle against financial crime, or so their bosses like to say. In the post-crisis era, battalions of compliance officers have been recruited and trained. The costs are enormous and still increasing, say the banks, but financial regulators have got what they demanded. All banks must know their clients, including where and how they got their money, and the supporting documentation has to be pristine, especially if chunky sums are moving across borders. That\u2019s the theory, but then there\u2019s the practice. At Deutsche Bank, circa 2012 to 2015, the system was an underfunded shambles. The bank has been fined $630m (\u00a3506m) for \u201cunacceptable\u201d deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls but the details of the affair are extraordinary. Some $10bn was transferred out of Russia through Deutsche \u201cin a manner highly suggestive of financial crime\u201d, says the Financial Conduct Authority. Red flags should have been everywhere in a wheeze whereby shares were bought in roubles in Deutsche\u2019s Moscow branch and then sold via the London office for dollars. These so-called mirror trades lacked \u201clegitimate economic rationale\u201d, says New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services \u2013 the other regulator on the case. The counterparties, typically registered offshore, were always related and often linked by common beneficial owners. Most damning of all, a few Deutsche employees detected something rotten but their concerns were either ignored or allowed to fizzle out inconclusively. Traders in Moscow were told not to worry and to get on with their jobs. A senior compliance officer complained he had to \u201cbeg, borrow and steal\u201d to receive appropriate resources. This tale of gross incompetence at one of the world\u2019s largest banks would be easier to understand if it had emerged from the pre-crash era of light-touch regulation. But, to repeat, the events happened as recently as 2012 to 2015, well after the hardening in the regulatory mood. We must assume, or hope, that most other international banks fulfil their duties and that Deutsche\u2019s systems and controls were uniquely dreadful. If not, all these fine boasts about how the banks are performing a service for the world by cleaning up the financial system aren\u2019t worth a rouble. Ocado chances its arm with technology It\u2019s an engineering triumph: a robotic arm that can pick up an apple without damaging it. The accompanying video clip suggests Ocado\u2019s mechanical device is still about 20 times slower than the average human in performing the task but, hey, big breakthroughs can take years. They certainly can at Ocado. The big advance that interests investors is a deal with an international customer to licence the already-deployed technology that powers Ocado\u2019s warehouses. The online grocer first promised such a deal in 2015. It never arrived. Then 2016 came and went. And now? \u201cWe expect to sign multiple deals in multiple territories in the medium term,\u201d says chief executive Tim Steiner, wisely avoiding defining the medium term. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the confidence is merited this time. Ocado has its new distribution centre up and running in Andover in Hampshire, so it can display its latest technology in action rather than on the drawing board. The deal has to happen, though. The extended arrangement with Morrisons can\u2019t sustain expectations indefinitely. The best advert for the technology would, of course, be booming profits in Ocado\u2019s core business of delivering groceries in the UK. On that score, progress is mixed. Revenues rose almost 15% in the financial year to last November but profit before tax, hit by a \u00a32.4m exceptional item, improved only 1% to \u00a312.1m. Ocado generates sufficient cash to open more warehouses and, it revealed, employ a remarkable 950 IT and software professionals in four countries. The concentration on technological improvement is admirable and Steiner is entitled to boast about the 50 patent applications. In the end, though, the Ocado Smart Platform is only properly smart if other companies want to pay decent money to licence it. VW motors into a fresh pay controversy How\u2019s the corporate revamp at Volkswagen going? Very nicely if you are Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, the compliance chief recruited after the great diesel emissions scandal. She will leave the carmaker after earning more than \u20ac10m for 13 months\u2019 work. Her departure, said VW, was prompted by \u201cdifferences in the understanding of responsibilities and future operating structures within the function she leads.\u201d Translation: there was a bust-up. Hohmann-Dennhardt has earned her euros, apparently, because she had to be bought out of her contract at Daimler and now VW has to pay the full three years of the employment contract it signed with her. That explains the formal mechanics of the \u20ac10bn. But it does not explain why the German carmaker, whose board was one of the most highly paid in Europe when the emissions cheating was exposed, appears to have learned nothing about how to reform remuneration after a corporate calamity.",

In the post-crisis era, battalions of compliance officers have been recruited and trained. The costs are enormous and still increasing, say the banks, but financial regulators have got what they demanded. All banks must know their clients, including where and how they got their money, and the supporting documentation has to be pristine, especially if chunky sums are moving across borders.</p> <p>That\u2019s the theory, but then there\u2019s the practice. At Deutsche Bank, circa 2012 to 2015, the system was an underfunded shambles. The bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/31/deutsche-bank-fined-630m-over-russia-money-laundering-claims\">has been fined $630m (\u00a3506m) for \u201cunacceptable\u201d deficiencies</a> in its anti-money laundering controls but the details of the affair are extraordinary. Some $10bn was transferred out of Russia through Deutsche \u201cin a manner highly suggestive of financial crime\u201d, says the Financial Conduct Authority.</p> <p>Red flags should have been everywhere in a wheeze whereby shares were bought in roubles in Deutsche\u2019s Moscow branch and then sold via the London office for dollars. These so-called mirror trades lacked \u201clegitimate economic rationale\u201d, says New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services \u2013 the other regulator on the case. The counterparties, typically registered offshore, were always related and often linked by common beneficial owners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/31/deutsche-bank-fined-630m-over-russia-money-laundering-claims\">Deutsche Bank fined $630m over Russia money laundering claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most damning of all, a few Deutsche employees detected something rotten but their concerns were either ignored or allowed to fizzle out inconclusively. Traders in Moscow were told not to worry and to get on with their jobs. A senior compliance officer complained he had to \u201cbeg, borrow and steal\u201d to receive appropriate resources.</p> <p>This tale of gross incompetence at one of the world\u2019s largest banks would be easier to understand if it had emerged from the pre-crash era of light-touch regulation. But, to repeat, the events happened as recently as 2012 to 2015, well after the hardening in the regulatory mood.</p> <p>We must assume, or hope, that most other international banks fulfil their duties and that Deutsche\u2019s systems and controls were uniquely dreadful. If not, all these fine boasts about how the banks are performing a service for the world by cleaning up the financial system aren\u2019t worth a rouble.</p> <h2>Ocado chances its arm with technology</h2> <p>It\u2019s an engineering triumph: a robotic arm that can pick up an apple without damaging it.

Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt left VW on Tuesday after joining the board of the company on 1 January 2016 as head of compliance and legal affairs. The payoff, which first emerged in the German media, will raise eyebrows among VW shareholders and campaigners. The German carmaker has already been heavily criticised over executive pay. It paid \u20ac63m to former and existing board members in 2015, despite being engulfed in scandal after it emerged that 11m of its cars were fitted with defeat devices to manipulate emissions data. VW has agreed to pay billions to settle charges with the US authorities over the scandal. It has set said \u20ac18.2bn to meet the costs of fines and fixing the cars installed with defeat devices, but the company now expects to pay out more than this. A number of executives have also been charged about their roles in the scandal. Hohmann-Dennhardt is thought to be entitled to as much \u20ac13m and will receive at least \u20ac10m. However, she defended the payment. The former judge told German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung: \u201cThe fact that a contract is fulfilled is a very normal process. I have nothing to hide.\u201d One of the reasons that the severance package is so significant is that VW had to buy Hohmann-Dennhardt out of a financial package with her former employee Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, in order to persuade her to join the carmaker. Hohmann-Dennhardt agreed a three-year contract with VW but the company announced in a statement last week that she would leave by mutual agreement. VW said that the company and Hohmann-Dennhardt are \u201cparting due to differences in their understanding of responsibilities and future operating structures within the function she leads\u201d. VW said Hohmann-Dennhardt improved the company\u2019s approach to compliance and rolled out an internal campaign designed to promote a culture of integrity. \u201cVolkswagen will continue to press forward with changes to its way of thinking and working,\u201d it said. \u201cThe group has substantially elevated its commitment to working ethically and with integrity and is decentralising its organisation.\u201d Hohmann-Dennhardt is being replaced by Hiltrud Werner, who was previously head of auditing. News of her payout has emerged a day after sales figures for 2016 confirmed that VW is the world\u2019s biggest car manufacturer. Toyota had been the biggest seller for the past four years but its 2016 sales total of just under 10.2m vehicles, announced on Monday, fell short of the 10.3m cars sold by VW. This is the first time that VW, which also owns Audi, Porsche and \u0160koda, has been the biggest carmaker in the world. The company claimed the top spot on the back of a 12% rise in sales in China and despite demand slowing in Europe and the US, which was partly due to the diesel emissions scandal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser has hit out at Germany and accused the country of gaining an unfair trade advantage from the \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro. In a sign that the Trump administration is targeting currencies in its approach to trade deals, Peter Navarro, the head of the US president\u2019s new National Trade Council, told the Financial Times (\u00a3) that the euro was like an \u201cimplicit Deutsche Mark\u201d. Germany \u201ccontinues to exploit other countries in the EU as well as the US with an \u2018implicit Deutsche Mark\u2019 that is grossly undervalued\u201d, he said. Navarro, an academic and outspoken critic of China\u2019s negative impact on the American economy, added that Germany was one of the main obstacles to a trade deal between the US and the EU. The comments sent the euro to an eight-week high against the dollar, and immediately drew a rebuff from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The euro\u2019s weakness \u2013 and its move to near-parity with the dollar \u2013 has come after a period of low and even negative interest rates as well as a programme of monetary stimulus measures from the European Central Bank. Speaking in Stockholm, Merkel said: \u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed. \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is.\u201d Many of the ECB policies \u2013 such as slashing interest rates and printing euros to buy government bonds \u2013 are unpopular in Germany, not least because they disadvantage the millions of savers in the country. Former UBS chief economist George Magnus called the comments from Navarro about the euro \u201chogwash\u201d because it was not \u201cGermany\u2019s currency to influence or manage\u201d. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cAny pretence that the US would be pursuing a so-called \u2018strong dollar policy\u2019 appears to have been blown to shreds today after Peter Navarro, one of Donald Trump\u2019s top trade advisers, took aim at Germany for implicitly targeting a lower euro in order to give itself a competitive advantage over its main trading partners, sending the US dollar sharply lower. \u201cWhile this overlooks the fact that the ECB sets monetary policy for the whole euro area, and not just Germany, this distinction isn\u2019t likely to figure too highly with the new US administration, which seems determined to upset the status quo in any way possible.\u201d Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of foreign exchange strategy at UniCredit Research, said: \u201cThis is quite strong and unusual rhetoric coming from a very senior trade adviser to the US president. First, and since it comes just days following the president\u2019s comments about the \u2018too strong dollar\u2019, it suggests that the US administration sees the exchange rate as one of the main anchoring points for the deployment of its trade policies. \u201cSecondly, and perhaps more importantly, it adds an additional layer of confusion and inconsistency in this twisted web of incoherent policies: a shift towards a \u2018weak dollar policy\u2019 is at odds with the imposition of tariffs (which tend to lead to exchange-rate appreciation \u2013 ignoring for the moment the possibility of retaliation).\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. The new US administration has opened up a new front against Europe, accusing Germany of unfairly profiting from the \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro. Peter Navarro, who heads up Donald Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, made the comments in an FT interview today. The comments sent the euro spiking; it\u2019s now at its highest level since November. But German chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to rebuff the comments, saying that Germany can\u2019t control the value of the euro anyway. New data has shown that Europe\u2019s economy continues to recover -- and that price pressures are building. Eurozone GDP rose by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, new data shows, meaning that it grew faster last year than America. Inflation is also on the rise; the consumer prices index jumped by 1.8% year-on-year. But the increase was mainly due to energy prices, with core inflation remaining at 0.9%. There was also relief that the eurozone jobless rate fell again, to 9.6% in December. But the divisions in Europe were clear to see - with Germany\u2019s unemployment rate hitting a post-reunification low, while Italy\u2019s remains at the highest since July 2015. Elsewhere in the eurozone, Greece\u2019s deadlocked talks with creditors have once more raised the spectre of Grexit. And back across the Atlantic, US consumer confidence dropped in January from the fifteen year high seen in December. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite a busy day for economic and corporate news, the actions of the Trump administration were once again at the forefront of investors minds. The fallout of Trump\u2019s ban on travel, his firing of the acting attorney general, followed by the attack on the euro and Germany by his top trade advisor, have all added to the mood of growing uncertainty. Some unimpressive updates have not helped. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said A double whammy in the form of misses for the Chicago PMI and consumer confidence on the economic front, plus a poor set of numbers from economic bellwether UPS, have resulted in a continuation of yesterday\u2019s risk-off atmosphere. Only in London is the mood more optimistic, where once again it is the FTSE\u2019s mining contingent that is helping to [support] the index. In the end the FTSE also succumbed to the negative mood. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.27% or 19.33 points at 7099.15 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.25% to 11,535.31 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% lower at 4748.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.9% to 18,590.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.49% lower at 9315.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.38% to 611.75 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 138 points or 0.7%. It\u2019s probably no surprise that market volatility is on the rise after the first few days of the Trump presidency. And after a dip on Monday it is back up again: Despite the drop in US consumer confidence, it is still at fairly high levels. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Although slightly down on last month\u2019s historic high US consumer confidence remains strong in the face of uncertainty. The US economy is enjoying robust numbers at the moment and Fed Chair Janet Yellen will likely be inching closer to the first of three possible interest rate rises this year. American citizens appear to be confident in the potential growth of business conditions, stock prices and jobs. However, the world\u2019s largest economy is now being steered by an unpredictable new leader in the form of Donald Trump and the year ahead could still be bumpy. That didn\u2019t last long... US consumer confidence has dropped, having spiked in the aftermath of the US election victory. America\u2019s Conference Board reports that its consumer confidence index dipped to 111.8 this month, down from the fifteen-year high struck in December. Over to Greece where deadlocked talks with creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat have once again raised the spectre of Grexit and the need for contingency plans. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: It is a scenario that in the ranks of Syriza, the governing left-wing party, no one openly wants. But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. Speaking on Skai TV this morning, Nikos Xydakis, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d \u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked. Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting. \u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015. \u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion. The dilemma, drachma or euro, will sow division with civil war passion in a country which should urgently unite and stand on its feet.\u201d Over in New York, Wall Street has opened lower as investors continue to watch political developments closely, and nervously. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 72 points, or 0.35%, in early trading to 19,901. Trump\u2019s decision to fire his acting attorney general overnight, following the travel ban that sparked protests in America and beyond, is clearly worrying some traders. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that: Although some of the selling momentum experienced yesterday throughout the stock markets has cooled down, the market headlines across the globe continue to be dominated by the executive order from Donald Trump to ban certain nationals from entering the United States. While it has to be taken into account that the record moves seen in the stock markets last week would increase the risks of some investors being tempted to take profits from positions, there is no doubting that this move from Trump has caused outrage across the globe and such actions represent a risk to the market sentiment. Reuters have helpfully published Angela Merkel\u2019s response to Peter Navarro\u2019s criticism: Speaking in Stockholm, on a visit to Sweden, the German chancellor said: \u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed. \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is.\u201d City experts aren\u2019t convinced by Peter Navarro\u2019s comments about the euro: Here\u2019s former UBS chief economist George Magnus: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets: Keith McCullough, CEO of Hedgeye Risk Management, is even less impressed: Newsflash: German chancellor Angela Merkel has responded to Peter Navarro\u2019s attack. She says that Germany cannot influence the value of the euro, and that the country has always pushed for the European Central Bank to be independent. Does Peter Navarro have a point, when he claims Germany is exploiting other countries through its cheap currency? Well.... Germany posted a record trade surplus in 2015, and will probably do the same when 2016\u2019s numbers are added up. Cheap currencies boost exports, and no-one would argue that the euro would be more valuable if you removed the weaker members from the currency bloc. Back in 2015, former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke blogged that the German trade surplus was \u201ca problem\u201d for the global economy. He argued that Berlin should boost government spending, and workers\u2019 wages, to help drive it down. However.... Bernanke also pointed out that Germany has little control over the value of the euro. It has fallen near to parity with the US dollar because the European Central Bank has slashed interest rates to record lows (unpopular in Germany), imposed negative rates on banks (unpopular in Germany) and created tens of billions of euros to buy government bonds (unpopular in Germany). Currency wars aren\u2019t a new issue either. NBC correspondent Hans Nichols points out that the Obama administration had its own concerns about the euro, when it was stronger: The prospect of a currency spat between the US and the eurozone has pushed the euro up against all major currencies. The single currency is up 0.7% against the dollar now, to $1.0764, after Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed it was \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d. This means the US dollar is still on track to post its worst January since 2008 (as recorded earlier). The euro has also gained 0.6% against the pound to 86.1p, meaning one pound is worth \u20ac1.1608. Peter Navarro\u2019s attack on Germany over the euro shows that the Trump administration are concerned about countries who run a trade surplus with the US. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Citigroup global econonomics director Ebrahim Rahbari says that \u201ctalking about a currency is much easier than taking specific measures\u201d. Currency rates have clearly been under discussion for some time, at forums such as the G20, Rahbari points out. So Navarro is \u201cratcheting up the discussions that have previously taken place\u201d, he concludes. Hold onto your hats, folks. The Financial Times is reporting that one of Donald Trump\u2019s advisers has hit out at Germany, saying it gets an unfair advantage due to the weakness of the euro. Here\u2019s the story, by the FT\u2019s Shawn Donnan: Germany is using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to exploit the US and its EU partners, Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser has said in comments that are likely to trigger alarm in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Peter Navarro, the head of Mr Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, told the Financial Times the euro was like an \u201cimplicit Deutsche Mark\u201d whose low valuation gave Germany an advantage over its main partners. His views suggest the new administration is focusing on currency as part of its hard-charging approach on trade ties. In a departure from past US policy, Mr Navarro also called Germany one of the main hurdles to a US trade deal with the EU and declared talks with the bloc over a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership dead. Here\u2019s the full story: Trump\u2019s top trade adviser accuses Germany of currency exploitation The euro is now rising sharply against the US dollar, as traders anticipate action from Washington over this issue. It\u2019s gained almost 0.5% to \u20ac1.074. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the news that eurozone growth and inflation have risen, while the unemployment rate has hit a new seven-year low. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: In the Eurozone GDP figures have been released this morning. Inflation in Spain has increased to 3% as has the cost of living in France, up by 1.4%; while the broader EU CPI measure jumped to 1.8% largely driven by a jump in energy prices. The French economy grew 1.1% in 2016 slightly less than expected but despite this Michel Sapin, the French minister of finance, insisted the French economy is still moving in the right direction and reducing unemployment. Overall, Eurozone GDP came in at 0.5% for the last quarter which was better than forecast and unemployment fell. All this positive data suggests the Eurozone is recovering slowly, though Italy continues to remain a weak point. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity: Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, A fresh and intricate new conundrum has reared its ugly head for Mario Draghi this morning as the pressure of a significant uplift in German inflation has pushed the Eurozone figure up to 1.8% for January. The renown \u2018powerhouse\u2019 of the Eurozone is now putting significant pressure on the ECB President as euro-sceptics are quickly pointing out that stimulus measures are falling far short of creating a balanced and improved bloc state. Whilst GDP saw an uplift this morning, as well as a diminishing Unemployment rate also posted, inflation has, and will be for the foreseeable future, the focus. With such wild swings upwards, Draghi will have to adopt Monetary policy accordingly, which at present isn\u2019t hugely clear as to what path he should, or is willing to take. Many analysts suggest Quantitative Easing is falling far short of improving the economic situation, and Draghi always notes \u2018other tools\u2019 which he can, and will adopt - perhaps now is the time for him to lay his cards on the table, so to speak. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: The ECB has been wont to point out that core inflation remains a problem and the uptick in prices might not last. And again this remains stubbornly below the headline figure at just 0.9%. No cause for the ECB to tighten monetary policy just yet but refreshingly upbeat figures nonetheless. The data is improving in Europe but there is as yet no sign of anything other than monetary policy divergence between the Fed and European Central Bank. Greece\u2019s debt problems won\u2019t go away and political risks are abundant. The eurozone didn\u2019t manage to match Britain\u2019s economy, though. UK GDP grew by 0.6% in the last three months of 2016, and by 2.2% during the year. The eurozone outperformed the United States last year. Today\u2019s growth figures show that the eurozone expanded by 1.8% in 2016; last Friday, we learned that America only grew by 1.6%. This is the first time the Eurozone has grown faster than the US in a calendar year since 2008, when the financial crisis struck. Eurozone politicians will be delighted to see the region\u2019s jobless rate fall to 9.6% (not 9.8% as I mistyped earlier, sorry). This is the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since May 2009. The jobless rate across the European Union came in at 8.2%, unchanged from November, and the lowest since February 2009. The lowest rates were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany, while Greece suffered the worst jobless rate (23.0% in October 2016) followed by Spain (18.4%). There are still 20.065 million men and women out of work in the EU, including 15.571 million in the euro area. And young people are still finding it hard to find work; in December 2016, the youth unemployment rate was 18.6% in the EU28 and 20.9% in the euro area, compared with 19.5% and 21.8% respectively in December 2015. Important point: eurozone core inflation (which strips out food and energy) was only 0.9% this month, rather than the headline figure of 1.8%. That\u2019s little comfort to households facing a cash squeeze, but it does give the European Central Bank a good reason not to be bounced into changing monetary policy. Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, explains: \u201cHeadline inflation is clearly picking up in the Eurozone, but a lot of that is linked to energy price base effects (+8.1% compared with +2.6% in December). As highlighted in their most recent press conference, the ECB itself is willing to look through these transient gains. As such, we believe that it is too early to call for any sort of further \u201ctapering\u201d in the region, especially ahead of a very busy political agenda. Growth up, inflation up, unemployment down.... On an annual basis, the eurozone grew by 1.8% last year - up from 1.5% in 2015. My Reuters machine is gasping for air as a burst of newsflashes ripple out from the eurozone, giving new insights into the European economy. New growth figures show that the euro area grew by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s an encouraging sign, suggesting the region\u2019s recovery is picking up pace. But inflation has jumped by more than expected, to 1.8% in January. That\u2019s the highest in almost four-years, driven by a steep rise in energy prices. The European Central Bank\u2019s target is to keep inflation just below 2% - these figures are surely going to fuel calls for the ECB to stop its bond-buying stimulus programme, and consider pushing interest rates up. And the unemployment rate across the region has dropped to 9.6% in December  , a new seven-year low. Details and reaction to follow.... The latest unemployment news from Italy is rather disappointing. The Italian jobless rate came in at 12% in December, higher than expected, while November\u2019s reading has been revised up from 11.9% to 12%. These are the highest readings since July 2015. The US dollar is poised to suffer its worst start to any year since 2008. The greenback has fallen by 1.9% against a basket of currencies this month, partly thanks to yesterday\u2019s selloff as Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders alarmed traders. The pound, for example, has gained over 1.5 cents against the US dollar this month, from $1.233 to $1.25. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says it\u2019s very hard to know how the markets will react to Trump. President Trump\u2019s travel ban - and his associated decision to fire the acting Attorney General - dominates sentiment and remains good for Treasuries, the yen (and gold), but bad for bonds and the dollar. How long will market sentiment to be affected? How far can the dollar and yields fall on this? I\u2019m not sure serious analysis is possible, and I don\u2019t trust my gut instincts on something as far from the usual state of affairs, but my bias is still that we\u2019ll get back to the Trump economic program, and the implications for Fed policy, before too long. More prosaically, markets will focus on the US jobs data due Friday. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s jobs market remains as strong as ever. The unemployment total in Europe\u2019s largest economy has fallen again this month, by 26,000 people, to 2.605m. That takes Germany\u2019s jobless rate down to 5.9%. UK online supermarket group Ocado is the best performing stock across Europe, jumping by 6.5%. It posted a 21% jump in pre-tax profits this morning, to \u00a314.5m, and told shareholders it was busier than ever, in its long-running attempt to sign an overseas deal. The only problem is that we\u2019ve been waiting YEARS for Ocado to team up with an international partner. The company insists there are plenty of suiters in the wings, but there\u2019s still no actual agreement. Retail analyst Nick Bubb predicts: Management will have to put up with more questions from the City today about the failure to deliver an Overseas deal in the analysts meeting at 9.30am\u2026 European stock markets have opened nervously, following those losses in Asia overnight. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has inched up by 0.2%, while the French CAC and German DAX are both flat. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says investors are juggling political and economic concerns right now. It\u2019s been an interesting start to the week, with protests against President Trump\u2019s immigration ban dominating market news and reaction. Trump\u2019s use of executive power has not stopped with immigration; on Monday he signed a new order that will cap business regulation. While politics took centre stage at the start of the week, earnings from Apple and Exxon on later today, along with a flurry of central bank meetings this week will be critical for determining what matters more to markets right now: politics or economics. Back to GDP....and Austria has posted another quarter of solid growth. Austrian GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, matching the (upwardly revised) growth in July-September. Austria\u2019s statistics body said that consumer spending and investment were the main factors behind the growth, as in France. Newsflash: Inflation in Spain has surged this month, to 3% on an EU-harmonised basis. The cost of living in France has accelerated too, jumping from 0.8% to 1.6% . The rises are mainly due to higher energy prices, and it suggests the eurozone inflation rate, due in two hour\u2019s time, has also risen sharply this month. If so, there\u2019ll be a lot more pressure on the European Central Bank to consider tightening its stimulus programme, especially from Germany (where inflation jumped to 1.9%, according to figures released on Monday). Asian stock markets have had another poor day, as fears about Donald Trump\u2019s actions continue to rile investors. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell by 1.7%, its biggest drop since October, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.7%. On Monday, global markets suffered their biggest one-day drop in six weeks, amid global condemnation of the US president\u2019s travel ban on seven countries in the Middle East. The news that Trump had fired attorney general Sally Yates after she instructed lawyers not to defend the ban has added to the nervous mood, and fears that Trump is destabilising the world order. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, says (via Reuters): Investors are becoming worried as it appears as if he was setting fire to geopolitical risks that already exist. We don\u2019t have any growth figures from Germany today. Instead, we\u2019ve got a nasty fall in retail spending. German retail sales fell by 0.9% month-on-month in December, dashing hopes of a recovery after a 1.7% drop in November. These figures are often volatile, but it could suggest consumers in Europe\u2019s largest economy were cautious in the run-up to Christmas. Outgoing French president Francois Hollande will surely be pleased that the economy is growing, but his successor still faces a big challenge: German journalist Gesche W\u00fcpper points out that France\u2019s growth during 2016 was weaker than hoped, at just 1.1% for the year. Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets this graph, showing how France\u2019s growth has been volatile and unspectacular over the last few years: Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group, shows how France (in green) has lagged behind Sweden, the US, Germany and the UK over the last decade. France has got Eurozone GDP Day off to a good start, by reporting that its economy accelerated in the last three months of 2016. French GDP expanded by 0.4% in the October-December quarter, twice as fast as in July-September. This suggests that France\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis continues, despite the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote last summer. The figures also show that France\u2019s economy grew by 1.1% during 2016. Statistics body INSEE says that consumer and business spending drove the recovery. \u201cHousehold consumption expenditures\u201d rose by 0.6% during the month. while \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d jumped by 0.8%. Exports were \u201cmore dynamic\u201d, rising by +1.1% during the quarter while imports grew by 0.8%. And that means foreign trade balance contributed slightly to GDP growth: +0.1 points after \u22120.7 points in the previous quarter. I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be looking at Europe\u2019s economy this morning, as new data are released showing how the eurozone is performing. The first estimate of eurozone GDP for the last quarter of 2016, due at 10am GMT, may show that growth picked up to +0.4%, from +0.3%. We\u2019ll also get some figures from individual countries, including France. The latest eurozone unemployment figures are also due at 10am GMT; economists reckon the jobless rate will stick at 9.8% again, the lowest since 2009. But Italy\u2019s figures, due at 9am GMT, will surely show that its recovery is lagging behind. Plus, the latest estimate of eurozone inflation is released (yup, also at 10am GMT). We also get German retail sales figures for December at 7am; they\u2019re expected to bounce back by around 0.6% after shrinking by 1.8% in November. And at 8am, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is giving speech on \u201cInto the future: Europe\u2019s digital integrated market\u201d in Frankfurt, Germany. Europe\u2019s financial markets are expected to be subdued, following yesterday\u2019s losses as investors watched the backlash against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day...",

But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. <br></p> <p>Speaking on Skai TV this morning, <strong>Nikos Xydakis</strong>, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, <strong>Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou</strong> similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. </p> <p>In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner <strong>Anna Diamantopoulou</strong> demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK consumers are in an \u201cabusive relationship\u201d with the big six energy providers, according to the MP who chairs the Commons business select committee. Iain Wright, the Labour MP who heads the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, questioned why the public was reluctant to switch suppliers despite poor customer service and the availability of cheaper tariffs. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s like an abusive relationship. I can\u2019t believe that customers are being beaten black and blue all the time and yet stay with their existing providers.\u201d In a lively session with consumer groups and energy providers, MPs were focused on the findings of a two-year investigation into the energy market by the competition watchdog, which concluded last summer. The Competition and Markets Authority found that 70% of domestic customers of the big six companies \u2013 British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE \u2013 were on expensive standard variable tariffs and could save more than \u00a3300 by switching to a cheaper deal. As a result, customers have been paying \u00a31.4bn a year more than they would in a fully competitive market, the CMA found. Consumer group Which? told the BEIS committee that the response to the report from energy suppliers had been \u201cdismal\u201d, adding that the only sector more mistrusted by the public was used car dealers. Peter Moorey, head of campaigns at Which?, said: \u201cThe energy market is still far from working effectively for consumers. Energy prices remain consumers\u2019 number one financial concern. The only sector distrusted more in Which\u2019s latest research is used car dealers. \u201cWe would have expected a much bigger response from energy suppliers given that we\u2019ve had this big investigation and it\u2019s found huge problems in the market. Response from suppliers has been dismal.\u201d He said energy companies had failed to engage with those customers who were sticking on the default expensive tariffs for a prolonged period of years. Victoria MacGregor, director of energy at Citizens Advice, said customer service among providers was still \u201ctoo patchy\u201d, with members of the public having to turn to the service for help with basic issues including problems with bills. Simon Stacey, domestic markets director at Npower, accepted that the industry \u201chas got an issue\u201d but insisted there had been improvements in the market with smaller, challenger suppliers bringing competition and innovation. \u201cI think that what you\u2019ve seen in the last year is a significant amount of switching, high degrees of engagement compared with previous years. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t still work to do,\u201d he said. However, Dan Hopcroft, residential sales director at EDF Energy, said branding the major energy providers \u201cdismal\u201d and on a par with used car salesmen was unfair. He said: \u201cThe term the big six is used, which we find upsetting. It infers that we\u2019re a club and we get together and that we determine what the prices are going to be and that\u2019s definitely not the case ... so it\u2019s actually quite upsetting to hear that.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May should guarantee the minimum wage for self-employed workers for companies such as Uber and Hermes and prevent them from losing work with no notice, the Labour MP Frank Field has said. The chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee told a Downing Street review of modern working practices that all workers should benefit from a new \u201cnational standard of fair work in the gig economy\u201d. The proposal by Field, who has led campaigns in parliament against what he claims is the \u201csulphurous effect\u201d of the fast-growing gig economy, comes amid multiple legal claims by people who believe they are wrongly classed as self-employed and so miss out on basic rights. In his submission to the government\u2019s labour market review led by the former Downing Street adviser Matthew Taylor, Field said a new national standard of fair work would \u201cgive the prime minister the tools she needs to craft basic humanity, decency and fairness into the bottom of Britain\u2019s labour market\u201d. He said an additional 900,000 self-employed positions had been added to the UK workforce since 2010. The proposed national minimum standard would avoid the need for employment tribunals and HM Revenue and Customs to determine whether people are genuinely self-employed and would instead automatically extend employment rights to all gig economy workers. The rights would include: a guarantee of an income no lower than the national minimum wage after taking into account costs such as petrol and car insurance; a ban on sweated labour, involving self-employed people working dangerously long hours to earn a basic living; the right for working people to challenge intimidating employment practices; four weeks\u2019 notice before working patterns are changed or work is withdrawn; and transparency about how companies calculate payments to working people. The proposal is likely to be fiercely opposed by the main gig economy companies, who have built their business models around self-employed labour. Uber declined to comment and Hermes said it was looking at Field\u2019s proposals. Field said: \u201cFor some working people, the gig economy provides the opportunity of flexible work, and a supplementary income, around which they can fit other commitments. However, for many others the gig economy represents a life of low pay, chronic insecurity and exploitation, in which all of the risks in the employment relationship are unloaded on to them by the company with whom they are working, and the gains go almost exclusively to the company in question.\u201d He said the government\u2019s newly appointed director of labour market enforcement, Sir David Metcalf, should police the new minimum standards. A spokesperson for the Taylor review said it would consider Field\u2019s submission. \u201cAs part of our country-wide evidence-gathering tour we are considering whether employment practices need to change to keep pace with modern business models \u2013 including the gig economy and use of agency workers,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is also considering the implications of new forms of work on worker rights and responsibilities \u2013 as well as on employer freedoms and obligations.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ocado is testing a robot hand that can pick and pack fruit and vegetables in a move that could reduce its reliance on thousands of warehouse workers. The online grocery retailer is developing the machines in partnership with academic institutions in Germany, Italy and Austria as well as Disney Research \u2013 a Zurich-based lab that is part of the US entertainment group behind Mickey Mouse and Frozen. Ocado currently employs about 4,000 people at its warehouses, and grocery picking is a key part of their job as handling of easily damageable and unpredictably shaped objects such as fruits, vegetables or eggs is difficult to mechanise. The latest development will fuel fears about jobs being replaced by technology. Automated warehouses have been in use for decades and Ocado, which delivers groceries for Waitrose and Morrisons, already uses a variety of robots in its operations. Those working in its warehouses are guided by technology to ensure they work efficiently. But the variation in shape and fragile nature of fruit and vegetables mean that historically they have been susceptible to damage or bruising when handled by robots. So far, Ocado has tested the RBO Hand 2 developed by the Technische Universit\u00e4t in Berlin with two different robotic arms: the LBR iiwa14, an \u201cintelligent industrial work assistant\u201d designed by German robotics firm Kuka to work closely with humans for \u201cgreater cost-effectiveness and utmost efficiency\u201d, and the Staubli RX160L, an industrial robot designed for \u201charsh environments\u201d. Ocado is also working on creating its own robot hand using machine learning and 3D \u201ccomputer vision\u201d sensors to ensure it can grab a range of tricky objects including eggs, glass bottles and household cleaning products, such as bleach, that could be hazardous if spilled. It is also trying to train the hands to recognise when fruit is ripe or mouldy. Alex Voica from Ocado\u2019s technology arm said: \u201cIdeally we will be able to develop one robot hand, or a small number of hands, that will be able to deal with a whole range of objects.\u201d Ocado is also helping to develop a humanoid robot, SecondHands, which uses machine learning to provides assistance to human technicians carrying out warehouse maintenance tasks. \u201cThe whole aim of what we are doing is to boost productivity. Right now we are limited by the capability of the warehouse and by the productivity of humans.\u201d Voica said. Ocado has already been able to improve the productivity of its staff by 50% by improving the systems that bring goods to packers and it was possible it could get the same kind of boost again. Ocado has been investing heavily in technology as it tries to increase profits and sell its knowhow to overseas retailers. The Hatfield-based company currently has 50 innovations seeking a patent and took on more than 200 extra tech experts last year, taking its total to 950 on top of 200 qualified engineers. Over the next year it expects to hire another 100 IT and engineering professionals as it opens two new warehouses and tries to persuade international retailers to use its software and technology. Duncan Tatton-Brown, Ocado\u2019s finance director, said the company was looking at using robot hands \u201cover time\u201d but there was no deadline for their introduction. He said the new warehouses would be automated but would \u201cstill need lots of people\u201d. \u201cWe are not only creating more operational jobs but creating a lot more jobs for software and hardware engineers. We are inventing and patenting things which is good news. We are creating innovations in the UK and we would argue we are a market leader in the world,\u201d Tatton-Brown said. The company, founded by three former Goldman Sachs bankers in 2000, delivered its first profit in 2015 after 15 years of investment in technology and warehouse systems. On Tuesday, the company reported a 22% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a314.5m, before \u00a32.4m of exceptional items mostly related to the company moving its head office. Sales rose 13.6% to \u00a31.3bn as a rise in customer numbers offset a fall in the average order size as Ocado was forced to cut prices amid heavy competition in the grocery market as major players such as Tesco try to fight off the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 February 2017 to correct details of the robot hand and arms tested by Ocado.",

      "bodyText": "Shell has sold a large part of its North Sea oil fields for $3.8bn (\u00a33bn) to a company headed by Linda Cook, who left the Anglo-Dutch group more than seven years ago after missing out on the top job. American-born Cook, nicknamed the first lady of oil and gas by the City, had been at Shell for 29 years and was latterly in charge of the group\u2019s gas and renewables businesses. She was a frontrunner to become chief executive, but instead Peter Voser was appointed to the post and Cook resigned. She was controversially awarded a $7.6m severance payment, and Shell also doubled her pension pot to almost $25m, prompting criticism from shareholder groups. Now she will become chair of private equity-backed oil group Chrysaor after it snapped up the package of oil fields put up for sale by Shell. The deal will be partly funded by Harbour Energy, which is part of the US investment giant EIG and where Cook has been managing director since 2014. The assets sold by Shell accounted for more than half of the company\u2019s North Sea oil production last year and includes fields gained after Shell acquired gas giant BG Group for \u00a347bn. More than 400 jobs will be transferred to Chrysaor, which will become one of the UK\u2019s biggest oil and gas producers after the sale is completed in the second half of this year. The move takes place two days before Shell is due to publish its 2016 full-year results and is part of its programme to reduce its debts by divesting $30bn of assets by 2018. The sale also comes shortly before the group is expected to submit its formal plan to government for dismantling its rigs at Brent, a field which has produced about 10% of total North Sea production over four decades. Shell will still have a fixed liability of $1bn for decommissioning the assets sold to Chrysaor but otherwise avoids the estimated $3.9bn cost of cleaning up the rigs at the end of their life, which is expected to be more than two decades away. Andy Brown, Shell\u2019s upstream director, said: \u201cThis deal complements the great strides we have made over the last two years in improving the competitiveness of our UK upstream business.\u201d Chrysaor said the acquisition demonstrated its belief that North Sea oil and gas production had real future potential. \u201cChrysaor is acquiring a high quality package of assets which combine low-cost production, a substantial reserves and resources base with strong cash flows and a highly competent and skilled workforce,\u201d said Phil Kirk, its chief executive. The deal covers Shell\u2019s interests in the fields Buzzard, Beryl, Bressay, Elgin-Franklin, J-Block, the Greater Armada cluster, Everest, Lomond and Erskine, and a 10% stake in Schiehallion. Shell also announced on Tuesday that it had sold its stake in a Thai gas field for $900m to a subsidiary of the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company. Oil majors have been reducing their footprint in the relatively high cost North Sea in favour of lower cost production elsewhere. Earlier this month, BP sold a 25% stake in the Magnus field to Enquest, another UK independent oil and gas company.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The jailed City trader Tom Hayes is to submit his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) in an effort to demonstrate his conviction for rigging the Libor interest rate is \u201cunsafe\u201d. The move, which could be made as soon as Tuesday, comes after the former UBS and Citigroup employee failed in a previous attempt to have his conviction overturned, and was then blocked last year from appealing to the supreme court. Hayes, the first person convicted of rigging Libor (the London interbank offered rate), had originally confessed to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) to running a \u201cdishonest\u201d scheme and agreed to cooperate with the agency. He then changed tack, pleaded not guilty and was convicted in August 2015. The former trader claims he felt under pressure to originally admitting guilt in order to avoid being extradited to the US, where he was wanted to face similar charges, and that the court did not take into account his autism when convicting him. In his latest effort to overturn his sentence, Hayes is asking the CCRC to review \u201cevidence still coming to light and [that] was not available to the jury at my original trial\u201d. In a letter to the Guardian sent from Lowdham Grange prison in Nottinghamshire, Hayes outlined key planks of his defence as well as writing about the personal price he continues to pay, including missing key moments as his young son grows up. \u201cIt is my case that little or no independent investigation was constructed by the SFO, which failed to obtain evidence that might exonerate me.\u201d He cites 8m documents he claims are located at UBS headquarters in Switzerland. \u201cAs a result I was convicted and given a 14-year prison sentence, later reduced to 11 years \u2013 one of the longest any British court has handed out to a nonviolent offender,\u201d he added. \u201cThose senior to me were exonerated by the regulator and have never been interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office.\u201d The SFO said Hayes had independent legal advice at all times when dealing with the agency, while a number of the issues he is raising were dealt with at trial or during his subsequent unsuccessful appeal against conviction. During his City career, Hayes did not submit Libor rates \u2013 which are determined by collating a range of submissions from investment banks \u2013 but he was convicted because the crown alleged he had been the ringleader in manipulating those who did. In his letter to the Guardian, Hayes continued: \u201cThe only time Libor rates were dishonest and inaccurate was during what became known as the \u2018lowballing\u2019 period, when senior bankers and central bankers conspired to mislead investors about the banks\u2019 solvency [by suggesting that they could borrow money cheaper than they really could in order to camouflage fears banks\u2019 finances were under strain].\u201d During the trial, Andrew Thursfield, a senior manager at Hayes\u2019s final employer, Citigroup, told the court that the bank did not engage in lowballing \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d. However, last year Citibank settled charges with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission that included \u201cthe false reporting of US dollar Libor at times to avoid generating negative media attention and to protect its reputation during the financial crisis from the spring of 2008 through the summer of 2009\u201d. Hayes concluded: \u201cI spent Christmas 2016 in prison, as I did the last, desperately missing my family. As was the case last year, the camaraderie and support of my fellow inmates along with support from the church helped me to cope through the festive season, happy for most but incredibly sad inside. I was devastated that I did not see my young son open his presents on Christmas morning. \u201cThis year my son started school, and I continue to watch from the sidelines as he grows up into a child I am deeply proud of. But as I remain trapped in a high security prison, my son is slowly forgetting how it feels to have his father in his daily life. I tell him on every prison visit that I won\u2019t stop fighting to get the truth out, and to win my freedom so I can return home.\u201d The CCRC typically refers about 3.5% of all applications to the appeal courts, which decide on whether the conviction is unsafe or the sentence unfair. UBS and Citigroup declined to comment.",
