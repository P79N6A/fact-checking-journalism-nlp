      "bodyText": "The incoming chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority has admitted to an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d after investing in a controversial tax avoidance scheme that resulted in him repaying more than \u00a3100,000 to the taxman. Charles Randell, a former City lawyer and government adviser at the time of the financial crisis, told the Treasury select committee that he had failed to see a \u201cwarning signal\u201d about Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP, an investment product that promised members tax reliefs but was subsequently challenged by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Ingenious Film Partners 2 was a film production partnership that proved popular with many celebrities and sports stars including Steven Gerrard, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham. It used tax breaks designed to encourage films to be made in the UK. Those who put money into the scheme could claim tax relief against film production losses. In a hearing on Tuesday, Randell, who was appointed last month and is due to take over the top job at the City watchdog in April, told the committee: \u201cI take responsibility for the decision that I took.\u201d He said he had been reassured that the scheme \u201chad been discussed with senior policy officials at HMRC who had indicated that they approved of it.\u201d Randell then added: \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me now that far from taking any comfort from that, I should have seen it as a warning signal because the mere fact that an informal assurance was seen to be necessary should have been telling me that this was an investment for which there wasn\u2019t a specific statutory framework\u201d. The disclosure came during a parliamentary hearing into Randell\u2019s appointment to lead the financial watchdog, which is accountable to the Treasury and parliament. Committee chair Nicky Morgan asked Randell if he could see that the Ingenious scheme would look, to the general public, like a \u201crather clever tax wheeze\u201d to let people pay less tax. \u201cYes I can\u201d, Randell replied. He added that he had \u201cdispensed with the services\u201d of his financial adviser when HMRC began taking action against the scheme. Ahead of the session Morgan, had written to the Treasury to ask if it had been aware of Randell\u2019s investment before appointing him. Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury\u2019s permanent secretary, said Randell\u2019s investment had been disclosed to the interview panel. Scholar said the panel had been \u201ccontent that [Randell] had taken appropriate action\u201d after he told them he had repaid the tax savings made and withdrawn from the scheme. In a subsequent letter to Scholar, Randell wrote: \u201cThe amount repaid to HMRC, which was not discussed at the interview, was approximately \u00a3114,000 plus interest. He added: \u201cI told the panel that I considered that my decision to invest in this partnership was an error of judgment which I regretted. I did not elaborate on this at the interview but I regret failing to independently investigate the assurances I received that HMRC were content with the partnership arrangements.\u201d Randell is currently an external member of the Prudential Regulation Committee of the Bank of England and a non-executive board member of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. He worked at the law firm Slaughter and May from 1980 to 2013, becoming a partner in 1989. Hearings by the Treasury committee into top appointments at the FCA and the Bank of England are commonplace, and are not without incident. Last year Charlotte Hogg resigned as deputy governor of the Bank of England barely two weeks after being promoted. Hogg had initially told the committee that the Bank was aware of her brother\u2019s role at Barclays, but then admitted days later she had not made the disclosure and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct she had helped to write.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, London\u2019s stock market has closed for the day. The FTSE 100 is virtually unchanged, down o.89 of a point at 7246.77. In New York the Dow is currently in the red. It\u2019s down 108 points or 0.43%. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our full story into the Treasury Committee\u2019s decision to release the official report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s treatment of small businesses. Charles Randell has also told MPs that he\u2019s committed to avoiding another financial crisis. He says the impact of the crisis was \u201cnothing short of disastrous\u201d on many people, and \u201cwe can\u2019t go there again\u201d. Randell adds that \u201csound prudential and conduct regulation\u201d can play a vital role in ensuring that financial firms stick to the rules, and protect consumers. A quick clarification: Charles Randell takes up the reins at the FCA on April 1, so I should have called him the \u2018chair-elect\u2019. Now fixed. Here\u2019s a potted history of the next head of the Financial Conduct Authority, from Pensions Age: Randell worked at Slaughter and May from 1980 to 2013, becoming a partner in 1989. He was a key adviser in the wake of the financial crisis, helping HM Treasury on the resolutions of Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley and the Icelandic banks, as well as advising on the government\u2019s investments into RBS and the merged Lloyds and HBOS. In addition, he advised the Portuguese Ministry of Finance on the recapitalisation of the Portuguese banking sector. The incoming chair of Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has admitted an \u2018error of judgement\u2019 after investing in a tax avoidance vehicle. Charles Randell is appearing before the Treasury Committee right now, and revealed that he made a mistake by putting money into the Ingenious Film Partners 2 scheme. Ingenious Film Partners 2 was a film production partnership which proved popular with many celebrities and sports stars, such as David Beckham and Wayne Rooney. It used tax breaks designed to encourage films to be made in the UK. Those who put money into the scheme could claim tax relief against film production losses. Randell has admitted that he failed to sufficiently investigate the situation, when he was told by his financial advisor that HMRC had said the scheme was acceptable. He invested in the scheme between 2006 and 2011. He told the committee that it was an \u201cerror of judgement\u201d not to investigate these assurances. He adds: I take responsibility for the decision that I took. I was reassured to hear that this partnership had been discussed with senior policy officials at HMRC who had indicated that they approved of it. It\u2019s clear to me now that far from taking any comfort from that, I should have seen it as a warning signal because the mere fact that an informal assurance was seen to be necessary should have been telling me that this was an investment for which there wasn\u2019t a specific statutory framework. There wasn\u2019t a binding approval mechanism. And if HMRC did approve it in 2005, which I\u2019ve been told repeatedly is the case, then it was always open to them to change their mind - which they obviously did do. Committee chair Nicky Morgan asks Randell if he could see that the Ingenious scheme would look, to the general public, like a \u201crather clever tax wheeze\u201d to let people pay less tax. \u201cYes I can\u201d, Randell replied. He added that \u201cI dispensed with the services of my financial advisor\u201d after HMRC began taking action against the scheme. I conducted as best I could my own personal assessment of the situation. I contacted HMRC and asked them to give me the terms of settlement for me personally. In early 2015, he paid around \u00a3114,000 plus interest to HMRC to settle the matter. Sir Tom Scholar, permanent secretary to the Treasury, has written to the Treasury committee saying that the government\u2019s assessment panel knew of Randell\u2019s involvement in Ingenious, and felt it should not prevent him chairing the FCA. But, as the FCA\u2019s role includes protecting consumers from dodgy investments, this isn\u2019t a great start to Randell\u2019s tenure at the watchdog.... Newsflash: Britain\u2019s Treasury committee has just published the official report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s treatment of small businesses. MPs took the decision after forcing Britain\u2019s financial watchdog, the FCA, to hand the report into RBS\u2019s Global Restructuring Group over. It ends a long battle between the committee and the FCA, which had refused to release the report (which leaked last year). However, MPs concluded that it should be published, having heard evidence that RBS deliberately put companies into GRG\u2019s clutches and drove them to the wall. Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan says: The findings in the report are disgraceful. The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. \u201cThe Committee has not taken the decision to publish lightly. Normally, reports prepared under section 166 are confidential, but there is overwhelming public interest in bringing transparency to what happened at GRG, given the earlier leak of the report, and in ensuring that everyone can see, and know that they are seeing, an authentic and verified copy of Promontory\u2019s original report. The report is online here. Shares in US retail titan Walmart are sliding, after the company missed Wall Street expectations. The company posted net income of $2.17bn, or 73 cents a share, for the last quarter compared with $3.76bn a year earlier. It also reported a slowdown in online sales growth, which will fuel concerns that Amazon is eating its market shares. Walmart are down over 8% in early trading. Asda, WalMart\u2019s UK operation, reported that growth slowed over the crucial Christmas quarter. Like-for-like takings rose by 0.5% in October-December, down from 1.1% in the third quarter of 2017. Latvia continues to be gripped by the arrest of central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics by anti-corruption officials last weekend. Rimsevics, who is accused of taking bribes, has told journalists he will not bow to pressure to resign. Associated Press has more details. Latvia\u2019s official on the European Central Bank\u2019s main policymaking council refused Tuesday to heed calls to resign following an investigation into suspected bribery and an Associated Press report on allegations of extortion and connections to money laundering. Ilmars Rimsevics, who was detained Saturday and released on bail two days later without charge, was defiant, dismissing the allegations against him as a smear campaign by commercial banks. \u201cI made a decision not to step down because I am not guilty,\u201d he said. The country\u2019s anti-corruption agency has started a probe into suspected bribery. And the AP has reported that the chairman of local bank Norvik, Grigory Guselnikov, says Rimsevics had asked for bribes since 2015. Guselnikov and Norvik have filed an international request for arbitration to a body of the World Bank to resolve what the document claims is the request for bribes and abuse of power by a \u201cSenior Latvian Official.\u201d Guselnikov and Norvik CEO Oliver Bramwell have confirmed that official is Rimsevics. Rimsevics said \u201cmy retreat would allow a man like Guselnikov to triumph.\u201d Wall Street is expected to open lower, when trading begins in 50 minutes. Tin hats on, folks. Analyst at Morgan Stanley think the recent stock market volatility was just an \u2018appetiser\u2019. In a new note to clients, Morgan Stanley warn that stocks will come under pressure again soon. They predict a \u2018tricky handover\u2019 in April-June, when inflation may be rising just as economic indicators cool. This could be a bad environment for stocks, they warn: It\u2019s when growth softens while inflation is still rising that returns suffer most. So the stock market falls a couple of weeks ago, which drove Wall Street into a correction, could just be an \u201cAppetiser, not the main course\u201d. Here\u2019s the key section from their report: Our cycle models suggest that DM [developed markets] remains in the late stages of a late-cycle environment. Rising equities, rising inflation, tightening policy,higher commodity prices and higher volatility are (in our view) a pretty normal pattern if that view is correct. Underneath all that sound and fury of the recent volatility spike, we think we\u2019re still dealing with a playbook with a reasonable amount of precedent. Inflation, after all, often plays a role in a late-cycle volatility rise,as there\u2019s tension between still-strong current conditions,and the effect of tightening (later). Meanwhile, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has spoken to the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Although tensions with Turkey are believed to have dominated discussions, last night\u2019s euro group also got a mention. Greek finance ministry officials have also revealed that they expect the country\u2019s next batch of bailout loans, the fourth tranche under the country\u2019s final bailout programme, to be released by the end of March at the latest. Of the \u20ac5.7bn total amount, \u20ac3.3bn will be used to cover debt financing needs, \u20ac500m will go towards repaying government obligations to the private sector while the remaining \u20ac1.9bn will be put towards the cash buffer Athens is currently building to cover post-bailout needs. \u201cHeadway is also being made on debt relief discussions,\u201d said one source adding that by March 1st plans will have been drawn up and presented to the Euro Working Group (advising euro area finance ministers) by technical teams visiting Athens. Greece came away empty handed from last night gathering of euro zone finance ministers. The Eurogroup concluded that Athens still hasn\u2019t hit all the targets to receive its next aid tranche. But despite that, the meeting wasn\u2019t all bad. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Though Greece failed to win the approval of fresh loans at the meeting, Mario Ceneco, the eurogroup chief, was fulsome in his praise for the country. Athens, he said, had made huge strides in implementing requisite reforms. The two \u2018prior actions\u2019 that had not been enforced \u2013 electronic auctions of foreclosed properties, a testy issue that the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is believed to have clashed over with ECB president Mario Draghi at the meeting and privatization of Athens\u2019 old international airport \u2013 were \u201coutside the control of the government\u201d. \u201cI am confident they can be cleared soon,\u201d Ceneco was quoted as saying. As soon as that happened creditors would give the green light for a new tranche worth \u20ac5.7bn to be disbursed. The EU\u2019s economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici was also generous with the plaudits saying everything must be done over the course of the next six months to allow Greece to successfully exit its final bailout programme. Both officials said discussion was already underway to restructure Athens\u2019 staggering debt load \u2013 at almost 180 percent by far the highest in the euro zone. Dent relief is considered vital if Greece is to recover from its worst economic crisis in modern times. Here\u2019s EY\u2019s Howard Archer on the slowdown in UK factory orders: The overall orders balance dipped to a 4-month low in February, although it remained appreciably above long-term norms. February\u2019s slowdown in orders seemed primarily due to a moderation in foreign demand after a very strong January performance. Domestic demand has also come off the peak levels seen in late-2017 The outlook for manufacturing looks bright on the foreign demand side, but domestic conditions could prove challenging over the coming months On the domestic demand front, still squeezed consumer purchasing power and business caution over investment amid significant uncertainties largely focused on Brexit are a challenging combination for manufacturers. This is being reinforced by increased prices for big-ticket consumer durable goods and capital goods. Newsflash: UK factory order growth slowed this month, according to the CBI\u2019s monthly \u2018industrial trends\u2019 survey. The CBI found that 30% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal in the last quarter, and 20% said they were below normal. That gives a net balance of +10 in the three months to February, down from +14 in January; the weakest growth since October. The balance of export orders fell more sharply, from +19 to +10 in February -- a sign that overseas demand for UK goods weakened this month. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, says manufacturers are still doing pretty well. She fears, though, that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU could hurt the sector. \u201cThis month saw another strong showing from UK manufacturers. Although order books weren\u2019t quite as buoyant as they were last month, demand remains strong and output grew briskly. \u201cWith the Brexit negotiations reaching a critical juncture, many businesses are concerned about future barriers to trade and are looking for clarity over the future relationship with the EU. Remaining in a comprehensive customs union will help alleviate some of those fears and give firms the confidence to invest and grow.\u201d As this chart shows, UK manufacturers have enjoyed a boost since the EU referendum (partly thanks to the slump in the pound, which make exports more competitive). The UK stock market has dipped into the red, dragged down by three heavyweight members. Mining giant BHP Billiton is leading the fallers, down over 4%, despite posting its best six-monthly profit figures since 2014 and raising its dividend. Reuters reckons traders aren\u2019t impressed by rising costs at the company. InterContinental Hotels shares are also down, around 4%, in spite of beating City forecasts for its profits in 2017. The company announced plans for a \u2018a new upscale conversion brand in 2018\u2019 - and is ruling out handing shareholders any \u201cadditional capital\u201d while it focuses on a new strategy to boost growth. The third laggard is HSBC - still down over 3% after missing profit forecasts this morning. Over in Frankfurt, the German DAX has also dipped into negative territory after this morning\u2019s ZEW confidence survey. Breaking: Economic confidence among German investors has fallen. The Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) reports that its monthly index of German economic expectations shrank by 2.6 points this month, to 17.8. Expectations for the eurozone, US, UK and Japanese economies also declined. Investors are also a little gloomier about current economic conditions in Germany -- this subindex fell by 2.9 this month to 92.3. Confidence may have been hit by the recent turbulence in the world\u2019s stock markets, and the struggle to form a German coalition government. ZEW president Professor Achim Wambach says the German economy still looks strong, though: \u201cThe latest survey results continue to show a positive outlook for the German economy. The assessment of the current economic situation is still on a very high level and the economy is expected to improve in the coming six months. Economic growth in Germany is substantially driven by the very good development of both the global economy and private consumption. Inflation expectations for Germany and the Eurozone have also started to increase.\u201d Here\u2019s more expert reaction: Hello.... The pound is suddenly rallying, shaking off its early losses. The recovery has been triggered by a report in Business Insider, saying that the European Parliament is drawing up a plan to give Britain \u201cprivileged\u201d access to the single market. If so, that would calm some of the worries about a hard Brexit. Here\u2019s the key points from the report: Exclusive: The European Parliament is preparing a \u201cdetailed,\u201d 60-paragraph resolution which will call for more flexibility in future relationship talks with Britain. The Parliament wants the EU to negotiate an \u2018association agreement\u2019 which could give Britain \u201cprivileged\u201d single market access and membership of EU agencies. The resolution marks a break from the position of the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. The Parliament\u2019s plans were revealed to British MPs during meetings in Brussels this week. More here. Here\u2019s some reaction to William Hill\u2019s money-laundering fine, from deputy Labour leader Tom Watson: My colleague Randeep Ramesh points out that he highlighted this problem back in 2013: UK betting company William Hill has been hit with a \u00a36.2m fine today, after accepting money linked to criminal activities. Gambling regulators imposed the penalty for failing to stick to Britain\u2019s anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. Angela Monaghan explains all: The Gambling Commission said that over the two years to August 2016, the company failed to spot obvious signs of problem gambling, and in doing so breached anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. It is the commission\u2019s second-largest penalty on record, after it fined the betting firm 888 \u00a37.8m last year for failing to protect vulnerable customers. The regulator said that as a result of failings by senior management and staff at William Hill, 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences, which resulted in financial gains for the group of around \u00a31.2m. Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, said there were clear warning signs of problem gambling in the spending patterns of some customers that William Hill should have picked up on. Over in the City, shares in banking giant HSBC have fallen by 4% in early trading. HSBC reported an 11% jump in adjusted pre-tax profits for the last year, to almost $21bn. That\u2019s below analyst expectations; not a great way for outgoing CEO Stuart Gulliver to sign off. Revenues grew 5%, as the bank benefits from the pick-up in global growth. Gulliver\u2019s replacement, John Flint, reckons he has \u201ca great platform to build on\u201d. Shareholders are less optimistic, knocking the bank\u2019s shares down 31p to 729p. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: HSBC has definitely pinned its flag to the Asian mast, with over three quarters of profits now coming from the far east. The long term appeal of this approach is clear, with the Asian middle class set to balloon by a staggering 2 billion people by 2050. However this approach comes with risks attached. The strength of HSBC\u2019s share price over the last two years has a lot to do with better than expected economic performance from China. That\u2019s all well and good, but this cuts both ways, and looking forward if China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold. In another sign of Brexit angst, City traders have been buying more insurance against the pound weakening. Bloomberg has spotted that protecting yourself against short-term sterling volatility is now more expensive than insuring against volatility for a whole year. It\u2019s usually the other way round. This suggests investors expect some twists, turns and pitfalls as the two sides try to hammer out a Brexit transition deal. Neil Jones of Mizuho Bank explains: \u201cBrexit politics is expected to be more certain in the longer term than in the short term.... [but the] market is leaning toward expecting an OK outcome. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the pound is suffering from \u201csome pre-David Davis Brexit speech jitters\u201d. Davis delivers his speech, in Austria, at around 9.30am UK time. That means you\u2019ve got time to read our profile of the man handling Britain\u2019s stickiest political challenge in generations: The pound is coming under some pressure this morning, as City traders fret about the state of the Brexit talks. Sterling has shed over half a cent against the US dollar, falling back below $1.40 to trade around $1.394. The pound had been rallying in recent weeks, driven by speculation that the Bank of England will hike borrowing costs. But investors haven\u2019t taken their eye off Brexit, and the risks of a \u2018hard\u2019 exit from the European Union. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the infighting within the government is hurting the pound. Whilst the BoE could look to raise interest rates as soon as Spring, this is being overshadowed by Brexit concerns or more specifically confusion from Theresa May\u2019s Brexit cabinet and uncertainties over the post Brexit transition period. As a result, demand for the pound remains limited. Today\u2019s losses come ahead of an eagerly-awaited speech from David Davis, secretary of state for leaving the EU. He\u2019ll pledge the Britain won\u2019t abandon workers rights and environmental concerns after Brexit. In a colourful twist, Davis is expected to promise that Britain won\u2019t turn into a Mad Max-style dysopia. That sort of talk might not calm nerves in the City..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are expected to open cautiously today, after a weak session in Asia. The Japanese and South Korean markets have both shed around 1%, with some profit taking after Monday\u2019s gains. Although the volatility has calmed down, there\u2019s still some anxiety out there, as David Madden of CMC Markets says: The herd mentality is always evident in the wake of a major sell-off as individuals like to feel they are part of the pack. The CBI will release a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector today, which might move the markets. There\u2019s also a fresh German economic confidence report. It may show that the recent stock market volatility, and the long coalition talks in Germany, have hit morale. On the corporate front, HSBC, BHP Billiton and Intercontinental Hotels are reporting results. The agenda: 10am GMT: The ZEW index of German economic confidence for February 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey for February 3pm GMT: The EC\u2019s Eurozone consumer confidence survey for February",

It used tax breaks designed to encourage films to be made in the UK. Those who put money into the scheme could claim tax relief against film production losses.</p> <p>Randell has admitted that he failed to sufficiently investigate the situation, when he was told by his financial advisor that HMRC had said the scheme was acceptable. He invested in the scheme between 2006 and 2011.</p> <p>He told the committee that it was an \u201cerror of judgement\u201d not to investigate these assurances.</p> <p>He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I take responsibility for the decision that I took.</p> <p>I was reassured to hear that this partnership had been discussed with senior policy officials at HMRC who had indicated that they approved of it.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear to me now that far from taking any comfort from that, I should have seen it as a warning signal because the mere fact that an informal assurance was seen to be necessary should have been telling me that this was an investment for which there wasn\u2019t a specific statutory framework. There wasn\u2019t a binding approval mechanism.</p> <p>And if HMRC did approve it in 2005, which I\u2019ve been told repeatedly is the case, then it was always open to them to change their mind - which they obviously did do.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Committee chair Nicky Morgan asks Randell if he could see that the Ingenious scheme would look, to the general public, like a \u201crather clever tax wheeze\u201d to let people pay less tax.</strong></p> <p>\u201cYes I can\u201d, Randell replied.<br></p> <p>He added that \u201cI dispensed with the services of my financial advisor\u201d after HMRC began taking action against the scheme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I conducted as best I could my own personal assessment of the situation.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "KFC was warned it would face delivery problems months ago, it has been claimed, as the company tries to grapple with a worsening chicken supply crisis that has forced almost half of its outlets to remain closed. The fast food chain said it expected disruption to some restaurants to continue for the rest of the week \u201cmeaning some will be closed and others operating with a reduced menu or shortened hours\u201d. About 420 KFC stores are currently shut after the company switched deliveries to a cheaper service, amid mounting consumer anger. An updated list showed that the number of open outlets rose to 450 by Tuesday afternoon after dropping to just 254. And for a second day KFC gave no indication of when operations would be back to normal. Police in Tower Hamlets, east London, urged the public not to waste officers\u2019 time by complaining about closed KFC stores. The GMB union said it had expressed major doubts about KFC\u2019s decision last October to switch its deliveries from the food delivery specialists Bidvest Logistics to DHL. Mick Rix, the GMB\u2019s national officer, said he told KFC that it could face a repeat of supply problems that had hit Burger King when it ditched Bidvest Logistics in favour of DHL six years ago. He said: \u201cWe warned them a few months ago. I wrote to KFC. I alluded to Burger King trying to cut costs and ending up with poorer quality service and poorer distribution. They had shortages, too, but not on the scale we\u2019re seeing now at KFC. Within six months they [Burger King] were pleading with Bidvest Logistics to take it back.\u201d Rix claimed KFC\u2019s current crisis stemmed from dropping a supply system based on six warehouses run by Bidvest to a system of one distribution centre in Rugby run by DHL. He said conditions at the Rugby warehouse were \u201can utter shambles\u201d. Rix added: \u201cThey took a lower tender with a load of promises that have not materialised. The system can\u2019t cope. My sources say KFC execs knew three weeks ago that there was a major problem with DHL. They were concerned about the set-up and the systems after testing. And some of the answers from DHL were completely strange and worrying. It was clear it was going to fall flat on its face.\u201d He urged KFC to go back to Bidvest to help resolve the problem, despite its decision to make 255 staff redundant since losing the KFC contract. Speaking en route to a meeting with Bidvest at its offices in Banbury, Rix said: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had redundancies at Bidvest before on this scale. Some of those staff would come back. It is the only way of resolving the problem.\u201d He added: \u201cDHL will not be able to provide the service they quoted for. Even if industry experts piled into that depot now to sort out the mess at Rugby, it would take weeks and even months to sort the problems out.\u201d \u201cWe think that with the dedicated professionals that are already there at Bidvest and with new people and new vehicles, you could have a good operation up and running within a couple of weeks.\u201d A KFC spokesperson said: \u201cWe feel for those who lost their jobs at Bidvest; the decision to change supplier wasn\u2019t taken lightly. DHL have estimated that winning the KFC contract and opening the new distribution centre has created 300 new jobs.\u201d Malory Davies, editor of the trade journal Logistics Manager, said KFC would have to resolve the crisis within days. \u201cFrankly, KFC can\u2019t afford for it to go on for more than a few days. They have a whole load of franchisees who will be getting very angry,\u201d he said. Davies added: \u201cThis one is going to be a case study for business schools for years to come, it is really major. It is entirely possible to service the UK market from one warehouse \u2013 lots of people do it \u2013 but a contract of this size would be more of a challenge.\u201d The technology analyst Chris Green said DHL and its software partner, Quick Service Logistics, appeared to have failed to properly match up data from KFC\u2019s ordering process to its new system. He said: \u201cIf you were one of KFC\u2019s 750 franchisees you could order your replacement chicken and other supplies and usually within about 24 hours a lorry from Bidvest would appear outside your store with what you needed. The stores were used to that kind of just-in-time ordering, and that\u2019s what\u2019s caught them out. \u201cIt is doing huge brand damage to KFC. The franchisee can\u2019t go off and buy chicken from a wholesaler. Their contracts with KFC prevents them from going to third parties. And KFC can\u2019t put its name on chicken it didn\u2019t supply. The franchisee and KFC have both got both hands tied behind their backs.\u201d",

An <a href=\"https://www.kfc.co.uk/crossed-the-road\">updated list</a> showed that the number of open outlets rose to 450 by Tuesday afternoon after dropping to just 254.

I wrote to KFC. I alluded to Burger King trying to cut costs and ending up with poorer quality service and poorer distribution. They had shortages, too, but not on the scale we\u2019re seeing now at KFC. Within six months they [Burger King] were pleading with Bidvest Logistics to take it back.\u201d</p> <p>Rix claimed KFC\u2019s current crisis stemmed from dropping a supply system based on six warehouses run by Bidvest to a system of one distribution centre in Rugby run by DHL. He said conditions at the Rugby warehouse were \u201can utter shambles\u201d.</p> <p>Rix added: \u201cThey took a lower tender with a load of promises that have not materialised. The system can\u2019t cope. My sources say KFC execs knew three weeks ago that there was a major problem with DHL. They were concerned about the set-up and the systems after testing. And some of the answers from DHL were completely strange and worrying. It was clear it was going to fall flat on its face.\u201d</p> <p>He urged KFC to go back to Bidvest to help resolve the problem, despite its decision to make 255 staff redundant since losing the KFC contract.</p> <p>Speaking en route to a meeting with Bidvest at its offices in Banbury, Rix said: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had redundancies at Bidvest before on this scale. Some of those staff would come back. It is the only way of resolving the problem.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cDHL will not be able to provide the service they quoted for. Even if industry experts piled into that depot now to sort out the mess at Rugby, it would take weeks and even months to sort the problems out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe think that with the dedicated professionals that are already there at Bidvest and with new people and new vehicles, you could have a good operation up and running within a couple of weeks.\u201d</p> <p>A KFC spokesperson said: \u201cWe feel for those who lost their jobs at Bidvest; the decision to change supplier wasn\u2019t taken lightly. DHL have estimated that winning the KFC contract and opening the new distribution centre has created 300 new jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Malory Davies, editor of the trade journal Logistics Manager, said KFC would have to resolve the crisis within days. \u201cFrankly, KFC can\u2019t afford for it to go on for more than a few days. They have a whole load of franchisees who will be getting very angry,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Davies added: \u201cThis one is going to be a case study for business schools for years to come, it is really major. It is entirely possible to service the UK market from one warehouse \u2013 lots of people do it \u2013 but a contract of this size would be more of a challenge.\u201d </p> <p>The technology analyst Chris Green said DHL and its software partner, Quick Service Logistics, appeared to have failed to properly match up data from KFC\u2019s ordering process to its new system. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIf you were one of KFC\u2019s 750 franchisees you could order your replacement chicken and other supplies and usually within about 24 hours a lorry from Bidvest would appear outside your store with what you needed. The stores were used to that kind of just-in-time ordering, and that\u2019s what\u2019s caught them out. </p> <p>\u201cIt is doing huge brand damage to KFC. The franchisee can\u2019t go off and buy chicken from a wholesaler. Their contracts with KFC prevents them from going to third parties. And KFC can\u2019t put its name on chicken it didn\u2019t supply. The franchisee and KFC have both got both hands tied behind their backs.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful\u201d treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details \u201cwidespread inappropriate treatment\u201d of small businesses by the bank\u2019s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in \u201cmaterial financial distress\u201d. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: \u201cThe findings in the report are disgraceful.\u201d \u201cThe overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them \u201cthat another GRG can\u2019t happen again.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: \u201cThis report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.\u201d The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS\u2019 specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was \u201cendemic\u201d and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did \u201cJust Hit Budget\u201d memo A memo entitled \u201cJust Hit Budget\u201d was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on \u201chow to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it\u201d. In a section headed \u201cRope\u201d the memo said: \u201cSometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what\u2019s coming when they fail to deliver.\u201d \u201cMissed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,\u201d staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: \u201cBasket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.\u201d On fees to be charged, staff were told: \u201cBe specific: avoid round number fees \u2013 \u00a35,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. \u00a35k sounds like you haven\u2019t.\u201d The FCA report concluded that the memo was \u201cindicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t take the p*ss\u201d When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: \u201cCan you go in and add your name and what you want ... It\u2019s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don\u2019t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: \u201cAt one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.\u201d Another customer complained of \u201ccynical and bullying tactics \u2026 which are frankly way out of order\u201d. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from \u00a3400,000 to \u00a32m, by using the \u201cKissinger school of negotiation\u201d. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included \u201cmimicry\u201d of a customer\u2019s foreign accent that the FCA deemed \u201cdisrepectful of the customers\u2019 nationality\u201d. The report\u2019s verdict \u201cThere was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,\u201d the report found. It described this treatment as both \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201cendemic\u201d, adding that GRG\u2019s behaviour had \u201cprofound impacts\u201d in some cases. The report\u2019s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered \u201cmaterial financial distress\u201d due to its treatment of them. While RBS \u201cdid not set out to engineer\u201d financial difficulty, the bank had a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called \u201cupside instruments\u201d to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. \u201cThis was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG\u2019s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,\u201d the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff \u201cwould take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,\u201d the report found. It warned this might place an \u201cotherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation\u201d. \u201cThere was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.\u201d Customers felt \u201cpoorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited\u201d and were met with a \u201cdismissive attitude\u201d when they complained. GRG\u2019s management \u201cwas aware (or should have been aware) of these issues\u201d. \u201cIt is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.\u201d How RBS responded RBS said it is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cThe report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,\u201d it said, though the most serious allegation \u2013 that staff \u201cdeliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank\u2019s profit \u2013 has been shown to be without foundation\u201d. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: \u201cThe culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bans around the world on single use plastic items such as carrier bags will dent growth in oil demand over the next two decades, according to BP. However, the UK-headquartered oil and gas firm said it still expects the global hunger for crude to grow for years and not peak until the late 2030s. Spencer Dale, the group\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cJust around the world you see increasing awareness of the environmental damage associated with plastics and different types of packaging of one form of another. \u201cIf you live in the UK that\u2019s clearly been an issue, but it\u2019s not just a UK-specific thing; you see it worldwide, for example China has changed some of its policies.\u201d Theresa May has branded plastic waste an environmental scourge, and MPs have called for charges on plastic bags to be extended to disposable coffee cups. Dale predicted such measures around the world could mean 2m barrels per day lower oil demand growth by 2040. But he said single use plastics were only about 15% of all non-combusted oil, which is used for petrochemicals, an industry that BP expects to be a big driver of global growth in crude demand. The company\u2019s energy outlook report, published on Tuesday, forecasts demand peaking at about 110m barrels per day between 2035 and 2040, up from around 97mb/d today. Much of the growth comes from rising prosperity in the developing world. But Dale said his position was that \u201cnobody knows when it\u2019s going to peak because small changes can shift it by five to 10 years\u201d. BP envisages demand plateauing rather than peaking and suddenly declining. Other experts and oil companies see demand peaking much earlier as governments\u2019 climate change policies and new technologies begin to bite; for instance, a Fitch report (pdf) says demand could peak in 2030 because of electric vehicles. BP also looked at the impact of a more stringent and global version of the bans on petrol and diesel cars that governments such as those in France and the UK have pledged by 2040 and that China is considering. Even with such a strong measure, the modelled effect would be limited on oil demand and emissions. The former would drop by 10mb/d, which is significant but not disastrous for oil firms if BP\u2019s prediction of 110mb/d of demand comes to pass. Emissions would be lower than without a ban, but still grow 7% by 2040 because of more vehicles on the road, a disastrous increase for meeting climate change goals. BP has almost doubled the amount of electric cars it expects in 2035 globally, up from 100m in last year\u2019s outlook to 180m now. By 2040, 320m of the world\u2019s 2bn cars will be electric, the firm thinks. But the company believes the advent of driverless cars, which are expected to overwhelmingly be electric, means battery-powered cars will be used more intensely than conventional ones, offsetting some of the emissions cuts they promise. BP also believes if there were more electric cars than expected, there would be fewer efficient combustion engine cars as a result. Asked what impact electric cars would have on curbing oil demand, Dale said: \u201cAlmost nothing.\u201d The economist said one of the big surprises of the past year had been the falling cost of renewables, and continued strong government policy support for them. \u201cMassively surprised by renewables again. We revised up renewables again,\u201d he said. The amount of power expected from renewable sources such as solar and wind is now expected to be 8 terawatt hours in 2035, up from the 5tWh predicted three years ago, and is the fifth year to be revised upward by BP. Critics noted that every year since the company\u2019s energy outlook was first published in 2011, it has forecast a slowing of renewables growth, only to be proved wrong every time. Dale said the impact of the US leaving the Paris climate agreement would be limited on carbon emission reductions, since most cuts are coming elsewhere, but the world was missing the leadership role that the US had played at climate talks under Barack Obama.",

Plastic is seen as a versatile, indispensable product, but the environmental impact is becoming more stark. Plastic is now so pervasive that recycling systems cannot keep up and the leakage into the environment is such that by 2050 plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish. Last year scientists found plastic fibres in tap water, and plastic has been found in the stomachs of sea creatures in the deepest part of the ocean. Most plastic waste ends up in landfill sites or leaks into the natural environment, where it is causing huge damage to eco-systems on land and sea, creating near permanent contamination. According to academics in the United States, by 2015, of all the plastic waste generated since the 1950s, only 9% has been recycled, with 12% incinerated and 79% accumulated in landfill sites or the environment.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why are the supermarkets under fire?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Producers of plastic include retailers, drinks companies and supermarkets. The Guardian revealed that supermarkets create more than half of the plastic waste in the household stream in the UK. But they refuse to reveal how much they put on to the streets and how much they pay towards recycling it. Supermarkets are under pressure to reduce their plastic packaging and campaigners argue they have the power to turn off the tap. Much of the packaging they sell to consumers is not recyclable: plastic film, black plastic trays, sleeves on drinks bottles and some coloured plastic. The Recycling Association and other experts believe supermarkets could do much more to make packaging 100% recyclable and reduce the use of plastic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who pays to clean up the waste?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. Producers and retailers pay the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the \u201cpolluter\u201d is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can shoppers do to help?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supermarkets are under pressure, not least from the prime minister, to create plastic-free aisles. A growing number of zero-waste shops are springing up and consumers are being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic.</p>\n    <p><b>Sandra Laville</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Spencer Dale, the group\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cJust around the world you see increasing awareness of the environmental damage associated with plastics and different types of packaging of one form of another. </p> \n<p>\u201cIf you live in the UK that\u2019s clearly been an issue, but it\u2019s not just a UK-specific thing; you see it worldwide, for example China has changed some of its policies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/10/theresa-may-proposes-plastic-free-supermarket-aisles-in-green-strategy\">has branded</a> plastic waste an environmental scourge, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/05/mps-25p-charge-takeaway-coffee-cups-possible-ban-environmental-audit-committee-report\">MPs have called</a> for charges on plastic bags to be extended to disposable coffee cups. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-20T12:00:59/embed.html\" data-alt=\"oil demand\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-20T12:00:59/embed.html\">oil demand</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Dale predicted such measures around the world could mean 2m barrels per day lower oil demand growth by 2040. </p> \n<p>But he said single use plastics were only about 15% of all non-combusted oil, which is used for petrochemicals, an industry that BP expects to be a big driver of global growth in crude demand.</p> \n<p>The company\u2019s energy outlook report, published on Tuesday, forecasts demand peaking at about 110m barrels per day between 2035 and 2040, up from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/\">around 97mb/d today</a>.

Pimlico Plumbers, which has lost at every stage of the legal dispute, has appealed to the UK\u2019s highest court to argue that those it sends out to repair leaking pipes and malfunctioning dishwashers are self-employed and not \u201cworkers\u201d. Workers do not enjoy the full range of employment protection rights given to full-time staff but are entitled to significant elements such as holiday pay. The supreme court\u2019s judgment, which is expected to be reserved, will set a clear precedent for other gig economy disputes such as that between the cab firm Uber and its drivers. The original claim was brought by Gary Smith, from Kent, who worked for Pimlico Plumbers for six years until 2011. He had a heart attack and claims that his request for three days a week was rejected, the Pimlico Plumbers van he rented was taken away and he was dismissed. Addressing the court, Thomas Linden QC, for Pimlico Plumbers, said not every contract to provide services implied entitlement to employment rights. Linden said he was not clear what Smith and his lawyers \u201cassert the law to be\u201d. They do not, he said, define what should be the correct test of who is a worker and who is a self-employed contractor.

The claimant\u2019s specialist skills placed him in a strong bargaining position, Linden told the court. Linden said Pimlico Plumbers disputed Smith\u2019s assertion that he was sacked because he wanted to work fewer days. The company had asked for details of his medical condition after he had a heart attack but only ever received a sick note, Linden said. \u201cThereafter the claimant did not seek work,\u201d Linden said. \u201c[Smith] was asserting that he could not work five days a week because he was self-employed.\u201d Smith was registered for VAT, paid tax on a self-employed basis and worked solely for Pimlico Plumbers during his time with the company.

      "bodyText": "Vodafone is testing technology to track and control drones to let authorities protect aircraft from accidents and terrorist attacks and stop incursions into \u201cno-fly zones\u201d such as prison and hospital airspace. The trial comes amid mounting concern from the security services that terrorists could use drones adapted to carry small but lethal explosives to attack targets. Drones have been used for criminal purposes, such as smuggling and delivering contraband to prisoners. Vodafone is trialling technology in Spain and Germany that would track commercial drones too small to be picked up on radar, in much the same way as air-traffic control systems work. Authorities and aviation regulators are scrambling to make the skies safe before widespread commercial drone use is expected to become operational across Europe from next year. In 2016, Amazon claimed its first successful UK delivery by drone \u2013 a TV streaming stick and bag of popcorn to a garden in Cambridge \u2013 with the US tech giant keen to expand its \u201cPrime Air\u201d service. Vodafone is working with the European Aviation Safety Agency, tasked with developing regulations to ensure commercial drones fly safely across Europe. \u201cThis will help to ensure the skies stay safe as drones become ubiquitous, everywhere,\u201d said Johan Wibergh, group chief technology officer at Vodafone. The system is not designed to monitor consumer drones but rather the larger classes being developed for commercial use. A preliminary trial by Vodafone last year in Seville, Spain, showed that its 4G network could be used to control a 2kg drone with a 1.3-metre wingspan. The technology would allow the real-time tracking of each drone, accurate to within 50 metres, by drone operators and authorised bodies such as air traffic control. It would also be possible to enable \u201cprotective geofencing\u201d, which would automatically make drones land or return to the operator when approaching an \u201cexclusion zone\u201d such as an airport or a prison. Authorities would also be able to override drone control. Vodafone hopes the technology will be ready for commercial use in 2019.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Betting group William Hill has been fined \u00a36.2m by the gambling industry regulator for failing to protect consumers and prevent money laundering. The Gambling Commission said that over the two years to August 2016, the company failed to spot obvious signs of problem gambling, and in doing so breached anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. It is the commission\u2019s second-largest penalty on record, after it fined the betting firm 888 \u00a37.8m last year for failing to protect vulnerable customers. The regulator said that as a result of failings by senior management and staff at William Hill\u2019s online operations, 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences, which resulted in financial gains for the group of around \u00a31.2m. Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, said there were clear warning signs of problem gambling in the spending patterns of some customers that William Hill should have picked up on. \u201cIn many respects, this wasn\u2019t properly resourced or staffed, so a lot of the checks weren\u2019t happening. People were potentially able to gamble money that was the proceeds of crime; in one case, money stolen from a local council,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThere were clear warning signs, the escalating amount of money that was being spent should have set off alarm bells.\u201d Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party and shadow culture secretary, accused the industry of \u201cturning a blind eye to dirty money\u201d. William Hill will pay \u00a35m for breaching regulations and a further \u00a31.2m for the money earned from the transactions with the 10 customers. The commission said if further failures relating to this case emerge, the firm will forfeit any money made from these transactions. Neil McArthur, executive director of the regulator, said the commission was prepared to use the full range of its powers to make gambling fairer and safer. \u201cThis was a systemic failing at William Hill which went on for nearly two years and today\u2019s penalty package \u2013 which could exceed \u00a36.2m \u2013 reflects the seriousness of the breaches. \u201cGambling businesses have a responsibility to ensure that they keep crime out of gambling and tackle problem gambling \u2013 and as part of that they must be constantly curious about where the money they are taking is coming from.\u201d The commission said that William Hill failed to adequately seek information about the source of their funds or establish whether they were problem gamblers. As part of its investigation, the commission found that one customer was allowed to deposit \u00a3541,000 over 14 months, after William Hill staff assumed his income could be \u00a3365,000 a year based on a verbal conversation and without further questioning. The customer was in fact earning around \u00a330,000 a year and was funding his gambling habit by stealing from his employer. The betting industry is currently awaiting the details of a government clampdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which are machines that allow customers to stake up to \u00a3100 every 20 seconds on digital casino games such as roulette. It is understood the government is considering tough curbs, potentially cutting maximum bets on the machines to \u00a32. Campaigners against FOBTs claim they are particularly addictive, clustered in deprived areas, and allow gamblers to rack up huge losses. William Hill will now appoint external auditors to review its anti-money laundering and social responsibility policies and procedures. Responding to the fine, William Hill\u2019s chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said: \u201cWilliam Hill has fully co-operated with the commission throughout this process, introducing new and improved policies and increased levels of resourcing. We have also committed to an independent process review and will work to implement any recommendations that emerge from that review. \u201cWe are fully committed to operating a sustainable business that properly identifies risk and better protects customers. We will continue to assist the commission and work with other operators to improve practices in the areas identified.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s influential internal environmental lobby group has called on the federal party to clarify its stance on the controversial Adani coalmine, a project it says is not in the national interest. The national convener of the Labor environment action network, Felicity Wade, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday the party needed to make a decision. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Labor to make its position on Adani clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Adani mine is not in the national interest and does not have broad community support. Digging up low-quality polluting coal isn\u2019t a winning strategy in a carbon-constrained global economy.\u201d Wade\u2019s intervention follows a signal from the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, on Monday that there was an ongoing role for coal in Australia, and a strong speech to the Sydney Institute by the opposition spokesman on climate change, Mark Butler, who said development of the Galilee basin was not in Australia\u2019s national interest because it would displace mining and jobs in existing coal regions, and would not help the world meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. Labor has been signalling publicly since the end of January a more hardline stance on the Adani project, and the party has been looking at a range of legal mechanisms that could be used to stop it. But the signalling, which has coincided with a byelection in Batman, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where Labor will face off with the Greens, has not yet resulted in the party adopting a concrete position on the project. The powerful mining union warned last week that Labor adopting a more hardline stance on Adani would trigger a divisive internal ALP debate on the future of the coal industry, and cost Labor political support in Queensland. Shorten is visiting Queensland coastal electorates this week armed with infrastructure announcements, and while on the ground in Townsville sent a clear message that Labor was not anti-coal or anti-mining. He said of the Adani project that it was highly unlikely to get finance, and the promised jobs associated with the project had not materialised. Shorten said his party\u2019s position on Adani was it \u201chas to stack up commercially and environmentally\u201d. Butler, who has been on the record opposing Adani for almost a year, gave a less hedged message on Monday night. He said developing the Carmichael mine would fly in the face of current market trends, where export volumes for thermal coal had been flat for several years, and would also be inconsistent with the International Energy Agency\u2019s advice \u201con what the world needs to do \u2026 to keep global warming well below two degrees\u201d. Wade acknowledged it was more difficult for Labor to adopt a definitive stance than it was for the Greens. \u201cUnlike for the Greens, for Labor all decisions have real world consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cThe grand gesture that destroys confidence in central and north Queensland and leads to the election of another Coalition government undermines climate action more fundamentally than the fate of any individual mine. \u201cIf Labor is to take the lead of the financial markets and oppose Adani, we must take decisive action to ensure genuine economic activity and jobs in north Queensland. \u201cAs Labor people we understand why economically vulnerable communities object to the sense that post-materialist elites in the south want to decide their futures. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Adani mine will be bad for the global climate.\u201d Wade said Labor should use the Adani decision to offer voters in Queensland a comprehensive regional development policy, and to overhaul the national environmental protection framework, which was sorely lacking. \u201cAs Labor struggles to work out how the Adani mine\u2019s problems can be dealt with through legislation, never has there been better proof of the need to revamp the laws and institutions charged with ensuring we get the trade-off between economy and environment right,\u201d she said. \u201cIdeally we get to a point where community confidence in the approvals process saves us from these politically divisive messes in which nobody wins.\u201d The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, has accused Labor of saying different things to different constituencies. \u201cIf Shorten came out today and said Labor would stop Adani from going ahead if they win next election, like Hawke did with Franklin Dam, the project is dead,\u201d Bandt said Tuesday. \u201cTime for clarity, Labor, not fence-sitting\u201d. Labor\u2019s candidate in Batman, Ged Kearney, told Guardian Australia Labor needs to be \u201csensitive to the communities\u201d in Queensland that are facing a jobs shortage. \u201cI think I have been really upfront about my view of Adani that \u2026 I sincerely don\u2019t think it stacks up, particularly financially,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I have learned at the ACTU is you can\u2019t just say, \u2018Stop something.\u2019 There\u2019s a whole complexity and a whole raft of social, economic and legal issues that has to be dealt with. It\u2019s a hard message. It\u2019s not a two-word slogan; it\u2019s a complex message.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Carillion\u2019s pension scheme trustees began urging the collapsed government contractor\u2019s \u201ccontemptuous\u201d directors to provide more money to plug a yawning deficit in 2010 but were repeatedly refused, it has been claimed. Letters released by MPs conducting an inquiry into Carillion also reveal that trustees asked the Pensions Regulator (TPR) in vain to force the company\u2019s directors to pump more money in. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said the evidence showed directors reserved tens of millions of pounds to pay dividends but \u201crefused to give an inch\u201d to improve the funding of 13 retirement schemes with nearly 30,000 members. Documents charting the pension negotiations reveal that: Trustees believed the schemes needed \u00a365m a year. Carillion directors made a \u201ctake or leave it\u201d offer of \u00a333.4m. The refusal to compromise led to an \u201cimpasse\u201d. Trustees wanted \u201cformal intervention\u201d from the regulator. TPR threatened to impose higher payments but did not. Evidence submitted to a joint inquiry by MPs on the business committee and the work and pensions committee detail concerns among Carillion\u2019s retirement scheme trustees stretching back to 2010. Trustees believed a contribution of \u00a335m a year was affordable in 2010, pointing to a \u201cbullish\u201d financial results statement by the company and a 12% increase in dividend payments to shareholders. But the company initially offered \u00a323m and refused to go above \u00a325m, which the trustees considered \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. \u201cThese letters suggest the Carillion directors were contemptuous of their pensions obligations,\u201d said Field. \u201cOver two successive 15 month negotiations, they refused to give an inch to the pension schemes. \u201cTheir private pleading that the company could not afford more was in stark contrast to the rosy picture \u2013 and bumper dividends \u2013 being presented to the outside world. Richard Adam, the longstanding finance director, has particular questions to answer.\u201d During a second round of pension contribution talks in 2013, trustees asked the company to pay in \u00a365m per year over 14 years to meet a deficit they estimated at \u00a3770m. But the request was met with a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d offer of \u00a333.4m a year over 15 years, with Carillion refusing to acknowledge that the deficit was any greater than \u00a3530m. The chairman of the trustees, Robin Ellison, wrote to TPR, in light of the firm\u2019s deteriorating cash flow, urging it to step in after Carillion rejected a compromise deal that would see it pay \u00a339m per year and agree to value the deficit at \u00a3605m. Since Carillion\u2019s collapse, Ellison has estimated the pension schemes\u2019 deficit at \u00a3990m. He told TPR that pensioners were \u201ctaking a disproportionate amount of risk\u201d under the company\u2019s proposals and complained that directors had made \u201cno move\u201d from their original offer. He wrote: \u201cTo conclude, to the great concern of the trustee, we believe we have now reached an impasse with the sponsor [Carillion] and believe no further progress will be made without the intervention of the Pensions Regulator.\u201d In evidence submitted to the inquiry, the under-fire regulator said it \u201cmade clear\u201d that it was prepared to impose a new payment regime but ultimately did not use its powers to do so. TPR, which will give evidence to the inquiry this week, insisted on Monday that its warnings eventually led to a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in pension contributions, without saying how much. Field, who has previously criticised the regulator for a perceived lack of action, aid: \u201cWith characteristic alacrity, the Pensions Regulator started its arduous process of chasing money down from Carillion a few days after it was formally announced there was no money left. I can only assume \u2013 and hope \u2013 they are going after some of those very generous bonuses [paid to directors].\u201d The Pension Protection Fund, the government\u2019s retirement scheme lifeboat, is expected to absorb a liability of about \u00a3900m, with members facing payout cuts of up to 15%. The row over pensions came as the government\u2019s Insolvency Service said a further 942 jobs would be saved and 152 more made redundant. It has now found new employment for 7,610 people, but redundancies have hit 1,141 and about 9,000 jobs are still hanging in the balance.",

Richard Adam, the longstanding finance director, has particular questions to answer.\u201d</p> <p>During a second round of pension contribution talks in 2013, trustees asked the company to pay in \u00a365m per year over 14 years to meet a deficit they estimated at \u00a3770m. </p> <p>But the request was met with a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d offer of \u00a333.4m a year over 15 years, with Carillion refusing to acknowledge that the deficit was any greater than \u00a3530m.</p> <p>The chairman of the trustees, Robin Ellison, wrote to TPR, in light of the firm\u2019s deteriorating cash flow, urging it to step in after Carillion rejected a compromise deal that would see it pay \u00a339m per year and agree to value the deficit at \u00a3605m. Since Carillion\u2019s collapse, Ellison has estimated the pension schemes\u2019 deficit at \u00a3990m.</p> <p>He told TPR that pensioners were \u201ctaking a disproportionate amount of risk\u201d under the company\u2019s proposals and complained that directors had made \u201cno move\u201d from their original offer.<br></p> <p>He wrote: \u201cTo conclude, to the great concern of the trustee, we believe we have now reached an impasse with the sponsor [Carillion] and believe no further progress will be made without the intervention of the Pensions Regulator.\u201d</p> <p>In evidence submitted to the inquiry, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/29/the-pensions-regulator-a-deficit-of-credibility\">under-fire regulator</a> said it \u201cmade clear\u201d that it was prepared to impose a new payment regime but ultimately did not use its powers to do so.<br></p> <p>TPR, which will give evidence to the inquiry this week, insisted on Monday that its warnings eventually led to a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in pension contributions, without saying how much.</p> <p>Field, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/29/carillion-mps-accuse-pensions-watchdog-of-failing-to-act\">previously criticised the regulator</a> for a perceived lack of action, aid: \u201cWith characteristic alacrity, the Pensions Regulator started its arduous process of chasing money down from Carillion a few days after it was formally announced there was no money left. I can only assume \u2013 and hope \u2013 they are going after some of those very generous bonuses [paid to directors].\u201d</p> <p>The Pension Protection Fund, the government\u2019s retirement scheme lifeboat, is expected to absorb a liability of about \u00a3900m, with members facing payout cuts of up to 15%.</p> <p>The row over pensions came as the government\u2019s Insolvency Service said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/19/carillion-job-losses-rises-above-1000\">a further 942 jobs</a> would be saved and 152 more made redundant.

      "bodyText": "Frank Field is right to castigate the directors of Carillion for being \u201ccontemptuous\u201d of their obligations to the company\u2019s pensioners. The picture of what happened in the pre-crash years is now reasonably clear: the directors, even as they were raising the dividend to shareholders year after year, made a corporate plea of poverty when talking to the pension trustees. The decision-making and the skewing of priorities were appalling. The deeper scandal, however, may be the fact that the Pensions Regulator had a front-row seat at the developing debacle and didn\u2019t once deploy its formal powers of intervention. The regulator\u2019s officials attended meetings between the company and the pension trustees but were not shocked into formal action until Carillion went bust, by which time there was no money left. Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the regulator, pleads in her letter to Field\u2019s committee that her organisation \u201cmade clear\u201d to both company and trustees that it was \u201cprepared to use\u201d its formal powers. And the regulator separately argues that those threats resulted in a \u201csignificant\u201d \u2013 but unquantified \u2013 increase in contributions. Sorry, but semi-threats and attempts to cajole just look too timid. The gap between what the trustees wanted in 2013 (\u00a365m a year of contributions over 14 years) and what the company was offering (\u00a333.4m a year) was enormous. It should have been a cue for the regulator to turn up the interventionist dial to the maximum, and roll out its section 231 powers to impose a schedule of pension contributions. The softly-softly approach may be explained by the passage in Titcomb\u2019s letter in which she points to the need \u2013 enshrined in statutory objective in 2014 \u2013 to take account of a sponsoring company\u2019s ability to invest in its business and grow. Well, yes, it\u2019s easy to agree that the politicians\u2019 commands made the regulator\u2019s job more difficult. But, come on, the legislation was not intended to be a blanket excuse to tread lightly in all circumstances. The regulator, as Field points out, has used its section 231 powers only once \u2013 an extraordinary statistic. Lack of regulatory resources may be one factor. Lack of ambition is surely another. Reckitt must prove worth of Mead deal before contemplating another For about 10 years until the end of 2016, Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s marketing machine ran with barely a splutter. In 2017, however, two things happened. First, as Monday\u2019s full-year results showed, like-for-like growth ground to a halt \u2013 revenues were flat. Second, the Dettol-to-Durex group paid the mighty sum of $18bn (\u00a313bn) to buy Mead Johnson\u2019s baby milk formula business. The purchase was clearly designed to address the growth problem and, up to a point, the chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, can claim it is delivering. The infant milk business is producing higher sales figures after nine quarters of contraction under the previous owner. Reckitt was full of explanations of how minor adjustments to packaging and presentation have worked a little magic. Fine, but the idea that all the hard work has been done, and that Reckitt can now contemplate another big deal, such as a bid for Pfizer\u2019s consumer products division, stretches credibility. Reckitt has owned the business for only six months, which is not long enough to make meaningful judgments about an adventure that was a major departure from the bolt-ons that were Reckitt\u2019s style during its golden run. The Pfizer unit \u2013 which was also caught GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s eye \u2013 could cost $15bn-plus. At that kind of money, shareholders would surely want solid proof that Reckitt\u2019s appetite for big deals isn\u2019t a distraction from the day-job of re-igniting the old business. A prediction that operating margins will rise at only a \u201cmoderate\u201d rate in the medium-term was vague and underwhelming. The shares, down 7% on Monday, have now fallen by a fifth from their peak last summer. The message should be simple to decipher: prove the worth of the Mead deal, and pay down more of the borrowings, before you contemplate another big acquisition. Time to tell us just what you think about bid for GKN, prime minister Let\u2019s hope somebody has remembered to tell Theresa May that hostile bids \u2013 like Melrose\u2019s \u00a37bn offer for GKN \u2013 run to a timetable. Asked again about the government\u2019s view of affairs at GKN, the prime minister trotted out the same \u201cwatching carefully\u201d line. Get on with it. Or, rather, stop watching and give an opinion. The deal could have implications for the UK manufacturing base, which is why the business secretary, Greg Clark, has met both sides. But most of the relevant facts are now on the table \u2013 the formal offer document has been published, and GKN has tabled its defence. Ministers must have observed everything they can hope to observe. Just tell us what you think.",
