Andrew Bailey also highlighted the debate about the speed at which banks are being required to hold more capital. Having urged banks to construct contingency plans for the break-up of the eurozone, the top banking regulator also reiterated that the \"biggest risk to stability that we face\" came from the euro area. He said: \"Whatever happens in the euro area, there is a cost of adjustment, and that, too, will act as a drag on the returns earned by banks, and in the worst scenario presents a clear threat to financial stability.\" Bailey is acting head of the body that is to become the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is to be set up in the Bank of England to oversee the industry after the resignation of Hector Sants. He has previously caused controversy by suggesting free banking, where current account customers in credit do not a pay a fee, was \"a myth\" \u2013 but goes a step further, raising the need for official intervention. He said free banking might encourage mis-selling of financial products because of the \"unclear picture\" of the price of banking, saying reform of the banking industry could not take place until \"we have a much better sense of what we are paying for and how we are paying\".

    "webTitle": "Retail figures plunge as frugal Britons postpone summer shopping trips", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The precarious state of the high street was underlined when official figures showed that last month saw the biggest plunge in spending for two years \u2013 and experts predicted that many more shops will go bust this year. Wet weather throughout April contributed to a worse-than-expected 2.3% fall in sales volumes. The grim headline figure was blamed on a sharp drop in demand for fuel after panic buying in March distorted the normal buying pattern, but the Office for National Statistics data also reflected a collapse in demand for clothing and shoes as the wettest April since records began saw frugal Britons postpone buying their new summer clothes. The biggest factor was demand for petrol and diesel tumbling 13.2%, the largest fall since the survey started in February 1996. March retail sales had been stronger than expected after Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude's advice that people fill up jerrycans to beat a possible fuel strike led to queues at petrol stations around the country, with the 2% rise buoyed by a 5.3% increase in demand for fuel. As a result, consumers had brought forward their fuel purchases from April, the ONS said, with some filling stations unable to restock sufficiently. Stripping out the impact of fuel, sales volumes were down 1%, the worst outcome in a nearly a year. Matt Piner, an analyst at Conlumino, said the rain \"undoubtedly played a role in keeping people away from the high streets\", but that the ongoing squeeze on household finances was the crux of \"anaemic spending\" levels that resulted in a more than 5% drop in clothing and footwear sales. With shopkeepers' fortunes tied to consumer spending, R3, the trade body for insolvency professionals, said that a poll of its members forecast that retail would suffer the highest rate of insolvencies of any sector this year due to the toxic cocktail of weak demand and a lack of credit. There have already been a series of casualties this year, including value fashion chain Peacocks, Game, and most recently Clinton Cards, where nearly 3,000 shop workers are losing their jobs. \"We have seen a number of big-name brands go bust very publicly,\" said R3 president Lee Manning. \"Our recent research shows that more retailers are experiencing the pressures caused by shrinking demand and consumer expenditure, compared with businesses in other sectors. Are we expecting a further bloodbath on the high street? We can't say for sure but we can expect a steady stream of insolvencies.\" The gloomy data coincided with a British Retail Consortium survey that showed Britain's high streets had suffered the biggest fall in visitor numbers since November 2009, with footfall in April down more than 12% on last year. On Tuesday, Marks &amp; Spencer reported a fall in annual profits and slashed its long-term sales and store opening targets. Its chief executive, Marc Bolland, blamed the setback on a \"challenging consumer backdrop\": \"The UK looks completely different than it did 18 months ago. The economy is not allowing us to grow much faster than we are doing today.\" With As rivals bombard customers with discounts, Bolland said canny shoppers were trawling the high street looking for the best deals. While consumer confidence continues to bump along the bottom, the Bank of England signalled that fresh action to boost Britain's recession-hit economy could be on the way. The minutes of a meeting of the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee held earlier this month revealed Threadneedle Street in \"wait and see\" mode. Only one member of the MPC, David Miles, voted for a fresh dose of money creation through quantitative easing \u2013 but the minutes record that for \"several members\" the decision was finely balanced. The minutes are likely to prompt City speculation that the Bank will respond to the International Monetary Fund's warning that it needs to do more to prevent the UK from being locked into a cycle of low growth and high unemployment. Action last month was ruled out because inflation has been coming down, but the drop in the annual increase in the cost of living from 3.5% to 3% in April and the intensification of the eurozone crisis has made further action from the Bank more likely. The minutes noted: \"The committee would continue to monitor the outlook each month and further monetary stimulus could be added if the outlook warranted it.\"",

There have already been a series of casualties this year, including value fashion chain Peacocks, Game, and most recently Clinton Cards, where nearly 3,000 shop workers are losing their jobs.</p> <p>\"We have seen a number of big-name brands go bust very publicly,\" said R3 president Lee Manning. \"Our recent research shows that more retailers are experiencing the pressures caused by shrinking demand and consumer expenditure, compared with businesses in other sectors. Are we expecting a further bloodbath on the high street? We can't say for sure but we can expect a steady stream of insolvencies.\"</p> <p>The gloomy data coincided with a British Retail Consortium survey that showed Britain's high streets had suffered the biggest fall in visitor numbers since November 2009, with footfall in April down more than 12% on last year. On Tuesday, Marks &amp; Spencer reported a fall in annual profits and slashed its long-term sales and store opening targets. Its chief executive, Marc Bolland, blamed the setback on a \"challenging consumer backdrop\": \"The UK looks completely different than it did 18 months ago. The economy is not allowing us to grow much faster than we are doing today.\" With As rivals bombard customers with discounts, Bolland said canny shoppers were trawling the high street looking for the best deals.</p> <p>While consumer confidence continues to bump along the bottom, the Bank of England signalled that fresh action to boost Britain's recession-hit economy could be on the way. The minutes of a meeting of the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee held earlier this month revealed Threadneedle Street in \"wait and see\" mode. Only one member of the MPC, David Miles, voted for a fresh dose of money creation through quantitative easing \u2013 but the minutes record that for \"several members\" the decision was finely balanced.</p> <p>The minutes are likely to prompt City speculation that the Bank will respond to the International Monetary Fund's warning that it needs to do more to prevent the UK from being locked into a cycle of low growth and high unemployment. Action last month was ruled out because inflation has been coming down, but the drop in the annual increase in the cost of living from 3.5% to 3% in April and the intensification of the eurozone crisis has made further action from the Bank more likely. The minutes noted: \"The committee would continue to monitor the outlook each month and further monetary stimulus could be added if the outlook warranted it.\"</p>",

As Europe's leaders prepared to meet in Brussels to discuss the crisis, Athens was forced to issue a formal denial of claims that the \"euro working group\" of member-country governments had been asked to set out how they would cope if Greece left the single currency. \"Such reports not only are false, but actually hinder the efforts of the Hellenic Republic to address its challenges at this critical juncture,\" the Greek government said in a written statement. The FTSE 100 index closed 136 points lower amid the nervous mood, at 5266, a fall of 2.5%. The French CAC lost 2.6%, and Germany's DAX shed 2.4%. Investors are watching nervously as the Greek electorate prepares for elections on 17 June, after an inconclusive poll left the balance of power in the hands of anti-austerity parties. Europe's leaders have urged the Greeks to see the upcoming poll as a referendum on euro membership; but the risk of Greece leaving is putting pressure on other vulnerable countries such as Italy and Spain. The Italian stock market index was down 3.7%, and the Spanish market was off 3.2%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones was down 161 points at 12,340 by mid-morning, a fall of 1.3%. A paper from Germany's Bundesbank spelling out the possible consequences if Greece fails to fulfil the promises of tough austerity measures made when it received its \u20ac130bn bailout earlier this year added to the sense of a looming crisis. \"When the euro system provided Greece with large amounts of liquidity, it trusted that the programmes would be implemented and thereby ultimately assumed considerable risks. In the light of the current situation, it should not significantly increase these risks,\" the Bundesbank said, suggesting that parliaments and governments of other member states should decide whether to offer any more help to Greece. Simon Derrick, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said: \"Everyone's going through the same basic process of saying, is anything going to happen before 17 June 17, and what are the possible outcomes on 17 June?\" He added that governments such as Germany and the Netherlands have shown an increasingly frustrated tone in recent weeks. \"You get the sense that they have been pushed as far as they could and they will not be pushed any farther.\" The sharp divide between healthy countries such as Germany and its stricken southern neighbours was underlined by an auction of German debt, which saw Berlin sell \u20ac4.6bn-worth of two-year bonds at a record low yield of 0.07%. That's less than the rate of inflation, so that buyers are accepting a negative real yield on their investment. Sony Kapoor, of Brussels-based thinktank Re-Define, said: \"The new record low negative real borrowing costs being enjoyed by Germany and other AAA-rated eurozone countries are less a reflection of their strength and more a symptom of investor desperation amid all the talk of a Greek exit.\" He added: \"As long as the new record highs being tested by German bonds are seen by some as a reflection of German economic strength, rather than as a sign of a eurozone in crisis, it will make a political solution harder.\"City analysts are holding out little hope that tonight's meeting will yield anything radical enough to staunch the crisis and ensure that the consequences of a Greek exit from the eurozone could be contained. Chris Beauchamp, of IG Index, said, \"today is the anniversary of the Defenestration of Prague in 1618, the start of the 30 Years' war. Frankly, it seems as if this crisis has been going on for 30 years...Hopes for today's EU summit have been well and truly chucked out of the window, as the Germans once again state their firm opposition to eurozone bonds as a means of solving the crisis. Berlin has ignored the pleas of the OECD, IMF and its allies in Paris and Rome, believing that such a solution would only worsen the spendthrift ways of their southern neighbours. \"There will probably be little progress at tonight's meeting,\" said analysts at Citi. \"It will probably require more pressure from the market and from deposit holders at periphery banks to agree on measures such as a likely euro-area-wide deposit guarantee scheme. In our view, broad-based common bond issuance is unlikely to take place any time soon. John Higgins, of Capital Economics, said, \"stock markets fell back sharply again on Wednesday and the euro came under further pressure as doubts grew that the evening's informal meeting of EU leaders in Brussels would do much to prevent an imminent exit of Greece from the euro-zone.\"",

      "bodyText": "Nationwide Building Society has written a third of all the new mortgages taken out this year as traditional lenders scaled back in the moribund housing market. As the country's largest building society announced a fall in profits for the year to 4 April to \u00a3203m from \u00a3307m, it also unveiled plans to move into the small business banking market next year, an area traditionally dominated by the big four clearing banks. The Swindon-based building society insisted that it had not relaxed its lending criteria as it admitted that its gross mortgage lending - the volume of new loans - was up 44% at a time when lending across the market was up 5%. Chris Rhodes, marketing director of Nationwide, also raised concerns about the calls by the International Monetary Fund for interest rates to be cut further from their historically low 0.5% as it would put further pressure on savers. It would also increase the bill - which hit \u00a3750m last year - for Nationwide to maintain the promise offered to half its 1.2 million mortgage customers to cap their base mortgage rate at 2% above the Bank of England's base rate. Rhodes insisted that the large market share being taken by Nationwide in mortgages would not put the lender under too much pressure as the \u00a318.4bn of gross lending it issued last year compared with the \u00a327bn it had written at its peak before the 2008 banking crisis. \"The biggest lenders have pulled back a bit,\" said Rhodes. \"Fundamentally the asset quality remains strong, there is no change in our pricing strategy and if anything we've been pricing up very slightly,\" he said. Its net mortgage lending - which deducts loans being repaid- was \u00a32.7bn, the equivalent to a 35.5% share of the market which has undergone a dramatic shift since the 2008. Pre-crisis, Nationwide's net lending was \u00a310.6bn. Ahead of the crisis Halifax would have sold one-in-four mortgages but now Lloyds Banking Group, which rescued the lender during the crisis, is accounting for one-in-five of new loans. Santander, owner of Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, is also scaling back its lending. Nationwide's lending to first time buyers is also up 9% with 24,000 customers helped onto the housing ladder for the first time. The society is also being affected by the scandal over mis-selling of payment protection insurance but Rhodes said its total charge of \u00a3103m was small in the context of the \u00a39bn bill incurred by the industry. Nationwide's bad debt charge was flat at \u00a3428m, comprising a 24% fall in the charge for retail lending but including a 41% rise in charges to cover impairments on commercial loans. Rhodes said this rise was the result of around 100 troubled large-size loans rather than the result of a sudden change across the sector. The society preferred to focus on a 10% rise in its underlying profits to \u00a3304m, which excluded, among other other things, a \u00a375m charge to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the bank levy and a \u00a335m change in the value of its own debt.",

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond, the chief executive of Barclays, knew he was facing a sceptical audience when he set \"citizenship\" as one of the his four priorities on taking the helm last year. \"We're not doing this as something that is 'this year's initiative',\" he said after his invitation-only citizenship day event on Wednesday. \"Judge us years from now \u2013 on the quality of our business, on our relationship with shareholders, our reputation. Most importantly, are we a better business and better citizens?\" To be fair, Barclays is not the only bank with reputational issues. The entire industry has been tarred with the same brush after the 2008 crisis. Any attempt to improve its image should be given a chance. The audience did not allow the bank to duck the controversy about pay \u2013 Diamond's \u00a317m earnings helped provoke one of the early rebellions during the shareholder spring \u2013 nor the embarrassing run-in with the tax authorities at the start of the year when the Treasury took the unusual step of introducing retrospective legislation to close down two tax avoidance schemes. But neither were there any concrete answers as to how Barclays would tackle the issues that seem to be at the heart of its battle to prove its \"citizenship\". Publishing a three-year plan, Barclays set out a three-pronged definition of how it defines citizenship: contributing to growth; the way it does business; and supporting the communities in which its operates. \"We recognise that we have a long way to go on our journey to restore trust and deliver our citizenship agenda,\" the bank said in the 14-page document published on Wednesday. There is now a formal subcommittee on the board tasked with overseeing citizenship, which involves pledges to provide \u00a3150bn of lending over the next three years, to raise \u00a32tn of financing for businesses and to lend \u00a350bn to small businesses. And among Diamond's citizenship themes is resolving the \"too big to fail\" issue, taking the taxpayer off the hook for any future bank catastrophe. This is laudable. Taxpayers cannot afford another bailout after the \u00a365bn pumped into Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group and the nationalisation of Northern Rock and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley. It also serves a purpose for Barclays: proving that banks no longer need a bailout might, just might, mean that mega-bonuses become less egregious to the taxpaying public \u2013 and push the \"citizenship\" agenda on to the back burner.",

Any attempt to improve its image should be given a chance.</p> <p>The audience did not allow the bank to duck the controversy about pay \u2013 Diamond's \u00a317m earnings helped provoke one of the early rebellions during the shareholder spring \u2013 nor the embarrassing run-in with the tax authorities at the start of the year when the Treasury took the unusual step of introducing retrospective legislation to close down two tax avoidance schemes.</p> <p>But neither were there any concrete answers as to how Barclays would tackle the issues that seem to be at the heart of its battle to prove its \"citizenship\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://reports.barclays.com/cr11/overview.html\" title=\"\">Publishing a three-year plan</a>, Barclays set out a three-pronged definition of how it defines citizenship: contributing to growth; the way it does business; and supporting the communities in which its operates.</p> <p>\"We recognise that we have a long way to go on our journey to restore trust and deliver our citizenship agenda,\" the bank said in the 14-page document published on Wednesday.</p> <p>There is now a formal subcommittee on the board tasked with overseeing citizenship, which involves pledges to provide \u00a3150bn of lending over the next three years, to raise \u00a32tn of financing for businesses and to lend \u00a350bn to small businesses.</p> <p>And among Diamond's citizenship themes is resolving the \"too big to fail\" issue, taking the taxpayer off the hook for any future bank catastrophe. This is laudable. Taxpayers cannot afford another bailout after the \u00a365bn pumped into Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group and the nationalisation of Northern Rock and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley.</p> <p>It also serves a purpose for Barclays: proving that banks no longer need a bailout might, just might, mean that mega-bonuses become less egregious to the taxpaying public \u2013 and push the \"citizenship\" agenda on to the back burner.</p>",

That is the struggle: to try to convince countries in Europe you need a more active monetary policy, European Central Bank stands behind the currency, and the structural reforms such as completing the single market.\" Cameron said by monetary activism he did not just mean quantitative easing, but also \"making sure all the monetary institutions of a bank are properly capitalised and properly working. Around Europe there is a lot of work to be done on that.\"",

He aims to capture the 'tragi-comedy' of the crisis, with cartoons that are 'often silly, fanciful but a whisker away from reality'. Tackling yields, credit default swaps and eurobonds in a cartoon isn't easy, he says, and his aim is to bring the crisis 'back down to earth'. He has clearly thrived on the twists and turns of the Greek crisis, playing on what he describes as the 'handy, accessible and familiar' classical myths and legends. And he has an  uncanny knack of anticipating events, imagining a return to the drachma last June \u2013 a fanciful idea at the time but now under serious consideration.

      "body": "<p>When the G8 major economies convened at Camp David last weekend, the continuing crisis of the euro, common currency of 17 European Union (EU) members, dominated the economic discussions. The agonies of Greece, badly divided in recent parliamentary elections, and forced to vote again on 17 June, were at the forefront.</p> <p>Growing popular support for Greek extremist parties, right and left, deeply concerns other EU members, especially if the hard-left Syriza party, now leading, prevails in the upcoming round. Syriza unequivocally rejects the tough fiscal measures the EU required, at German insistence, to bail Greece out from decades of profligate fiscal policy, and a Syriza-led government would cross all of Germany's declared red lines.</p> <p>Thus, the once-unthinkable prospect of Greece exiting the euro and returning to a national currency is now undergoing frantic contingency planning in Athens and Brussels.

      "bodyText": "When the G8 major economies convened at Camp David last weekend, the continuing crisis of the euro, common currency of 17 European Union (EU) members, dominated the economic discussions. The agonies of Greece, badly divided in recent parliamentary elections, and forced to vote again on 17 June, were at the forefront. Growing popular support for Greek extremist parties, right and left, deeply concerns other EU members, especially if the hard-left Syriza party, now leading, prevails in the upcoming round. Syriza unequivocally rejects the tough fiscal measures the EU required, at German insistence, to bail Greece out from decades of profligate fiscal policy, and a Syriza-led government would cross all of Germany's declared red lines. Thus, the once-unthinkable prospect of Greece exiting the euro and returning to a national currency is now undergoing frantic contingency planning in Athens and Brussels. Several EU leaders believe that disciplining Greece by expelling it from the eurozone will chasten other troubled EU economies, with overall EU stability quickly following Greece's departure. Iceland, for example, shows that devaluation can be precisely the medicine necessary for a major economic correction.
