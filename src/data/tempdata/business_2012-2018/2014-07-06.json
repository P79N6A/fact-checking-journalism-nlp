      "bodyText": "Green MEPs have accused Brussels of capitulating to demands from leading banks that want to cut the cost of their contribution to an EU safety net at the expense of large building societies and other mutual financial institutions. According to the MEPs, a backroom deal will allow banks to calculate their contribution to the European rescue fund based on their balance sheet rather than on a previously agreed scheme that gauges the level of risk banks take. The effect will be to force large building societies and mutuals to make contributions under the new European Banking Union rules while cutting the costs faced by banks involved in casino-style trading. Molly Scott Cato, South West Green MEP and Green party finance spokeswoman, said the European parliament had spent months debating the issue and agreed a scheme that would assess the risks posed by each bank and charge an annual fee for a Europe-wide bank insurance scheme. \"But in a sleight of hand this clear intention of lawmakers is about to be disregarded in the fine print of a so called 'delegated legal act' of the European Commission detailing the EU's Bank Resolution Directive,\" she said. \"In particular the Italian and Dutch governments, the European Central Bank and the European Commission are exerting pressure in the wrong direction, to protect exactly those banks whose risk-taking caused the [2008] crisis.\" The commission has outlined a \"simpler\" method of calculating the costs banks should face in a discussion document sent to each of the union's 28 countries. It is possible the new arrangements will force building societies and credit unions to pay into the rescue fund despite maintaining a low-risk profile. Scott Cato said: \"Current plans do not dig deep enough, they do not get to the root of the problem. They would see building societies bailing out Barclays and its ilk.\"",

      "bodyText": "Political uncertainty around next year's election and the prospect of a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU have become the biggest risks to business, according to a survey of executives at big companies. The latest poll of 112 chief financial officers by consultants Deloitte ranked those threats ahead of any impending interest rate rise and September's independence vote in Scotland. It showed, however, that overall concerns about economic and financial risk continued to fall. There was also further evidence that firms were becoming more confident about investing and expanding, with two-thirds of finance bosses saying now was a good time to take risks. The quarterly poll, which includes 31 FTSE 100 companies, showed that 45% of CFOs expected interest rates to be 1% in a year's time, up from their record low of 0.5% now. While some cited higher borrowing costs, a housing bubble and volatility in emerging markets as risks, the main concern was the political outlook. \"The macroeconomic worries that have acted as a drag on corporate activity have eased and the policy environment is more stable. But, with the general election less than a year away, uncertainties around political and policy risk have moved centre stage,\" said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. \"Nonetheless, UK corporates have shifted from balance-sheet repair to growth and business spending is emerging as a driver of the UK recovery. Cost control, debt reduction and building cash helped get business through the recession but the weight CFOs attach to such defensive strategies dropped to a four-year low in the second quarter.\" The large majority of CFOs expected their company's turnover to increase over the next 12 months. A net 93% \u2013 the difference between those forecasting a rise and those a fall \u2013 saw revenues rising, up from 57% this time last year. There were also upbeat signs for the jobs market, with a net 76% of CFOs predicting that hiring would pick up. The report is the latest in a string of upbeat surveys on the UK private sector, which have bolstered expectations in financial markets that the Bank of England will raise rates around the turn of the year. The Bank's monetary policy committee announces its latest rate decision on Thursday, but none of the economists in a Reuters poll forecast any move yet. \"No change in monetary policy is again expected at the Bank of England, but the speed with which the economy continues to grow, and unemployment fall, has led to increasing expectations that the first hike in interest rates will take place later this year and the policy debate looks likely to have intensified,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data specialists Markit.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EDF, which operates most of Britain's nuclear power stations, could be in line for an \u00a3800m windfall via a loophole in a government subsidy scheme aimed at keeping the lights on at times of peak demand. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, last week outlined his plan to pay power plants to be on standby from 2018 in an effort to deal with peak demand and the intermittency of wind power. Most industry experts assumed that the \"capacity market\" scheme \u2013 the cost of which will be passed to the consumer \u2013 was designed to ensure that the many gas-fired power stations threatened with closure would be kept open. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) now admits the scheme will be open to all forms of generation including nuclear, which has low operating costs and therefore could undercut its competitors in the auction to be run by the National Grid. The market is meant to start with that auction later this year although the ratings agency Moody's has warned it may be delayed if it is found to breach European commission rules on state aid. All but one of the UK's nuclear power plants are owned by the largely French state-owned EDF, whose UK atomic portfolio includes seven ageing plants due to be closed by 2024. Cornwall Energy, a power industry consultant, estimates that successful bids by EDF using all seven of its existing plants could be worth \u00a3223m in the 2018-19 financial year and \u00a3818m in total by 2023. Lawson Steele, a utility analyst with the investment bank Berenberg, described the potential for nuclear to take advantage of the scheme as a \"slight anomaly\". But an energy trader, who asked not to be named, said: \"This is a massive windfall for EDF. The cost to generate nuclear energy is low, so these plants are profitable, whereas gas-fired generation is marginal.\" EDF was unwilling to say whether it would participate in the capacity auctions, which will be run in December, with the power having to be made available from 2018. But a spokesman said: \"We understand that the capacity auction will be technology neutral and theoretically rules in nuclear power plants. \"We won't be giving any steer on what power plants we will be entering into the capacity auction until the pre-qualification period in August.\" If it is built, EDF's Hinkley Point C power plant will not be eligible for the capacity market as it will be subject to another, more generous subsidy scheme known as \"contracts for difference\" (CfD). Tory MP Tim Yeo, chairman of the energy and climate change select committee, was told about the decision to include nuclear power by the Guardian. He said he was surprised at the move. \"The capacity market is designed to provide flexibility and this is a rather perverse consequence of that. Decc seem to have rather a lot on their plate and they're quite an under-resourced team.\" The department said it was too early to predict who would win what in the future bidding. \"It is important to note that the capacity contracted in the capacity market will be determined by a competitive auction so it is not possible to say with certainty what proportions of each technologies will be procured.\" Tom Greatrex, the shadow energy minister, said the value of letting existing nuclear capacity take part in the auctions seemed dubious. \"Nuclear is a significant baseload power source, but is not flexible enough to be part of an efficient capacity market. There are, therefore, serious questions as to why Decc ministers have given nuclear power stations the green light to bid for capacity payments when they won't be able to add flexible capacity to the mix.\" Fellow Labour MP Alan Whitehead, who is a member of the energy and climate change select committee, wrote in a blog that the capacity market system was far too expensive and was five times more than a previous government plan to set up an emergency \"strategic reserve\". The capacity scheme is also too extensive, he wrote: \"It strikes me as rather like announcing that you are going to concrete over the Somerset levels to a height of six feet and then proclaim that a flood prevention strategy is now fully in place.\" In a report on the UK energy sector, Moody's predicted the European commission may determine that the design of the capacity payments scheme may have to be changed, triggering delays. Decc said that it remained confident that this would not happen.",

In her mission to create a waterless loo that uses no energy and turns the waste into a useable product, Gardiner has exhibited a bowl moulded from horse manure and monitored the activity of composting worms in her bathroom, turning \"poop\" into fertile soil, she said. Now, seven years after she embarked on her plan to revolutionise the \"most un-innovative part of anybody's house\", her Loowatt waterless toilet will be shown off to festival goers at Latitude in Suffolk this month It is the latest move in a project which has raised some \u00a32m in funding along the way including cash from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The key to the Loowatt system is a biodegradable lining that runs around the bowl. When the \"flush\" is triggered, the waste is pushed down into a cartridge beneath which, later emptied into a digester, provides the raw material that is broken down by microorganisms into biogas and fertiliser.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is early July 1914 and the financial markets are calm. Traders assume that the recent assassination in Sarajevo is a localised event that will have no lasting ramifications. There have been disturbances aplenty in the Balkans since the turn of the century and the expectation is that the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand will be, like all the others: a footnote in history. It was only later in the month, after Austria delivered its ultimatum to Serbia, that the markets woke up to the threat of a war involving the great European powers. Bond yields rose; there were fears that debts would go unpaid. The stock market in London closed in early August and did not reopen until early the following year. In Britain, the Bank of England and the Treasury managed to avert a full-scale panic but things were never quite the same again. Although nobody at the time was aware, the six weeks from Sarajevo to the outbreak of the first world war marked the end of the inaugural era of globalisation that had London and the gold standard at its heart. There had been occasional panics, some of them serious, but the international economic order seemed as stable and secure as the international balance of power. The next 30 years saw the end of the gold standard, the collapse of global trade, a marked reduction in migration flows, the rise of protectionism and the biggest depression the world has ever seen. Annual growth rates per person in the 12 biggest western European countries fell from 1.33% between 1870 and 1913 to 0.83% from 1913 to 1950. The decline could have been even more pronounced had it not been for technical progress. The first half of the 20th century saw the launch of innovative products \u2013 such as the motor car and the aeroplane \u2013 and the wider dissemination of advances pioneered in the second half of the 19th century \u2013 such as electricity and modern plumbing \u2013 that had the potential to boost growth by increasing productivity. But these innovations were only fully exploited once the right infrastructure was in place. That meant the physical infrastructure \u2013 the highways and the suburbs \u2013 and the financial architecture, including reform of the banks, the International Monetary Fund and the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system based on the dollar. Between 1950 and 1973 GDP per head in the 12 biggest western European nations increased by 3.93% a year on average. Roll forward 93 years from 1914. It's July 2007 and there have been a few tremors in the financial markets. A few hedge funds have hit problems with their investments in US sub-prime mortgages but most traders are blissfully unconcerned. The assumption is that any difficulties are localised, minor and soluble. There is nothing to suggest this will be any more serious than the peso crisis in Mexico, south-east Asia's meltdown, Russia's default or the bursting of the dotcom bubble. Again, the optimism was unfounded. When the financial markets froze up in early August 2007 it created the conditions for the near-collapse of the western banking system 13 months later. Certain conclusions can be drawn from these two incidents. We know far less than we think we do. In retrospect, it was obvious that the financial markets were in a highly fragile state in 2007, just as historians can find umpteen reasons why the assassination in Sarajevo led to war. Warning signs were ignored, with disastrous consequences. The foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey, was right with his famous 1914 warning: it was a long while before the lamps came back on again: more than three decades of war, slumps and rule by brutal regimes ensued before it could be said that the crisis was over. The after-effects of the 2007-08 crash also linger. The question is what happens next. The default assumption is that the global economy has had its near-death experience but is now on the mend. The financial system has been repaired, public debts are being reduced, the eurozone has been saved. Apart from the fact that most of us are a bit poorer than we were in 2007, life goes on as before. There has certainly been much less of a root-and-branch rethink of the prevailing economic model than there was after the first oil shock in 1973. There are, though, some who worry that 2007-08 was merely the warm-up act for an even bigger crisis, made all the more inevitable by the failure to embrace more radical reform. The former prime minister Gordon Brown is one concerned by the failure to understand that global problems \u2013 growth, financial stability, climate change \u2013 require global solutions. A second crisis would certainly make a long period of turbulence much more likely. What would emerge at the end of such a period? There are those who think the events of 2007-08 mark a watershed, the end of a period of phoney growth based on debt, over-exploitation of the planet and the last gasp of technologies approaching obsolescence. Larry Summers, a former US treasury secretary, says we may be facing secular stagnation. The US economist Robert Gordon says the new wave of technological advances, such as IT, are not nearly as significant in boosting productivity as the big advances of the late 19th and early 20th century \u2013 running water, electricity, the internal combustion engine. Gordon believes US growth could be as low as 0.2% a year by 2100. Gerard Lyons, once chief economist at Standard Chartered before becoming an adviser to London's mayor, Boris Johnson, has a rather more upbeat view. While not playing down the many risks \u2013 including growing inequality and climate change \u2013 Lyons argues in his new book, The Consolations of Economics, that the global economy could eventually emerge stronger from its recent travails. Lyons makes a strong case, and he has history on his side. The global economy has regenerated itself before and it can do so again. It is premature to say that the new wave of innovations will have less impact on productivity than those identified by Gordon as having a transformative role in the first half of the 20th century. It is certainly not too early to identify a reconfiguration of the global economic balance of power: with Asia, Africa and Latin America all becoming relatively stronger while Europe and North America become relatively weaker. But the lessons of the 1914-45 period are that this rebirth can be a long and painful process. And it will only happen if the fundamental weaknesses of the model are addressed. The mood now is like that of the 1920s \u2013 a hankering for the lost days of Edwardian summer. \u2022 The Consolations of Economics by Gerard Lyons; Faber &amp; Faber; \u00a316.99",

      "body": "<p>It is early July 1914 and the financial markets are calm. Traders assume that the recent assassination in Sarajevo is a localised event that will have no lasting ramifications. There have been disturbances aplenty in the Balkans since the turn of the century and the expectation is that the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand will be, like all the others: a footnote in history.</p> <p>It was only later in the month, after Austria delivered its ultimatum to Serbia, that the markets woke up to the threat of a war involving the great European powers. Bond yields rose; there were fears that debts would go unpaid. The stock market in London closed in early August and did not reopen until early the following year. In Britain, the Bank of England and the Treasury managed to avert a full-scale panic but things were never quite the same again.</p> <p>Although nobody at the time was aware, the six weeks from Sarajevo to the outbreak of the first world war marked the end of the inaugural era of globalisation that had London and the gold standard at its heart. There had been occasional panics, some of them serious, but the international economic order seemed as stable and secure as the international balance of power. The next 30 years saw the end of the gold standard, the collapse of global trade, a marked reduction in migration flows, the rise of protectionism and the biggest depression the world has ever seen. Annual growth rates per person in the 12 biggest western European countries fell from 1.33% between 1870 and 1913 to 0.83% from 1913 to 1950.</p> <p>The decline could have been even more pronounced had it not been for technical progress. The first half of the 20th century saw the launch of innovative products \u2013 such as the motor car and the aeroplane \u2013 and the wider dissemination of advances pioneered in the second half of the 19th century \u2013 such as electricity and modern plumbing \u2013 that had the potential to boost growth by increasing productivity.</p> <p>But these innovations were only fully exploited once the right infrastructure was in place. That meant the physical infrastructure \u2013 the highways and the suburbs \u2013 and the financial architecture, including reform of the banks, the International Monetary Fund and the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system based on the dollar. Between 1950 and 1973 GDP per head in the 12 biggest western European nations increased by 3.93% a year on average.</p> <p>Roll forward 93 years from 1914. It's July 2007 and there have been a few tremors in the financial markets. A few hedge funds have hit problems with their investments in US sub-prime mortgages but most traders are blissfully unconcerned. The assumption is that any difficulties are localised, minor and soluble. There is nothing to suggest this will be any more serious than the peso crisis in Mexico, south-east Asia's meltdown, Russia's default or the bursting of the dotcom bubble.</p> <p>Again, the optimism was unfounded. When the financial markets froze up in early August 2007 it created the conditions for the near-collapse of the western banking system 13 months later.</p> <p>Certain conclusions can be drawn from these two incidents.</p> <p>We know far less than we think we do. In retrospect, it was obvious that the financial markets were in a highly fragile state in 2007, just as historians can find umpteen reasons why the assassination in Sarajevo led to war. Warning signs were ignored, with disastrous consequences. The foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/artists-mark-first-world-war-centenary\" title=\"\">Sir Edward Grey, was right with his famous 1914 warning</a>: it was a long while before the lamps came back on again: more than three decades of war, slumps and rule by brutal regimes ensued before it could be said that the crisis was over.</p> <p>The after-effects of the 2007-08 crash also linger. The question is what happens next. The default assumption is that the global economy has had its near-death experience but is now on the mend. The financial system has been repaired, public debts are being reduced, the eurozone has been saved. Apart from the fact that most of us are a bit poorer than we were in 2007, life goes on as before. There has certainly been much less of a root-and-branch rethink of the prevailing economic model than there was after the first oil shock in 1973.</p> <p>There are, though, some who worry that 2007-08 was merely the warm-up act for an even bigger crisis, made all the more inevitable by the failure to embrace more radical reform. The former prime minister Gordon Brown is one concerned by the failure to understand that global problems \u2013 growth, financial stability, climate change \u2013 require global solutions. A second crisis would certainly make a long period of turbulence much more likely.</p> <p>What would emerge at the end of such a period? There are those who think the events of 2007-08 mark a watershed, the end of a period of phoney growth based on debt, over-exploitation of the planet and the last gasp of technologies approaching obsolescence. Larry Summers, a former US treasury secretary, says we may be facing secular stagnation. The US economist Robert Gordon says the new wave of technological advances, such as IT, are not nearly as significant in boosting productivity as the big advances of the late 19th and early 20th century \u2013 running water, electricity, the internal combustion engine. Gordon believes US growth could be as low as 0.2% a year by 2100.</p> <p>Gerard Lyons, once chief economist at Standard Chartered before becoming an adviser to London's mayor, Boris Johnson, has a rather more upbeat view. While not playing down the many risks \u2013 including growing inequality and climate change \u2013 Lyons argues in his new book,<a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/the-consolations-of-economics/9780571307784\" title=\"\"> The Consolations of Economics</a>, that the global economy could eventually emerge stronger from its recent travails.</p> <p>Lyons makes a strong case, and he has history on his side. The global economy has regenerated itself before and it can do so again. It is premature to say that the new wave of innovations will have less impact on productivity than those identified by Gordon as having a transformative role in the first half of the 20th century. It is certainly not too early to identify a reconfiguration of the global economic balance of power: with Asia, Africa and Latin America all becoming relatively stronger while Europe and North America become relatively weaker.</p> <p>But the lessons of the 1914-45 period are that this rebirth can be a long and painful process. And it will only happen if the fundamental weaknesses of the model are addressed. The mood now is like that of the 1920s \u2013 a hankering for the lost days of Edwardian summer.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Consolations of Economics by Gerard Lyons; Faber &amp; Faber; \u00a316.99</em></p>",
