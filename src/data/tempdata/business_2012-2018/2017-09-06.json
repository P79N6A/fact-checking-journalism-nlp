      "bodyText": "The popularity of British music abroad has hit a record high as artists including Adele, David Bowie and Coldplay brought in more than \u00a3350m from fans around the world last year. Sales of British music outside the UK surged 11% to a record \u00a3365m last year \u2013 the highest level since records began \u2013 spurred by the phenomenal growth in popularity of streaming music on services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer. UK music trade body the BPI does not break down who was the most popular British artist abroad in terms of sales of all of their music, including back catalogues, but Adele\u2019s 25 was the best-selling album by a UK artist in 2016. David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar, his last album released just before his death last year, ranked second with foreign fans. Bowie was the biggest-selling artist in the UK last year. The top five was rounded out by The Rolling Stones\u2019s Blues &amp; Lonesome, Coldplay\u2019s A Head Full of Dreams and Radiohead\u2019s A Moon Shaped Pool. The BPI said the value of British music exports \u2013 sales of CDs, vinyl, streaming and downloads of singles and albums \u2013 has rocketed by more than 72% since the start of the decade as legal streaming has replaced widespread piracy. \u201cMusic by brilliant British artists such as Ed Sheeran, Adele, David Bowie, Coldplay and Sam Smith is streamed and purchased the world over,\u201d said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the annual Brit Awards. \u201cThe global digital streaming market represents a huge new opportunity.\u201d Global streaming revenues need to grow by less than 10% this year to pass physical sales, which fell 8% to $5.4bn in 2016. Last year saw a 60% surge to $4.6bn. The BPI, which is to officially release the figures at its annual meeting on Thursday, said that British recording artists and labels made the most from their music overseas since it began keeping records at the turn of the century. Since 2000, the British record industry has made a total of \u00a34.4bn from the sale of music outside the UK. British music proved to be most popular in the USA, the world\u2019s biggest music market, followed by Germany, France, Australia and Canada. The BPI said that fast-emerging markets such as Asia, Turkey, India and South America were becoming increasingly significant in sales terms. However Japan is the only Asian market in a top 10 comprised of six European nations, Canada and the US and Australia. \u201cWith Britain leaving the European Union, the UK needs businesses that are true global superstars,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cGovernment can help seize the opportunity by making sure our artists can tour freely post-Brexit.\u201d Best-selling albums by British artists outside the UK in 2016 1.

      "bodyText": "It is amazing to recall that as recently as 2013, fund managers summoned the will to vote out a City grandee as chair of a major FTSE 100 company. He was Sir John Bond, who had been chairman of Xstrata and was due to assume the same position after the big mining merger with Glencore. Bond wasn\u2019t merely ousted, but humiliated as payback for the perceived botched handling of the Glencore deal. The majority against the man who had led HSBC for years and chaired Vodafone was 80%. This episode showed that very occasionally, the fund management industry\u2019s bark about the importance of sound boardroom governance is accompanied by bite. The survival of Keith Hellawell at Sports Direct demonstrates how rare these moments are. Hellawell escaped narrowly on Wednesday \u2013 his majority among independent shareholders was 53% \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to understand why. If Bond was deemed too weak to stand up to Glencore\u2019s chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, how on earth does Hellawell qualify as a credible counterweight to Sport Direct\u2019s Mike Ashley? The complaints against Hellawell are well known and extend far beyond the failure to honour a promise to commission an independent review of working practices. He tolerated a lack of a permanent finance director for three years, ran into rows over bonuses, sanctioned trading arrangements with members of Ashley\u2019s family and is seemingly happy with Sports Direct\u2019s baffling habit of buying stakes in other retailers. Maybe the Hellawell loyalists think he\u2019s just the chap to lead a FTSE 250 company, or are persuaded by the thin evidence of reform at Sports Direct. Or perhaps they argue that since Ashley owns 60% of the shares, rebellion would be futile. The rest of us will despair at the City\u2019s timidity on a high-profile governance issue. A few houses \u2013 Legal &amp; General, Standard Life Aberdeen, Hermes, Fidelity and Royal London \u2013 made their opposition to Hellawell public. Well done, but you lost. Maybe you should have shouted louder to generate more heat. When Bond was defenestrated, there was much talk of a \u201cshareholder spring\u201d \u2013 an investor uprising against greedy or incompetent boards. The name was always absurd and the notion overblown. Unlike last year, Hellawell had promised to quit if he was rejected by independent shareholders. But presented with an open goal, the City missed. The message sent by this result is that the club of institutions who take their stewardship responsibilities seriously is small and getting smaller. Berkeley pay bonanza attracts little protest The protests over Berkeley Group\u2019s pay practices were even limper, but as expected. There was a modest 16% vote against a report on the executives\u2019 combined \u00a392m windfall, barely changed from 13% last year. Berkeley long ago convinced fund managers that the executives deserve their yearly bonanza, \u00a329m for the chairman, Tony Pidgley, and \u00a328m for the chief executive, Rob Perrins, because the company is in the process of paying \u00a32.2bn in dividends over a decade. That target looked a stretch when it was set in the dark days of 2011, which is why shareholders gave a thumbs-up to the scheme. But the point about this incentive plan is that it rewards executives for factors entirely beyond their control. In the past six years, the housing market has drastically improved, especially in Berkeley\u2019s home patch of London and the south-east. Yes, the company runs an impressively slick operation, and Pidgley is an acknowledged maestro in reading the property breezes. But it is plainly true that personal rewards have been supercharged by lottery-like features. The door has been opened for executives in other feast-or-famine sectors to try their luck and demand jackpot incentives at the right moment in the cycle. RBS restructuring report must be published Nicky Morgan, the Treasury select committee chair, is right. Now the report into the alleged devious activities of Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s restructuring unit has leaked, there is little point in the Financial Conduct Authority continuing to sit on the document. It may as well publish the \u201cskilled persons report\u201d immediately. Any case for further delay evaporated with last week\u2019s leak to the BBC. As Morgan said, the FCA has no control over further disclosures and \u201cthe balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication\u201d. In practice, a few names and details may have to be left out (that\u2019s often the case with the FCA) but the main findings can surely be stated. Get on with it. The full tale of what happened in RBS\u2019s global restructuring unit is plainly a matter of public interest.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest GDP figures out on Wednesday provided some good news, with growth improved on the weak March quarter largely off the back of a jump in profits and government investment. While there are some small signs that the improved performance of economy is flowing through to workers in the form of more hours of work, the amount of wages going to workers continues to grow at very low levels. In the June quarter the economy grew by 0.8% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 a marked improvement on the 0.3% growth in the previous quarter. But even if the seasonally adjusted figure jumps around a bit, the trend growth of 0.7% is pretty decent \u2013 if not exactly stunning: The economy grew by 1.8% in the past 12 months in seasonally adjusted terms, although a slightly better 2.1% in the more stable trends figures. But even this growth, while better than 1.9% of last quarter, is a demonstration of what passes for good news nowadays. The June quarter marked the 19th consecutive quarter of annual GDP growth being below 3% \u2013 more than a year longer than the previous such low growth streak: The growth sees us in the middle of the pack for the June quarter among OECD nations, though rather more at the lower end in annual growth terms: But while the economy grew at a solid clip in the June quarter, the reasons for it paint a more mixed picture of how things are going. Nearly three quarters of the 0.8% quarterly growth is due to public investment \u2013 and a large proportion of that was due to the timing of the transfer of the recently completed Royal Adelaide hospital from the private sector. Take away the 0.64 percentage points of growth generated by \u201cstate and local government\u201d investment and suddenly the growth is looking pretty pathetic. After a good fortnight of the government lambasting the ALP and Bill Shorten for being \u201csocialists\u201d, it was rather ironic to hear the treasurer, Scott Morrison, boasting of the contribution of defence spending on economic growth. National government defence investment grew by 26% in the June quarter, which contributed another 0.1 percentage points to growth. But the purchase of the hospital also detracted from private investment. If we take away the effect of the purchase of the hospital, business investment actually contributed 0.1% points to growth: Exports also contributed 0.6 percentage points of growth in the quarter and household spending 0.4 percentage points \u2013 offsetting the ongoing decline in non-dwelling investment: Over the past year household spending has been the biggest driver by far on economic growth \u2013 contributing nearly two thirds of the entire growth of the economy. Generally this is not surprising \u2013 around 53% of our GDP is made up of household spending, but it is a bit odd given the annual growth of household spending remains very much subdued compared to the period before the GFC: That we have been able to keep spending going at those levels is due not to improvements in our wages but through us saving less. In June Australian households saved on average 4.6% of their disposable income \u2013 the lowest level since the start of the GFC and the 13th quarter in a row without a rise \u2013 a run not seen since the heady spending days of the mid 1980s: Households of course are having to reduce their savings because wages growth remains particularly pathetic. Oddly, in the past year there has been a nice uptick in the amount of hours worked, which normally results in improved wages growth, and yet wages growth has been falling. While nominal GDP grew at a very strong 7.6% (the best for six years), wages and salaries \u2013 which normally follow nominal GDP growth \u2013 grew in the past year by just 1.5% in trend terms: The reason for the disjoint is that while corporate profits account for just a quarter of GDP they contributed to 60% of the growth of nominal GDP in the past year. In the past year, corporations gross operating surplus (a proxy for profit) grew by 21.1% \u2013 the best result for nine years: It would seem the economy is massively out of whack \u2013 with profits not leading to wages growth. Profit growth and a quarterly or even annual increase does not necessarily lead to an increase in wage growth. Over time it does flow through, but it can take 3 years and so one hopes that this current boom in profits will in time lead to an increase in wages. One problem is that the past three years have featured very low profit growth, so even with the 21% growth of the past year, the gross operating surplus has only grown on average by 3% during that time. Unless the strong growth continues, it is unlikely that wages will improve: If you are looking for some positive signs, at least the growth of wages and salaries improved in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 up from 1.3% to 2.0% \u2013 but in the long term context it doesn\u2019t look like much of a corner being turned: The added wrinkle is that the big boom in corporate profits has come via a massive surge in export prices, with the terms of trade up 21% in the past year. Now that normally flows through into a big upturn in mining investment, and thus a demand for workers and in turn better wages. But the mining industry is currently in the production phase of its boom \u2013 and that is not a phase that needs a growth in jobs. The worry is the mining industry might continue to be a powerhouse of economic growth, but due to profits rather than investment, and thus the stronger profits won\u2019t lead to stronger wages. And so the economy continues to tick along due in part to exports, household spending and timely government investment. While exports should remain solid, the government investment is mostly a one-off. That means the ongoing strength of the economy comes down to household spending. Given the low wages, growth is dependent on people reducing their savings. That is hardly sustainable and why the government \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 will be hoping the good noises in parts of the economy soon begin to be echoed in our wages.

      "body": "<p>The latest GDP figures out on Wednesday provided some good news, with growth improved on the weak March quarter largely off the back of a jump in profits and government investment. While there are some small signs that the improved performance of economy is flowing through to workers in the form of more hours of work, the amount of wages going to workers continues to grow at very low levels. </p> <p>In the June quarter the economy grew by 0.8% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 a marked improvement on the 0.3% growth in the previous quarter. But even if the seasonally adjusted figure jumps around a bit, the trend growth of 0.7% is pretty decent \u2013 if not exactly stunning:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"quarterly growth graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MZu3D/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The economy grew by 1.8% in the past 12 months in seasonally adjusted terms, although a slightly better 2.1% in the more stable trends figures. But even this growth, while better than 1.9% of last quarter, is a demonstration of what passes for good news nowadays. </p> <p> The June quarter marked the 19th consecutive quarter of annual GDP growth being below 3% \u2013 more than a year longer than the previous such low growth streak:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual GDP growth graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xzToL/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>  </figure>  <p>The growth sees us in the middle of the pack for the June quarter among OECD nations, though rather more at the lower end in annual growth terms:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"OECD GDP growth graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lXULP/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while the economy grew at a solid clip in the June quarter, the reasons for it paint a more mixed picture of how things are going. </p> <p>Nearly three quarters of the 0.8% quarterly growth is due to public investment \u2013 and a large proportion of that was due to the timing of the transfer of the recently completed Royal Adelaide hospital from the private sector. Take away the 0.64 percentage points of growth generated by \u201cstate and local government\u201d investment and suddenly the growth is looking pretty pathetic. </p> <p>After a good fortnight of the government lambasting the ALP and Bill Shorten for being \u201csocialists\u201d, it was rather ironic to hear the treasurer, Scott Morrison, boasting of the contribution of defence spending on economic growth. National government defence investment grew by 26% in the June quarter, which contributed another 0.1 percentage points to growth.</p> <p>But the purchase of the hospital also detracted from private investment. If we take away the effect of the purchase of the hospital, business investment actually contributed 0.1% points to growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private business investment\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/InZjd/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Exports also contributed 0.6 percentage points of growth in the quarter and household spending 0.4 percentage points \u2013 offsetting the ongoing decline in non-dwelling investment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution to GDP growth graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fYZY7/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Over the past year household spending has been the biggest driver by far on economic growth \u2013 contributing nearly two thirds of the entire growth of the economy. Generally this is not surprising \u2013 around 53% of our GDP is made up of household spending, but it is a bit odd given the annual growth of household spending remains very much subdued compared to the period before the GFC:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Household consumption graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/quLTJ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That we have been able to keep spending going at those levels is due not to improvements in our wages but through us saving less. </p> <p>In June Australian households saved on average 4.6% of their disposable income \u2013 the lowest level since the start of the GFC and the 13th quarter in a row without a rise \u2013 a run not seen since the heady spending days of the mid 1980s: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Household savings ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NNaJx/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Households of course are having to reduce their savings because wages growth remains particularly pathetic. </p> <p>Oddly, in the past year there has been a nice uptick in the amount of hours worked, which normally results in improved wages growth, and yet wages growth has been falling. </p> <p>While nominal GDP grew at a very strong 7.6% (the best for six years), wages and salaries \u2013 which normally follow nominal GDP growth \u2013 grew in the past year by just 1.5% in trend terms:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Nominal GDP and wages and salaries\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/srsio/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The reason for the disjoint is that while corporate profits account for just a quarter of GDP they contributed to 60% of the growth of nominal GDP in the past year.</p> <p>In the past year, corporations gross operating surplus (a proxy for profit) grew by 21.1% \u2013 the best result for nine years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Corporate profit growth graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/m6NxF/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It would seem the economy is massively out of whack \u2013 with profits not leading to wages growth.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Deutsche Bank has issued a stark warning about the impact of technology, saying a \u201cbig number\u201d of his staff will lose their jobs as robots take over. John Cryan told an audience in Frankfurt: \u201cIn our bank we have people doing work like robots. Tomorrow we will have robots behaving like people. It doesn\u2019t matter if we as a bank will participate in these changes or not, it is going to happen.\u201d He also referred to accountants inside the bank who \u201cspend a lot of time basically being an abacus\u201d, who would also be replaced by machines. In remarks reported by German publication Handelsblatt at a conference in Frankfurt, Cryan added: \u201cThe sad truth for the banking industry is, we won\u2018t need as many people as today.\u201d Cryan, a Briton who took the helm of Deutsche in June 2015, is in the process of restructuring the bank, which employs 100,000 staff around the world. Cryan is the latest business leader to make predictions about the impact of automation on on banking roles. In 2015, the former chief executive of Barclays described how the industry was facing an \u201cUber\u201d moment, with hundreds of branches closing and a potential halving of the number of jobs in the sector. Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, has also warned that robots will be able to take on more work with up to 15m jobs in Britain at risk \u2013 not just from the low-skilled jobs traditionally impacted by machinery but also more skilled roles such as administrative, clerical and production tasks. Others though have been circumspect. Kallum Pickering, an analyst with Berenberg, has said: \u201cProducers will only automate if doing so is profitable. For profit to occur, producers need a market to sell to in the first place. Keeping this in mind helps to highlight the critical flaw of the argument: if robots replaced all workers, thereby creating mass unemployment, to whom would the producers sell?\u201d Cryan also said that automation might lead to an improvement in jobs. \u201cIf you take an accountant at the bank, a large part of their job is to produce numbers. It takes them three to four weeks to produce an account and then they move to the next one. Wouldn\u2019t it be great, if machines could produce those numbers in just a few hours? Then accountants could analyse the numbers, form valid opinions what those numbers mean and not just produce them,\u201d he said. Cryan also spelt out the opportunity for the Germany financial capital to benefit from Brexit, pointing out the city has the regulatory capability, law firms and consultants and an international airport to take business from London. \u201cThese are all arguments in favour of a move to the banks of the Main when faced with relocating from the banks of Thames,\u201d said Cryan. His colleagues have warned up to 4,000 of Deutsche\u2019s 9,000 roles in the UK could leave after Brexit. Cryan told the conference that Germany and Frankfurt had to decide how much they wanted to benefit from Brexit. \u201cFor months there have been discussions regarding which location is set to profit the most once London is no longer within the European Union. I cannot fully understand this debate because as I see it, the race had already been won before it even began,\u201d he said. While new finance jobs will be created in Dublin, Amsterdam and Paris \u2013 all vying for business leaving London \u2013 none of these have the infrastructure to take on the business. \u201cThere is only one European city which can fulfil these requirements and that city is Frankfurt,\u201d said Cryan. The choice was not between Dublin, Paris or Frankfurt but New York, Singapore or Frankfurt. \u201cWhat determines who gets what piece of the cake?\u201d said Cryan. It was not about changing laws or tax subsidies, he added. \u201cIn truth, it is its infrastructure that makes London unique in Europe. In this respect, this is where Germany needs to catch up if wants to take over a large share of the business performed in London.\u201d He said Frankfurt needed \u201cmore attractive, urban residential areas, enough international schools and a dozen additional theatres and a few hundred restaurants\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. The future of the US Federal Reserve has been thrown into fresh uncertainty after vice chair Stanley Fischer suddenly resigned. Fischer\u2019s early departure may help Trump to reshape the Fed, and could be a sign that chair Janet Yellen won\u2019t be reappointed next year. Canada\u2019s central bank has surprised the markets with its second interest rate rise in as many months. The BoC raised borrowing costs from 0.75% to 1%, citing the strengthening Canadian economy. Nicholas Wall, portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, says the BoC is showing its confidence in the business cycle. Canada has been experiencing a period of above-trend growth, underlined by 4.5% annualised GDP expansion in the second quarter, with more timely data suggesting that economic momentum remains strong. The BoC sees the composition of growth as broad-based and self-sustaining, despite some cooling in the housing market. This backdrop appears to have strengthened the central bank\u2019s view that the output gap has all but closed, meaning it was prepared to tighten policy despite core inflation running about 0.5% below its target.The move sent the Canadian dollar up by over 1.4% to a two-year high. Pressure is mounting on the European Central Bank to cut its bond-buying stimulus programme, following hard-hitting comments from Germany today. John Cryan, the head of Deutsche Bank, warned that \u2018cheap money\u2019 is fuelling financial bubbles, while finance minister Wolfgang Schauble said policy should be normalised as the European economy has recovered. Something for the ECB to chew on tonight, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s policy meeting.... In the UK, the chairman of Sports Direct has clung onto his job. Only 45% of shareholders opposed Keith Hellawell\u2019s re-election, despite City concerns over the way the retailer operates. The day began with a surprise fall in German factory orders. They fell by 0.3% in July, due to falling demand from domestic customers and other eurozone members. It may be a sign that the German economy slowed over the summer. European stock markets have ended the day in a mixed position; Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 lost 18 points, or 0.25%, but there were gains in Germany, France and Italy. Chris Beauchamp of IG sums up the day: It seems clear that risk appetite is struggling to gain a foothold as the market deals with hurricanes, North Korea, administrative struggles in Washington and the surprise resignation of the deputy Fed chair. Flight to safety in government bonds has driven yields lower, and when combined with yesterday\u2019s dovish comments from Fed policymaker Brainard, the result has been to put severe pressure on bank stocks. A rate hike from the Bank of Canada has provided the \u2018move of the day\u2019 as the USDCAD exchange rates slumps to its lowest level in over two years. Having been the poster-boy for tighter policy earlier in the year, the Fed is losing ground to others. This week\u2019s ECB meeting will give us clues as to whether Draghi is about to burnish the ECB\u2019s hawkish credentials. And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Intriguingly, Stanley Fischer\u2019s resignation comes a few weeks after he criticised efforts to roll back financial regulations. He told the FT that there are worrying signs of a return to the status quo that preceded the financial crisis of 2008. Fischer said: \u201cIt took almost 80 years after 1930 to have another financial crisis that could have been of that magnitude. And now after 10 years everybody wants to go back to a status quo before the great financial crisis. And I find that really, extremely dangerous and extremely short-sighted. \u201cOne can understand the political dynamics of this thing, but one cannot understand why grown intelligent people reach the conclusion that [you should] get rid of all the things you have put in place in the last 10 years.\u201d The US dollar has hit an eight-day low following Fischer\u2019s resignation, and the Canadian rate hike. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has paid Stanley Fischer a rather lovely tribute: \u201cIt has been an extraordinary privilege \u2013 and exceptionally good fortune \u2013 for me to have worked closely with Stan Fischer. The combination of his encyclopaedic knowledge of economics, outstanding judgment, quiet leadership and his perennial good humour has helped policymakers around the world to navigate one of the most challenging periods in the global economy. In the years ahead, students and practitioners of macroeconomic policy will continue to draw inspiration from Stan\u2019s contributions at the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Israel, his earlier stellar career at the IMF and his many and varied academic contributions\u201d. Stanley Fischer\u2019s resignation has sent a ripple of excitement through the financial markets. Johan Javeus, chief strategist at SEB Group, says Fischer\u2019s replacement will be significant for monetary policy: Danske Bank points out that the vacancies are piling up at the Fed..... This is from investor Axel Merk. Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal points out how influential Fischer has been during his long career: Newsflash! Stanley Fischer, the vice chair of America\u2019s Federal Reserve central bank, has tendered his resignation. In an unexpected move, Fischer will leave the Fed in mid-October. His term officially expired next June. Fischer cites \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d, in a letter to president Donald Trump. He also says it has been a \u201cgreat pleasure\u201d to serve alongside chair Janet Yellen. Fischer\u2019s decision means that he certainly won\u2019t be succeeding Yellen when her term ends next year (not that this was very likely....). It also gives Trump more control over the Fed, as a new vice chair must now be appointed. Fischer is a highly respected economist and central banker. He\u2019s previously served as chief economist of the World Bank, and governor of the Bank of Israel. Here\u2019s Dutch Bank ING\u2019s snap take: With back to back 25bp rate hikes, the Bank of Canada has fully reversed the 2015 policy easing that was spurred by the downturn in commodity prices. How quickly times change. It was just three months ago the Bank\u2019s officials were sounding relaxed about the monetary policy stance, suggesting that there was no hurry to raise rates. But a swift change of tone was followed by a July rate hike and they have now decided to follow up with a further 25bp hike, taking the policy rate back to 1%. ING expect the BoC will leave rates on hold until the end of the year, and raise them twice in 2018. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s explanation of today\u2019s Canadian rate hike: The Bank of Canada is trying to strike a balance between bringing interest rates up to more normal levels amid the strongest growth spurt in more than a decade, and acknowledging the persistence of low inflation and subdued wage pressures. It may also be attempting to restrain market expectations it will get too far ahead of the Federal Reserve. Futures trading suggests investors were anticipating -- before Wednesday\u2019s rate decision -- as many as three hikes from the Bank of Canada by the end of 2018, versus one more for the Federal Reserve. The Canadian \u2018loonie\u2019 (so named for the bird that adorns the coin) surged by 1.5% against the US dollar after the rate hike was announced. It hit a high of C$1.2134 against the US dollar, from C$1.241. This is the second Canadian interest rate rate in under two months, and comes after Canada posted its strongest growth in 17 years. In a statement, the Bank of Canada says: \u201cRecent economic data have been stronger than expected, supporting the bank\u2019s view that growth in Canada is becoming more broadly based and self-sustaining.\u201d That growth is broad-based, the BoC adds. It cites \u201crobust\u201d consumer spending, \u201csolid\u201d job and income growth, and \u201cwidespread strength\u201d in exports. But...it could send a shiver though the Canadian housing market. After a long boom, there are signs that the sector is now cooling. In Toronto, prices have fallen by a fifth since April, according to a new survey. Boom! Canada\u2019s central bank has voted to hike interest rates to 1%, from 0.75%. It\u2019s a surprise move, which has sent the \u2018Loonie\u2019, or Canadian dollar, soaring against the US. The BoC says it is withdrawing some of its \u2018considerable\u2019 stimulus, due to Canada\u2019s stronger than expected economic performance recently. Given Canada\u2019s economy is growing strongly, and house prices have accelerated, there are decent arguments for an interest rate hike. But still, this is a surprise to investors. It will also bring pain to borrowers. In a statement, the BoC says it will pay close attention to the \u201csensitivity\u201d of the economy to higher interest rates given \u201celevated\u201d household indebtedness. Over in America, the trade gap has widened slightly, and the deficit with China has hit an 11-month high. The Commerce Department has reported that the difference between US imports and exports rose by 0.3% in July to $43.7bn, from June\u2019s $43.5bn. That\u2019s a smaller rise than expected, with exports dropping by 0.3% and imports by 0.2%. The politically sensitive US-China trade deficit climbed by 3.0% to $33.6 billion in July, the highest level since August 2016. That might normally attract fresh criticism from Donald Trump, but he may be too busy handling North Korea and a stream of hurricanes..... Despite this pressure from Germany, the European Central Bank will be reluctant to trim its bond purchase programme at tomorrow\u2019s meeting. But....waiting too long has its own dangers, and could allow the \u2018bubbles\u2019 which John Cryan warned about to get even larger. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at FOREX.com argues that the ECB should take a decision on QE this week, so the markets know what will happen beyond 2017. He writes: In July, the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said that the Governing Council would discuss the future of its \u20ac60 billion monthly purchases programme in the autumn. Technically, autumn in the Northern Hemisphere will not start until Friday September 22, so there is a possibility that the topic of QE tapering may not be discussed at this week\u2019s meeting. However, many analysts reckon that an announcement would be made a bit early at this meeting because it coincides with the new ECB staff forecasts. There are a number of reasons why the ECB would want to reduce QE purchases, not least because of bond scarcity. But more importantly, the consequences of acting too late could be very damaging as inflation could spiral out of control. Sky News\u2019s Ian King has a good explanation of why the ECB is under fire from Germany\u2019s finance minister, and one of its top bankers, today: Pressure is building on the European Central Bank (ECB) to bring Quantitative Easing (QE) to an end - with one of the eurozone\u2019s most prominent bankers today adding to the calls. In an attempt to stimulate demand in the single currency area, the ECB began buying assets in March 2015 at the rate of \u20ac60bn per month, paying for it with newly-created electronic money. It raised its purchases to \u20ac80bn per month in March last year before bringing the figure back down to \u20ac60bn in March this year. At the time the ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, pledged to continue the programme until the end of 2017. However, with the eurozone now enjoying solid growth in most countries and the ECB having bought more than \u20ac2tn worth of assets, there are growing calls for the programme to be wound up early on the grounds that the job has been done.

Around 53.2% of independent shareholders backed Keith Hellawell\u2019s reappointment, with 46.7% opposing it. That\u2019s a narrow result, and even narrower if you note that some shareholders abstained. This vote doesn\u2019t include Mike Ashley\u2019s large stake in SPD (last year - Ashley used his vote to save Hellawell from a rebellion). Presumably Hellawell (a former chief constable of West Yorkshire and government drugs tsar) will now carry on at Sports Direct, despite City concerns over its corporate governance. Britain\u2019s employers have been falling over each other to criticise the government\u2019s leaked immigration plans. The proposals, reported by the Guardian yesterday, would dramatically cut the number of low-skilled migrants after Brexit by only allowing them to stay for two years. The Food and Drink industry has warned of a \u2018catastrophe\u2019, with firms unable to fill posts, while the CBI has called for an \u2018open but managed\u2019 migration system. More here: Over in parliament, Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn has asked prime minister Theresa May to condemn Sports Direct\u2019s failure to end zero hours contracts. She rather ducked the question, though, pointing out that the Conservatives have taken action against unfair use of zero hours contracts in the past. More here: Sports Direct\u2019s AGM has wrapped up - now we wait for the results of the shareholder vote. Crucially, chairman Keith Hellawell has promised to step down if a majority of investors don\u2019t back him today. Heads-up! Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has backed John Cryan\u2019s call for an interest rate hike in the eurozone. Speaking (via satellite) at the banking conference in Frankfurt, Sch\u00e4uble took another swipe at the current ultra-loose monetary policy. He urged the European Central Bank to \u201cnormalise\u201d policy as soon as possible - ie, end its money-printing QE programme and raise borrowing costs. Sch\u00e4uble said: Unusual monetary policy implies it is not usual or normal \u2014 we should get back to a normal monetary policy. We have come back to a normal situation much quicker than people thought. This isn\u2019t the first time that Germany\u2019s finance minister has fired a broadside at the ECB, and its president Mario Draghi. But it does put a little more pressure on the ECB\u2019s governing council ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Could it embolden hawkish members to push to tighten policy? City economists are divided on whether the ECB will make a decision to curb its bond-buying programme this month, or delay until October. So it will certainly be an exciting meeting.... We have another no-show at the Sports Direct AGM -- senior independent director Simon Bentley. So chairman Keith Hellawell has faced the music alone -- and rejected a call for an independent review of SPD\u2019s work practices John Cryan has also warned that many bank jobs will be lost as the industry embraces automation. The FT\u2019s Laura Noonan has the details: Alas, Sports Direct founder and chief executive Mike Ashley isn\u2019t gracing today\u2019s AGM with his presence. That\u2019s not against the rules -- handling the shareholders is the responsibility of the chairman. SPD has blamed \u201cconflicting demands\u201d on Ashley\u2019s time.... Deutsche Bank\u2019s John Cryan also took a swipe at the ECB\u2019s policy of charging negative interest rates on commercial bank deposits. This policy was introduced in Jun 2014; Cryan argues that it\u2019s gone on quite long enough, saying: \u201cIt can\u2019t be forever that deposit taking is a loss making\u2026 for banks.\u201d Over in Derbyshire, unions are protesting outside Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters ahead of today\u2019s shareholder AGM. They\u2019re pointing out that SPD hasn\u2019t delivered on the promises made after its \u2018Victorian\u2019 working practices were revealed. My colleague Sarah Butler is there, and tweeted these photos: One of Europe\u2019s top bankers has urged policymakers to end the era of \u2018cheap money\u2019 and start raising interest rates. John Cryan, CEO of Deutsche Bank, warned that the European Central Bank is helping to fuel a dangerous bubble in the financial markets. He wants the ECB to tighten policy now; it is currently pumping \u20ac60bn of new money into the economy each month, and hitting banks with negative interest rates to encourage them to offer credit. Speaking to fellow bankers in Frankfurt this morning, Cryan declared: \u201cThe era of cheap money in Europe should come to an end - despite the strong euro.\u201d This cheap money is driving asset prices to unsustainable levels, he added: We are now seeing signs of bubbles in more and more parts of the capital market. As this chart shows, the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has swelled to record levels thanks to its bond-purchase programme. That QE programme has also driven bond prices to record highs. Cryan\u2019s intervention comes a day before the EBC\u2019s governing council sets monetary policy. Economists expect the ECB to hold off tightening policy until October. He also argued that City banks who quit London because of Brexit should head to Germany, as: \u201cThere is only one European city which can fulfil these requirements and that city is Frankfurt.\u201d City traders are \u201con edge\u201d due to the North Korean crisis, says David Madden of CMC Markets. Investors aren\u2019t running scared, but they are a touch on the nervous side, and while the situation keeps rumbling on, dealers could be reluctant to start a fresh round of buying. Russian president Valdimir Putin has now weighed in, saying fresh sanctions aren\u2019t the answer and would only \u201cpush Pyongyang into a corner\u201d. Now this is more encouraging. German shoppers boosted their spending in August, suggesting that consumer confidence is still robust. The monthly Retail PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, jumped to 53.0 last month from 50.7 in July. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as Germany\u2019s weak factory orders and the North Korean crisis worry investors. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has lost 25 points, or 0.33%, with similar falls in France and Germany following the selloff in Asia. Fears that Pyongyang could be preparing another missile test are pushing shares down, and keeping gold near a one-year high. North Korean ambassador Han Tae Song added to concerns yesterday, by warning that the US could receive \u201cmore gift packages\u201d. European bank shares are leading the selloff, reflecting caution ahead of tomorrow\u2019s European Central Bank policy meeting. Attention, travellers! Budget airline Ryanair has shaken up its luggage policy in a bid to deter customers from taking two bags onto their flight. Angela Monaghan explains: Ryanair customers will have to pay \u00a35 for priority boarding from 1 November if they want to carry a wheelie bag on board, as the airline attempts to reduce boarding and flight delays caused by a shortage of overhead cabin space. Priority boarders will still be able to carry on two bags, but all other passengers will only be allowed to take one smaller bag on board the aircraft. A second, larger, wheelie bag will have to be placed in the hold free of charge at the boarding gate, to be collected at baggage reclaim on arrival... Is it just an attempt to raise money? Apparently not - Ryanair say the policy will cost them \u00a350m, but hopefully speed things up. More here: Sports Direct has reiterated its bold pledge to become the \u201cSelfridges of Sport\u201d retailing. As it prepares for a potentially bruising AGM meeting today, SPD told the City that: The Company is pleased to confirm ahead of today\u2019s AGM that trading in our new generation flagship stores continues to exceed our expectations as Sports Direct moves towards the \u2018Selfridges\u2019 of sport. I suspect that won\u2019t stop some investors voting against chairman Keith Hellawell\u2019s reappointment, though. Several influential shareholders, including Hermes and Fidelity, argue that fresh blood is needed at the top following recent revelations over the company\u2019s working practices. German consumer goods makers had the toughest July, suffering a 3% drop in new orders. Capital goods (heavy duty machinery) dropped by 0.7%, while intermediate goods orders fell by 0.4%. This is the first drop in German factory orders in three months, as this chart shows: Just in: Germany\u2019s factories suffered a surprise drop in new orders in July, suggesting Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy could be running out of steam. New government figures show that factory orders dropped by 0.7% during the month, missing City forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Orders from other eurozone countries fell by 1% during the month. However, orders from other nations rose by 0.6% -- suggesting the recent strength of the euro isn\u2019t hurting Germany. But....domestic orders declined by 1.6% - perhaps a sign that German companies are taking a breather after a strong few months? Germany factory orders can be volatile, but this isn\u2019t exactly what chancellor Angela Merkel would hope to see ahead of this autumn\u2019s election. But the economics ministry insists that German manufacturing remains robust, saying: Order activity remains on a very high level.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are jittery again this morning as the North Korea nuclear crisis weighs on the markets. Asian stocks are dropping today, following a nervy session on Wall Street last night that saw the Dow Jones fall 1%. The selloff comes as South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, warned that the crisis on the Korean peninsula risks becoming \u201cuncontrollable\u201d. Speaking at a bilateral meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Moon declared: \u201cThe global political situation has become very serious due to North Korea\u2019s repeated provocations.\u201d South Korean media are reporting that Moon asked Putin to help \u201ctame\u201d North Korea, following last Sunday\u2019s nuclear test. More details here: On the economics front, we find out how whether America\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world widened or narrowed, and how its service sector performed in August. We\u2019ll also be watching two annual general meetings, with retailer Sports Direct and housebuilder Berkeley Group facing their shareholders. Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, will face a rebellion from investors who believe he should resign. And there\u2019s a possibility that Canadian interest rates could rise today, as the Bank of Canada holds its latest monetary policy meeting. Here\u2019s the agenda: 1.30pm: US trade balance for July 3pm: Bank of Canada interest rate decision 3pm: US service sector PMI for August",

There are a number of reasons why the ECB would want to reduce QE purchases, not least because of bond scarcity.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Sports Direct chairman, Keith Hellawell, has defended the use of zero-hours contracts as he survived a shareholder rebellion over his role at the retailer. Hellawell, 75, who has been chairman since 2009, had pledged to step down if he failed to win the backing of independent investors who voted against him last year. Just over 53% of independent investors backed his re-election on Wednesday even though he has been viewed as a weak chairman who is failing to counter the power of the company\u2019s majority shareholder and founder, Mike Ashley. The senior independent director Simon Bentley was also re-elected. Before the sparsely attended meeting at Sports Direct\u2019s head office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, investors had set the scene for a rebellion by pledging to vote against Hellawell. Last year, more than half of independent shareholders voted against the chairman, forcing the company to hold a second vote in January after which he was kept in place only with the backing of Ashley, who now owns more than 60% of Sports Direct shares. At the annual general meeting, Hellawell defended Sports Direct\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts and said there was no need for an independent review of its working practices. Asked for an update on a pledge made last year to offer guaranteed hours deals to shopfloor staff, the vast majority of whom currently do not know if they will get any work each week, Hellawell said \u201ca huge proportion of workers are happy to retain the flexibility\u201d of the existing setup. He added: \u201cZero-hours is still a legal form of employment in this country. I appreciate that a number of unions are against that but while it is still a legal form of employment we will choose it if we wish to continue with that.\u201d The issue was raised by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, during Wednesday\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions when he said Ashley should \u201chonour his word\u201d and end zero-hours contacts. Alex Balacki, a store manager who was recently elected to the board by workers directly employed by the company \u2013 not including the majority of warehouse staff who are hired via agencies \u2013 said: \u201cThe vast majority of people are happy with the contracts and as long as that\u2019s the case it\u2019s working for people.\u201d He said the setup allowed Sports Direct to employ \u201csingle mums and students\u201d in a way that would not otherwise be possible. At the meeting a series of investors asked for an update on a report into the treatment of workers carried out by the company\u2019s lawyers last year. A year ago, independent shareholders backed a resolution calling for an independent review of corporate governance and working practices. Sports Direct did promise to implement that review but later said it would be carried out by the law firm RPC, which has worked closely with the company for some time. Asked if he would commit to a truly independent review, Hellawell said: \u201cIf there\u2019s a problem we address that problem and work through that problem. We don\u2019t see the need for an outside body to come in and look at this organisation at the moment.\u201d A spokesman for the Unite union, which has been campaigning for better workers\u2019 rights at Sports Direct, said the vote was closer than expected because the company had been buying back shares. \u201cPromises have been broken regarding the treatment of workers and issues around corporate governance persist. The board and the chairman need to heed the message of the vote and clean its act up,\u201d Unite said. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the corporate governance manager of Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWith Keith Hellawell surviving his second shareholder revolt in a year by the skin of his teeth, we believe that the board should urgently address the long list of governance concerns that have been raised by independent shareholders to help restore confidence in the board.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s working practices have been in focus after the Guardian exposed how temporary workers at its depots were in effect being paid below the minimum wage. Revenue and Customs subsequently found that workers were owed backpay but some have yet to receive the money, partly because of a dispute between employment agencies previously used by Sports Direct. Hellawell said Sports Direct recognised \u201ca concern to pay workers whatever they are owed\u201d but this was \u201cnot as easy as it sounds\u201d when dealing via the agencies. \u201cThere are discussions between agencies, former agencies and this company,\u201d he said. At Berkeley Group\u2019s annual meeting in Cobham, 16% of shareholders voted against the housebuilder\u2019s remuneration report. The company handed its boardroom \u00a392m in long-term share bonuses for 2016, in one of the biggest executive payouts ever in the City. Berkeley\u2019s chairman and founder, Tony Pidgley, received \u00a329m while the chief executive, Rob Perrins, made \u00a328m after beating targets in a long-term incentive plan drawn up in 2011. In 2015, Berkeley\u2019s top six executives made \u00a347m between them. The London luxury home builder defended the latest payout as \u201cpay for performance\u201d but halved the value of the 10-year incentive scheme last December.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s blueprint for a post-Brexit immigration policy, outlined in leaked Home Office documents, would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for some industries, employers have warned. Corporate chiefs and industry leaders in sectors including housebuilding, aerospace, farming and hotels said the tighter controls could lead to labour shortages and damage the economy, as one of their biggest fears about Brexit shows signs of becoming a reality. About 2.2 million European Union nationals work in Britain \u2013 roughly 7% of the overall workforce \u2013 with some subsectors of the economy almost totally reliant on migrants, official figures show. Business leaders have long counselled No 10 on the need to retain access to high and low-skilled labour when Britain leaves the EU. The warning is stark from some, with EU workers accounting for more than 20% of the labour force in at least 18 specialist sectors, according to a GMB study of Office for National Statistics figures. The hotels, retail and hospitality industries, in particular stand to lose from the reforms. Some 75% of waiters and 25% of chefs working in the UK come from other EU nations. \u201cIf these proposals are implemented it could be catastrophic for the UK hospitality industry,\u201d said Ufi Ibrahim, the chief executive of the British Hospitality Association. Hospitality firms need at least 60,000 new EU workers a year in order to fill vacancies, according to research for the BHA by the accountancy firm KPMG. Peter Gowers, the chief executive of the hotel chain Travelodge, said: \u201cEven if the hotel industry recruited virtually every person on the the unemployment register there wouldn\u2019t be enough people to fill all the roles needed in the 10 years following Brexit. That\u2019s particularly the case in London.\u201d He said the government must consult on a \u201cmeaningful guest worker programme as a matter of urgency\u201d to avoid price rises and cuts in investment in the industry. The leaked Home Office document proposes offering EU migrants residency for a maximum of only two years, in a policy designed to drive down numbers. Those in \u201chigh-skilled occupations\u201d will be granted permits to work for a longer period of three to five years. About 4% of aerospace, defence and space industry workers are from other EU countries, while 5% of employees in these sectors working in the EU are UK citizens, with a supply chain that stretches across Europe. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of industry trade body ADS, said: \u201cIt is important the needs of businesses who rely on employees being able to cross national borders are taken into account in the government\u2019s final proposals.\u201d Downing Street faced a second embarrassing leak in 24 hours after it emerged No 10 has been asking business leaders to sign a letter supporting its Brexit strategy. The document, leaked to Sky News, was circulated to a number of FTSE 100 company chiefs with a request that they consider signing the letter by Friday. The furious response of businesses is likely to strengthen the position of Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who has been pushing for the government to listen more to companies\u2019 concerns about Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman insisted on Tuesday that this engagement was already happening, saying: \u201cBusiness has an important voice in the conversation taking place over Brexit and we will continue to listen to them. One of our aims is to make sure we deliver a Brexit that is as smooth as possible for business.\u201d Tighter immigration controls could damage economic growth, bringing potentially dire consequences for the nation\u2019s finances. The rapid reduction in net migration to below 100,000 new arrivals to the UK each year \u2013 a Tory campaign pledge before the election \u2013 could knock 3.1% off GDP by 2025 and lower tax receipts by \u00a332.7bn, according to research from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). Douglas McWilliams, the executive chairman of CEBR, said: \u201cIf you destroy the capacity for people to come here looking for work, then there will be a significant effect to the economy and a very big knock-on effect for the public finances.\u201d Industry sectors lined up to voice concern over the leaked proposals. \u201cIf this does represent the government\u2019s thinking it shows a deep lack of understanding of the vital contribution that EU migrant workers make \u2013 at all skill levels \u2013 across the food chain,\u201d said Ian Wright, the director general of the Food and Drink Federation. The National Farmers\u2019 Union said an abrupt drop in the number of EU workers able to work in the UK would cause \u201cmassive disruption to the entire food supply chain\u201d. Farming produces the raw ingredients for the UK food and drink sector, worth \u00a3109bn and employing 3.8 million people. The EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said it could work with the proposals for highly skilled workers but the proposals for low-skilled migrants were a \u201cgrave concern\u201d. Tim Thomas, the director of employment and skills at the EEF, said: \u201cThe proposals represent a mixed bag. On the highly skilled side, the system described is one we can work with, after some changes. But, we would have grave concerns that at lower skill levels accessing EU workers will be on a completely different basis.\u201d Thomas also warned that overseas workers may no longer want to come to the UK: \u201cThe question, currently unanswered, is whether workers other than the highly skilled will still want to come to the UK on the basis there\u2019s no family reunion, no pathway to ever settling here, and where their stay is limited to two years.\u201d The CBI, which speaks for 190,000 businesses that employ 7 million people, said it was essential to keep an open approach to hiring staff from the EU so that vacancies could be filled and that overseas firms carried on investing in the UK. Neil Carberry, the group\u2019s managing director for people and infrastructure, said the government\u2019s final position paper should support \u201can open but managed approach to immigration\u201d. The Institute of Directors said business leaders would not welcome the approach outlined in the leaked documents and its members would be hoping for changes in the government\u2019s final position. Seamus Nevin, the institute\u2019s head of employment and skills policy, said immigration rules should be clear and simple. \u201cThe UK needs an immigration system which provides control while also enabling employers to access the foreign workers they need at all levels \u2013 whether it be short-term seasonal workers, intra-company transfers or permanent positions,\u201d he added. Tim Martin, the founder of the Wetherspoons pub chain and a prominent supporter of Brexit, said immigration was healthy for the economy. He draws about 5% of his 35,000-strong workforce from EU nationals, although he said tighter controls similar to Australian or US rules would be preferable. \u201cThe EU method of immigration and migration was unsustainable and was undemocratic, even though you have definitely benefited from the eastern Europeans, in particular, who have come over here in the last decade or so,\u201d he added. The EU referendum and Britain\u2019s increasingly hostile stance to European workers is already having an effect on employment figures. There was a 1.1% drop in the number of workers from eight eastern European countries to 997,000 in the three months to June from the same period a year ago, according to ONS figures. A slowdown could contribute to lower unemployment and might potentially push up wages. However, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said old Home Office studies showed that immigration had little impact on wages and employment. \u201cOverwhelmingly it has been the case that overseas workers have been complementary rather than competitive to British workers,\u201d he said. Rob Perrins, the chief executive of the Berkeley Group, which builds upmarket homes in London, said some of its EU workers had left because of the sharp fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. The company is heavily dependent on EU workers, who make up half its workforce. Perrins said about 200,000 workers are needed to build housing in London to address the shortage of new homes. Steve Turner, of the Home Builders Federation, said as many as 70% of workers on some construction sites in the capital hail from abroad, mainly from within the EU. \u201cClearly the electricians, bricklayers and plumbers that are coming from Europe we are very reliant on,\u201d Turner added. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to define what\u2019s skilled. House builders need labour of all sorts \u2013 skilled and unskilled.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair customers will have to pay \u00a35 for priority boarding from 1 November if they want to carry a wheelie bag on board, as the airline attempts to reduce boarding and flight delays caused by a shortage of overhead cabin space. Priority boarders will still be able to carry on two bags, but all other passengers will be allowed to take only one smaller bag on board the aircraft. A second, larger, wheelie bag will have to be placed in the hold free of charge at the boarding gate, to be collected at baggage reclaim on arrival. Ryanair is also lowering checked bag fees \u2013 a move that will cost the airline \u20ac50m (\u00a346m) a year \u2013 and increasing the weight allowance to encourage more customers to check in luggage. From 1 November, the check-in bag allowance will increase from 15kg to 20kg, while the fee for luggage in the hold will be reduced from \u00a335 to \u00a325. Kenny Jacobs, the airline\u2019s chief marketing officer, said the changes to its baggage policy still mean passengers will be able to travel with two bags for free, but under the current rules too many passengers were taking two bags on board busy flights, resulting in insufficient overhead space and causing delays. He said that on a typically busy flight, about 186 seats of a total of 189 will be occupied, with space for about 90 bags in the overhead lockers. But some people were bending the rules by bringing on board a wheelie bag and a large rucksack that will not fit underneath the seat. \u201cWe\u2019re making these changes because our flights are so much busier,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of people will have two very large bags, taking up someone else\u2019s space. They\u2019ll hope they\u2019ll get away with it and generally they have, but we don\u2019t want to go back to policing bags at the gate.\u201d When the second bag allowance was introduced in late 2013, average Ryanair flights were 82% full, Jacobs said. That rose to 97% in August, when a record 12.7 million passengers flew with the airline. \u201cThese bag policy changes will cost Ryanair more than \u20ac50m a year in reduced checked bag fees. However, we believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking in a bag,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that by restricting non-priority customers to one small carry-on bag \u2013 their wheelie bag must be placed in the hold, free of charge at the boarding gate \u2013 this will speed up the boarding of flights and eliminate flight delays being caused by not having sufficient overhead cabin space on busy flights to accommodate over 360 carry-on bags.\u201d Priority boarding costs \u00a35 at the time of booking. It can be added to a booking for \u00a36 up to one hour before scheduled departure. The changes will mean more passengers will have to collect their luggage from the baggage reclaim carousel at the arrival airport, potentially holding up passengers at their destination. However, Jacobs said bags were often available as soon as passengers had cleared security, partly because security checks were taking longer. \u201cMore than 90% of the time your bag will be on the carousel when you get there,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s North Sea energy sector is still shedding thousands of jobs despite the recovery in the oil price, according to new figures. The industry had already been hollowed out by the 2014-16 oil price slump, falling from a peak of nearly 500,000 employed in 2014 to 315,000 at the end of last year. But data from the Oil &amp; Gas UK, the trade body, shows a further 13,000 jobs linked to the sector were lost in the first half of 2017. The bulk of the employment is indirect jobs, in the supply chain and services such as hotels and restaurants. Oil &amp; Gas UK said this year\u2019s contraction, which has continued despite the price of a barrel of oil costing a third more than a year before, was the result not just of cost-cutting, but nearly $6bn worth of mergers and acquisitions. Several major oil firms have sold stakes to smaller, independent players in the region this year in search of more profitable reserves elsewhere, raising fears over further job losses. One industry expert cited Total\u2019s recent acquisition of Maersk\u2019s North Sea operations, saying head office functions would be duplicated and therefore liable to restructuring and job cuts. Steve Todd, national secretary of the RMT union, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this industry for 45 years and it\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever seen it. I don\u2019t see any light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cIf anything it\u2019s getting worse, in my view. I\u2019m yet to be convinced there are any green shoots.\u201d Todd said the reasons for the losses included downsizing and mergers, and warned that workers still in employment were also suffering. \u201cMorale among the workforce is rock bottom,\u201d he said. \u201cThose in jobs have had to make sacrifices, they\u2019ve had to do longer tours of duty [out on vessels and on rigs]. People have taken pay cuts, sometimes of 20% to 30%.\u201d Oil &amp; Gas UK said it believed the largest job cuts \u201cmay now be behind us\u201d but warned it still had serious concerns over record low levels of drilling. Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of Oil &amp; Gas UK, said: \u201cThere are still serious issues facing our industry which has suffered heavy job losses since the oil price slump. But we are hopeful that the tide is turning and expect employment levels to stabilise if activity picks up.\u201d Just 14 exploration wells and 8 appraisal wells \u2013 the step after exploration but before production \u2013 were drilled in 2016, the trade body\u2019s economic report found. A lack of capital investment also remains a serious concern, with only three new oilfields approved since 2016. The only area where expenditure is increasing involves the decommissioning of old oil rigs, such as Shell\u2019s removal of a platform in the Brent field earlier this year. The government has proposed changing tax relief rules around decommissioning to support the sector, with a final decision expected at the autumn budget. Andrew Jones, a Treasury minister, told an industry conference on Tuesday: \u201cThe government remains fully committed in its support of the UK\u2019s oil and gas industry.\u201d The price of oil continues to hover around $50 a barrel despite a deal agreed in May by major oil-producing countries to extend production curbs and prop up prices. Oil &amp; Gas UK said the market\u2019s reaction to the agreement suggested \u201cit may be more difficult to overcome the global oversupply [of oil] than previously anticipated\u201d and that the market was likely to remain volatile until 2019.",

      "bodyText": "Housebuilder Redrow says it\u2019s looking forward to working with government to consider the future of the help-to-buy subsidy scheme beyond 2021. You bet it is. Since former chancellor George Osborne in 2013 committed to helping homebuyers purchase new properties with a deposit of only 5%, Redrow has reported record profits every year. The latest annual numbers \u2013 and a share price that has improved threefold since 2013 \u2013 shows how wonderful life has become for big housebuilders. You\u2019d almost think Redrow was producing high-tech consumer gadgets. Operating margins are running at 19% and return on capital employed has hit 26%. About 40% of its private sales are to help-to-buy purchases, which is typical for the sector. After an improvement of a quarter in pre-tax profits to \u00a3315m, the company hiked its dividend by 70% and said there\u2019s plenty left in the tank. Profits will rise to about \u00a3430m by 2020 and the dividend can be almost doubled again \u201csubject to market conditions remaining unchanged\u201d. The obvious question is why on earth the government, having spent \u00a34.6bn already, would wish to continue with help to buy after 2021. Yes, the scheme has allowed some people to buy homes who would not otherwise have been able to do so, but the clearest beneficiaries of the stimulus to prices have been housebuilders\u2019 shareholders and executives. Back in 2013, one justification was the limp state of the mortgage market. That no longer applies. The banks are well-capitalised, high loan-to-value mortgages have returned and the Bank of England these days frets about too much lending, not too little. Osborne\u2019s other argument was that more demand for houses would increase supply. The numbers suggest modest success, even if some of the increase would have happened anyway. But the point now is that withdrawing help to buy overnight wouldn\u2019t obviously cause the housebuilders to down tools for fear that non-subsidised houses would sell for slightly less. A return of capital of 26% is splendid but it is still worth getting out of bed for 15%. Before ministers commit to renewing help to buy on the same terms, they should recall the warning by Lord King, former governor of the Bank of England, in 2014: \u201cThis scheme is a little too close for comfort to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages. We had a very healthy mortgage market with competing lenders attracting borrowers before the crisis, and we need to get back to that healthy mortgage market ... We mustn\u2019t let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme.\u201d Ditching help to buy outright in 2021 may be undesirable since there is a fair case that first-time buyers still deserve a leg-up. But, as even wiser housebuilders concede, too many houses qualify for help to buy. Current ceilings are set at \u00a3600,000 and 20% of the value of mortgage. Both figures could usefully be cut in half before the scheme becomes an addiction. No embarrassment of riches for Bell Pottinger There\u2019s an intriguing detail to the Bell Pottinger tale, which we have just reported: the now-disgraced PR outfit is understood to have inserted an \u201cembarrassment clause\u201d in its contract with the Guptas to the effect that it expected to be compensated if other clients defected as a result of its work in South Africa. The clause suggests somebody at Bell Pottinger was dimly aware of the risk in running a campaign that stirred racial tensions and was deemed unethical and unprofessional by industry trade body, the Public Relations and Communications Agency. How, though, did Bell Pottinger ever expect to make a claim? Quantifying the lost earnings would be almost impossible and, as the firm is now discovering, exposure was bound to cause a stampede to the exit by clients. The chance of getting a penny out of the Guptas in these circumstances was always roughly zero. Hellawell slow out of the blocks at Sports Direct If Keith Hellawell, chairman of Sports Direct, was serious about the commitment he gave a year ago to earn the respect of outside shareholders, there was one easy course of action open to him: he could have met a few rebels. It is amazing, therefore, that one complaint from Hermes echoes last year\u2019s grumble. The fund manager is \u201cgreatly concerned about the lack of one to one engagement\u201d and the \u201cmissed opportunities to build positive and constructive relationships with interested third party minority investors\u201d. Hellawell may still survive Wednesday\u2019s vote, but it doesn\u2019t sound as if he has tried terribly hard to save his job.",

    "webTitle": "Scott Morrison claims 'better days ahead' for Australian economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy is growing at an annual rate of 1.8% after a strong pick-up in economic activity in the June quarter. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8% in the June quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 more than double the 0.3% rise in the March quarter \u2013 driven by strong growth in exports and household consumption. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the pick-up in growth was consistent with economic developments in the United States and United Kingdom, and showed the economy was moving towards \u201cbalanced growth\u201d, despite the impact of Tropical Cyclone Debbie earlier this year. He said Australia\u2019s economy was proving resilient, and he looked forward to stronger growth in coming months. \u201cThe better days ahead for the Australian economy are now beginning to emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s national accounts for the June quarter reveal solid and more balanced growth for our economy, confirming the emerging national economic consensus of the better days ahead that I referred to in this year\u2019s budget.\u201d He said household consumption, new business investment, net exports, and new public final demand, were all driving growth, offsetting declines in inventories and flat dwelling investment. He said the government\u2019s defence spending was also making a huge contribution to growth, with defence investment up 26.3% in the quarter. But household consumption was the largest contributor to growth in the year, up by 0.7% in the quarter, and 2.6% over the last 12 months. Food, rent, financial services and furnishing and household items were the major growth items. Morrison admitted households were maintaining their spending levels by saving much less than they were a few years ago, with the household saving ratio declining to 4.6% in the June quarter (a nine-year low), down from 8% in 2015 and over 10% in 2012. When asked if he thought current household spending levels were sustainable, given record-low wages growth and rising prices were encouraging people to save less, Morrison said the fall in the saving ratio wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. \u201cI think it\u2019s a statement of confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe saving ratio has come down, but it remains positive. That\u2019s an indicator that people are still putting a bit away, just not as much as they were putting away before. That often is an indicator of improving confidence in households.\u201d Economists say the GDP data definitely shows positive signs, and fit with the Reserve Bank\u2019s upbeat view on the economic outlook. Alan Oster, NAB\u2019s chief economist, said it was likelier the RBA would raise interest rates \u201csooner than we currently expect in 2019\u201d. The GDP figures come a day after the Reserve Bank kept the official cash rate on hold again, at a record-low 1.5%. Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, told the Reserve Bank board dinner on Tuesday that economic growth would reach 3% over the next couple of years, and the unemployment rate would keep declining. \u201cEncouragingly, growth in the number of Australians with jobs has picked up over recent months and the unemployment rate has come down a bit,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cThe investment outlook has also brightened. Inflation has troughed and it is likely to increase gradually over the next couple of years. These are positive developments.\u201d But some economists have cautioned that the 0.8% growth in the June quarter may overstate the health of the economy, because it followed an unusually weak 0.3% in the first quarter. Paul Dales from Capital Economics said the rebound in growth in the June quarter was due to the unwinding of the drag in the first quarter caused by the unusually hot and wet weather that disrupted activity. \u201cThe 0.6% quarter-on-quarter average of the [March and June quarters] provides a better guide to the true trend and suggests the economy is growing at a subdued rate of about 2.2% per year,\u201d Dales said. \u201cWe suspect growth will improve to only 2.5% next year, which suggests the Reserve Bank\u2019s 3% forecast is too optimistic.\u201d Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has criticised Morrison\u2019s positive spin on the data, saying average wages fell 0.1% in the June quarter and living standards slipped significantly. He said annual economic growth is still below 2%, and since it has been below 2% for three of the last four quarters, \u201cthis is now the worst run economic growth performance since the global financial crisis\u201d. \u201c[And] the Bureau of Statistics notes that for the last five quarters, households have been spending more than their incomes,\u201d he said. \u2018This is in line with the RBA governor\u2019s concerns around household debt and the risks this poses to future economic growth.\u201d",
