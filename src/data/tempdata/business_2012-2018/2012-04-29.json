The regulator has introduced a raft of initiatives demanding that companies provide more transparency over pricing and reduce the number of tariffs they offer to reduce scope for confusion. The energy companies argue that their profit margins are extremely low and they are the victims of soaring prices of wholesale gas that is needed directly for homes or to generate electricity in their power stations. The big six also argue that they are being blamed for the government's failure to come up with a coherent energy policy that secures supplies while driving down carbon levels. Ofgem's evidence gives no indication that the dominant power companies have achieved efficiency savings and passed these savings on to consumers through lower bills, as would be expected in a competitive market, the IPPR argues.

      "body": "<p>A new service has been launched aimed at mobilising public anger over executive pay.</p> <p>Building on the protest vote against remuneration policies at Barclays on Friday, a new website will allow savers to email the major City institutions that manage their investments and demand they take action on executive pay.</p> <p>The rebellion at Barclays came amid signs that institutional investors are beginning to take action against underperforming companies. Last week the pay policies of Central Rand Gold were voted down when 75% of investors voted against the remuneration report of the South-Africa-based company, which is listed in London. The pay policies were also rejected last year after a period of underperformance by the company, which was worth \u00a3300m at its flotation in 2007 but has sunk to just \u00a315m now.</p> <p>The new website \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.yoursayonpay.org.uk\" title=\"\">www.yoursayonpay.org.uk</a> \u2013 is intended to give people a say on pay and is run by FairPensions. Mike Darrington, the former managing director of the bakers Greggs, is a supporter.</p> <p>Darrington said: \"It's high time that we get a handle on excessive executive pay. For too long now many of those at the top of Britain's biggest companies have continued to reap enormous rewards while profits and share prices fail to impress.

      "bodyText": "A new service has been launched aimed at mobilising public anger over executive pay. Building on the protest vote against remuneration policies at Barclays on Friday, a new website will allow savers to email the major City institutions that manage their investments and demand they take action on executive pay. The rebellion at Barclays came amid signs that institutional investors are beginning to take action against underperforming companies. Last week the pay policies of Central Rand Gold were voted down when 75% of investors voted against the remuneration report of the South-Africa-based company, which is listed in London. The pay policies were also rejected last year after a period of underperformance by the company, which was worth \u00a3300m at its flotation in 2007 but has sunk to just \u00a315m now. The new website \u2013 www.yoursayonpay.org.uk \u2013 is intended to give people a say on pay and is run by FairPensions. Mike Darrington, the former managing director of the bakers Greggs, is a supporter. Darrington said: \"It's high time that we get a handle on excessive executive pay. For too long now many of those at the top of Britain's biggest companies have continued to reap enormous rewards while profits and share prices fail to impress. I \u2026 urge anyone who cares about excesses at the top to take their online action.\" Even though investors have had a vote on pay since 2002, only 18 remuneration reports have had more than 50% of votes cast against them in 10 years, FairPensions said. This has sparked mixed responses to Vince Cable's proposals to introduce new votes on pay policies that would be binding on directors, rather than advisory as they are now. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of FairPensions, is also attempting to highlight the fact that institutional investors do not have to disclose how they vote at annual meetings. \"Until now scrutiny of high-paying companies has been left to big investors, who have shown themselves reluctant to take a strong stance on spiralling pay awards. It's high time the public had a chance to influence this debate and have their say on pay,\" Howarth said. Speaking after the Barclays annual meeting on Friday, the bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, said shareholders were increasingly keen to show they were taking action. \"The institutions \u2026 are also very keen to be seen to be exercising stewardship and that I completely respect,\" said Agius. \"The sentiment of shareholders is being heard everywhere.

      "bodyText": "As we enter another recession, economics is now firmly in three camps. There are the rightwing supply-siders who want to cut employment protection to force people into work alongside tax cuts that encourage more private spending. There are the Keynesians, who cheerlead for the state and argue that only the government can restore confidence and stimulate growth. And there is a school of thought that justifies governments sitting on their hands. This tactic, adopted by the Treasury with the backing of the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, recommends policymakers do whatever the money markets tell them, which in the UK means a deflationary freeze on spending for seven years. Sit tight and wait for the private sector to shake off its debts. While Whitehall obsesses about balancing its books, the inevitable upturn will magically appear. This last group has come to dominate economic thinking not only in the UK, but also in the main capitals of Europe over the three years since the collapse of the G20's Keynesian consensus. George Osborne is not alone in thinking that politicians, sandwiched between the markets and change-resistant voters, have nowhere else to go. From Finland to Austria and the Netherlands to Germany, it is the policy du jour. Angela Merkel said the terms of the EU's spending freeze (bringing annual overspends to within 3%) were set in stone and could only be wrecked by a no vote in the Irish referendum. The election of a Keynesian socialist French president in a fortnight would be irrelevant, the German chancellor added. But the European consensus is breaking down as it becomes obvious that snipping and nibbling at the problem is only making the situation worse. Greece has been joined by Belgium, Portugal, Italy, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands and Slovenia in recession. Germany may be exporting almost everything it makes to the Chinese, but like France, two more years of virtually zero growth await. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the EU, on Friday hinted at what is blindingly obvious to everyone else: that growth remains elusive and this fact should be recognised and debated. Merkel told a German newspaper that while she had not shifted her position, generating growth would be her chief economic concern at the summit of EU leaders in June. Senior officials in Brussels, while instructing Spain and others to maintain self-defeating austerity measures, are seeing the error of their ways. But admitting that their economic plan has flopped fails to answer the question, which way to turn? Osborne is under intense pressure to adopt the supply-side reform model. The Conservative former defence secretary Liam Fox is gaining a hearing for his calls to remove employment protection. Last week he said: \"We need to have a combination of increased labour market flexibility and spending cuts, to make room for employers' tax cuts, if we are to create non-inflationary growth and improve the productivity and exportability upon which any sustained recovery will depend.\" Even if his ideas to cut maternity leave subsidies and other employee benefits are rejected by colleagues including John Redwood, MP for Wokingham and a leading Tory thinker on the economy, they all agree the \u00a310bn in extra welfare cuts suggested by the chancellor are essential and must be agreed by the Liberal Democrats. Redwood is aligned with the owners of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, the Sunday Times, and the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday in calling for tax cuts for families to be paid for by a bigger welfare squeeze. A bonfire of employment protection is also on these newspapers' shopping list. This weekend, the Sunday Times said in an editorial under the heading \"Britain needs the spirit of the 1980s\" that proposals by private equity millionaire Adrian Beecroft for a hire and fire business culture, published last year, should be dusted off and implemented without delay. It accused the Lib Dems and the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, in particular, of burying a report that could help Britain's economy bounce back rapidly. Rightwing Tory MPs, many of them part of the 2010, post-expenses scandal intake, are pressing Osborne to ditch the consensus. Labour, unsure of its footing, decries the 10 lost years it says are inevitable from following current policies without having the confidence to put forward an alternative. Step forward US economist Paul Krugman, who with fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz is trying to convince policymakers in Europe that the US failed to go far enough in deploying government funds for investment to boost recovery. Worrying about the \"confidence fairy\" and the \"invisible bond vigilantes\" who stalk the money markets in search of vulnerable countries, as Krugman puts it, is for economic illiterates. Borrowing money is not so frightening, especially when central banks can create money to buy their own bonds, as the UK and US have done to some extent. He said last week in a blog: \"For the past two years most policymakers in Europe and many politicians and pundits in America have been in thrall to a destructive economic doctrine. According to this doctrine, governments should respond to a severely depressed economy not the way the textbooks say they should \u2013 by spending more to offset falling private demand \u2013 but with fiscal austerity, slashing spending in an effort to balance their budgets.\" Krugman agrees the consensus is falling apart but says most of the pressure for change is coming from the right. What is strange about the debate is that Keynesianism is seen as a gamble, whereas the champions of austerity must be waving a magic wand. In 2009, most mainstream forecasters predicted cuts in public spending would release the private sector from its chains to spur growth of 2% by 2011. In 2010 they said it would take a little longer and delayed 2% plus growth until 2012. Now the forecasters suggest 2% growth will arrive next year \u2013 without explaining how. The Bank of England is one of the chief culprits, mainly because its independence gives some respectability to the zombie economics (Krugman's term) followed in Brussels and London. What the supply-siders get wrong is their view of risk. They believe entrepreneurs just need the boulders of regulation and decent pay to be removed for them to increase output and jobs. But there is no evidence for this. What is clear is that governments which maintain investment in crucial areas, stand behind their banks and invest in education and training, at the cost of higher spending, will reap more in tax receipts from growth. From Silicon Valley to Germany's corridors of manufacturing, state subsidies (for research, for training, for worker's sickness payments) are what fosters innovation. If there is rebalancing to be done, it can take place once the economy is back on its feet and not before.",

I am coming back to protect my interest. I imagine that these comment are from certain individuals who want to maintain strong links to the Icelandic banks.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Crew on British cruise holidays who are paid a basic salary of as little as 75p an hour face having extra tips from passengers withheld unless they hit performance targets. The boss of P&amp;O Cruises said the move was part of a package to \"make crew more responsive\" and offer protection as tips dry up in the economic downturn. At the bottom end of the scale, a junior waiter on a ship sailing out of Southampton now earns a basic salary of \u00a3250 a month, for shifts lasting a minimum of 11 hours, seven days a week, with a possible \u00a3150 extra in bonuses. According to documents seen by the Guardian, this is \"a significantly increased basic salary\". David Dingle, CEO of Carnival UK, in charge of P&amp;O cruise lines, said the crew were \"much happier\" and the new arrangement was a win-win for passengers, staff and P&amp;O. He said many crew took home over \u00a31,000 a month, but tougher times meant that \"sadly, our customers were reluctant to pay the recommended level of tipping\". Cash tips are being phased out in favour of electronic tips automatically added to passengers' bills, which pay for the potential performance bonus. As passengers could opt out of paying, Dingle said, the firm was \"taking the risk out\" by paying bonuses if targets were met. \"We've handled it fairly and decently and made sure their pay is being protected,\" he said. Bonuses will be held back in part if customers' feedback ratings do not exceed targets, some of which stand at 96%. Cabin stewards whose attitude was ranked below 92% by customers will forfeit an entire bonus payment worth approximately 15% of their basic salary. Crew have been warned P&amp;O's funding of the scheme \"is dependent on the passengers paying their auto gratuities\". Passengers on the P&amp;O Oriana ship that recently returned to Southampton said members of the mainly Indian crew \u2013 the restaurant staff and cabin stewards \u2013 seemed upset by the deal. One passenger, Rob Bygrave, of Sherborne, Dorset, said it was an \"absolute scandal\". He said one crew member told him \"grown men were in tears\" at a meeting towards the end of a 97-day world cruise where they were notified of the new arrangements. P&amp;O, which celebrates its 175th anniversary this year, is part of the Carnival Corporation, which also owns Princess Cruises, whose Star Princess allegedly failed to pick up two dying fishermen, and Costa Cruises, owner of the Concordia that sank with the loss of 32 lives in January. Dingle said: \"You've got staff from eastern Europe in restaurants in Britain \u2013 why? Because it's great money. Yes, the minimum wage is more than we pay, but this is a global industry, Our businesses have to remain competitive. \"Let's not forget the level of take-home pay for our staff, the vast majority of whom come from India. Look at hotels in Goa. The earning ability is greater on our ships. \"We have a manning office in Mumbai. There are queues out on to the street. It clearly is of value to these people.\" The officers on P&amp;O cruise ships are European, mainly from Britain, Italy and Croatia, and the service staff are mostly drawn from India and the Philippines. Dingle said work permit issues could prevent Indian staff from rising through the ranks, but added: \"I'm sure in future we'll be employing Indian officers.\" P&amp;O's pay scale is understood to be standard for the industry. The company told Oriana workers that Carnival was \"committed to providing our service staff with a salary package that is in line with other cruise companies\". The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"Holidaymakers will be horrified to learn that some of the seafarers on their cruise ships are paid so little. It's high time the disgraceful practice of allowing the shipping industry to pay poverty wages to workers who don't live in the UK was stopped. Exploitative rates of pay for those working on British ships have no place in a modern society.\" More than 750,000 passengers took a cruise out of British ports last year, an increase of 100,000 on the previous year, and a million Britons flew abroad for a cruise. The industry's revenues rose to more than \u00a32.4bn, with the price of an average cruise of around 10 nights going up to \u00a31,434.",

      "bodyText": "Jade Jackson, aka Miss Stylie, got her first set of turntables when she was 12. By 17, she was standing outside a club in Liverpool in the rain refusing to go home until they let her MC. \"I think they realised I wasn't going home, so they let me in in the end,\" she said. \"I tore that place up.\" But the artist \u2013 who flits between grime, hip-hop and house \u2013 is still far from a record deal. Taking inspiration from the tattoo on her neck, which declares \"Have No Fear\", she has decided to take matters into her own hands and joinjoined a growing wave of artists relying on fans rather than industry executives to get their music heard. With a performance on Friday night at the Getintothis awards in Liverpool \u2013 the scouse answer to the Mercury Music prize \u2013 Jackson launched an appeal to her fans through PledgeMusic, a website that lets fans \"pledge\" money towards an album before it is made, paying for its production. \"People think it's easy to put out an album but it ain't like that no more,\" said the 22-year-old from Toxteth, who gave up a possible career in football as a striker for Liverpool FC's women's team to concentrate on music. \"This industry can be cruel, it can run you over. These days you have to create your own platform before anyone will even look at you.\" With CD sales in decline and record deals thin on the ground, artists are increasingly looking for new ways to fund their careers, including direct-to-fan funding sites such as PledgeMusic, Sellaband \u2013 used by Public Enemy \u2013 and Kickstarter. Bands such as the Libertines have used Pledge recently, with the site launching two campaigns daily, compared with two a week when the company was set up in 2009. Managing director Malcolm Dunbar said: \"CD sales are falling and it's difficult to even find somewhere to buy a CD, so creating your own buzz is much more necessary than it was.\" If anyone is going to save the music industry, it is fans: \"Selling direct to fans will be an integral part of the industry. Fans are an artist's lifeblood so it is increasingly necessary to engage with them and give real value for money.\" Getting fans to invest directly in artists is part of a new grassroots movement in music, according to Peter Guy, a Liverpool music writer and creator of the Getintothis blog. Friday night's event was the inaugural GIT award to celebrate the diversity and talent of the city's music scene, put together with no external funding and little sponsorship. \"That DIY spirit has just become the norm,\" Guy said. \"Artists and people in the music game don't have to rely on that old record label infrastructure; people are just coming together, working collaboratively and doing it for themselves.\" Esco Williams \u2013 a Liverpudlian answer to Marvin Gaye whose recent DIY efforts saw him making a video on the roof of a multistorey car park \u2013 has just hit his target of \u00a35,000 to fund his first album after an appeal to \"you, yer mates, yer ma\". He says crowd funding \u2013 creating a buzz at his live gigs, on Twitter and Facebook \u2013 has given him the confidence to follow his own path. With record labels now insisting on 360 degree deals that take a cut of everything from an artist's T-shirt sales to live shows, fan-funding means any money made goes back to the artist. \"We're doing everything in-house; whatever we do and whatever we make is for us, we don't have to sell out. With a big label, you are not a priority unless you are Beyonc\u00e9,\" Williams said. With some major record labels increasingly relying on televised talent shows to find artists \u2013 the prize for BBC1's The Voice is a recording contract with Universal \u2013 emerging acts are having to find new routes to stardom, according to Jon Webster, chief executive of the Music Managers Forum. \"Above my desk is a sign which says: 'There are no rules any more',\" he said. There is still some reticence in the industry about using fan-funded sites, particularly around more innovative methods of raising money, such as selling experiences such as having dinner or going bowling with the artist. Webster said: \"Not everyone is comfortable with it. Some younger, perhaps more transient pop acts might embrace new revenue streams that older more established artists might not, for example.\" Miss Stylie's manager, Andy Ng, said: \"In this day and age, fans are the taste-makers. In the past, you signed with a label because they had distribution, radio pluggers, press teams, but that whole system is breaking down now. It's a democracy, not a dictatorship any more.\" Getting her album made thanks to her fans is the first step, Miss Stylie says, on a path to world domination. \"I'm going to be coming into a big game with my defences ready,\" she said. \"But I knew when I was waiting outside that club: I'm going to get there somehow.\" Alexandra Topping was a judge of the Getintothis award",

By 17, she was standing outside a club in Liverpool in the rain refusing to go home until they let her MC. \"I think they realised I wasn't going home, so they let me in in the end,\" she said. \"I tore that place up.\"</p> <p>But the artist \u2013 who flits between grime, hip-hop and house \u2013 is still far from a record deal. Taking inspiration from the tattoo on her neck, which declares \"Have No Fear\", she has decided to take matters into her own hands and joinjoined a growing wave of artists relying on fans rather than industry executives to get their music heard.</p> <p>With a performance on Friday night at the <a href=\"http://www.peterguy.merseyblogs.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Getintothis awards</a> in Liverpool \u2013 the scouse answer to the Mercury Music prize \u2013 Jackson launched an appeal to her fans through <a href=\"http://www.pledgemusic.com/\" title=\"\">PledgeMusic</a>, a website that lets fans \"pledge\" money towards an album before it is made, paying for its production.</p> <p>\"People think it's easy to put out an album but it ain't like that no more,\" said the 22-year-old from Toxteth, who gave up a possible career in football as a striker for Liverpool FC's women's team to concentrate on music. \"This industry can be cruel, it can run you over. These days you have to create your own platform before anyone will even look at you.\"</p> <p>With CD sales in decline and record deals thin on the ground, artists are increasingly looking for new ways to fund their careers, including direct-to-fan funding sites such as PledgeMusic, <a href=\"https://www.sellaband.com/\" title=\"\">Sellaband</a> \u2013 used by Public Enemy \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a>.</p> <p>Bands such as <a href=\"http://www.pledgemusic.com/artists/thelibertines\" title=\"\">the Libertines have used Pledge recently</a>, with the site launching two campaigns daily, compared with two a week when the company was set up in 2009.</p> <p>Managing director Malcolm Dunbar said: \"CD sales are falling and it's difficult to even find somewhere to buy a CD, so creating your own buzz is much more necessary than it was.\"</p> <p>If anyone is going to save the music industry, it is fans: \"Selling direct to fans will be an integral part of the industry. Fans are an artist's lifeblood so it is increasingly necessary to engage with them and give real value for money.\"</p> <p>Getting fans to invest directly in artists is part of a new grassroots movement in music, according to Peter Guy, a Liverpool music writer and creator of the <a href=\"http://www.peterguy.merseyblogs.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Getintothis</a> blog. Friday night's event was the inaugural GIT award to celebrate the diversity and talent of the city's music scene, put together with no external funding and little sponsorship.</p> <p>\"That DIY spirit has just become the norm,\" Guy said. \"Artists and people in the music game don't have to rely on that old record label infrastructure; people are just coming together, working collaboratively and doing it for themselves.\"</p> <p>Esco Williams \u2013 a Liverpudlian answer to Marvin Gaye whose recent DIY efforts saw him making a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/37466879\" title=\"\">video on the roof of a multistorey car park</a> \u2013 has just hit his target of \u00a35,000 to fund his first album after an appeal to <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/36193732\" title=\"\">\"you, yer mates, yer ma\"</a>.</p> <p>He says crowd funding \u2013 creating a buzz at his live gigs, on Twitter and Facebook \u2013 has given him the confidence to follow his own path.
