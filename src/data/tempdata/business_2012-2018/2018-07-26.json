      "bodyText": "Amazon\u2019s sparkling-looking results also includes a flurry of new achievements and milestones, from new Fire smart TVs and tablets to a French Alexa, Amazon Prime\u2019s 22 Emmy nominations and some new cloud computing kit. But analysts really care about the guidance -- which shows that Amazon expects sales and profits to keep surging. Here\u2019s the details: Net sales are expected to be between $54.0 billion and $57.5 billion, or to grow between 23% and 31% compared with third quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, compared with $347 million in third quarter 2017. The results are online here. It\u2019s another big earnings night. Amazon has just posted a record quarter, with revenues up 39% to $52.9bn. That\u2019s a huge sales performance, but actually $500m less than expected. But earnings per share have beaten forecasts. Shares have jumped in after hours trading. Boom! It\u2019s official, Facebook has suffered the biggest loss of stock market value in a single day, ever. Shares in the social media giant just closed down almost 19%. That leaves them at $176.26, down $41.24 in a single painful session. That wipes more than $119bn off the company\u2019s value, I think, and roughly $15bn off Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s stake. It means Facebook has (reluctantly) taken the crown of the biggest one-day fall away from Intel. The news that Facebook missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue and user growth targets last night, and slashed its forecasts, has clearly given traders a jolt. There\u2019s no relief for Facebook shares, which are now down 19.5% - wiping around $120bn off the company\u2019s value. Still, for every seller there\u2019s a buyer. So some investors think this is a good opportunity to snaffle a stake in Facebook. Jeff Henriksen, Founder and Managing Partner, Thorpe Abbotts Capital, explains why: First, the bad news. The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe. This has had a negative effect on both costs and revenue growth and caused the market to question Facebook\u2019s long-term prospects and the quality of its past performance. \u201cThat said, I think the market is missing the larger picture here. First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u2014even though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u2014should not be permanently impaired. Ultimately these expenses will improve earnings quality and the sustainability of the business model. We believe that it is more likely than not that Facebook\u2019s earnings will double over the next 5 years and provide a very satisfactory return for long term investors.\u201d Facebook is still on track to set an unwanted record tonight: After a very bruising morning, Facebook shares are still down over 18% in New York. This has pulled the Nasdaq index into the red too; it\u2019s down around 1%, having hit record highs earlier this week. There\u2019s still a case for investing in Facebook, despite its setbacks and the challenges ahead. Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u201cFacebook is making the changes to ensure that its place as the leading social media network is maintained following considerable scrutiny in the press and on Capitol Hill. Facebook\u2019s user base remains large with over 2bn monthly active users and over 1.4bn daily active users. Ahead of the mid-term elections it is vital that it takes action on fake news, any political advertising on Facebook and of course data security. This involves considerable investment in staff and artificial intelligence and these costs will grow faster than revenue for the next 2 to 3 years. \u201cHowever for advertisers, the size and targeting offered by Facebook and increasingly Instagram, is highly attractive and this will continue to drive the growth of revenues and profits.\u201d Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has suffered a staggering hit today. The value of Zuckerberg\u2019s stake in Facebook has fallen by around $15bn today, or \u00a311bn. That still leaves him with a personal fortune of around $72bn, due to his stake in the social media firm. This chart from Bloomberg shows how Facebook is facing the biggest loss of market value in cash terms ever: That $151bn loss is based on Facebook\u2019s shares dropping 24% (their worst point overnight). Currently they\u2019re still down 18%, which is a loss of around $113bn - so still the biggest rout in history (although that\u2019s not adjusted for inflation). Wall Street analysts are worried that Facebook suffered a slowdown in user growth last quarter. The number of North American daily active users on the site remained flat, while the European user base actually shrank -- following the Cambridge Analytics scandal, and new data protection rules. Bloomberg point out that several Facebook executives have been selling shares in recent months. A canny move, given today\u2019s rout.... As you can see, Facebook missed several forecasts last night (although earnings per share were better than estimated) Facebook shareholders are suffering a historic loss of value today: Colin J Sebastian, analyst at Baird, says Facebook\u2019s share price has been struck by two self-inflicted blows. Facebook dropped two \u201cbombshells\u201d on the Q2 earnings call, a significant slowdown in revenue growth for Q3/Q4, followed by operating margin declines over the next 3+ years. Importantly, these are \u201cself-inflicted\u201d issues to a large degree, as Facebook sacrifices core app monetization to drive usage/engagement of Stories. Lower margins will result from continuing large-scale investments in computing infrastructure and headcount, but without meaningful related revenue streams. While shares are moving to the \u201cpenalty box,\u201d we believe after-hours trading already embeds model changes. Maintain Outperform rating. At one stage, Facebook\u2019s shares were down a hefty 20% - wiping around $125bn off its value. That\u2019s basically the value of fast food chain McDonalds . Facebook\u2019s \u201cnightmare\u201d guidance of lower revenue growth and higher costs is causing the rout, says GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives said. \u201cIf you look at their forecast for the second half of the year in terms of user growth, and the expense profile, it refuels the fundamental worries about Facebook post-Cambridge Analytica.\u201d Facebook is tumbling in early trading on Wall Street, after the social network giant revealed the true cost of its data scandal last night. Shares in Facebook have plunged by 18% - an astonishing fall for a company of this size. They have fallen to $178.40 each, down from $217.50 before the company released its results last night. Bloomberg reckons this is Facebook\u2019s record one-day fall (unless shares recover during today\u2019s session). Investors are unfriending the company after it missed revenue and user numbers in the last three months. But the real concern is that Facebook expects to be less profitable in the coming years, as it strives to clean up its network following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, spooked investors yesterday by predicting that the revenue slowdown will continue for some time. Facebook basically admitted that the cost of improving security, and driving out fake news, will make a big dent in profitability. Crucially, Wehner warned that Facebook\u2019s operating margins will stop from their current rate of 44% (very tasty!) by around 10 percentage points. These quotes did the damage: \u201cOur total revenue-growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue-growth rates to decline by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4.\u201d \u201cLooking beyond 2018, we anticipate that total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019,\u201d \u201cOver the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend towards the mid-thirties on a percentage basis.\u201d Reaction to follow! Facebook shares have been hammered in pre-market trading....as traders prepare for the open of Wall Street.... Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, argues that investors shouldn\u2019t totally lose faith in Facebook, despite yesterday\u2019s disappointment. He writes: \u201cPerhaps the data scandal is at last beginning to bite in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Certainly, the frequent references to the other platforms available such as Instagram and the new revenue metric of how many people use at least one of the FB apps each month send a message that this is a company looking to find ways of becoming more than just a social media platform. High expectations can be a remarkable burden, and the reaction is often brutal when they are missed, but the revenue miss was slight, and $13.2 billion is not to be sniffed at. Facebook might have its wings clipped, but it is still a remarkable money-making machine. Fortune\u2019s David Meyer has a pithy explanation for how Facebook\u2019s latest results disappointed Wall Street last night: The company announced revenues and daily active user numbers that fell short of analyst estimates ($13.04 billion vs. $13.32 billion for the quarter, and 1.47 billion rather than 1.48 billion) and, more worryingly for investors, it warned that its increasing privacy efforts would hit its growth rate further in the second half of this year. Indeed, user numbers in North America are flat and those in Europe have actually fallen. So the expectation that Facebook was just going to shrug off Europe\u2019s hard-hitting new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as the privacy scandals that have plagued it through much of the year so far, was way off the mark. These things are making a difference, and they will continue to do so. More here: Facebook\u2019s stock market woes could go down in stock market history, says CNBC\u2019s Michael Santoli. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates unchanged, at its meeting today. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, an all-time low. Banks still face a negative interest rate (-0.4%) for leaving cash at the ECB\u2019s vaults rather than lending it. The ECB says it expects to leave interest rates on hold until the summer of 2019. It also affirmed that it intends to halt its asset-purchase stimulus scheme at the end of 2018 (a decision it took at its previous meeting). So no surprises here. President Mario Draghi will face the press in 45 minutes. He can expect questions about when summer starts and ends exactly (a tricky call if we get another heat wave next year). Market analyst David Jones points out that Facebook\u2019s shares hit record highs yesterday, before the company gave Wall Street a nasty shock after trading ended. Facebook shares remain on track for a massive slide when trading begins in New York, in less than two hours time. The stock is down around 20% in pre-market trading, after it missed Wall Street expectations last night and warned that profit margins will be thinner than expected in the years ahead. This would eliminate all Facebook\u2019s gains this year: Such a staggering selloff would wipe around $125bn off Facebook\u2019s value, and drag founder Mark Zuckerberg down the list of the world\u2019s top billionaires. The French government has weighed in, seeking \u2018clarification\u2019 on the agreement reached between Juncker and Trump yesterday. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire sounds concerned that France\u2019s farmers could suffer, declaring firmly that agriculture should \u201cbe kept outside the scope of the discussions\u201d on lowering trade barriers. Le Maire says: \u201cWe have high sanitary, food and environmental standards as well as rules of production to which we are attached and that guarantee the protection and safety of our consumers. Europe will not compromise on these norms.\u201d Writing in the New Statesman, Stephen Bush argues that Jean-Claude Juncker outplayed Donald Trump yesterday: In reality, it\u2019s a remarkable coup for Juncker. The EU is already seeking to buy more gas as part of the Commission\u2019s long-term efforts to wean the continent off Russian energy. The EU already has zero tariffs on soy in place, and American soybeans are currently at a low price thanks to Trump\u2019s trade war with China making them attractive to European farmers anyway. But.... that might also threaten the agreement\u2019s viability. The president might rip it up, if he decides he got the rough end of the deal. One reason why Trump\u2019s White House is so erratic is that the president\u2019s mind changes depending on which advisor is currently in favour: those wanting to avoid a trade war are currently on the up, but that could change. And that Juncker has conceded very little that the EU hasn\u2019t already conceded in practice may mean that Trump decides he\u2019s been had and that the whole mess is re-opened in the not too distant future. Britain\u2019s Department for International Trade is hoping that America will soon lift its tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. In a statement, it says: \u201cWe welcome the agreement by the U.S. and the EU to work together to reduce barriers to trade and to further increase trade and investment,\u201d \u201cWe look forward to progress towards the removal of steel and aluminium tariffs and de-escalation of the tit-for-tat action that could harm businesses and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d Overnight, China has escalated its trade dispute with America by thwarting a $44bn takeover deal. Beijing regulators sunk chipmaker Qualcomm\u2019s attempted takeover of Dutch rival NXP, by declining to approve the deal. Without a green light from China, the deal expired as the clocks struck midday in Beijing (midnight in New York) - even though eight other regulators around the globe had signed it off. This makes Qualcomm the biggest casualty yet of the Trump trade wars. It launched its takeover of NXP in October 2016, so the collapse of the deal is a serious blow. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf admitted last night that the tensions between America and China were scuppering the deal, telling Bloomberg: \u201cWe didn\u2019t see anything in the near-term that would make it worthwhile to change the timing. There were probably bigger forces at play here than just us.\u201d It\u2019s a reminder to the White House that China can make things difficult for US companies if president Trump continues to impose tariffs on their imports. The Frankfurt stock market is leading the charge this morning, as trade war relief ripples through the trading floors. The German DAX has jumped by 1.4% this morning, or 172 points, to 12,751 . Automakers are continuing to rally, thanks to Trump\u2019s pledge not to impose tariffs on car imports (in the near future, anyway). The Paris market is also upbeat, pushing France\u2019s CAC index up by 0.7%. Traders are pleased that the Juncker-Trump talk went rather better than expected, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: While there isn\u2019t exactly much substance to what was announced, with the fact the relationship didn\u2019t worsen being more notable than the plans to negotiate, it was enough to lift the spirits of the previously fearful markets. Alan Beattie of the Financial Times makes some good points about the EU-US trade announcement in this thread: Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u2019t convinced by Juncker\u2019s pledge to buy more American soybeans.... US President Trump tweeted that EU officials were going to buy more US soybeans. EU officials cannot do that. The US is already the largest exporter of soybeans to the EU. There are no subsidies, trade taxes or quotas on soybeans in the EU. Private farmers decide whether to buy more soybeans or not. Not everyone is cheering the news that America and Europe will co-operate on trade. Others noted that while the announcement marks a change in tone, it won\u2019t necessarily stop Trump from moving forward with auto tariffs later this year if he changes his mind. Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, has pointed out that Donald Trump reached similar agreements with China in 2017 - only to hit them with tariffs months later. Levy explained (via Politico) that the agreement is \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d, but.... \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to solve any of the problems the president flagged \u2013 trade deficits, tariffs, subsidies.\u201d \u201cIt looks a lot like deals struck with China last year, which of course were a prelude to a full-blown trade war. Shares in European car makers are jumping sharply, as the threat of punitive tariffs fades away. Porsche, BMW, Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen have all surged by at least 4% in early trading. Investors are relieved that Donald Trump has agreed not to slap any more tariffs on European imports - at least while officials try to hammer out closer trade ties. Before yesterday\u2019s meeting, manufacturers was bracing for America to impose 20% tariffs on European car imports, which would have made them much less competitive in the US. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says the US and EU presidents managed to stave off a transatlantic trade war yesterday. Traders do have every right to celebrate Juncker and Trump meeting because the tensions were high before the meeting as it was pretty much clear that we are heading towards a real trade war. But thanks to common sense which prevailed last night, and it eased tensions stoked by threats coming from both side. Under the agreement, both sides would hold off on other tariffs as the negotiation process continues. The joint statement by leaders did look like a fairy tale, both sides agreed to work towards zero tariffs. For Trump it does not matter what the final deal would like, but for now, it is enough for him to show the world that he delivered on his promise and he brought the Europeans to a point where he thinks that things are fair. European officials were pleasantly surprised by Donald Trump\u2019s attitude last night, reports the Financial Times: \u201cI think it was another Trump we saw in there,\u201d said one senior EU official. \u201cHe was different from the tweets and the noise, different from all that brouhaha. He was focused and engaged and clearly looking for something to help with the markets.\u201d Another person familiar with the discussions said Mr Trump was eager to find a solution to what had become a growing problem for both sides. \u201cAnyone who knows Donald Trump knows that he wants to make deals,\u201d said the person. European stock market have opened higher, as traders welcome the warming of relations between Washington and Brussels over trade. The Trump-Juncker agreement isn\u2019t really a deal, but it could turn into a game changer. So says Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank, who is reassured that America won\u2019t impose tariffs on EU car imports while negotiations continue. He writes that the two sides have taken \u201ca step away from the brink\u201d. The US-EU agreement to talk rather than to slug it out in a tit-for-tat escalation of trade barriers strengthens our base case: despite all the noise, the US will not levy new tariffs on car imports from the EU in the end. Instead, the trade tensions stoked by Trump will ease somewhat as the two sides either strike a deal fast (25%probability) or at least engage in serious negotiations (55% probability). If so, Eurozone business confidence can recover this autumn. This should allow the Eurozone to overcome its current soft patch with a return to annualised growth rates of around 2% from Q4 2018 onwards. According to Juncker, he and Trump agreed that the US and the EU should strive in their negotiations to: remove mutual tariffs on industrial goods, reform the World Trade Organization (WTO), and intensify trade in services. While the EU pledged to import more soybeans and liquefied natural gas from the US, the US will re-assess the tariffs it has already imposed on steel and aluminium imports from the EU. The EU would then lift its retaliatory measures. However, Trump isn\u2019t \u201cexactly known for consistency\u201d, so the upcoming negotiations could still founder, Schmieding adds. The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed Trump and Juncker\u2019s agreement: \u201cI am pleased to learn that the United States and European Union reached agreement today to work jointly to reduce trade barriers and, together with other partners, strengthen the WTO. The global economy can only benefit when countries engage constructively to resolve trade and investment disagreements without resort to exceptional measures.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a sense of relief in the markets today, after America and the European Union stepped away from a trade war. Following talks at the White House, Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker emerged to announce they had agreed to work together towards \u201czero\u201d tariffs, barriers and subsidies. Trump declared it was a \u201cvery big\u201d day, after Europe agreed to buy more soya beans and natural gas from America. The two sides have also agreed to work together to reform the international rules on trade. In truth, details are a bit scant -- as we covered in last night\u2019s liveblog, the two sides have mainly agreed to negotiate. But that\u2019s an improvement on threats being fired across the Atlantic over social media. Importantly, the two sides have agreed not to impose any more tariffs while they keep talking. That removes the threat of new punitive levies on European car imports. The two men even shared one of Juncker\u2019s famous kisses in the Oval Office - a fitting way to seal the d\u00e9tente. Germany\u2019s economic affairs minister, Peter Altmaier, has cheered the move, saying it will save jobs. Analysts are also optimistic, with Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada saying: This is more positive outcome than many had expected. Also coming up today Facebook\u2019s shares will get slammed when Wall Street opened, after the social media giant missed forecasts last night. It also warned that profitability will be hit by the cost of cleaning up its platform and fighting election interference. Wall Street threw something of a wobbly last night, sending Facebook\u2019s shares plunging in after-hours trading. The European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. No fireworks are expected. The ECB has already agreed a plan to wind down its stimulus programme, and it\u2019s far from ready to raise interest rates. But still, president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference could be interesting. Plus, there are new US trade figures - they might show whether Trump\u2019s tariffs have had an impact.

So some investors think this is a good opportunity to snaffle a stake in Facebook.</p> <p>Jeff Henriksen, Founder and Managing Partner, Thorpe Abbotts Capital, explains why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, the bad news. The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe. This has had a negative effect on both costs and revenue growth and caused the market to question Facebook\u2019s long-term prospects and the quality of its past performance. </p> <p>\u201cThat said, I think the market is missing the larger picture here. First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u2014even though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u2014should not be permanently impaired. Ultimately these expenses will improve earnings quality and the sustainability of the business model. We believe that it is more likely than not that Facebook\u2019s earnings will double over the next 5 years and provide a very satisfactory return for long term investors.\u201d<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5a01afe4b08b0659d55b6d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-26T17:16:51.298Z\">6.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Facebook is still on track to set an unwanted record tonight:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HoarseWisperer/status/1022518900616048640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Facebook could become the first company in world history to lose $100 billion in market cap. in a single day. <a href=\"https://t.co/uiMjIxcgiG\">pic.twitter.com/uiMjIxcgiG</a></p>&mdash; The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HoarseWisperer/status/1022518900616048640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 26, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b59fda8e4b08b0659d55b4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-26T16:59:28.719Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After a very bruising morning, Facebook shares are still down over 18% in New York.</p> <p>This has pulled the Nasdaq index into the red too; it\u2019s down around 1%, having hit record highs earlier this week.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b59f570e4b08b0659d55ae1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-26T16:26:13.435Z\">5.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u2019s still a case for investing in Facebook, despite its setbacks and the challenges ahead.</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Barringer, </strong>equity research analyst at <strong>Quilter Cheviot</strong>, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFacebook is making the changes to ensure that its place as the leading social media network is maintained following considerable scrutiny in the press and on Capitol Hill.

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser faces the threat of a cash squeeze after a key Chinese investor warned of a delay to a planned rescue deal following a legal challenge in Scotland. One industry source said that suppliers were already beginning contingency planning for a collapse into administration of the retailer as, without a cash injection, House of Fraser could struggle to pay its rent bill due at the end of September. C.banner, the owner of Hamleys, is set to invest \u00a370m in House of Fraser, which employs 6,000 people directly and a further 11,000 people at brand concessions. C.banner also plans to purchase shares in the chain from current majority owner Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, for a further \u00a370m. Full details of the plan, which was contingent on the finalisation of a restructure involving the closure of nearly half of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 stores early next year, were due to be sent to C.banner\u2019s shareholders on Thursday. This would have paved the way for a cash injection for House of Fraser over the summer. Instead, C.banner filed a note to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday warning that it may not be able to release details of its investment in House of Fraser until 31 October, as it cited a legal challenge against the store closures brought by a group of landlords. The delay came after the landlords filed a legal complaint in Edinburgh on Monday, saying that they were \u201cunfairly prejudiced\u201d in the insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) that was approved by a majority of creditors, including landlords, last month. The group, which is being advised by accountancy firm Begbies Traynor and property advisory firm JLL, also allege there were \u201cmaterial irregularities in the implementation of the House of Fraser CVA\u201d. Frank Slevin, the chair of House of Fraser, has said the group plans to \u201crobustly defend our position regarding the CVA challenge\u201d in a process that could take weeks or even months. Hopes of a deal have also deteriorated as shares in C.banner have fallen more than 70% since the end of June, partly in response to the resignation of the group\u2019s auditors. However, C.banner said it was seeking a new auditor and \u201cthere are no other circumstances connected with the resignation of Deloitte that need to be brought to the attention of holders of securities or creditors of the company\u201d. Meanwhile, trading has been tough this summer for UK department stores, which generally suffer during prolonged warm spells because shoppers prefer to be outdoors, at the beach or buying online. John Lewis on Tuesday revealed that sales were up just 0.4% in the first 25 weeks of its financial year as sales of home furnishings slid 4% and fashion sales rose just 1.2%. Debenhams is also under pressure after credit insurers, who protect retail suppliers, reduced cover for those dealing with the department store, which has issued three profit warnings this year. Industry watchers said House of Fraser had been discounting in an attempt to improve sales in a sluggish market. The trading difficulties will pile pressure on to the retailer whose parent, House of Fraser Group, which includes two Chinese outlets, slumped to a \u00a343.9m pretax loss last year from a profit of \u00a31.5m in 2016. \u201cThere is not a chance of [House of Fraser] getting the money,\u201d an industry source said. One banking source agreed that House of Fraser would need more capital by the end of September but said the company could look to its current lenders or Sanpower for new funding. Sanpower has already pumped more than \u00a325m into House of Fraser since March this year and could be prepared to stump up more. It is also possible that C.banner will waive the condition that the CVA must be finalised before it makes an investment. \u201cI suspect they are looking at anything that is feasible,\u201d the source said. Retailers across the high street are struggling for survival as a switch to buying online makes it harder to turn a profit on high street sites, many of which incurred hefty increases in business rates as a result of last year\u2019s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers have reined in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes. More than 35,000 jobs are at risk after New Look, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright announced plans to close dozens of shops while weaker chains, including Maplin, Poundworld and Toys R Us, have collapsed.",

C.banner also plans to purchase shares in the chain from current majority owner Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, for a further \u00a370m.</p> <p>Full details of the plan, which was contingent on the finalisation of a restructure involving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/house-of-fraser-to-close-more-than-half-of-its-british-stores\">the closure of nearly half of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 stores</a> early next year, were due to be sent to C.banner\u2019s shareholders on Thursday. This would have paved the way for a cash injection for House of Fraser over the summer.</p> <p>Instead, C.banner filed a note to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday warning that it may not be able to release details of its investment in House of Fraser until 31 October, as it cited a legal challenge against the store closures brought by a group of landlords.</p> <p>The delay came after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/20/house-of-fraser-landlords-take-action-over-store-closures\">landlords filed a legal complaint</a> in Edinburgh on Monday, saying that they were \u201cunfairly prejudiced\u201d in the insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) that was approved by a majority of creditors, including landlords, last month.<br></p> <p>The group, which is being advised by accountancy firm Begbies Traynor and property advisory firm JLL, also allege there were \u201cmaterial irregularities in the implementation of the House of Fraser CVA\u201d.</p> <p>Frank Slevin, the chair of House of Fraser, has said the group plans to \u201crobustly defend our position regarding the CVA challenge\u201d in a process that could take weeks or even months. Hopes of a deal have also deteriorated as shares in C.banner have fallen more than 70% since the end of June, partly in response to the resignation of the group\u2019s auditors.</p> <p>However, C.banner said it was seeking a new auditor and \u201cthere are no other circumstances connected with the resignation of Deloitte that need to be brought to the attention of holders of securities or creditors of the company\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, trading has been tough this summer for UK department stores, which generally suffer during prolonged warm spells because shoppers prefer to be outdoors, at the beach or buying online. John Lewis on Tuesday revealed that sales were up just 0.4% in the first 25 weeks of its financial year as sales of home furnishings slid 4% and fashion sales rose just 1.2%.</p> <p>Debenhams is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/15/insurance-firms-heap-pressure-on-troubled-debenhams\">under pressure after credit insurers</a>, who protect retail suppliers, reduced cover for those dealing with the department store, which has issued three profit warnings this year.</p> <p>Industry watchers said House of Fraser had been discounting in an attempt to improve sales in a sluggish market. The trading difficulties will pile pressure on to the retailer whose parent, House of Fraser Group, which includes two Chinese outlets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/house-fraser-slides-44m-loss-ahead-chinese-takeover\">slumped to a \u00a343.9m pretax loss</a> last year from a profit of \u00a31.5m in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not a chance of [House of Fraser] getting the money,\u201d an industry source said.</p> <p>One banking source agreed that House of Fraser would need more capital by the end of September but said the company could look to its current lenders or Sanpower for new funding. Sanpower has already pumped more than \u00a325m into House of Fraser since March this year and could be prepared to stump up more. It is also possible that C.banner will waive the condition that the CVA must be finalised before it makes an investment.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect they are looking at anything that is feasible,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>Retailers across the high street are struggling for survival as a switch to buying online makes it harder to turn a profit on high street sites, many of which incurred <a href=\"http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2018/May/House-of-Frasers-120m-rates-liabilities/\">hefty increases in business rates</a> as a result of last year\u2019s revaluation.

      "bodyText": "Sky posted a forecast-beating rise in annual profits on Thursday, as its chief executive said the results underlined why the company is at the centre of a \u00a326bn bidding war between Comcast and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox. Sky comfortably beat City expectations with pre-tax profits up 7.6% to \u00a3864m in the year to the end of June and revenues rising 5% to \u00a313.6bn. The company is proving resilient in the Netflix era, reporting the lowest rate of customers defecting to rivals in a decade. \u201cWhether you\u2019re an independent shareholder or part of a larger group, today\u2019s results clearly show the cultural success that you\u2019re buying into,\u201d said Jeremy Darroch, Sky\u2019s chief executive. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, which is trying to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own, is mulling making a new bid after being trumped by Comcast hours after tabling his own improved offer of \u00a324.5bn earlier this month. The results come on the eve of Sky making an appeal to the Takeover Panel at a hearing on Friday to try to force Disney, which is paying $71bn to buy Fox, to pay more for the rest of Sky. The regulator has said that under the \u201cchain principle\u201d, which is designed to make sure that minority shareholders get treated fairly, Disney must offer \u00a314 a share for the rest of Sky after taking over Fox\u2019s 39% stake. However, Sky and some shareholders believe this is too low. When Disney tabled a new bid for Fox \u2013 to see off Comcast - it raised it by 36%. Sky investors believe that at the very least the Takeover Panel should apply the same premium to what Disney should pay for the rest of Sky, which would force it to offer a minimum of \u00a314.62. This would be within touching distance of Comcast\u2019s current \u00a314.75 bid, which has been recommended to shareholders by Sky\u2019s independent committee. \u201cIf the Takeover Panel pushes Disney higher then it gives shareholders more leverage to extract a higher price from Comcast,\u201d said one Sky investor. \u201cIt puts a higher floor on the minimum Sky is worth and gives more power to investors.\u201d The most bullish of analysts and Sky\u2019s independent investors, such as Crispin Odey, believe that Sky is worth as much as \u00a318 a share, amounting to more than \u00a331bn. Sky shares closed up 0.5% at \u00a315.15 on Thursday. Because Murdoch has a deal in place with Disney, Fox must ask for consent to make a new bid for Sky. Under UK takeover rules, Disney/Fox has until 8 August to make a new bid to surpass Comcast. Such a bid could potentially come as early as Friday, following Fox shareholders voting to agree Disney\u2019s takeover. Earlier this month, Comcast pulled out of competing with Disney for Fox, instead focusing all its efforts on buying Sky. This has led some analysts to believe there may be an asset carve up between Disney and Comcast. Disney would settle for 21st Century Fox\u2019s non-Sky assets, which include the Hollywood studio behind films from X-Men to Deadpool and Avatar, and Comcast would get full control of Sky. Sky has huge strategic value to Comcast and Disney, which are looking for customer growth outside their core US markets and control of more content to compete with the rising threat of Netflix, Amazon and potentially Apple and Google as well. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on Sky now. We think it\u2019s a great business and it will fit well and it\u2019s a good use of capital,\u201d said Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, at the company\u2019s latest results on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s also unique.\u201d Disney, which has called Sky a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d, recently revealed in regulatory filings that it had upped its profit forecasts for Sky in the coming years by more than 25%. The entertainment giant made the increase in light of factors including the exceptionally good deal Sky struck in the auction for the next three-year cycle of Premier League rights. Sky, after enjoying success with original productions such as Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Emmy-nominated Patrick Melrose, has also announced it is increased its original content budget by 25% to \u00a3500m. Sky\u2019s overall content budget, including sports rights, was \u00a36.5bn last year.",

      "bodyText": "British households spent around \u00a3900 more on average than they received in income during 2017, pushing their finances into deficit for the first time since the credit boom of the 1980s. The Office for National Statistics said the shortfall amounted to nearly \u00a325bn \u2013 equal to almost a quarter of the NHS budget \u2013 and the overspend was mostly paid for with borrowed money, though households also ran down savings. The figures pose a challenge to the government, which was warned last year that Britain\u2019s consumer credit bubble of more than \u00a3200bn was unsustainable. A dramatic rise in debt-fuelled spending since 2016 has also taken place against the backdrop of the Brexit vote, which triggered a rise in inflation at a time of weak wage growth. Analysts warned that a squeeze on household incomes from benefit cuts, lacklustre wages and high inflation would continue to force poorer households to borrow more to pay basic bills. Tom Selby, a research analyst at financial adviser AJ Bell, said the figures presented ministers with a significant challenge as they sought \u201cto build financial resilience in the UK\u201d. Researchers at the ONS said the situation was worse than at any time on record after the \u00a325bn deficit last year surpassed the \u00a3300m deficit recorded in 1988. British household finances also slumped from being among the most solvent in the 1990s to being among the most indebted compared with households in other major western countries. The report \u2013 titled \u201cMaking ends meet: are households living beyond their means?\u201d \u2013 found that the deficit among UK households, equivalent to 1.2% of GDP, contrasted with a surplus in France equivalent to 2.7% of GDP and a surplus equivalent to 5.1% in Germany. Last year official data showed unsecured credit \u2013 such as credit cards and payday loans \u2013 climbed to a record high of more than \u00a3205bn while the consultancy PwC said its own measure showed consumer debts rising above \u00a3300bn. The ONS said households took out nearly \u00a380bn in loans in 2017, the most in a decade. But they deposited just \u00a337bn with UK banks, the least since 2011. Households accumulated more debt than they acquired in assets even when their investments in bonds, shares and pensions were included. Anti-poverty charities warned that millions of low income households were the worst affected. StepChange, which provides advice for indebted households, said the poorest were in constant need of credit to keep their heads above water. The charity\u2019s chief executive, Phil Andrew, criticised the ONS for saying that households were living beyond their means, which he said implied they could cut back if they wanted to. \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that this very useful data is so heavily sprinkled with the phrase that households are \u2018living beyond their means\u2019. The reality is that too many households, here in Britain, in 2018, simply cannot make ends meet, however hard they try.\u201d He added: \u201cNot having enough money to make ends meet is not the same thing as living beyond your means \u2013 which implies you have a choice, when too many people do not.\u201d According to ONS figures, the poorest 10% of households spent two and a half times their disposable income, on average, in the financial year ending 2017 \u2013 while the richest 10% spent less than half of their available income during the same period. The ONS said a rise in interest rates, expected to be pushed through by the Bank of England next week, could encourage greater saving and an improvement in household finances. But AJ Bell\u2019s Selby said: \u201cFor people having to borrow to make ends meet, saving for the future might feel like a luxury they simply cannot afford.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>British households spent around \u00a3900 more on average than they received in income during 2017, pushing their finances into deficit for the first time since the credit boom of the 1980s. </p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the shortfall amounted to nearly \u00a325bn \u2013 equal to almost a quarter of the NHS budget \u2013 and the overspend was mostly paid for with borrowed money, though households also ran down savings.</p> <p>The figures pose a challenge to the government, which was warned last year that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/uks-200bn-consumer-debt-unsustainable-sp-warns\">Britain\u2019s consumer credit bubble of more than \u00a3200bn was unsustainable</a>. A dramatic rise in debt-fuelled spending since 2016 has also taken place against the backdrop of the Brexit vote, which triggered a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/first-post-brexit-data-shows-uk-inflation-rose-to-06-in-july\">rise in inflation at a time of weak wage growth</a>.</p> <p>Analysts warned that a squeeze on household incomes from benefit cuts, lacklustre wages and high inflation would continue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/08/uk-consumers-trapped-in-credit-card-debt-for-longer-than-thought\">to force poorer households to borrow more to pay basic bills</a>.</p> <p>Tom Selby, a research analyst at financial adviser AJ Bell, said the figures presented ministers with a significant challenge as they sought \u201cto build financial resilience in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Researchers at the ONS said the situation was worse than at any time on record after the \u00a325bn deficit last year surpassed the \u00a3300m deficit recorded in 1988. British household finances also slumped from being among the most solvent in the 1990s to being among the most indebted compared with households in other major western countries.</p> <p>The report \u2013 titled \u201cMaking ends meet: are households living beyond their means?\u201d \u2013 found that the deficit among UK households, equivalent to 1.2% of GDP, contrasted with a surplus in France equivalent to 2.7% of GDP and a surplus equivalent to 5.1% in Germany.</p> <p>Last year official data showed unsecured credit \u2013 such as credit cards and payday loans \u2013 climbed to a record high of more than \u00a3205bn while the consultancy PwC said its own measure <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/uk_s-unsecured-debt-mountain-reaches-p300bn-or-p11-000-per-house.html\">showed consumer debts rising above \u00a3300bn</a>.</p> <p>The ONS said households took out nearly \u00a380bn in loans in 2017, the most in a decade. But they deposited just \u00a337bn with UK banks, the least since 2011. Households accumulated more debt than they acquired in assets even when their investments in bonds, shares and pensions were included.</p> <p>Anti-poverty charities warned that millions of low income households were the worst affected. </p> <p>StepChange, which provides advice for indebted households, said the poorest were in constant need of credit to keep their heads above water.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The charity\u2019s chief executive, Phil Andrew, criticised the ONS for saying that households were living beyond their means, which he said implied they could cut back if they wanted to. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that this very useful data is so heavily sprinkled with the phrase that households are \u2018living beyond their means\u2019. The reality is that too many households, here in Britain, in 2018, simply cannot make ends meet, however hard they try.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cNot having enough money to make ends meet is not the same thing as living beyond your means \u2013 which implies you have a choice, when too many people do not.\u201d</p> <p>According to ONS figures, the poorest 10% of households spent two and a half times their disposable income, on average, in the financial year ending 2017 \u2013 while the richest 10% spent less than half of their available income during the same period. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The ONS said a rise in interest rates, expected to be pushed through by the Bank of England next week, could encourage greater saving and an improvement in household finances.</p> <p>But AJ Bell\u2019s Selby said: \u201cFor people having to borrow to make ends meet, saving for the future might feel like a luxury they simply cannot afford.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A growing thirst for gin among UK consumers boosted annual sales at the drinks firm Diageo, which benefited from the launch of a pink version of the spirit. The international drinks group said total UK sales rose 8% in the year to the end of June, thanks to a double-digit rise in sales of Tanqueray and Gordon\u2019s, which introduced a pink gin last summer. Gin sales helped to offset the waning popularity of vodka, with sales of Smirnoff down 2%. Sales at the group\u2019s Guinness business were also strong in the UK, up 8%, driven partly by its new Hop House 13 lager, which uses the same yeast as the Irish stout. Diageo said gin was the fastest-growing category across western Europe, with sales up 22%. Gordon\u2019s launched its pink gin last summer, capitalising on the Instagram-inspired popularity of colourful drinks and cocktails. The trend has been linked to a penchant for kitsch among millennials, with unicorns and flamingos appearing on everything from pool inflatables to biscuits this summer. The brand\u2019s pink gin, which is flavoured with raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant, competes with drinks such as Burleighs\u2019 version containing preserved Japanese cherry blossom, pink grapefruit, hibiscus and rose flowers, and a Beefeater tipple flavoured with strawberries, which launched in the UK this spring. Flavoured gins have accelerated a revival of gin that began in 2009 with the launch of the Sipsmith craft brand and was followed by the launch of dozens of local distilleries. Supermarkets have also cashed in with own-label craft sprits, while the discounters Aldi and Lidl have put premium flavoured gins at the heart of their plans for Christmas this year. Internationally, Diageo said sales of gin rose 14%, only outperformed by tequila \u2013 sales of which soared 56%, driven by strong growth in the US and Mexico \u2013 while vodka dived 6% and rum was down 4%. \u201cThe resurgent European gin market is compensating for weaker vodka sales \u2026 The gin craze that is helping Fever-Tree reach spectacular new heights is powering Diageo, too,\u201d Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com, said. An overall 5% rise in sales to \u00a312.2bn, slightly ahead of expectations, helped lift operating profits by 4% to \u00a33.7bn.

    "webTitle": "Trump-Juncker 'talks about talks' met with scepticism", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In Donald Trump\u2019s The Art of the Deal, the future US president extolled the value of talking big. \u201cPeople want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular,\u201d Trump wrote, or at least his ghostwriter did. \u201cI call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2013 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201d Standing alongside the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in the rose garden of the White House on Wednesday, Trump stuck with that tried and tested philosophy. \u201cThis was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed,\u201d he boasted after their three-and-a-half hour meeting. In response, Juncker, more muted but still vulnerable to the charge of exaggeration, told reporters: \u201cI came for a deal \u2013 we made a deal.\u201d But what did it really amount to? \u201cTalks about talks,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat attached to a member state. In return for Trump not escalating the continuing transatlantic trade war by hammering European, particularly German, carmakers, the EU said it will open negotiations on zero tariffs and non-tariff barriers on industrial goods, apart from cars and car parts. It will also hold off on a further raft of retaliatory tariffs on \u20ac20bn (\u00a317.8bn) of goods, including suitcases and photocopiers, which were lined up to join the levies on US products including agricultural goods, Harley Davidson motorcycles and bourbon. Juncker mysteriously suggested the EU would be importing a load of soya beans to help farmers in the US midwest hit by Chinese tariffs. The EU also wanted to import a greater amount of liquified natural gas (LNG), Juncker said. \u201cBut these are decisions made by private companies \u2013 unless the commission is suddenly going to be buying up beans,\u201d a puzzled EU diplomat said. On returning to Brussels, EU officials who had been with Juncker and Trump in Washington conceded that, indeed, the promises had been made with full knowledge that market forces would lead to increases in imports of soya beans and LNG, rather than any action by the EU. \u201cWe are not going to turn into a Soviet-style economy,\u201d one said. LNG is becoming a cheap alternative for Europe. The EU announced in December that it would invest \u20ac101.4m in the construction of a terminal in Krk, Croatia, as part of its attempt to diversify and reduce dependence on Russian pipelines. Meanwhile, a 25% tariff imposed by China on US soy imports earlier this month is expected to reshape the global market. Brazil, the second-largest producer behind the US, will sell more to China. US exporters will therefore turn to Europe, where there will be less competition due to Bras\u00edlia\u2019s change of focus. The import figures in six months\u2019 time will bear out Juncker\u2019s promise. And, as positive as the trade deal on industrial goods sounded \u2013 a bastardisation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership aborted by Trump \u2013 the EU has a policy of not agreeing deals with states that are not signed up to the Paris climate deal, so it is difficult to see where it will go. Guntram Wolff, the director of the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels, said the White House talks, for all that, should be seen as a success for both sides. The US president had been coming under domestic pressure as exporters started to feel the effect of existing EU tariffs, and may have been looking for a way to avoid further escalation ahead of the US mid-term elections. Juncker was able to buy the German car industry more time. While refusing to engage in the hand-holding that caused Theresa May trouble, he was clearly also able to build a personal relationship with the US president. An EU official said: \u201cThere is, to a certain extent, good chemistry between President Juncker and President Trump,\u201d an EU official said. \u201cBut to quote Harold Wilson, \u2018a week is a very long time in politics\u2019.\u201d Indeed, there remains deep scepticism among EU member states. France and the Netherlands had been particularly strong on not wanting the commission to negotiate with Trump unless he withdrew the punitive tariffs on European steel and aluminium that started the trade war in the first place. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, was one of those who insisted the EU would not negotiate with a gun to its head, and had called for the metal tariffs to be dropped in order for wider trade negotiations to progress. The 28 member states had additionally agreed at a summit in Sofia in May that any deal on industrial goods with the US would come with a price tag in the form of a deal on public procurement, opening up US contracts to EU providers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give away anything for free,\u201d said an EU diplomat. \u201cAnd that gun is on the table and the bazooka of tariffs on cars is just in the cupboard and could come back at any time.\u201d France\u2019s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, expressed wariness over the talks with Trump. \u201cEach side, the Europeans and the Americans, must find something in these discussions. Any trade deal must be based on reciprocity. We don\u2019t want to enter into a negotiation [on] a wide-ranging deal,\u201d he said. Le Maire added that previous failures to make progress on a free-trade deal showed the limits of a potential agreement. Paris will insist the EU should not make concessions \u201cunder constraint\u201d. Concessions by Brussels need to be matched by those from Washington, a French source said. And the US must \u201crespect EU standards and norms\u201d. A senior diplomat, in reference to Neville Chamberlain, told The Guardian: \u201cMaybe it is a good deal \u2013 we will have to see. But maybe it is just \u2018peace for our time\u2019, and that\u2019s a different matter.\u201d",

It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2013 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201d</p> <p>Standing alongside the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in the rose garden of the White House on Wednesday, Trump stuck with that tried and tested philosophy. \u201cThis was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed,\u201d he boasted after their three-and-a-half hour meeting.</p> <p>In response, Juncker, more muted but still vulnerable to the charge of exaggeration, told reporters: \u201cI came for a deal \u2013 we made a deal.\u201d</p> <p>But what did it really amount to? \u201cTalks about talks,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat attached to a member state. </p> <p>In return for Trump not escalating the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/25/tariffs-greatest-tweets-trump-before-meeting-juncker-eu\">continuing transatlantic trade war</a> by hammering European, particularly German, carmakers, the EU said it will open negotiations on zero tariffs and non-tariff barriers on industrial goods, apart from cars and car parts.</p> <p>It will also hold off on a further raft of retaliatory tariffs on \u20ac20bn (\u00a317.8bn) of goods, including suitcases and photocopiers, which were lined up to join the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/25/harley-davidson-production-us-eu-tariffs-motorcycles\">levies on US products</a> including agricultural goods, Harley Davidson motorcycles and bourbon.</p> <p>Juncker mysteriously suggested the EU would be importing a load of soya beans to help farmers in the US midwest <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/24/trump-farmers-aid-emergency-billions-tariffs-latest-news\">hit by Chinese tariffs</a>.</p> <p>The EU also wanted to import a greater amount of liquified natural gas (LNG), Juncker said.</p> <p>\u201cBut these are decisions made by private companies \u2013 unless the commission is suddenly going to be buying up beans,\u201d a puzzled EU diplomat said. </p> <p>On returning to Brussels, EU officials who had been with Juncker and Trump in Washington conceded that, indeed, the promises had been made with full knowledge that market forces would lead to increases in imports of soya beans and LNG, rather than any action by the EU. \u201cWe are not going to turn into a Soviet-style economy,\u201d one said.</p> <p>LNG is becoming a cheap alternative for Europe. The EU announced in December that it would invest \u20ac101.4m in the construction of a terminal in Krk, Croatia, as part of its attempt to diversify and reduce <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/24/eu-blueprint-energy-union-russian-gas-gazprom-maros-sefcovic\">dependence on Russian pipelines</a>. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a 25% <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/04/vaccines-and-golf-carts-the-chinese-products-targeted-by-trump\">tariff imposed by China</a> on US soy imports earlier this month is expected to reshape the global market. Brazil, the second-largest producer behind the US, will sell more to China. US exporters will therefore turn to Europe, where there will be less competition due to Bras\u00edlia\u2019s change of focus. The import figures in six months\u2019 time will bear out Juncker\u2019s promise.</p> <p>And, as positive as the trade deal on industrial goods sounded \u2013 a bastardisation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership aborted by Trump \u2013 the EU has a policy of not agreeing deals with states that are not signed up to the Paris climate deal, so it is difficult to see where it will go.</p> <p>Guntram Wolff, the director of the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels, said the White House talks, for all that, should be seen as a success for both sides. The US president had been coming under domestic pressure as exporters started to feel the effect of existing EU tariffs, and may have been looking for a way to avoid further escalation ahead of the US mid-term elections.</p> <p>Juncker was able to buy the German car industry more time. While refusing to engage in the hand-holding that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/20/trump-was-being-a-gentleman-when-he-held-my-hand-says-may\">caused Theresa May trouble</a>, he was clearly also able to build a personal relationship with the US president.</p> <p>An EU official said: \u201cThere is, to a certain extent, good chemistry between President Juncker and President Trump,\u201d an EU official said. \u201cBut to quote Harold Wilson, \u2018a week is a very long time in politics\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, there remains deep scepticism among EU member states. France and the Netherlands had been particularly strong on not wanting the commission to negotiate with Trump unless he withdrew the punitive tariffs on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/30/trump-administration-tariff-steel-aluminum-eu-trade-tension\">European steel and aluminium</a> that started the trade war in the first place.</p> <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, was one of those who insisted the EU would not negotiate with a gun to its head, and had called for the metal tariffs to be dropped in order for wider trade negotiations to progress.</p> <p>The 28 member states had additionally agreed at a summit in Sofia in May that any deal on industrial goods with the US would come with a price tag in the form of a deal on public procurement, opening up US contracts to EU providers.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give away anything for free,\u201d said an EU diplomat. \u201cAnd that gun is on the table and the bazooka of tariffs on cars is just in the cupboard and could come back at any time.\u201d</p> <p>France\u2019s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, expressed wariness over the talks with Trump.</p> <p>\u201cEach side, the Europeans and the Americans, must find something in these discussions.

      "bodyText": "The latest inflation data from the Bureau of Statistics quickly put an end to any thoughts of another interest rate rise. The consumer price index growth of 2.1% at first glance suggested that inflation was finally back within the Reserve Bank\u2019s 2%-3% target range. But further analysis shows that inflation growth remains very much absent from the economy, except for items households cannot avoid. It says something about the lack of inflation growth that we have reached a point where growth of 2.1% could be in any way considered strong enough for the RBA to think about increasing rates. The RBA\u2019s target range is 2% to 3%, meaning that it really only needs to think about increasing interest rates if the growth looks to be heading above 3%. Right now the economy is flat out getting above 2%. And while the latest CPI figures show inflation at 2.1% the RBA\u2019s core inflation measure of the trimmed mean actually fell very slightly and at 1.9% is under the 2% mark for the 10th straight quarter: Even if we look at a quarterly growth basis, there is no sign of an impending inflation boom. Both the CPI and the trimmed mean recorded slower growth in the June quarter than in the preceding March quarter: And the lack of inflation is even more apparent when you consider that one of the biggest drivers of CPI growth was alcohol and tobacco prices. The thing about those items \u2013 especially tobacco \u2013 is that their prices are not driven by demand. There is no great influx of people taking up smoking. The driver of tobacco prices are increases in excise \u2013 meaning that its influence on inflation growth gives a somewhat skewed view of the level of demand in the economy. If we exclude alcohol and tobacco then the CPI grew by just 1.7% on the past year: The other big driver of inflation recently has been petrol prices. Across the nation they rose 16.3% over the past year \u2013 the fastest annual growth for a decade: That price is driven by international factors and says little about the level of demand in our economy. So forget thoughts of the RBA hitting the interest rate lever. There is nothing in these figures that would have the RBA thinking that inflation is about to return to previously normal levels, let alone growing too fast. For core inflation to get back to the RBA midpoint of 2.5% within the next six months inflation would have to grow in that time at a pace not seen for five years. But that does not mean everyone is experiencing low increases in their cost of living, or that even with low wages growth things aren\u2019t too bad because inflation is low. The problem is that the picture of inflation is quite varied across the nation and also across the range of things that we buy. In Melbourne for example CPI did grow in the past year by 2.5%, but in Perth it rose just 1.1%: Across the capital cities, inflation in Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra was above the national average of 2.1%: And a clear driver of inflation in those cities is housing costs \u2013 rents and utility costs as well as property rates and charges. Here we come to the problem of the low level of inflation not matching up with the reality of people\u2019s lives. Across the nation the biggest contributors to inflation growth over the past nine months have been petrol, health, tobacco and education costs. Aside from tobacco, those are pretty hard categories to avoid spending money on. The items that have most driven down inflation in that period have been AV equipment and international holidays \u2013 not exactly essentials. If we look at the average annual growth of essential spending groups such as food and beverages, housing, education, health, and insurance compared with recreation and culture (which includes AV equipments, holidays travel, books, and sporting activities), we see aside from food and beverages, the essential groups have vastly outpaced inflation: And while even housing costs have in general moderated over the past few years compared to what they were growing at when inflation was last soaring prior to the GFC, they remain well above wages growth and vastly outpacing the price rises of recreation and culture items: It means that while general inflation remains relatively poor, households are not seeing many gains because aside from food, the lowest rises are coming in areas that are often forgone when essential bills need to paid. And it is why, regardless of the level of inflation, until we see wages growth start to rise closer to 3%, there is little sign either of the economy of households able to handle an interest rate rise. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australian columnist",
