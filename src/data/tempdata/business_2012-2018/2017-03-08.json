      "bodyText": "The UK economy will confound forecasts for a Brexit-related slowdown through 2017, but will then quickly run out of steam as rising prices hit consumer spending, the Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted. The government\u2019s independent forecaster said that since its November outlook, the economy had performed better than expected and it raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 2% from 1.4%. But it predicts growth will be slower than previously thought in 2018, at just 1.6%. The new forecasts still paint a gloomier picture for growth than those published this time last year, when the UK was yet to vote for Brexit. Setting out the new forecasts, the OBR\u2019s chairman, Robert Chote, said the pattern of growth it envisaged had changed to one where the economy expands more quickly this year then slows, rather than the other way round as forecast in November. But the result in five years\u2019 time was roughly the same in terms of where the economy would end up. The more significant changes were on the public finance forecasts, with the OBR now expecting the government to borrow significantly less this financial year. Setting out the new growth outlook, Chote said: \u201cThe economy ended 2016 with greater momentum than we expected, thanks to the great British consumer, but the outlook over the medium term is little changed.\u201d He warned that support to the economy from household spending was set to wane as people contend with higher prices. He also flagged a recent trend for people to dip into their savings to spend. Chote noted that spending grew but incomes were flat in the final months of 2016, a pattern that implied a \u201csharp fall in household saving\u201d. The OBR thinks that in the fourth quarter of last year the saving ratio \u2013 which estimates the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income \u2013 turned negative for the first time since mid-2008. \u201cThis pace of decline cannot continue indefinitely and we don\u2019t assume that it [will],\u201d said Chote. The OBR is far from alone in making big revisions to the growth outlook for this year, and the move follows a pattern of forecasters being forced to upgrade the UK\u2019s prospects as the economic news since the Brexit vote has repeatedly confounded predictions of a slowdown. The Bank of England recently raised its forecast for 2017 growth to 2.0% from 1.4%. But most forecasters, including the OBR, caution that the outlook is uncertain and that growth will most likely be slower in 2018 as higher inflation knocks spending. Inflation has been rising on the back of higher oil prices and as imports have become more expensive because of the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote. Living costs are expected to rise further this year. The OBR forecasts inflation will rise from the 0.7% rate enjoyed by consumers over 2016 to 2.4% this year and stand at 2.3% in 2018. But that is below the Bank\u2019s forecast for inflation to peak at 2.7% in early 2018. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), a respected thinktank, described the OBR\u2019s inflation forecast as \u201ctoo conservative\u201d. Its own prediction is for inflation to peak at around 3.7% at the end of this year. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also took issue with the OBR\u2019s outlook. \u201cThe OBR is too bullish about the UK\u2019s near-term growth prospects. We expect that inflation will be a greater challenge to the UK economy than the OBR currently predicts, with price growth overtaking pay growth this year. This is likely to squeeze consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth,\u201d said its head of economics, Suren Thiru. The OBR conceded there were risks to its forecasts, including that consumers do not behave as it expects. As the government prepares to trigger article 50 to leave the EU, the forecasting group also highlighted the role of the Brexit process, which will mean new policies are introduced. \u201cThese policies, and the response of households and businesses to them, are subject to great uncertainty and there is little by way of precedent on which to base any forecast assumptions,\u201d the OBR said. The newest member of the OBR\u2019s budget responsibility committee, economist Sir Charlie Bean, also had some words of caution for anyone seeking to interpret this latest set of economic forecasts. Referring to the way official statistics get repeatedly revised over years, he told reporters: \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happened in the past.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Loss-making Royal Bank of Scotland has awarded bonuses in shares to its top management team worth almost \u00a316m. The bank revealed the bonus awards to nine executives an hour after Philip Hammond delivered his budget and said he was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to when the Treasury would be able to sell off any of its 73% stake in the bailed-out bank. The announcement by the Edinburgh-based bank also included details of \u00a36m in bonuses that have been paid out after being awarded in previous years. Last month, when RBS reported losses of \u00a38bn for 2016, the bank\u2019s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, had attempted to justify the need to pay bonuses by saying staff should not be penalised for the \u201csins of the past\u201d. A year ago, the management team were awarded bonuses worth \u00a317.4m. Since RBS\u2019s \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout during the financial crisis, it has reported nine consecutive years of losses amounting to more than \u00a358bn. The bonuses being awarded will not pay out before 2020. They shed light on the payouts to executives outside the boardroom, such as Chris Marks, the head of the investment banking operation, NatWest Markets, who was awarded shares of more than \u00a32m. Other awards include \u00a31.8m to Alison Rose, who runs the commercial bank, and \u00a31.2m for Les Matheson, the head of the high street banking business. The pay of Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, was disclosed last month at more than \u00a33m for 2016. He was also awarded nearly \u00a33m in shares that he will start to receive from 2021, provided performance criteria are reached. Hammond has said he will not be able to sell any RBS shares while the bank awaits a penalty from the US Department of Justice for mis-selling toxic bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis and fights with Brussels over the sale of 300 branches mandated at the time of its bailout. In the documents published alongside the budget, the goverment said it \u201cwould continue to seek opportunities for disposals, but the need to resolve legacy issues makes it uncertain as to when these will occur\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A big fall is expected in the number of people dying in the UK this year, according to one of Britain\u2019s biggest funeral providers. Shares in Dignity, the only funeral company listed on the stock exchange, closed down 17% on Wednesday at \u00a322.96, wiping \u00a3232m of the company\u2019s value, after it also revealed it was facing greater competition as new firms entered the unregulated sector. Dignity suggested the number of deaths could fall by about 5% to 560,000 this year, in line with long-term trends, following an unusually high number of deaths of about 590,000 in both 2015 and 2016. \u201cHistorical data would suggest that deaths in 2017 could be significantly lower than 2015 and 2016,\u201d the group, which provides funerals and operates crematoria, said. In 2015 the number rose by 7% to 588,000 and was slightly higher still in 2016 at 590,000. Dignity described the shift as extraordinary. However, despite the rise in deaths, the number of funerals conducted by Dignity last year fell by almost 3,000 to 70,700. The company said it was losing market share and facing greater competition, particularly in funerals and companies offering pre-arranged funeral plans where lack of regulation was encouraging new entrants in the market. Dignity said it was also seeing businesses offering digital services in the funeral market. Mike McCollum, the chief executive, said Dignity was actively seeking regulation of its markets: \u201cLooking into the future, we anticipate further engagement with the Scottish and Westminster parliaments, as we believe regulation of the funeral and pre-arranged funeral markets is necessary to ensure every family receives minimum standards of care from appropriate facilities. \u201cWe also expect to invest more in digital technologies that will help our clients and also act as a source of new business for the group.\u201d He added the company was introducing more affordable services that would appeal to customers \u201cwe would not normally expect to be able to help\u201d. An average Dignity funeral would cost about \u00a34,000, at the higher end of the market, McCollum said. However, in late 2016 it launched a direct cremation service, Simplicity Cremations. The service costs from \u00a31,495, where the company collects the deceased from the place of death and takes them directly to the crematorium, before returning the ashes to the bereaved. There is no funeral service. Both David Bowie and the novelist Anita Brookner opted for direct cremations. \u201cIt is a very stripped down service,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cFunerals are very traditional and people rely on traditions when they\u2019re bereaved. This is an alternative form of funeral and it\u2019s going to take a long time to be widely adopted but we are responding to a demand.\u201d Dignity said its expectations for financial performance in 2017 were unchanged but it lowered its medium-term target for earnings per share growth to 8% a year from 10%, which weighed on shares. Sam England, analyst at the German bank Berenberg, said the company had actually performed well, with the results for 2016 beating expectations and the group signalling a strong start to 2017. Revenue rose by 3% to \u00a3313.6m in the 53 weeks to 30 December 2016, compared with the 52 weeks to 25 December in 2015. Pre-tax profit also rose 3% to \u00a371.2m.",

Dignity said it was also seeing businesses offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/08/death-apps-everest-cake-safebeyond-everplans-afternote-funerals\">digital services</a> in the funeral market.</p> <p>Mike McCollum, the chief executive, said Dignity was actively seeking regulation of its markets: \u201cLooking into the future, we anticipate further engagement with the Scottish and Westminster parliaments, as we believe regulation of the funeral and pre-arranged funeral markets is necessary to ensure every family receives minimum standards of care from appropriate facilities. </p> <p>\u201cWe also expect to invest more in digital technologies that will help our clients and also act as a source of new business for the group.\u201d</p> <p>He added the company was introducing more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/21/cost-of-living-what-about-the-cost-of-being-dead\">affordable services</a> that would appeal to customers \u201cwe would not normally expect to be able to help\u201d. </p> <p>An average Dignity funeral would cost about \u00a34,000, at the higher end of the market, McCollum said. However, in late 2016 it launched a direct cremation service, Simplicity Cremations. The service costs from \u00a31,495, where the company collects the deceased from the place of death and takes them directly to the crematorium, before returning the ashes to the bereaved. There is no funeral service.</p> <p>Both David Bowie and the novelist Anita Brookner opted for direct cremations.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a very stripped down service,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cFunerals are very traditional and people rely on traditions when they\u2019re bereaved. This is an alternative form of funeral and it\u2019s going to take a long time to be widely adopted but we are responding to a demand.\u201d </p> <p>Dignity said its expectations for financial performance in 2017 were unchanged but it lowered its medium-term target for earnings per share growth to 8% a year from 10%, which weighed on shares.</p> <p>Sam England, analyst at the German bank Berenberg, said the company had actually performed well, with the results for 2016 beating expectations and the group signalling a strong start to 2017.</p> <p>Revenue rose by 3% to \u00a3313.6m in the 53 weeks to 30 December 2016, compared with the 52 weeks to 25 December in 2015.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis has been reprimanded by the advertising watchdog for running a Black Friday promotion offering the Apple Watch on sale, only to pull it from its website until the next day when it was marked up to full price. The ruling is a blow to the reputation of John Lewis, which prides itself on its clean corporate image. The retailer argued that the breach of the UK advertising code was a misunderstanding. In November, a promotion ran on johnlewis.com advertising the Apple Watch at \u00a3249 as part of its promise to match competitors\u2019 prices. The company, which has used the strapline \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d since 1925, ran the Apple Watch promotion at the same time as pushing a four-day Black Friday sales event promising that \u201cwe\u2019ve lowered hundreds of prices this weekend\u201d. The Advertising Standards Authority received a complaint from a shopper, who found that the Apple Watch was listed as out of stock when she tried to buy it but that it was made available the following day at full price. John Lewis said the Apple Watch deal had proved so popular that a decision was made to pull it from the price match sale over concerns they would not have enough stock to fulfil all orders. The company said it had boosted the Apple Watch back to full price the next day because the competitor had stopped running its promotion, and listed it as out of stock online until after the separate four-day Black Friday sale ended. John Lewis admitted that it might have stopped selling the discounted Apple Watch online sooner than it could have done. The company said that removing stock from sale was \u201cnot a decision we would take lightly\u201d and that it had been done in good faith because Black Friday is the biggest retailing day of the year. The department store group reported its best ever weekly revenues of almost \u00a3200m last year thanks to Black Friday. The ASA said the advertising code states that promotions must be run \u201cequitably, promptly and efficiently and be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants\u201d. It added: \u201cWe considered John Lewis\u2019s action to make a product unavailable on their website while their competitor\u2019s promotion was still running denied online consumers the opportunity to purchase at the price-match price, despite John Lewis still having stock available. We told John Lewis Partnership to ensure they dealt fairly with consumers in future. \u201cWe told them to avoid causing unnecessary disappointment and not to withhold availability of promotional stock.\u201d A spokeswoman for the retailer said the issue had arisen because of a mix-up in interpretation of two different deals and the very limited stock of Apple Watches. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the ASA\u2019s decision,\u201d said the spokeswoman. \u201cWe believe this is due to a misunderstanding of the difference between a one-day unplanned price match applied because of our never knowingly undersold policy and planned John Lewis four-day Black Friday promotions.\u201d The company said the breach of the UK ad code had prompted it to review how it advertises multiple promotions and deals \u201cto avoid any possible confusion happening again\u201d. \u201cWe had very limited stock and continued to sell the watches in our shops, matching the competitor\u2019s promotion for the one day that it ran,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cRemoving stock from sale is not a decision we would take lightly.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Finance sector could face climate-risk testing, says Australian watchdog", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s financial institutions could be required to test climate-risk scenarios as international regulators continue to warn of the economic dangers posed by climate change. Geoff Summerhayes, executive board member of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told a Senate committee that climate scenario testing could be added to the other common scenarios Apra requires financial institutions to face to ensure their systems are robust. It\u2019s been more than a year since the COP21 Paris climate change conference, when the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg was appointed to head a taskforce to provide investors, insurers, banks and consumers with more information. The move was part of plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system. Last month Summerhayes warned climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Apra is the regulator that oversees the $6tn industry made up of banks, building societies, superannuation, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Summerhayes said Apra already sent out common scenarios for institutions to test. These scenarios have an economic factor, including an asset price shock and, in the case of the insurance industry, a potential liabilities scenario as well. \u201cIt is possible in the future that climate could be such a risk that we would want to test,\u201d Summerhayes said. \u201cThat is not in our current plans but it is possible as other emerging risks are, that we would scenario test.\u201d He acknowledged the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) had been very active on climate change. The bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has warned of financial crises and falling living standards unless corporations faced up to the risks. \u201cApra is not first prudential regulator to make statements about climate,\u201d he said. Emma Herd, the chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change, told the committee the political debate in recent years had stopped companies speaking publicly about their strategic response to climate change. \u201cIn terms of company reporting, the challenge for companies is that \u2026 any statement that is made around climate change as a financial risk is then interpreted through the prism of the political debate,\u201d Herd said. \u201cSo companies have to be incredibly cautious about statements that they are making and constantly apply that political lens and I think that is creating a level of conservatism that is inhibiting how companies talk about their strategic response to climate change. \u201cCompanies are often much more prepared to talk fully and frankly to investors about their view than they are to talk publicly and into the public debate because it is just seen through the prism of the debate of the last 10 years.\u201d Herd revealed unpublished research from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors from 1 March this year, in which an analysis of 167 ASX 200 companies found there were large gaps in corporate reporting. It found: Only 69 companies (41%) publicly state that they acknowledge climate science or identify and assess climate risk; Only 106 companies (63%) report on their greenhouse gas emissions; Only 36 companies (22%) publicly report on climate change-related targets. Herd said reports were very short on detail with many companies simply disclosing their emissions. Very few disclosed a strategy for dealing with the climate-related issues that might affect the businesses, or report on mitigating these risks. Summerhayes said his climate warning last month came about due to three factors: Australia\u2019s Paris commitments, the Bloomberg taskforce and the legal opinion by Noel Hutley SC for the Centre for Policy Development and the Future Business Council on company directors\u2019 duties and climate change. Last month he said: \u201cThe opinion found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act.\u201d Summerhayes said climate was an active discussion in many of the institutions supervised by Apra. \u201cMarkers that have been put down in the last year are significant and markets are already adjusting to those markers and the extent to which the draft report to FSB is adopted or not, we are of the view that a transition is under way to a lower-carbon world and that has implications on the risks that Apra-regulated entities need to oversee. \u201cHence we expect them to be having a conversation about it.\u201d Kate O\u2019Rourke of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulatory framework was flexible enough to accommodate scenario testing and companies could choose to dramatically change their information disclosures on climate risks. Last month a coalition of business, energy, climate and welfare groups issued a joint statement warning that a decade of partisan politics and finger-pointing had destroyed investor confidence in Australia\u2019s energy sector. The Senate inquiry, initiated by Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and restarted after the federal election, is looking into carbon risk and disclosure in corporate Australia.",

      "bodyText": "Supermarket giant Sainsbury\u2019s has scaled back an ambitious target to get consumers to halve their household food waste after finding it was more difficult than expected to achieve behavioural change. Sainsbury\u2019s launched its \u201cWaste Less, Save More\u201d programme in 2016 \u2013 a \u00a310m five-year plan to help customers save money by reducing their food waste. Using official statistics showing that the average UK family throws away \u00a3700 of food each year, the supermarket set a target of getting households to slash this by 50%. But at the end of a one-year \u00a31m trial in the market town of Swadlincote, Derbyshire \u2013 the first in the UK to engage consumers and find new ways to reduce their waste \u2013 it has been abandoned as it is unlikely to be met. The goal is in line with the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development target of halving per capita global food waste at retail and consumer level and reducing food losses along production and supply chains by 2030. The UN estimates that global food loss and waste causes about $940bn (\u00a3770bn) a year in economic losses, with a third of the world\u2019s food wasted while one in nine people remain malnourished. The UK churns out 15m tonnes of food waste a year \u2013 7.3m tonnes from households. The estimated retail value of this food is \u00a37.5bn and the government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap, has calculated that a typical family wastes \u00a3700 of food a year. Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket \u2013 has produced a battery of gadgets, such as food-sharing apps and smart fridges, for householders to test in its pioneering experiment. \u201cWaste Less, Save More is a brand new way of working and completely different to what anyone has done before, so it was hard to define a measure of success,\u201d said Paul Crewe, head of sustainability, energy, engineering and environment for Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cThat said, we really wanted a stretching target to drive results and we\u2019re really proud of the progress that has been made at a household level. I always say that we\u2019re aiming for the stars, so it\u2019ll still be a success if we land on the moon. \u201cHaving spent the last year getting under the skin of household food waste, we have realised that this kind of behavioural change won\u2019t happen overnight, but we have definitely seen positive progress on what will be a longer journey. \u201cWhat\u2019s more we\u2019re now looking to take the campaign nationwide. Even if we inspire small changes within our communities, these will add up to have a big impact.\u201d In the next phase of the programme, the chain will announce an urban trial in Peckham, London, to measure and analyse the challenges of reducing food waste for those living in dense residential \u2013 and typically multi-occupation \u2013 housing. The results of the trial are being independently evaluated by Wrap and will be published at the end of May. David Moon, head of food sustainability at Wrap added: \u201cAs the recent stall in progress reducing UK household food waste demonstrates, tackling food waste in the home is an extremely complex problem for which there is no single solution. \u201cBehaviour change takes time, and campaigns like Waste Less, Save More in Swadlincote are helping develop interventions and insights that will help long-term progress.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "About 2.5 million E.ON customers will pay an extra \u00a397 a year on energy bills in what consumer groups have branded a \u201cmonstrous\u201d and \u201ccrippling\u201d blow for householders. The company\u2019s 8.8% price rise for customers on a dual-fuel standard tariff from the end of next month is the second highest increase among several announced recently by rivals, including a 9.8% rise by npower, 7.8% by Scottish Power and 1.2% by EDF. The E.ON move prompted the government to renew warnings that it will act if the energy market is shown to be working against consumers. \u201cWherever markets are not working for consumers, this government is prepared to act,\u201d said a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. \u201cWe expect energy companies to treat their customers fairly and continue to be concerned by these price rises which will hit millions of people already paying more than they need to.\u201d British Gas has pledged to freeze prices until August, while SSE has promised to hold prices \u201cuntil at least April\u201d. From 26 April, E.ON\u2019s standard electricity prices go up by 13.8% on average, and standard gas prices rise by 3.8%, affecting more than half of the company\u2019s 4 million customers if they take no action. The increases will take the average dual-fuel bill up to \u00a31,144, compared with about \u00a3900 for the cheapest deals on the market. Unlike most of its competitors, which had cited rising wholesale prices for their increases, E.ON said it had seen a drop in wholesale costs. Instead it blamed the increase on government schemes such as renewable energy subsidies, which are levied on household energy bills. The German energy firm said the cost of various social and environmental programmes had risen by about 36% on the year before. The latest increase comes despite the energy regulator recently saying it saw no reason for the big six to raise prices despite upward price pressures, because of the way they hedge when buying power. Ofgem is due to publish an update later this week on an index of costs facing suppliers; in January that index showed wholesale energy prices were rising. An Ofgem spokesman said: \u201cIn the past few weeks, suppliers have responded to increasing cost pressures by announcing price freezes as well as price increases of different levels. This shows that competition is beginning to bite, with some suppliers competing more effectively than others to keep their prices and costs down.\u201d E.ON\u2019s move is also likely to lead to renewed calls for the government to step in with a price cap, a step that Ofgem recently told MPs it has the power to do, but only if ministers instruct it to. Consumer groups and switching sites said the E.ON price rise would add pressure on bill payers, and urged them to look for better deals. Emma Bush, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, called it a \u201ccrippling blow\u201d for households, while Alex Neill of consumer organisation Which? said: \u201cE.ON\u2019s customers on standard tariffs will be rightly outraged that their energy bills are set to go up when the regulator suggested that inflation-busting rises are unnecessary.\u201d One comparison site, energyhelpline.com, called the rise \u201cmonstrous\u201d. The site\u2019s founder said he had counted 25 tariffs across 10 suppliers that would finish at the end of March, pushing up bills for customers on those deals. MoneySuperMarket said it expected SSE to follow suit soon. The big six, which some experts have said are on the verge of becoming the \u201cbig eight\u201d because of so-called challenger companies First Utility and Ovo Energy, are not alone in increasing prices. The Co-Op\u2019s energy arm has raised prices twice this winter, most recently by 5%, and First Utility is pushing up dual tariffs by an average of 9.7%. E.ON defended the rise as the company\u2019s first in more than two years, and argued that it was due to factors beyond its control. Tony Cocker, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is an announcement we never want to make, but is due in large part to the fact that many of the costs we don\u2019t directly control, such as policies including EMR [energy market reform], RO [the renewables obligation] and the energy company obligation [ECO], which are paid for via people\u2019s energy bills, are increasing. \u201cWe have been able to partially offset some of these rises through our wholesale hedging policy and other means, but we do have to make an increase.\u201d A spokeswoman for SSE said the company had \u201ccommitted to freezing its standard household energy prices this winter, capping them at their current level until at least April 2017\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>About 2.5 million E.ON customers will pay an extra \u00a397 a year on energy bills in what consumer groups have branded a \u201cmonstrous\u201d and \u201ccrippling\u201d blow for householders.</p> <p>The company\u2019s <a href=\"http://pressreleases.eon-uk.com/blogs/eonukpressreleases/archive/2017/03/07/2601.aspx\">8.8% price rise</a> for customers on a dual-fuel standard tariff from the end of next month is the second highest increase among several announced recently by rivals, including a 9.8% rise by npower, 7.8% by Scottish Power and 1.2% by EDF.</p> <p>The E.ON move prompted the government to renew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/14/greg-clark-to-meet-big-six-energy-firms-over-profiteering-report\">warnings</a> that it will act if the energy market is shown to be working against consumers. \u201cWherever markets are not working for consumers, this government is prepared to act,\u201d said a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. \u201cWe expect energy companies to treat their customers fairly and continue to be concerned by these price rises which will hit millions of people already paying more than they need to.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/10/scottish-power-customers-to-be-hit-by-78-price-hike\">British Gas has pledged to freeze prices until August</a>, while SSE has promised to hold prices \u201cuntil at least April\u201d.</p> <p>From 26 April, E.ON\u2019s standard electricity prices go up by 13.8% on average, and standard gas prices rise by 3.8%, affecting more than half of the company\u2019s 4 million customers if they take no action. The increases will take the average dual-fuel bill up to \u00a31,144, compared with about \u00a3900 for the cheapest deals on the market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-07T18:27:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Energy price changes graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-07T18:27:41/embed.html\">Energy price changes graph</a> </figure>  <p>Unlike most of its competitors, which had cited rising wholesale prices for their increases, E.ON said it had seen a drop in wholesale costs. Instead it blamed the increase on government schemes such as renewable energy subsidies, which are levied on household energy bills. The German energy firm said the cost of various social and environmental programmes had risen by about 36% on the year before. </p> <p>The latest increase comes despite the energy regulator recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/19/big-six-energy-suppliers-warned-rising-prices-ofgem\">saying it saw no reason for the big six to raise prices despite upward price pressures</a>, because of the way they hedge when buying power. Ofgem is due to publish an update later this week on an index of costs facing suppliers; in January that index <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/node/97634#thumbchart-c8329010666635703-n106412\">showed wholesale energy prices were rising</a>.<br></p> <p>An Ofgem spokesman said: \u201cIn the past few weeks, suppliers have responded to increasing cost pressures by announcing price freezes as well as price increases of different levels. This shows that competition is beginning to bite, with some suppliers competing more effectively than others to keep their prices and costs down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2017-01-19T15:59:45/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Energy supplier costs index graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2017-01-19T15:59:45/embed.html\">Energy supplier costs index graph</a> </figure>  <p>E.ON\u2019s move is also likely to lead to renewed calls for the government to step in with a price cap, a step that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/22/energy-prices-energy-uk-bills\">Ofgem recently told MPs it has the power to do</a>, but only if ministers instruct it to.</p> <p>Consumer groups and switching sites said the E.ON price rise would add pressure on bill payers, and urged them to look for better deals.<br></p> <p>Emma Bush, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, called it a \u201ccrippling blow\u201d for households, while Alex Neill of consumer organisation Which? said: \u201cE.ON\u2019s customers on standard tariffs will be rightly outraged that their energy bills are set to go up when the regulator suggested that inflation-busting rises are unnecessary.\u201d</p> <p>One comparison site, energyhelpline.com, called the rise \u201cmonstrous\u201d. The site\u2019s founder said he had counted 25 tariffs across 10 suppliers that would finish at the end of March, pushing up bills for customers on those deals. MoneySuperMarket said it expected SSE to follow suit soon.</p> <p>The big six, which some experts have said are on the verge of becoming the \u201cbig eight\u201d because of so-called challenger companies First Utility and Ovo Energy, are not alone in increasing prices. The Co-Op\u2019s energy arm has raised prices twice this winter, most recently by 5%, and First Utility is pushing up dual tariffs by an average of 9.7%.</p> <p>E.ON defended the rise as the company\u2019s first in more than two years, and argued that it was due to factors beyond its control. </p> <p>Tony Cocker, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is an announcement we never want to make, but is due in large part to the fact that many of the costs we don\u2019t directly control, such as policies including EMR [energy market reform], RO [the renewables obligation] and the energy company obligation [ECO], which are paid for via people\u2019s energy bills, are increasing. </p> <p>\u201cWe have been able to partially offset some of these rises through our wholesale hedging policy and other means, but we do have to make an increase.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for SSE said the company had \u201ccommitted to freezing its standard household energy prices this winter, capping them at their current level until at least April 2017\u201d.</p>",
