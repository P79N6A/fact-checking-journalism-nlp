Neither Donald Trump nor European officials raised the possible resumption of talks during the US president\u2019s visit to Brussels last month, EU sources said. Documents relating to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, known as TTIP, had now been locked in a filing cabinet and the code to open it had been lost, one diplomat joked. It was reported in April that the UK had fallen behind in the queue to strike a trade deal with Trump\u2019s administration. According to the Times, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, had convinced Trump that talks on a US-EU agreement would be simpler than he thought. This had led to a \u201crealisation\u201d that a trade deal with the EU \u2013 allowing the tariff-free exchange of services and goods \u2013 would be more important to US interests than a post-Brexit deal with Theresa May, it was reported. Talks over TTIP stalled last year amid opposition from within the EU, including sceptical comments from France\u2019s then trade minister and the German vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel. However, a meeting between Trump the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European council president, Donald Tusk, two weeks ago offered the EU scant evidence of any such willingness, according to EU sources. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe not entirely dead but it is in deep freeze\u201d. The source said that the completion of an EU-Japan trade deal was nevertheless imminent, and would provide significant economic gains. The development may offer Downing Street some fresh hope that the UK stands a better chance of engaging with Washington than Brussels does. May has appeared less inclined to criticise the White House for its recent policy tacks \u2013 including leaving the Paris climate agreement \u2013 suggesting that the prime minister believes the UK stands a chance of forging an accord with the US administration if it avoids upsetting the president. In Brussels, though, there is a high degree of scepticism about the UK\u2019s chances of getting a deal. \u201cTrump would have to be taught what trade means first,\u201d one EU diplomat said. The source added that it was questionable whether the UK had the expertise to engage with the US administration on a trade deal. \u201cA UK-US trade deal would probably take 10 to 15 years anyway\u201d, the diplomat said. The UK\u2019s attitude to the coming Brexit negotiations had given EU diplomats little evidence of such a capacity, the source added. \u201cTheresa May keeps saying she the chief negotiator. Is she really going to spend six days a week in Brussels negotiating? \u201cIf it is David Davis, fine. If it is Olly Robins [permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the European Union] then fine, he knows the files, although maybe less the economic ones. We need to know who we are negotiating with ... I don\u2019t think they have a plan.\u201d The warnings of a freeze in trade talks come despite upbeat comments in April from the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. He said before Trump\u2019s first foreign tour that the US was \u201copen\u201d to resuming negotiations with Brussels. \u201cClearly at some point we need to do something with Europe,\u201d Ross said in an interview with the Financial Times. \u201cIt seems a little weird that a car being shipped from Mexico to Europe pays no tariff as they have a bilateral [agreement with the EU] and a car being shipped from the US pays the full tariff.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, the March GDP figures will mark 103 quarters without Australia\u2019s GDP falling in two consecutive quarters. But we should not get too excited about this length of time without a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d. Not only is such a definition of a recession meaningless, the real focus should be that Australia\u2019s economy is growing far too slowly to generate well-paying jobs. There has been some talk that Wednesday\u2019s GDP figures will see Australia break a record for length of time without a technical recession. Mostly this appears to be because the March quarter will be 103 quarters since the June 1991 quarter, which was the last time we experienced two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That is supposedly going to beat the streak held by the Netherlands from 1981 to 2008. I\u2019m not sure where this talk of a record period of growth has come from \u2013 possibly a speech by then Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson in 2014 in which he suggested the Netherlands went 26.5 years without a recession from December 1981 to March 2008. But if that were so, then at 105 consecutive quarters, Australia still has half a year to go to equal the record. But even worse, the Netherlands only went into a recession during the global financial crisis in December 2008 \u2013 when its GDP fell 0.8%, following a fall of 0.3% in the September quarter that year. On that basis, we actually have to go 108 consecutive quarters to tie the Netherlands \u2013 or till June next year. But don\u2019t worry. We actually \u201cbeat\u201d the Netherland\u2019s record a long time ago. I\u2019m not sure who was advising Parkinson that the Netherlands didn\u2019t have a recession from 1981 until the GFC but I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t someone from the Netherlands. They actually had a recession in 2003 \u2013 as a report by the EU in 2004 noted at the time: \u201cin autumn 2003, the Dutch economy officially entered recession\u201d. The OECD also records that in June 2003 the Netherlands\u2019 GDP fell by 0.3% and in the following quarter it fell 0.01% \u2013 a small fall, but a fall nonetheless. And if we\u2019re going to use dopey phrases like \u201ctechnical recession\u201d we might as well be technical about it. The Netherlands\u2019 streak without a technical recession lasted 87 consecutive quarters \u2013 Australia beat that number in the June quarter of 2013. But regardless, any suggestion of a recession being \u201ctechnical\u201d gives the definition a weight it does not deserve in any way. The Netherlands is an excellent case in point of why the definition of two consecutive quarters of negative growth constituting a recession is very stupid. All the talk of the Netherland\u2019s great uninterrupted run of growth has it starting in December 1981 because in that quarter its GDP grew by 0.1%. But six months later in the June quarter of 1982, its GDP fell by 2.4%, and it fell again in December by 2.1%. It meant that at the end of 1982 the Netherland\u2019s economy was 2.5% smaller than it has been a year before. And yet we should say it was not in a recession? Please. Even in Australia the definition is silly. We have our golden run starting from September 1991, and yet growth was so weak in December of that year Australia\u2019s economy was still 1% smaller than it had been 12 months earlier. But hey, don\u2019t worry \u2013 we were no longer in recession! Now going over 25 years without two consecutive negative quarters is pretty amazing. The run is certainly longer than any other developed nation has achieved. But it\u2019s a bit like a football coach bragging that the team went throughout a season never losing two consecutive quarters in a row and not caring how many matches they won or lost. We only say we have not had a recession because we use GDP as the measure that needs to avoid going backwards two quarters in a row. If instead we used GDP per capita growth then we would have had a couple recessions since 1991: Oddly though, even using the consecutive GDP per capita growth definition we would not have had a recession during the GFC because, while per capita GDP fell 0.3% and 1.2% in June and December of 2008, it rose by 0.2% in the September quarter. That again shows how silly it is to worry about consecutive quarters. If we used annual growth, it definitely looks like we had a recession during the GFC. Annual growth of GDP did not fall below zero, but GDP per capita did \u2013 in fact we had four consecutive quarters where GDP per capita was lower than it had been a year before: But why even use GDP? Why not use employment? After all surely the prime reason we care at all about GDP growth is because we hope it leads to people getting work. What if we judged a recession by the growth of the percentage of working age people in jobs? What if we said we\u2019re in a recession if the percentage of people aged 15-64 who are employed falls by more than 1 percentage point from where it was a year before? That definition would have had us in a recession in the GFC. Such a measure would also highlight how since the GFC we have also experienced pretty pathetic economic activity: All this talk of non-existent records being broken also involves worries that we might be close to narrowly avoiding a technical recession. In the September quarter last year, our GDP shrank by 0.5%; it then grew by 1.1% in December. The worry is that with an already weak economy, the impact from Cyclone Debbie might see GDP shrink in March and June. If that happens, once again we\u2019ll be talking \u201ctechnical recession\u201d. With any luck it\u2019ll also have us realising how foolish is such talk. Better that we should look for signs of how the economy is performing than worrying about fake records and dumb definitions. Certainly the signs are not great. Construction in the March quarter fell 0.7%, and annual growth in the volume of retail trade (a generally good guide for household consumption) was as slow as it has been since 2011: Hours worked and the total growth of wages also remains pitiful: Company profits however have shown another strong rise \u2013 up 39.7% over the past year. While figures released last week showed that private new capital expenditure (investment on buildings, machinery and equipment) grew 0.3%, it remains very timid: Worse still is that while the treasurer continues to suggest we are near the end of the fall in mining investment dragging down economic growth, the latest figures for expected investment suggest the fall still has a way to go. Mining investment is expected to fall another 22% next year, which the 6% expected rise in non-mining investment would not be enough to cover: Whether the March GDP figures released next week show negative growth or not, the clear signs are that the economy is weak. The general consensus is that GDP in the March quarter will grow by around 0.1%-0.3% \u2013 that would mean the economy in the past year grew at slower than it has for nearly eight years. And we don\u2019t need to debate technical definitions of recession or not to know that is not a sign of a healthy economy.",

      "bodyText": "Roll up, roll up, who wants some lovely Saudi dosh that would arrive with a stock market listing in London of Saudi Aramco, the enormous state-owned national oil company? Almost every investment banker and corporate lawyer in town, obviously. Aramco, if it is really worth about $2tn (\u00a31.5tn), would be the world\u2019s biggest flotation. The advisory fees would keep rolling in for decades because, once a firm has settled on a foreign stock exchange, it tends to stick around. That is why there is an intense lobbying effort to persuade City regulators that, to sweeten the appeal of London over New York, Aramco should be given fast-track entry to the FTSE 100 index, even though the Saudi regime seems to have no intention of meeting one of the basic qualifying criteria. Only a 5% slice of Aramco would be sold to outsiders, it is reported, whereas the rules state that at least 25% of the shares must be in public hands to be a so-called \u201cpremium\u201d listing. The Saudis seem to fancy the \u201cpremium\u201d label and prestige of FTSE 100 status, but don\u2019t like the obligations that would go with them. Thank goodness, then, that the Investment Association, which represents the fund management establishment, is kicking up a fuss. It makes a point that is really just common sense. If you have a sound rule, born from hard experience of how minority investors can be exploited by a single controlling shareholder, stick to it. If you bend the rules to accommodate a deep-pocketed new arrival, you will look desperate and grasping, which will damage London\u2019s supposed standing as a high-class financial centre. Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the association, didn\u2019t put it so strongly, of course. Nor did even he mention Saudi Aramco. But everybody knew the context when he wrote last week to the Financial Conduct Authority to say that the 25% minimum level should apply \u201cirrespective of the size of the company being listed\u201d and \u201cshould be preserved at all costs to protect the integrity and standard of the UK premium listing\u201d. He\u2019s right \u2013 and he\u2019s right to be alarmed. An FCA consultation on listing rules for foreign firms is under way and has suggested an \u201calternative segment\u201d for \u201ccompanies where there is a founding family or government that wishes to retain control rights that are incompatible with a conventional premium listing\u201d. If this new segment was excluded from FTSE indices followed by tracker funds that carry many small investors\u2019 savings, little harm might be done. The idea might even have limited merit. But don\u2019t, for heaven\u2019s sake, mix \u201cconventional\u201d and \u201cunconventional\u201d and say it can all go into the FTSE 100 pot. If you do, the whole principle of a premium listing, imposing extra demands on a company, is lost. It does not require any genius to guess why Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, was on the trip to Riyadh with Theresa May in April. In some quarters, persuading Aramco to prefer London over New York is presented as act of patriotism, a way to demonstrate the City\u2019s pulling power after Brexit. It is argued that the 25% rule was never designed with companies as big as Aramco in mind, so it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get in the way of good business. That line of thought puts an absurdly glossy veneer on the lust for fees. It also ignores the interests of investors. The 25% threshold was not plucked out of thin air. It is designed to ensure that minority shareholders can exercise minimum rights on how a company is run and who serves on its board. In the absence of such protections, you can end up with cases like ENRC, the Kazakhstan mining outfit that was briefly a member of the FTSE 100 index, lost a packet for its shareholders, and was dubbed \u201cmore Soviet than City\u201d by one non-executive director as he was ousted. Aramco may say it\u2019s made of better stuff and \u2013 who knows? \u2013 it may even be willing to defy expectations and reveal audited details of its oil reserves as Shell, BP and others must do. But the 25% qualifying criterion for a premium listing should still apply, even when a 5% slice could be worth $100bn. It is there for a good reason. Let\u2019s hope the intervention of the Investment Association will knock some sense into the politicians, bankers and regulators who seem dazzled by the prospect of Saudi riches. The last time the City got into the game of watering down listing requirements to drum up business from foreign governments and oligarchs, the story ended badly. Let Aramco list in London if it wishes, but Saudi ministers should be told they must play by the rules as they find them.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets made a downbeat start to an important week, which sees the UK election, the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, and the testimony of former FBI director James Comey on Donald Trump\u2019s alleged links with Russia. Markets were also unsettled by volatility in sterling, reacting to the latest opinion polls, as well as the terror attack in London. And the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf, which sparked a rise then fall in the oil price, added to the uncertainty. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Markets softened at the beginning of what could be a game-changer of a week in politics and monetary policy. Last week\u2019s soft US jobs report, another terror attack in London in the run up to the UK election and volatile oil prices all played a role in the downbeat tone. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 21.87 points or 0.29% at 7525.76 German market shut for public holiday France\u2019s CAC closed 0.66% lower at 5307.89 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.99% to 20,721.04 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 10,884.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.6% to 786.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 2 points or 0.01%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of next week\u2019s eurogroup meeting over Greece, some positive noises from the IMF. A report in Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt (\u00a3) says: The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, is willing to participate in a Greek bailout and give European creditors more time to settle an ongoing dispute over debt relief, she told Handelsblatt in an exclusive interview. \u201cIf the creditors are not yet at that stage where they can agree on and respect our assumptions, if it takes them more time to get there, we can acknowledge that and give them a bit more time,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s our report on how the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf is affecting Qatar. Kareem Shaheen writes: The tiny Gulf state of Qatar has been literally and figuratively isolated by the escalating row with its Arab neighbours, with land, sea and air routes closed off in an unprecedented crisis in the Arabian peninsula that threatens longstanding trade deals. The closure of the only land route into Qatar as well as the airspaces of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in effect established a blockade on Doha, which relies almost entirely on imports to feed its population. It will damage the prospects of a recovery for Doha\u2019s national carrier, Qatar Airways, amid a slowdown caused by the US administration\u2019s ban on electronic devices in the cabins of aircraft flying from the Middle East, and will raise questions about the future of al-Jazeera, the flagship television network established by the Gulf kingdom and which has been at the centre of diplomatic rows with the rest of the region. Along with the block on re-exports from Dubai to Qatar, together the measures could even affect the monarchy\u2019s preparations for the football World Cup it is due to host in 2022. The full story is here: The pound is continuing its recent volatility, something which is likely to continue this week in the run up to the UK election as various polls emerge but with little in the way of consistency. Sterling is currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2929 and 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.1491. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound remained the day\u2019s main mover, seemingly still dining out on this morning\u2019s Guardian/ICM poll. Sterling gradually widened its growth, taking 0.3% off the dollar and pushing 0.6% higher against the euro; in reality, however, this has done little to change the currency\u2019s standing. Cable still has a bit to go before it has clawed back all of the losses it suffered this time last week, while the pound has barely escaped its 7 week lows against the euro....Today\u2019s rather dreary, pound-heavy trading is likely the template for the rest of the week, as there is nothing in the run-up to the election that can topple it from its dominant perch. In fact, all of the week\u2019s points of interest come on Thursday: alongside the UK vote there is the month\u2019s ECB press conference and, perhaps most excitingly, the reappearance of former FBI chief James Comey for his testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Despite a weakening in [the UK] services PMI for May to 53.8 from 55.8 in April the pound has held up rather well in the wake of the weekend terror attacks. If financial markets are nervous about Thursday\u2019s election and a weakening of economic activity they don\u2019t appear to be showing it, with opinion polls still showing divergent results. YouGov appear to be doubling down on their recent survey by suggesting that the Conservatives will fall short of a majority by 21 seats, while the latest ICM poll shows a lead of 11 points. Markets appear to be taking the view that the YouGov poll is an outlier and unreliable which when you look at the margin for error on it, and the balance of probabilities right now, seems a sensible conclusion. And here\u2019s more detail from the survey itself: Here are some of the comments from the respondents to the ISM survey: \u201cLumber tariff effects are beginning to show up.\u201d (Construction) \u201cBusiness is progressing steadily. No real issues or adjustments to affect annual goals/efforts.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cGeneral feeling is caution. Too much uncertainty.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cSeeing an uptick in the overall activity within the oil and gas sector, which typically will cause a trickle-down effect on the majority of businesses.\u201d (Mining) \u201cTypical transition month in terms of fresh produce and other food related categories. End of spring items and beginning of summer. Gapping of some items. Beef is increasing in price, especially grilling meat cuts. I anticipate this to increase to over $1 per pound on some items as we approach the 4th of July holiday.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cContinuing to feel [the] effect of overheated commercial construction market \u2014 few bidders, higher prices. Scarce construction labor seems to be the driver.\u201d (Public Administration) \u201cBusiness outlook continues to be steady and meeting original projects, but some ups and downs in successive months.\u201d (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u201cOverall, business conditions the past month were flat as compared with several months of growth. While levels haven\u2019t decreased, it may be that overall conditions have reached a high watermark.\u201d (Retail Trade) \u201cStrong market conditions bring a renewed confidence.\u201d (Transportation &amp; Warehousing) The second service sector survey is not only lower than expected, but also lower than the previous month\u2019s figure. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell from 57.5 in April to 56.9 last month, just below the expected level of 57. Meanwhile US factory orders fell for the first time in five months, down 0.2% in April compared to a 1% rise in March. The March figure was revised up from the previous 0.5% increase. The surveys show that the US economy is enjoying steady if unspectacular growth, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit: Although service sector business activity picked up in May, the PMI surveys for manufacturing and services collectively indicate only a modest pace of economic growth so far in the second quarter. Historical comparisons with GDP indicate the PMI is signalling second quarter GDP growth of just over 2%, suggesting there may be some downside risks to IHS Markit\u2019s current forecast of a GDP growth rebound to just over 3% in the second quarter. However, the key message from the PMI is that the economy is enjoying steady, albeit unspectacular, growth, and that the pace of expansion has been slowly lifting higher in recent months. Hiring meanwhile remains on a firm footing, with the survey\u2019s employment indicators running at levels consistent with around 160,000 jobs added to the economy in May. In another sign of the economy\u2019s underlying steady expansion, average prices charged for goods and services is running at the second highest in almost two years, indicating that rising demand is helping restore some pricing power. The first of the day\u2019s two US economic surveys has shown a month on month improvement in the service sector, albeit not as much as earlier expected. The final Markit services PMI reading for May came in at 53.6, up from 53.1 in April but lower than the initial estimate of 54. It was still the highest level since February. It was a similar picture for the composite index - services and manufacturing together - which rose from 53.2 in April to 53.6, lower than the first reading of 53.9. Ahead of the latest service sector surveys (from Markit and ISM), US markets have indeed slipped back at the open. After hitting another record high on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 17 points of 0.08%. while the S&amp;P 500 opened down a similar amount and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.01%. Wall Street is about to open and the forecast is for a slight fall in initial trading: Meanwhile the oil price has lost its early gains, which were made on the back of the Qatar news. Strength in the dollar - which makes oil less affordable for international buyers - seems to be outweighing the prospect of supply shortages following the Gulf dispute. In any case, Qatar is not a major producer of oil, rather it specialises in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Clement Thibault, senior market analyst at Investing.com, said: According to the latest data, five of the top 10 oil producers in the world are Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, UAE, Kuwait). Together, they are responsible for over 24 million barrels of crude a day, or over two and a half times the US\u2019s crude production. However, Qatar is a minor player among the OPEC big boys. Its strength is aligned with LNG. Indeed, it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest LNG producer, supplying almost 30% of global production. By land, Qatar is completely blocked by Saudi Arabia. By sea, its exporting tankers have to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, situated between Iran and the UAE, putting it in a precarious situation any way it turns. Asian customers such as Japan, India, and South Korea would be the most affected by a disruption in NG service, since they are the major importers of Qatari gas... Though we aren\u2019t raising any alarms yet, we believe this is a situation worth monitoring carefully. The Middle East is after all an energy powerhouse, but also rather notorious for a lack of political stability. Any geo political incident coming out of this region could have worldwide energy implications. Despite Qatar\u2019s minor role in oil, the dispute has raised new fears that the recent Opec deal to cut production could run into trouble. Brent crude is currently down 1% at $49.44 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.9% lower at $47.23. After a rough session of heavy losses, the Qatar stock market has closed down 7.27%. After a fairly quiet morning in London, the FTSE 100 has dropped by 22 points to 0.3% to 7525. Mining stocks such as Antofagasta (-2.7%) and BHP Billiton (-1.8%) are among the fallers, tracking a 1% drop in the copper price. The slowdown in UK service sector growth last month hasn\u2019t spooked the markets, though, as the pound is still back above $1.29 today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The pound\u2019s gains also ignored an unexpectedly weak services PMI. The figure fell from 55.8 to 53.8 month-on-month, the slowdown due to the dual pressures of rising inflation and pre-election jitters. The FTSE ended up bearing the brunt of the bad news, falling 0.3%; the index wasn\u2019t helped by its mining stocks, which dropped between 1.5% and 2.5% thanks to copper\u2019s own 1% decline. There\u2019s not much action in Europe, where some markets are closed for the Whit Monday holidays. So City traders are getting on with business, putting last weekend\u2019s terrorist attacks at London Bridge (south of the Square Mile) behind them. Yesterday, it emerged that Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho has been injured after stepping in after a bouncer was attacked during Saturday night\u2019s atrocities. Sunday Express editor Martin Townsend summed up the mood, saying: \u201cGeoff Ho is an absolutely first class reporter and a fine and decent man and our thoughts are with him and his family at this time. \u201cWe are all hoping and praying for a speedy recovery.\u201d And the good news is that Geoff has been tweeting from his hospital bed today. Reuters is reporting that some Egyptian banks have suspended links with their counterparts in Qatar: Get set for the working day - we\u2019ll guide you to the all the business stories you need to read in one really useful email. Click here to sign up. Some photos from today\u2019s Qatar stock market have arrived, showing the scene of the biggest selloff since the financial crisis. Every blue-chip share on the Qatar stock market has fallen sharply this morning. Many stocks - including property and energy companies - have slumped by 10%, which is the maximum daily move allowed by regulators. Even the best-performing stock on the QSI index is down 6%, as investors are spooked by the sudden freeze in relations with other Gulf states. The Qatar index is currently down by 7.5%, hitting its worst level since early 2016. The pound has inched back over $1.29 this morning, up around 0.2%. Sterling rose after a new Guardian/ISM poll showed the Conservatives with an 11-point lead ahead of Thursday\u2019s election. However, YouGov are painting a more serious picture for the Tories. Their new election model is now showing that the Conservatives would win 305 seats, which is 21 short of an overall majority. The diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its neighbours could have serious political and economic implications, says Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in a new research note. MUFG\u2019s Ehsan Khoman explains: 1) This time the political tensions are different \u2013 increased regional geopolitical instability. Whilst the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] has been hit by severe internal turmoil in the recent past (revival of memories of a similar spat in May 2014, when Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain united against Qatar for its support of the Muslim Brotherhood and severed ties for 8 months), the current wave is particularly worrying. Indeed, a divided GCC will bring further instability in the region at a time of full confrontation between the Saudi-led alliance and Iran. A possible thaw between Iran and Qatar could, in theory, lead to a confrontation with the US, as the latter has an immense military base currently in the GCC (most notably in Qatar where the country hosts the largest US military presence in the GCC \u2013 CENTCOM Forward Headquarters). Thus, a rapprochement between Iran and Qatar would be a vast security risk to the US military. 2) Yemen war. Saudi Arabia has announced this morning that it has pulled all Qatari troops from the ongoing Yemen war. 3) Oil and OPEC agreement risks. A full-fledged confrontation will, without any doubt, put pressure on the current compliance rate of OPEC members to the adherence of the 9 month agreement to cut production. Whilst Qatar\u2019s pledge was only to cut 30,000 barrels to 628,000 barrels (as part of the OPEC agreement), there are potential risks of Qatar leaving OPEC which could significantly impact oil prices \u2013 Brent prices are up 1.7% today to USD50.7/b. 4) Transportations industry (airlines, shipping and road freight) risks. The closure of land/sea/air contacts could have surmountable implications for the airlines, shipping and road freight industries \u2013 Etihad Airways, said it would suspend flights to and from Qatar beginning Tuesday morning (the last flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha will depart at 02:45 local time on Tuesday, the airline\u2019s spokesman said in an email). There have been no other announcement by the major airline carriers or corporates have been made thus far. Yemen\u2019s state news agency is reporting that it has also cut ties with Qatar. Yemen also supports the decision to remove Qatari soldiers from the Saudi-led coalition in the country. That group is fighting Houthi forces supported by Iran (a conflict which has turned Yemen into a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people starving, and thousands of cholera cases recorded) Back in the Gulf, the cost of insuring Qatari sovereign debt against default has hit a two-month high this morning. That underlines concerns that Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE have all cut ties with Qatar today. Reuters has the details: Five-year credit default swaps for Qatar rose 2 basis points(bps) from Friday\u2019s close to 61 bps, the highest level since early April. The coordinated move from the Gulf states dramatically escalates a dispute over Qatar\u2019s support of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world\u2019s oldest Islamist movement, and adds accusations that Doha even backs the agenda of regional arch-rival Iran. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s said the rift could have an impact onQatar\u2019s credit rating if trade and capital flows are disrupted. Qatar sovereign dollar bonds also fell. Breaking: Growth across Britain\u2019s service sector slowed last month, which could reinforce worries about the state of the UK economy. Markit\u2019s UK service sector PMI has fallen to 53.8 for May, down from April\u2019s 55.8 (a four-month high). This takes the PMI closer to to the 50 point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Companies reported that new business growth slowed, with some clients holding off big decisions until the general election is over. The squeeze on household incomes, due to rising inflation, is another factor. It shows that the sector is vulnerable to political uncertainty, says Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He explains: \u201cThe powerhouse driving UK GDP lost some of its force this month, with the weakest performance since February, revealing a fragility out of sync with the other sectors which were fired up and running. \u201cIt was clear that slower new business growth let the side down, impacted by caution around the General Election, and a tightening of purse strings. Not even stiff competition between businesses absorbing higher prices for food and the effects of the National Living Wage, could tempt consumers to spend. \u201cDisappointingly, businesses also delayed crucial buying decisions on the back of lingering doubts around the strength of the economy which in turn affected job creation. UK car sales have fallen, and this week\u2019s UK general election may be partly to blame. The number of new car registered in May fell by 8% year-on-year to 186,265, according to the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That\u2019s the second monthly fall in a row. Registrations plunged by 18% in April, after a rush to buy cars in March before new tax changes on vehicle emissions came into effect. Mike Hawes, head of SMMT, warns that sales will keep falling this month too. He believes that the political uncertainty may have put some buyers off: We expected demand in the new car market to remain negative in May due to the pull-forward to March \u2013 which was an all-time record month \u2013 resulting from VED reform. Added to this, the general election was always likely to give many pause for thought and affect purchasing patterns in the short term. Although demand has fallen, it\u2019s important to remember that the market remains at a very high level and, with a raft of new models packed with the latest low emission and connected technology coming to market this summer, we expect the market to remain strong over the year. Breaking: The eurozone\u2019s private sector has kept growing at its fastest pace since the financial crisis. And this may mean that the region\u2019s economy is entering a real growth spurt. Markit\u2019s \u2018composite PMI\u2019, which measures activity at service sector and manufacturing firms, has just come in at 56.8 for May, matching April\u2019s reading. Any figure over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since 2011. Firms reported that they were the more optimistic about their prospects, as new orders rose strongly. They also took on new workers, at one of the fastest rates in the last 10 years. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says these PMI surveys suggest the eurozone is speeding up: \u201cThe final PMI readings add to mounting evidence that the eurozone is enjoying a strong second quarter, consistent with GDP rising at a 0.7% rate. \u201cEncouragingly, both the hard data and the surveys are revealing a broad-based upturn. So far in the second quarter the PMI surveys are running at levels indicative of 0.7% GDP growth in France and Germany, with nearly 1% being signalled for Spain and 0.5% in Italy. Another solid performance from Germany... France\u2019s services sector firms racked up decent growth in May: Back in the eurozone, Spain has posted strong service sector growth last month. Markit\u2019s Spanish services PMI has come in at 57.3 in May, down on April\u2019s 57.8, but still showing a sharp increase in activity. The Gulf is now facing its most serious diplomatic crisis in years, says my colleagues Ben Doherty and Patrick Wintour. They explain: Qatar has long faced criticism from its Arab neighbors over its support of Islamists. The chief worry among them is the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist political group outlawed by both Saudi Arabia and the UAE as it challenges the nations\u2019 hereditary rule. Gulf countries led by Saudi Arabia fell out with Qatar over its backing of then-Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood member. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors from Qatar over the rift. Eight months later, they returned their ambassadors as Qatar forced some Brotherhood members to leave the country and quieted others. However, the 2014 crisis did not see a land and sea blockade as threatened now. In the time since, Qatar repeatedly and strongly denied it funds extremist groups. However, it remains a key financial patron of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and has been the home of exiled Hamas official Khaled Mashaal since 2012. Here\u2019s the full story: Qatar\u2019s stock market is suffering its biggest slump since the financial crisis, with shares now down 8%. Several airlines, including Etihad and Emirates, have announced they are suspending flights to Qatar. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: \u201c[There are] rising tensions in the Gulf, as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. sever ties with Qatar over its alleged sponsorship of \u2018terrorism\u2019, only serving to raise the temperature on the geo-political heat map.\u201d Qatar has hit back at Saudi, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt, accusing them of lying over their decision to cut diplomatic ties today. In a statement, the Qatari foreign ministry says: \u201cThe campaign of incitement is based on lies that had reached the level of complete fabrications.\u201d Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains why crude prices have risen today: The price of oil could be on the verge of another recovery with political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar a potential threat to supply out of the Strait of Hormuz. A wave of selling has swept through Qatar\u2019s stock market at the start of trading, sending its benchmark index tumbling by 6%. The oil price has jumped this morning after a group of Gulf states cut diplomatic relations with Qatar. In a dramatic development Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain all announced early today they were severing ties with Doha and calling their diplomatic staff home. They accused the Qatar leadership of supporting terrorism in the region, and destabilising the Gulf, through its support for Islamist groups and its relations with Iran. Associated Press explains: Saudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut diplomatic ties due to Qatar\u2019s \u201cembrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilizing the region\u201d including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, the Islamic State group and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom\u2019s restive eastern province of Qatif. Egypt\u2019s Foreign Ministry accused Qatar of taking an \u201cantagonist approach\u201d toward Egypt and said \u201call attempts to stop it from supporting terrorist groups failed.\u201d The tiny island nation of Bahrain blamed Qatar\u2019s \u201cmedia incitement, support for armed terrorist activities and funding linked to Iranian groups to carry out sabotage and spreading chaos in Bahrain\u201d for its decision. The four countries are suspending air and sea travel, and Saudi Arabia is also cutting its road crossings. As this map from Bloomberg shows, this would block Qatar from accessing the rest of the region by land. Energy traders were quick to respond to the escalating crisis, sending Brent crude up by $1 per barrel to $50.42. Qatar is the biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and those supplies could potentially be disrupted if this row deepens. China\u2019s service sector has posted its fastest growth in four months, in an encouraging signal following some weak factory data last week. Data firm Caixin reports that Chinese firms were boosted by a jump in new business last month, as client demand strengthened. This sent the Chinese services PMI up to 52.8 in May, up from 51.5 in April, which is the highest reading since January. That\u2019s a boost to the region, especially as China\u2019s manufacturing sector shrank in May. While service sector companies took on more workers, manufacturing firms continued to pare back staff numbers, at the fastest rate since last September. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says: \u201cThe improvement in the services sector bolstered the Chinese economy in May. However, the rapid deterioration in the manufacturing industry is worrying. We need to closely monitor whether the diverging trends in manufacturing and services will widen further.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are bracing for a barrage of data showing how service sector companies in Europe and America performed last month. Economists expect to see another strong performance from eurozone firms; growth is expected to remain around its highest level since the financial crisis. The UK services report will also be closely scrutinised, for signs that political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The City expects that growth slowed last month, taking the UK services PMI down to 55.0, from 55.7. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson reminds us that last week\u2019s factory data was encouraging, so perhaps today\u2019s report will bolster optimism. On the data front the picture was more positive with manufacturing PMI\u2019s continuing to be resilient in May, with the hope that today\u2019s services PMI numbers will be similarly good. Elsewhere, the oil price is climbing after a group of Gulf countries cut ties with Qatar, saying it was supporting terrorism in the region. And the pound could be jittery, with just three days until the UK general election. New figures showing how many new cars were sold last month.

Markets appear to be taking the view that the YouGov poll is an outlier and unreliable which when you look at the margin for error on it, and the balance of probabilities right now, seems a sensible conclusion.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5935684ee4b0bdd87e2f38b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-05T14:20:07.548Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s more detail from the survey itself:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61e7bf79b74b053848ad8ed250a99cd2a401d309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61e7bf79b74b053848ad8ed250a99cd2a401d309/0_0_858_828/500.jpg\" alt=\"Non manufacturing survey\" width=\"500\" height=\"483\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Non manufacturing survey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Institute for Supply Management</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593567d3e4b0be3ed19232ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-05T14:17:12.400Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the comments from the respondents to the ISM survey:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cLumber tariff effects are beginning to show up.\u201d (Construction) </li> <li>\u201cBusiness is progressing steadily.

Strength in the dollar - which makes oil less affordable for international buyers - seems to be outweighing the prospect of supply shortages following the Gulf dispute. In any case, Qatar is not a major producer of oil, rather it specialises in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Clement Thibault, senior market analyst at Investing.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the latest data, five of the top 10 oil producers in the world are Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, UAE, Kuwait). Together, they are responsible for over 24 million barrels of crude a day, or over two and a half times the US\u2019s crude production.</p> <p>However, Qatar is a minor player among the OPEC big boys. Its strength is aligned with LNG. Indeed, it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest LNG producer, supplying almost 30% of global production. By land, Qatar is completely blocked by Saudi Arabia. By sea, its exporting tankers have to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, situated between Iran and the UAE, putting it in a precarious situation any way it turns. Asian customers such as Japan, India, and South Korea would be the most affected by a disruption in NG service, since they are the major importers of Qatari gas...</p> <p>Though we aren\u2019t raising any alarms yet, we believe this is a situation worth monitoring carefully. The Middle East is after all an energy powerhouse, but also rather notorious for a lack of political stability. Any geo political incident coming out of this region could have worldwide energy implications.</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite Qatar\u2019s minor role in oil, the dispute has raised new fears that the recent Opec deal to cut production could run into trouble.</p> <p>Brent crude is currently down 1% at $49.44 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.9% lower at $47.23.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-05T13:42:45.110Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-593553b0e4b00493c82798cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-05T12:51:29.203Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After a rough session of heavy losses, the Qatar stock market has closed down 7.27%</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anca_cighi/status/871690577695436800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Qatar Stock Exchange has closed down 7.27 per cent.

Indeed, a divided GCC will bring further instability in the region at a time of full confrontation between the Saudi-led alliance and Iran. A possible thaw between Iran and Qatar could, in theory, lead to a confrontation with the US, as the latter has an immense military base currently in the GCC (most notably in Qatar where the country hosts the largest US military presence in the GCC \u2013 CENTCOM Forward Headquarters). Thus, a rapprochement between Iran and Qatar would be a vast security risk to the US military.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2) Yemen war.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Saudi Arabia has announced this morning that it has pulled all Qatari troops from the ongoing Yemen war.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3) Oil and OPEC agreement risks.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A full-fledged confrontation will, without any doubt, put pressure on the current compliance rate of OPEC members to the adherence of the 9 month agreement to cut production. Whilst Qatar\u2019s pledge was only to cut 30,000 barrels to 628,000 barrels (as part of the OPEC agreement), there are potential risks of Qatar leaving OPEC which could significantly impact oil prices \u2013 Brent prices are up 1.7% today to USD50.7/b.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4) Transportations industry (airlines, shipping and road freight) risks.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The closure of land/sea/air contacts could have surmountable implications for the airlines, shipping and road freight industries \u2013 Etihad Airways, said it would suspend flights to and from Qatar beginning Tuesday morning (the last flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha will depart at 02:45 local time on Tuesday, the airline\u2019s spokesman said in an email).

      "bodyText": "The way things are looking, the royal family will want to start bulk-buying birthday cards. When King George V sent the first telegrams to those celebrating their 100th birthday in 1917, he had to fire off only 24 messages. Last year, his granddaughter Queen Elizabeth sent 6,405 congratulatory cards to centenarians in the UK. Her own grandson and her great grandson will be signing a whole lot more, based on current projections. Those forecasts suggest that today\u2019s 10-year-olds have a 50% chance of living to at least 103. This rising longevity has come under the spotlight during the election campaign in a way the Conservatives would rather forget. No sooner had Theresa May raised the idea of people paying more for the costs of social care \u2013 branded a \u201cdementia tax\u201d \u2013 than she performed a U-turn. The focus on the costs of an ageing society continued in a recent warning from the World Economic Forum that the retirement age in Britain and other leading developed countries would need to rise to 70 by the middle of the century to head off a pension crisis. The WEF is right that there are huge cost implications from demographic changes taking place around the world. Indeed, the fact that a longer life is harder to fund for both the individual and state cannot remain a taboo subject, however awkward it may be to talk about who will foot the bill for more health and social care. But what is really missing from the debate about longevity is how a longer life is also a source of opportunities. At the root of this problem is the fact that our society remains largely ageist: too quick to write people off, too narrow minded about life after 60. The gerontologist Sarah Harper highlighted this last week when she called for a change to the way we talk about age. People should not be called old until they were seriously frail, dependent and approaching death, said Harper, the director of the Oxford Institute of Ageing. Anything else should be called \u201cactive adulthood\u201d. This raises the key point that we are no longer in an age where people cease work in their sixties, expecting to enjoy only a short retirement before they die. Instead, those who get the state pension will on average spend almost a third of their adult life in retirement, as John Cridland noted in his recent government-commissioned review of the state pension age. But despite this seismic shift, we are still structuring life in three stages \u2013 childhood, work, retirement. What\u2019s more, the ages at which each stage begins has barely budged in decades. It is this damaging fixation with a three-stage life that Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott explore in their book The 100-year Life. Their research in the worlds of psychology and economics feeds into a work that is a mixture of self-help book for those who want to make more of being younger for longer and a manifesto for how firms and policymakers can adapt to rising longevity. The authors make a gloomy assessment of where governments and employers currently stand in that evolutionary process. \u201cWhat is striking is the contrast between the magnitude of change that society will embark upon as people live longer, and the relatively limited response from corporations and governments,\u201d they write. \u201cSaying that corporates and governments are \u2018behind the curve\u2019 doesn\u2019t even come close.\u201d But the authors also have a positive message. They concede that living longer will inevitably mean most people will have no choice but to work a great deal longer. But that is not necessarily as bad as it sounds. We simply need to think more creatively about what work is, how it can change and how we can change over a longer lifetime, in what they call a \u201cmulti-stage life\u201d. That could mean working at a different pace at different stages, changing path more often or taking sabbaticals, for example. On top of the longevity factor, our working lives will also be shaped by rapid technological changes. Such developments as hi-tech robots and online banking are already forcing people to adapt how they work and in some cases to retrain altogether. For some workers, robots are already stealing their jobs. But here again, a longer life offers opportunities to adapt to those pressures. As Gratton and Scott note about retraining: \u201cGiven that across a 100-year lifespan there are 873,000 hours available and if, as is often claimed, a specialist expertise takes 10,000 hours to acquire, mastery in more than one field is neither daunting nor impossible.\u201d It\u2019s an alluring image: a world where people can take time out to retrain, their human skills are valued and nurtured by their employers and the government puts the education and welfare system in place to make it all happen. So how do we get there? Employers and policymakers can start by doing more to help the current cohort of over-50s to stay in work if they want to. There are almost a million 50- to 64-year-olds who are not in employment at all but say they are willing or would like to work, according to the Fuller Working Lives report published by the government this year. In other words, despite skills shortages, employers are not making use of a whole pot of untapped talent and experience. This urgently needs to change. As the Centre for Ageing Better points out, by 2020, one in three UK workers will be over 50 and employers will have to retain, retrain and recruit those older workers. One solution is to shorten or change working hours. Another is redefining older workers\u2019 roles so they become mentors to younger recruits, something Cridland recommended in his review. Employers must also move away from the current model where they centre so much of their training on new, young recruits. The onus is also on government to offer more and better education throughout people\u2019s lives. That must include financial education to help people cope with the greater number of choices a longer life will impose. Crucially, it must be education that is readily available to all. Similarly, our healthcare provision and welfare system will need to evolve so that everyone can benefit from rising longevity. Otherwise, as the 100-year Life authors point out, life risks being \u201cnasty, brutish and long\u201d for those unable to afford the kind of self-reinventions and sabbaticals that a longer life would ideally entail. It\u2019s a life that is hard to imagine as long as we remain stuck in our learn-work-retire model. But instead of just squabbling over care costs, pensions and retirement ages, isn\u2019t it time we ditched that old way of living and saw rising longevity for what it is? More time to do more things.",

Such developments as hi-tech robots and online banking are already forcing people to adapt how they work and in some cases to retrain altogether. For some workers, robots are already stealing their jobs. </p> <p>But here again, a longer life offers opportunities to adapt to those pressures. As Gratton and Scott note about retraining: \u201cGiven that across a 100-year lifespan there are 873,000 hours available and if, as is often claimed, a specialist expertise takes 10,000 hours to acquire, mastery in more than one field is neither daunting nor impossible.\u201d</p> <p> It\u2019s an alluring image: a world where people can take time out to retrain, their human skills are valued and nurtured by their employers and the government puts the education and welfare system in place to make it all happen.</p> <p>So how do we get there? Employers and policymakers can start by doing more to help the current cohort of over-50s to stay in work if they want to. There are almost a million 50- to 64-year-olds who are not in employment at all but say they are willing or would like to work, according to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fuller-working-lives-a-partnership-approach\">Fuller Working Lives report</a> published by the government this year. In other words, despite skills shortages, employers are not making use of a whole pot of untapped talent and experience.</p> <p>This urgently needs to change. As the Centre for Ageing Better points out, <a href=\"https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/news/makes-fulfilling-work-later-life/\">by 2020, one in three UK workers will be over 50</a> and employers will have to retain, retrain and recruit those older workers. One solution is to shorten or change working hours. Another is redefining older workers\u2019 roles so they become mentors to younger recruits, something Cridland recommended in his review. Employers must also move away from the current model where they centre so much of their training on new, young recruits.</p> <p>The onus is also on government to offer more and better education throughout people\u2019s lives. That must include financial education to help people cope with the greater number of choices a longer life will impose. Crucially, it must be education that is readily available to all.</p> <p>Similarly, our healthcare provision and welfare system will need to evolve so that everyone can benefit from rising longevity. Otherwise, as the 100-year Life authors point out, life risks being \u201cnasty, brutish and long\u201d for those unable to afford the kind of self-reinventions and sabbaticals that a longer life would ideally entail.</p> <p>It\u2019s a life that is hard to imagine as long as we remain stuck in our learn-work-retire model. But instead of just squabbling over care costs, pensions and retirement ages, isn\u2019t it time we ditched that old way of living and saw rising longevity for what it is? More time to do more things. </p>",

The union\u2019s research, unveiled at its 100th annual congress in Plymouth on Monday, attempts to quantify people in what it calls precarious employment \u2013 those in the gig economy, on zero- or short-hours contracts, temporary workers, the underemployed and those at risk of false self-employment. The data, based on a survey of nearly 3,500 people of working age, emerged before the publication this month of recommendations from Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair who was appointed by the current prime minister to lead a review into the gig economy. He is expected to recommend changes to the rights of self-employed workers. Tim Roache, the GMB\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThis paints a shocking picture of the modern world of work. Up to 10 million people go to work either not knowing what their hours are, if they\u2019ll be able to pay the bills, or what their long-term prospects are. That\u2019s a sorry state of affairs in the 21st century and a product of government\u2019s failure to tackle bogus self-employment, the use of agency contracts as a business model and point-blank refusal to ban zero-hours contracts.\u201d Further interviews of those who identified themselves as insecure workers found that 61% had suffered stress or anxiety as a result of their current job and the same proportion said they had been to work while unwell for fear of not being paid, losing their job or missing out on future hours. The rapid change in employment practices was highlighted by more than three-quarters of those interviewed who said they had previously been in permanent employment. A year ago, Citizens Advice warned that families were struggling to manage budgets and plan for the future as it estimated that a sixth of workers in England and Wales were insecurely employed. Roache said workers were likely to suffer more if the UK economy slowed further, and the Treasury was being deprived of tax receipts. Adrian Gregory, the chief executive of the London-based recruitment agency Extraman, who gave evidence to an MP-led inquiry into the future of the world of work in March, told the GMB that employment agencies\u2019 use of tax-avoidance schemes was proliferating. \u201cCombining the money removed from workers with the money avoided in tax, an educated guess would be that around 15% of the total income of the recruitment industry is misappropriated. This would amount to around \u00a34.5bn each year. I would think this figure is conservative,\u201d he said. He called on HM Revenue &amp; Customs to set up a specialist unit to investigate rogue employment agencies and to tighten enforcement on holiday pay. He said industry estimates suggested that 70% of holiday pay, totalling nearly \u00a33bn a year, was never paid.",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers representing Noel Edmonds have hit out at Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s proposed compensation scheme for victims of a fraud at the bank\u2019s HBOS Reading arm. The TV presenter\u2019s lawyers have written a lengthy letter to Prof Russel Griggs, appointed by Lloyds in March to review the level of compensation it intends to award to 64 victims of the fraud from a \u00a3100m pot it has set aside, calling the scheme a \u201csham\u201d. The letter, seen by the Guardian, claims that fraud victims are being shortchanged because the bank is determining the payouts with no independent scrutiny, and that Griggs lacks the financial expertise to ensure they are fair. \u201cYou are entirely dependent on what you are told by Lloyds in assessing the level of compensation that should be paid to fraud victims, and lack either expertise of your own or access to independent experts to assist you in your supervisory role in the review,\u201d said Edmonds\u2019 lawyer Jonathan Coad, of Keystone Law. \u201cThere appears to be no proper means of your making an independent assessment. It is difficult to see your role at present as much more than merely the applier of a rubber stamp on a pre-determined level of compensation which has been set by LBG [Lloyds Banking Group] itself. This renders the entire review scheme a mere sham which has been concocted primarily to preserve LBG\u2019s profit margin and share price.\u201d Coad said that while Edmonds \u2013 a former Radio 1 DJ, children\u2019s TV presenter and host of quiz shows including Deal or No Deal \u2013 had the financial backing and media clout to challenge Lloyds over his own case, most other claimants who had had their lives ruined by the \u00a3245m fraud could not afford to do likewise. He added that the questionnaire provided to claimants, upon which Lloyds will determine payout levels, required significant financial expertise, and that it was \u201cplainly essential\u201d that the bank make an independent expert available to all claimants. \u201cConducting the review process without the input of a forensic accountant is akin to seeking to assess the extent of injuries of crash victims without the contribution of a doctor,\u201d said Coad. \u201cI very much doubt if any but a tiny minority of them would be able to fund that advice themselves in the face of LBG\u2019s refusal to do so. An independent forensic accountant [would] permit fraud victims and their professional advisers to judge whether the offer that LBG ultimately makes by way of compensation is fair and equitable.\u201d Coad also said Lloyds lacked the expertise to deliver on a promise to compensate victims not only for financial losses but for the distress and anguish caused by the scam. \u201cThere appears to be neither an objective measure nor any professional expertise whatsoever to assess a suitable sum to compensate fraud victims for the distress, anguish, reputational damage, stigma and personal tragedy that the frauds at issue have inflicted,\u201d said Coad. Edmonds is seeking \u00a373m in compensation for what he claims is the destruction of his Unique business empire, as well as for public humiliation and damage to his reputation. Edmonds says he was a client of the former HBOS employee Mark Dobson, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison along with five others after a jury heard they spent the proceeds of their fraudulent activities on superyachts and sex parties, while destroying businesses to which they had lent money. Lloyds has insisted it will make payments to victims by the end of June. The fraud took place in the run-up to Lloyds\u2019 rescue of HBOS during the 2008 banking crisis. Coad said Edmonds had litigation funding in place so if the bank\u2019s compensation scheme was not revised to make it fair for victims he would take his case to court.",
