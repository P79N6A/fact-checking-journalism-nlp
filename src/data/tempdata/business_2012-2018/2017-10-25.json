      "bodyText": "British consumers have been put on notice for an interest rate rise next week, as official figures show the economy expanding faster than expected in the three months to September. GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017 following expansion of 0.3% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 0.3%. The official figures come as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, with the monetary policy committee likely to take them into account ahead of its decision on 2 November. Threadneedle Street has faced a slew of warnings against raising the cost of borrowing, amid growing concerns over the strength of the economy \u2013 which could be allayed by the latest data. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the latest figures \u201chave probably sealed the deal on an interest rate hike next week\u201d. Taken together with the levels of growth recorded in the first half of the year, the latest official figures point to the weakest expansion for the UK economy since 2009. Over the past 12 months, GDP grew at a rate of 1.5%, which is below the rate of expansion recorded in the 12 months to the end of 2016. It also places Britain behind other major nations including the US, which is expected to report growth at an annualised rate of 2.5% in the third quarter when official figures are released on Friday. Italy, France and Germany are also expected to grow faster next year, as Brexit uncertainties weigh on consumer confidence and deter business investment, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Still, with growth beating expectations and failing to show a deterioration on the previous three months, the latest figures should bolster the Bank to act. The pound gained almost 1% against the dollar to $1.3254 following the release of the figures, indicating that City traders expect a rate increase. Britain\u2019s dominant services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the economy\u2019s output, was the driver behind the third-quarter increase, recording growth of 0.4%. Computer programming was the largest contributor to services growth, while there was also a strong performance by motor traders and the retail sector. Manufacturing returned to growth, recording an expansion of 1%, although did not contribute as much to the economy overall because industrial production is much smaller than the services sector. The construction sector contracted for the second quarter in a row, although statisticians said it remained above its pre-financial crisis peak. Business groups have been spooked in recent weeks by deadlock in the Brexit talks and insufficient clarity over a transitional deal. This could discourage firms from investing in their businesses or raising workers\u2019 wages, spelling further trouble for the economy. While the latest GDP figures will likely bring them some comfort, there could still be storm clouds ahead. Despite the robust performance of the retail and motor trade in the official figures, which account for a three-month period that has now passed, a number of companies in these sectors have issued profit warnings for the future. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cDespite the modest pick-up in growth in the third quarter, the near-term outlook for the UK economy at least still looks challenging.\u201d The official figures show the economy growing at a slower rate than in 2016, with weaker consumer spending due to higher inflation and sluggish earnings growth for squeezed households. That has led the service sector to record growth of about one- or two-tenths slower this year. Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, said: \u201cAll in all, it appears that the economy is running around 0.5% per year more slowly than prior to the EU referendum.\u201d The latest figures were seized upon by Labour to criticise the government\u2019s policy on the economy, ahead of the budget next month. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the figures \u201cconfirm the impact that seven wasted years of Tory economic policy have had on working households\u201d. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cWe have a successful and resilient economy which is supporting a record number of people in employment.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU is to launch an investigation into a British government scheme that may help multinational firms pay less tax, the Guardian has learned. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, will announce on Thursday that she is opening an in-depth investigation into a UK tax scheme that exempts multinationals from anti-tax avoidance measures. Officials think the special exemption for multinationals may break EU competition rules by allowing them to pay less tax than domestic-only rivals. The inquiry centres on a change to the UK\u2019s \u201ccontrolled foreign company\u201d rules announced by the then chancellor, George Osborne, in 2011. The new rules were described by one expert at the time as a huge change, which meant companies could assume they were exempt from the anti-avoidance rules unless specifically caught. The rule change, which came into force in 2013, means a multinational company resident in the UK can lower its tax bill by shifting some taxable income to an offshore corporation, known as a \u201ccontrolled foreign company\u201d. CFCs are offshore subsidiaries that multinationals use to move capital around their global operations. CFCs are not illegal, but the commission believes the UK setup breaks EU competition rules, by giving an unfair advantage to multinationals, compared with British companies without foreign subsidiaries. EU investigators do not have an estimate of how much tax may have been lost to the UK exchequer, but when the measures were introduced, HMRC calculated that all changes to CFC rules would reduce the tax take by \u00a3805m a year by 2016. HMRC revealed on Wednesday that multinationals avoided paying \u00a35.8bn in taxes in 2016, some 50% more than government forecasts. This figure, which was reported by the Financial Times, does not include losses from changes to the CFC rules that are now being investigated by the European commission. EU officials do not yet know which companies have benefited from the scheme, but any firm deemed to have gained an unfair advantage would be told to pay money back to the UK Treasury. The UK scheme is seen as unique, but the commission has already acted against other member states deemed to have cooked up illegal state aid benefits. In 2016 the commission ordered Belgium to recoup \u20ac700m (\u00a3623m) from 35 companies that had unfairly benefited from a generous \u201cexcess profit\u201d scheme. The investigation underscores how the commission is using its powerful competition rules to clamp down on cosy deals between governments and some multinationals. Amazon was recently ordered to repay \u20ac250m as the commission sought to unwind a sweetheart deal with Luxembourg. Apple has been told to hand back \u20ac13bn in unpaid taxes to Ireland. Both technology companies and governments have rejected the commission\u2019s findings. Officials do not know whether the investigation will be complete before the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. Ongoing state aid investigations and pending European court cases are on the long list of \u201cother\u201d issues to be settled in the UK\u2019s exit agreement, as well as the divorce issues of the Brexit bill, Irish border and citizens\u2019 rights. The commission wants all outstanding investigations to be completed under EU law, even if the UK has already left. If the UK remains in the EU during a transition period, it would have to sign up to all EU rules, including state aid policy and anti-tax avoidance rules. From January 2019, all member states will be required to have anti-tax avoidance rules governing CFCs on the statute book. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not believe these rules are incompatible with EU law but will cooperate with the European commission\u2019s investigation. \u201cWe are clear that all multinationals must pay tax \u200eon any profits they make in the UK, and our rules prevent these profits from being artificially diverted overseas.\u201d Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government introduced the UK\u2019s controlled foreign company rules in 1984, in a bid to clamp down on firms using artificial schemes to divert profits from the UK. Osborne claimed the rules were stopping companies from coming to Britain and launched his changes as part of a wider overhaul of corporation tax. Vestager has previously cast doubt on suggestions the UK would seek to capitalise on Brexit by turning itself into a tax haven.",

    "webTitle": "Embargo factories that rip off workers, says rights tsar", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government should consider imposing an embargo on goods made in factories where workers have been underpaid, the workers\u2019 rights tsar has told MPs. Sir David Metcalf, director of labour market enforcement, who reports to both the home and business secretaries, said he was looking at new measures to improve adherence to employment legislation. Speaking to a parliamentary inquiry into the recommendations of the Matthew Taylor review into gig economy workers on Wednesday, Metcalf said as many as 5% of the lowest paid may not be receiving the national minimum wage while holiday pay rules were \u201csimply not enforced\u201d. Metcalf said that health and safety inspectors, who oversee holiday pay, did not have the resources to investigate companies, and enforcement should be handed to HM Revenue and Customs, which already oversees payment of the national minimum wage. \u201cWe are a very law abiding nation and mainly compliant but there is a tail, and possibly a long tail, using a business model that turns on non-compliance,\u201d Metcalf told MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee. Metcalf said non-compliance with employment law in the Leicester clothing manufacturing trade, for example, was \u201crife\u201d. Other trades of particular concern included cleaning, construction, nail bars, the care industry and car washes. He said major retailers and building firms were \u201cby and large compliant, they don\u2019t want their reputation damaged, they want to obey the law\u201d. But he said there was \u201ca tendency to rather wash their hands of what goes on down the supply chain\u201d and the UK should consider making the major companies at the head of the supply chain jointly liable for the behaviour of their manufacturers and processors. That might involve the threat of \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d major companies that were using suppliers who did not pay workers properly if they did not sort out a problem within a given period, or potentially putting an embargo on goods. Metcalf said if HMRC stopped goods being delivered from factories which did not pay correct wages the retailer would say \u201cwhere\u2019s my fast fashion I need these thing into the shop right now\u201d and that would give them \u201ca really strong incentive\u201d to ensure they only used factories that treated workers correctly. He has already called for higher fines for non-payment of national minimum wage or increased resources for enforcement agencies so they could inspect businesses more regularly. He has pledged to use powers to jail rogue bosses. The Low Pay Commission founder said HMRC , the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, the UK\u2019s newly ramped up anti-slavery body, should be able to undertake \u201cintelligence led\u201d investigations rather than having to wait for workers to complain. He wants gig economy workers to have the right to a pay slip and a statement given to them on their first day setting out their employment status so that they can check if they are getting what they are due.

      "bodyText": "The stronger than expected UK growth figures have given a lift to the pound on the basis that an interest rate rise next week is almost certain. With sterling up nearly 1% against the dollar, the FTSE 100 has fallen back thanks to its host of overseas earners which lose out when the pound is stronger. German and French markets also fell back as investors took profits, while Wall Street came back from its record highs after a handful of disappointing results. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 79.33 points or 1.05% at 7447.21 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.46% to 12,953.41 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.37% at 5374.89 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.81% to 22,446.39 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.51% lower at 10,153.3 But in Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.01% to 737.25 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 164 points or 0.7%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street\u2019s falls are accelerating, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 95 points or 0.4%. Following its recent record breaking run, any disappointment in the host of earnings reports coming out looks like an excuse for some profit taking. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The recent US stock market surge came to a halt today, as the positive earnings releases of days gone by were nowhere to be seen. With 70% of S&amp;P 500 earnings beating estimates, it is no surprise that confidence has been sky high of late. However, given the underperformance of AT&amp;T and Boeing earnings, it\u2019s not a shock that the wider S&amp;P 500, Dow and Nasdaq markets are all in the red as we realise that further earnings outperformance may not be a given. Sterling remains strong against the dollar, now up nearly 1% at $1.3261. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound continued to romp higher this Wednesday, as investors indulged in a hawkish view of the morning\u2019s UK third quarter GDP reading. Despite a better than expected pair of durable goods orders figures from the US \u2013 the core reading rose to 0.7%, while the non-core number hit 2.2% \u2013 cable widened its gains as the day went on. All this put the FTSE in a miserable mood, with the UK index dropping 50 points to fall to its lowest price in nearly 3 weeks. With the likelihood of a November rate hike from the BoE only increasing following the (slightly) better than forecast third quarter growth reading \u2013 leaving sterling in line for another boost \u2013 the UK index may struggle to muster the momentum required to climb back, and stay, above 7500 in the coming weeks. US home sales for September have jumped sharply to the highest level in a decade, confounding expectations of a small decline. After their recent record breaking run, US markets have paused for breath. A handful of companies including Chipotle and AMD released underwhelming updates, giving investors an excuse to hold fire after what has up until now been a positive earnings season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 2 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 2.79 points lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 10.62 points. Back with UK GDP, and here are chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s latest thoughts on the figures: On the latest US data, Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: President Trump will be heartened by today\u2019s durable goods orders, which have come in well above expectations and point towards a manufacturing sector performing strongly, despite an uncertain economic backdrop. The challenge for Trump will be maintaining this momentum, with a big decision due in the coming weeks on the future Janet Yellen as Fed chair. Having run on a jobs platform during last year\u2019s election, the president will also need to find a way of ensuring that strong manufacturing performance leads to an uptick in job and wage growth. Over in the US, there have also been some better than expected economic figures. New orders for US made capital goods - excluding defence and aircraft - jumped 1.3% in September, better than the 0.5% rise expected by analysts. The August figure was also revised upwards, from an initial 1.1% to 1.3%. The data comes ahead of Friday\u2019s third quarter GDP estimate, which is expected to show an impressive annualised rate of 2.5%, albeit down from the second quarter\u2019s 3.1%. The positive figures will add to the expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates again before the year end. OK, time for a quick catch-up on this morning\u2019s growth figures. Britain\u2019s economy grew a little faster than expected in the third quarter of this year, but still below its long-term growth rate. GDP rose by 0.4% in July-September, ahead of City expectations. It\u2019s an increase on the 0.3% growth recorded in the first two quarter of 2017, but still a fairly moderate performance. The service sector, which makes up around three-quarters of the economy, grew by 0.4%. Manufacturing, encouragingly, grew by 1% during the quarter. But construction suffered its second quarterly contraction in a row. Darren Morgan, the Office for National Statistics Head of National Accounts, explains: \u201cGrowth in the third quarter of 2017 continued at a similar rate as seen in the first half of the year. Services, led by increases in IT, motor trades and retail, continued to drive GDP growth. Manufacturing also boosted the economy with an improved performance after a weak second quarter. Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was a \u201csolid\u201d performance, as Britain\u2019s economy continued to outperform expectations. But his Labour opposite number, John McDonnell, criticised the government for not investing more. City economists have generally agreed that the UK economy looks somewhat lacklustre. Several blamed the Brexit vote, for cutting the value of the pound and deterring firms from investing in new machinery and buildings. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg sums up the mood: The current pace of UK GDP growth is ok, but it could be better. While the short-term risks to demand since the Brexit vote have not materialised in a serious way, the UK economy should be riding high on the back of the on-going global upswing. Uncertainty from Brexit is weighing on firm and household confidence. The forecast-beating growth figures appear to increase the chances of an interest rate rise next week. That sent the pound rallying almost 1% today. This has pulled down Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 share index, as a stronger pound undermines the value of overseas earnings. Sterling has now gained a whole cent against the US dollar today, to $1.325. City investors seem increasingly confident that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next week, on the back of today\u2019s growth figures. An interest rate rise would help savers, but could be bad news for over-stretched borrowers. With real wages shrinking this year, many households have been forced into debt to pay for basic items. Fran Boait, director of the Positive Money campaign group, argues that interest rate shouldn\u2019t rise until wages have caught up with inflation. With many people already drowning in debt, even a small increase in mortgage rates and credit card bills could push them under. People urgently need a boost to their incomes before any rise in interest rates. Our message to the Bank of England and the government is that there should be \u201cNo rate rise without a pay rise\u201d. Difficult times call for radical measures...and Labour MP Liam Byrne argues that Britain needs to rethink its economic model to get growth motoring again. Writing in the Guardian, Byrne says: London is an incredible 40% more productive than Wales. And in contrast to the shibboleths of traditional growth theory, our regions are failing to converge over very long periods of time. A bold new model would grant new fiscal freedoms to regions to borrow to invest in infrastructure and housing \u2013 as first proposed by the Keynes-inspired 1944 white paper on full employment. Devolution of the apprenticeship levy would rescue a failing policy and allow regions to coordinate technical education. And a radical boost to the Higher Education Innovation Fund would transform the power of regional universities to provide research and development to Britain\u2019s underproductive small business base. However elegant the strategy, said Winston Churchill, it\u2019s good to occasionally look at the results. Today\u2019s economic results are disappointing. It\u2019s time to change the theory and practise of the strategy. Duncan Weldon, head of research at the Resolution Group, says the big picture is that Britain\u2019s economy has slowed over the last decade. That\u2019s partly due to Britain\u2019s weak productivity - a problem that no-one seems close to solving. But Brexit doesn\u2019t help, he writes: Increased uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trading relationships, regulations and migration policy have led many firms to put investment on hold. The British economy has no doubt performed better than many analysts (including this one) expected since the referendum, but that performance still can\u2019t be termed \u201cstrong\u201d. It is important to remember that the UK\u2019s better-than-expected performance \u2013 relative to the most pessimistic pre-Brexit vote views \u2013 has come at a time when the global economy as a whole has been putting in a stronger performance. This month the International Monetary Fund estimated that the global economy would grow 3.6% in 2018 and that advanced economies would expand by 2.2%. Those numbers compare to estimates of 3.2% and 2.0% before June\u2019s referendum. Meanwhile they now pencil in growth of just 1.7% for the UK next year as opposed to an estimate of 2.2% 18 months ago. In other words, while the prospects for the world economy and other developed countries have improved, our own outlook has darkened. More here: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that the (small) pick-up in UK growth over the summer will persuade the Bank of England to raise interest rates next week. UK government bond prices have fallen since the GPD figures came out. This has pushed the interest rate (or yield) on 10-year UK debt to 1.41% - on track for its highest level since January. This is another sign that the City expects UK interest rates to rise soon (so investors are selling UK bonds and buying higher-yielding assets). Chancellor Philip Hammond has told reporters in London that Britain\u2019s economy continued to outperform expectations. Reuters has the details: \u201cIt\u2019s a solid performance by the UK economy in the third quarter and it\u2019s outperformed market expectations as the UK economy has done overall since the referendum last year. What it shows is the underlying fundamental strength of this economy,\u201d Hammond said in televised comments to British broadcasters. Hammond has also been admiring Britain\u2019s life sciences industry, at the Francis Crick Institute: Labour MP Chris Leslie, who supports the Open Britain campaign, says inflation and Brexit uncertainty are holding growth back: \u201cThese figures show the damaging impact Brexit is already having on the economy, with workers and consumers feeling the squeeze in lower wages and higher prices. Leslie adds that the UK needs to negotiate membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, rather than risk crashing out of Europe without a deal.... Incidentally, the latest word from parliament is that MPs might not get a vote on Brexit until after the UK has left the European Union! A funny way of taking back control.... The pound continues to push higher, now up 0.8 of a cent at $1.322, as the City continues to price in a rate hike next month. But...Dr Gordon Fletcher of University of Salford Business School fears that a UK interest rate rise could undermine the recovery. He writes: Growth is now weaker compared to the other major European economies and could itself be seen as tangible result of a \u2018Brexit effect\u2019. The past decade has also been a time of historical low interest rates and now concern will turn towards the prospect of an imminent rise in this rate. A rate rise could then be a disincentive in a relatively weak economy to further business growth and expansion. It is a fine balance. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, is pleased to see that manufacturing output rose by 1% during the quarter. As the backbone of our economy, the onus is now on the government to ensure that investment continues despite Brexit uncertainty.\u201d Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says the UK economy has \u2018lost its sparkle\u2019, and put in another \u2018lacklustre performance\u2019 in the last quarter: She fears that growth will remain subdued while Brexit plays out... There has been a deterioration in economic performance since the start of the year, as inflation has begun to bite and consumers have started to reconsider their priorities. This trend is likely to remain for a while, with Brexit related uncertainties looming large for consumers and businesses. Our expectations are therefore for annual GDP growth to fall short of the UK\u2019s potential and reach only around 1.5% in the short term. Britain\u2019s first interest rate rise since 2007 could be just round the corner, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington: British consumers are being put on notice for a rate hike from next week, as official figures show the economy expanding faster than anticipated in the three months to September. GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017 following expansion of 0.3% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 0.3%. The official figures come as the Bank of England prepares to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade, with the monetary policy committee likely to take them into account ahead of its decision on 2 November. Threadneedle Street has faced a slew of warnings against raising the cost of borrowing, amid growing concerns over the strength of the economy \u2013 which could be allayed by the latest data. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the latest figures \u201chave probably sealed the deal on an interest rate hike next week.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: You can keep up to speed on all the latest economic and business news with our daily email..... Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says Britain\u2019s growth rate looks \u2018subpar\u2019, despite avoiding the recession that some experts predicted after the EU referendum. He adds: The third quarter has been particularly difficult for the UK economy, with inflation ringing 3% while wage growth has been subdued. Consumers are facing an increased squeeze in living standards while the city has been brought to its knees by the increased uncertainty over Brexit proceedings.\u201d Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit, has tweeted a nice graph showing how Britain\u2019s annual growth rate has slowed (to 1.5% in the last quarter). John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says the UK economy is too weak, and needs more government investment - ideally in next month\u2019s Budget. Here\u2019s his response to today\u2019s growth figures: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures further confirm the impact that seven wasted years of Tory economic policy has had on working households. \u201cEconomic growth for the majority of 2017 has been below what was expected. In recent weeks leading independent forecasters have slashed growth for next year, and the latest economic data shows wages are still set to fall behind prices - squeezing living standards further. \u201cThe UK is not growing as fast as many of our trading partners in the EU or the USA, and it is becoming increasingly clear that this government has to use next month\u2019s Budget for a change of direction. \u201cThe Chancellor cannot keep hiding from the facts, as his approach of carrying on as usual is seriously putting working people\u2019s living standards at risk. \u201cLabour has consistently called for increased investment underpinned by our fiscal credibility rule, so that we can prepare our economy for any downturn from the Tories\u2019 chaotic handling of Brexit.\u201d Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, says Britain\u2019s economy is still suffering from the Brexit vote last year, and the slide in the value of the pound. He argues that the 0.4% growth recorded in the July-September quarter shouldn\u2019t be celebrated. Dixon writes: UK GDP growth....was a little bit above what we had expected but still below the rates of growth we enjoyed back in 2016 as service sector growth appears to be running around one or two tenths slower. This in turn may be a consequence of the weakness of consumption, triggered by the recent inflation pickup which itself is a consequence of the Brexit-induced collapse in sterling. All in all, it appears that the economy is running around 0.5% per year more slowly than prior to the EU referendum. Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool\u2019s Management School, agrees that the economic picture isn\u2019t rosy. Prof Milas: Brexit-related economic uncertainty is taking a toll on the economy not only in terms of getting stuck to 1.5% annual growth for 2017 Q3 but also in terms of the \u201cquality\u201d of the reading itself. Indeed, since the Brexit vote, the first reading of ONS has over-estimated annual GDP growth by a notable average of 0.3%. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the UK economy is \u2018stuck in second gear\u2019, adding. Year-on-year growth stands at 1.5%, which if it continues would be the weakest expansion since the crisis. The productivity puzzle remains unsolved - GDP per head lagged the headline number and increased by just 0.3%. Yael Selfin, KPMG\u2019s chief UK economist, warns that the economy isn\u2019t growing fast enough to justify tax cuts in next month\u2019s budget: Here\u2019s some detail of the UK GDP report, showing that computer programming and the UK car sector grew strongly over the summer. The strong performance by the motor industry is a surprise, as the UK\u2019s largest car dealer, Pendragon, issued a profit warning on Monday.... Here\u2019s some really granular detail: The Treasury have released a comment from Chancellor Philip Hammond, although it doesn\u2019t really address the GDP figures directly.... \u201cWe have a successful and resilient economy which is supporting a record number of people in employment. My focus now, and going into the Budget, is on boosting productivity so that we can deliver higher-wage jobs and a better standard of living for people across the country. \u201cThat is why I am visiting the Francis Crick Institute, where they are using cutting-edge research to generate real-life health improvements. The UK has world-leading expertise in life sciences \u2013 an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 and it is through supporting growth in these cutting-edge industries that we will build a competitive economy that works for everyone.\u201d Several analysts are pointing out that Britain\u2019s growth rate remains unimpressive, despite rising in the last quarter: Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says Britain is only achieving \u2018stable but slow growth\u2019: \u201cThe headline growth of 0.4% over the third quarter represents a slight increase over the second quarter figure. \u201cOver the year, growth is just 1.5%, and the quarterly figure suggests little momentum going forward. Sterling has risen on the back of today\u2019s growth report, up 0.25% against the US dollar to $1.317. City traders are concluding that the pick-up in growth raises the chances of a UK interest rate rise next month. This pick-up in UK growth means that Britain still hasn\u2019t suffered the recession that some experts predicted if the country voted to leave the EU. However, 0.4% is a still below the UK\u2019s long-term growth rate. As this chart shows, 2017 could be the weakest year for the economy since the financial crisis (the 2012 figures are distorted by the London Olympics). If you adjust for population changes, UK GDP rose by 0.3% during the last quarter. But....UK construction output shrank for the second quarter in a row, which means Britain\u2019s building sector is in recession. Britain\u2019s service sector provided the bulk of the growth in the last quarter. It expanded by 0.4% in the July-September period. The ONS says services was \u201cthe largest contributor to GDP growth, with a strong performance in computer programming, motor trades and retail trade.\u201d Britain manufacturing also returned to growth, with output rising by a punchy 1.0% during the quarter. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u2019s up from 0.3% in the second quarter, and a little better than the City expected. More to follow! Just two minutes to go until we discover how Britain\u2019s economy performed over the summer.... The pound is down slightly against the US dollar this morning at $1.312, and also against the euro at \u20ac1.115. It may move sharply in a few minutes, if the GDP figures are a surprise... Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, says today\u2019s GDP report will influence whether UK interest rates rise this year (for the first time in a decade). \u201cWith expectations still rife that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month, today\u2019s GDP figures will be closely scrutinised to see whether they give any excuse for policymakers to hold fire or if they support their hawkish intent. Uncertainty about Brexit, the relatively fragile state of the British economy and fears over personal debt and household incomes could all be making Mr Carney think twice about whether now is the right time to start the process of raising rates. However, the prospect of delaying could lead to accusations of the MPC crying wolf again and severely dent sterling. Rocks and hard places abound, and the Governor will be keeping his fingers crossed that today\u2019s figure gives him a valid excuse either way. The Treasury have created a little video explaining how GDP works: While we wait for the UK growth report, do listen to Robert Kennedy explaining how GDP is an imperfect measure. Kennedy gave the speech to the University of Kansas in 1968, a few months before he was assassinated, saying: Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. Britain\u2019s economy outperformed the eurozone for several years, during the euro debt crisis. But as this chart show, the eurozone\u2019s growth rate caught up in 2016, and outpaced the UK so far this year. That has probably helped Britain avoid a sharper downturn this year. Good morning. We\u2019re about to discover how well Britain\u2019s economy is performing in the face of Brexit uncertainty, rising inflation and persistently weak productivity. The first estimate of UK GDP for the July to September period, due at 9.30am BST, will show how quickly, or slowly, the economy expanded in the last quarter. It may not be a great picture either; economists predict that GDP rose by just 0.3% during the quarter, significantly below the long-term trend growth. The annual growth rate could also drop to just 1.5% - again, rather weaker than in recent years. 2017 hasn\u2019t exactly been a vintage year for the UK economy. GDP only rose by 0.3% in both the first and second quarter, partly due to a slowdown in the dominant service sector. Having been one of the fastest-growing advanced economies in recent years, Britain has actually been the slowest-growing G7 nation so far this year. Today\u2019s healthcheck on the UK economy is particularly important, as chancellor Philip Hammond weighs up what tax and spending changes to make in November\u2019s budget. It will also influence whether the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates at its monetary policy meeting next week. Sam Hill, senior UK economist at Royal Bank of Canada, fears that Britain\u2019s growth rate could fall to just 0.2%, as there are signs that the service sector actually shrank in July. He says: However, it is far from clear whether or not the preliminary estimate of Q3 GDP will reveal growth of 0.2% q/q or 0.3% q/q. Our long-standing forecast has been 0.2% q/q, which we will stick with following news of a contraction in the services sector in July. It is also highly probable that, even with a recovery in September, for the quarter as a whole the construction sector will end up being a drag on growth. Against those headwinds, industrial production has been on a much better footing in Q3, so the overall growth estimate will depend on the extent to which the services sector rebounded in August and September. City traders are bracing for some drama at 9.30am -- a weak GDP report could send the pound sliding. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at forex broker FXTM, explains: Overall, October is shaping up to be a painful trading month for Sterling, especially in light of deteriorating economic fundamentals and slow progress on Brexit talks weighing heavily on the currency. Inflation in the U.K. has jumped to a five-and-a-half year high at 3%, while wage growth remains subdued. With households feeling the squeeze as wage growth continues to fall behind inflation, concerns remain elevated over the sustainability of the U.K.\u2019s consumer-driven economic growth.",

The British economy has no doubt performed better than many analysts (including this one) expected since the referendum, but that performance still can\u2019t be termed \u201cstrong\u201d. It is important to remember that the UK\u2019s better-than-expected performance \u2013 relative to the most pessimistic pre-Brexit vote views \u2013 has come at a time when the global economy as a whole has been putting in a stronger performance.</p> <p>This month the International Monetary Fund estimated that the global economy would grow 3.6% in 2018 and that advanced economies would expand by 2.2%. Those numbers compare to estimates of 3.2% and 2.0% before June\u2019s referendum. Meanwhile they now pencil in growth of just 1.7% for the UK next year as opposed to an estimate of 2.2% 18 months ago.

GlaxoSmithKline chief executive, Emma Walmsley, said drug companies needed clarity on future relations with the EU as soon as possible to minimise disruption to medicine supplies. Walmsley also repeated her earlier call for a transition period of at least two years. \u201cThe most important thing is to get to clarity on an implementation phase for at least two years, potentially longer, but to get clarity on that as soon as possible,\u201d she said. The company is not planning to move operations out of the UK, but if no deal is reached, it will duplicate certain facilities in Europe, allowing it to retest drugs manufactured in Britain and shipped to the continent. Walmsley said: \u201cWe are not thinking of any relocation out of the UK, but \u2026 we are looking at contingency planning in terms of testing facilities, to allow us to have as seamless a transition as possible, and make sure we are providing secure supply to the patients that need our drugs and medicines.\u201d She added: \u201cAll of that work is under way in the detailed planning group, and we will be ready for it as necessary.\u201d GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s requests to the government also include making sure the UK can participate in the EU regulatory framework, setting up a talent-friendly immigration policy and delivering predictable funding levels for UK sciences. Walmsley\u2019s comments followed a warning from Japanese carmaker Toyota that the government needed to \u201clift the fog\u201d surrounding Brexit negotiations. Toyota said uncertainty over the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trading relationship with the EU was hindering its ability to plan for the future of its business in the UK, where it employs about 3,000 people. \u201cThe UK government should \u2026 understand that we cannot stay in this kind of fog when we don\u2019t know what will be the output of the negotiation,\u201d said Didier Leroy, executive vice-president at Toyota. \u201cAs quick as we can get clarity on that, better will be the way we can prepare [for] the future.\u201d On Wednesday the City of London warned that financial businesses would start activating Brexit contingency plans unless there is a transitional deal by the end of 2017. In a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, Catherine McGuinness, the most senior policy official at the City of London Corporation said the UK was facing a \u201chistorically defining moment\u201d and warned that the timetable for business to prepare for transition was \u201ctightening very rapidly\u201d. Earlier this week five of the UK\u2019s biggest business lobby groups, including the CBI and British Chambers of Commerce, wrote to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, urging him to quickly establish a transition deal that mirrored existing arrangements, or risk losing British jobs and investment.",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s hope Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio is right. The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group makes the immediate outlook for the UK seem, if not rosy, then at least steady. The economy is \u201cresilient\u201d. Borrowers can cope with a quarter-point rise in interest rates to 0.5%. And we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the increase in consumer debt because levels are still 25% below those of a decade ago. These are all fair points, and Lloyds\u2019 third-quarter results illustrated the theme of resilience. The bank\u2019s percentage of impaired loans continues to run at historically low levels, despite a hit from an unnamed and mysterious \u201csingle large corporate\u201d. Impairment charges over the nine months rose 20% to \u00a3538m but the loan book itself is larger after the purchase of the MBNA credit card business. Can we relax, then? Should we stop obsessing over every twist in the Brexit negotiations and spend more time looking at the underlying picture? Before anybody runs away with that idea, three points are worth making. First, Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s economic punditry always comes with the caveat that he\u2019s looking only six to 12 months into the future. If he\u2019s still talking up resilience in a year\u2019s time, that would be more significant. By then, we will know if the fall-off in business investment is affecting employment and thus banks\u2019 bad debt charges. Second, Lloyds enjoys the luxury of commanding positions across the UK banking landscape. It has a 25% share of UK current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages. Market leadership gives Lloyds a competitive cost-to-income ratio rivals can only envy. Others\u2019 view of life may not be so confident. Third, resilience should not be confused with decent growth. The UK economy grew marginally faster than expected in the third quarter but nobody would describe 0.4% as exciting in a year in which the eurozone has emerged from hibernation. Lloyds\u2019 share price tells a similar story. It bounced quickly from its post-referendum low when an economic shock did not arrive, but the advance since January has merely been from 64p to 68p. That\u2019s progress of a sort \u2013 but the Brexit discount, for a bank with 97% of its business in the UK, is obvious. Mind the dividend Here\u2019s how to knock \u00a34bn off your market capitalisation in one swoop: say you\u2019re having a look at buying a rival\u2019s unwanted subsidiary but give no details as to how you would meet the likely $14bn-$15bn (\u00a310.5bn-\u00a311.3bn) bill. The GlaxoSmithKline chief executive, Emma Walmsley, cannot be surprised by the severe 5.5% response to her ambition to make the UK pharmaceuticals group \u201ca consolidator\u201d in consumer healthcare, specifically by contemplating an offer for Pfizer\u2019s unit. GSK shareholders love their dividends \u2013 80p-a-share was sustained by her predecessor during some lean years for profits \u2013 and they will react violently to any whiff of danger on the income front. If a $15bn purchase required GSK to issue new shares to raise cash, the obvious worry is that dividends would be diluted. Yet the appeal of getting bigger in consumer healthcare is also clear. GSK\u2019s unit, which Walmsley used to run, hasn\u2019t skipped a beat since it absorbed Novartis\u2019s brands a couple of years ago; the desired 20% profit margin has arrived as advertised. Ripping out costs from an enlarged consumer operation also promises more certain (if lower) returns than those on offer in the riskier game of discovering and developing original medicines and vaccines. At the right price, then, a deal with Pfizer would make sense. The fit also looks good \u2013 Pfizer\u2019s operation is big in the US, GSK\u2019s isn\u2019t. But Walmsley needs to explain how the pieces of the financial jigsaw are meant to fit together. As it is, GSK could have to pay \u00a37bn next year to buy out Novartis\u2019s 35% stake in the existing consumer business. Can it really do that deal plus a purchase from Pfizer? And can GSK credibly say its focus remains on pharma, its largest business, if consumer healthcare is seeing so much action? Walmsley needs to tread carefully. The very worst outcome here would be to reopen the tired and tedious debate about whether GSK itself should be broken up. Keep the dividend sacrosanct and all should be fine. Another Brexit casualty Still on GSK, it is depressing to hear that \u201ccontingency planning\u201d for Brexit is required, including the construction of drug-testing facilities in mainland Europe. Healthcare should not be contentious territory in the Brexit negotiations. The mutual interest in securing uninterrupted and safe supplies of medicines is basic stuff. Finding a way for the UK and the EU to recognise each other\u2019s drug-testing regimes cannot be too hard.",

That\u2019s progress of a sort \u2013 but the Brexit discount, for a bank with 97% of its business in the UK, is obvious. </p> <h2>Mind the dividend</h2> <p>Here\u2019s how to knock \u00a34bn off your market capitalisation in one swoop: say you\u2019re having a look at buying a rival\u2019s unwanted subsidiary but give no details as to how you would meet the likely $14bn-$15bn (\u00a310.5bn-\u00a311.3bn) bill.</p> <p>The GlaxoSmithKline chief executive, Emma Walmsley, cannot be surprised by the severe 5.5% response to her ambition to make the UK pharmaceuticals group \u201ca consolidator\u201d in consumer healthcare, specifically by contemplating an offer for Pfizer\u2019s unit.</p> <p>GSK shareholders love their dividends \u2013 80p-a-share was sustained by her predecessor during some lean years for profits \u2013 and they will react violently to any whiff of danger on the income front. If a $15bn purchase required GSK to issue new shares to raise cash, the obvious worry is that dividends would be diluted.</p> <p>Yet the appeal of getting bigger in consumer healthcare is also clear. GSK\u2019s unit, which Walmsley used to run, hasn\u2019t skipped a beat since it absorbed Novartis\u2019s brands a couple of years ago; the desired 20% profit margin has arrived as advertised. Ripping out costs from an enlarged consumer operation also promises more certain (if lower) returns than those on offer in the riskier game of discovering and developing original medicines and vaccines.</p> <p>At the right price, then, a deal with Pfizer would make sense. The fit also looks good \u2013 Pfizer\u2019s operation is big in the US, GSK\u2019s isn\u2019t.</p> <p>But Walmsley needs to explain how the pieces of the financial jigsaw are meant to fit together. As it is, GSK could have to pay \u00a37bn next year to buy out Novartis\u2019s 35% stake in the existing consumer business. Can it really do that deal plus a purchase from Pfizer? And can GSK credibly say its focus remains on pharma, its largest business, if consumer healthcare is seeing so much action?</p> <p>Walmsley needs to tread carefully. The very worst outcome here would be to reopen the tired and tedious debate about whether GSK itself should be broken up. Keep the dividend sacrosanct and all should be fine.</p> <h2>Another Brexit casualty</h2> <p>Still on GSK, it is depressing to hear that \u201ccontingency planning\u201d for Brexit is required, including the construction of drug-testing facilities in mainland Europe.</p> <p>Healthcare should not be contentious territory in the Brexit negotiations. The mutual interest in securing uninterrupted and safe supplies of medicines is basic stuff. Finding a way for the UK and the EU to recognise each other\u2019s drug-testing regimes cannot be too hard.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ranjit Singh Boparan, the multimillionaire boss of 2 Sisters Food Group, has apologised for the scandal engulfing his company as he pledged to fund the cost of independent inspectors to police all 12 of his UK chicken sites. The concessions came during a sometimes heated session of the Commons environment, food and rural affairs committee hearing, in which Boparan, whose firm produces a third of all poultry products eaten in the UK, also pledged to improve standards at his factory, increase training of his workforce and install closed circuit television to check on staff. However, the entrepreneur was evasive when quizzed by MPs about whether the company had breached food safety regulations, and repeatedly declined to answer direct questions on the topic. Boparan had been summoned to appear in front of the parliamentary committee after a Guardian and ITV News investigation into standards at the firm\u2019s West Bromwich plant. Losing his temper at one point, Boparan addressed MPs with a raised voice and said: \u201cWe do not have poor standards. I invite all of you to my factory.\u201d Neil Parish, the chairman of the committee, said he would accept Boparan\u2019s apology and his promise to improve standards. Parish added: \u201cWhat he said today was recorded and is on the record. I accept his word that he will improve and put things right. But God help him if he\u2019s got to come here again and he hasn\u2019t put it right.\u201d The inquiry was called after the Guardian and ITV News recorded undercover footage in August showing 2 Sisters workers altering the source and slaughter date of poultry being processed at the firm\u2019s Site D plant in West Bromwich. Other 2 Sisters workers have also told the Guardian and ITV News that they have been instructed to alter \u201ckill dates\u201d. Further footage showed chicken being retrieved from the floor of the plant and returned to the production line, plus older chicken being mixed with fresher birds. Prof Chris Elliott, a food safety academic from Queen\u2019s University Belfast who led the UK government\u2019s independent review of food systems after the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said he had inspected many food businesses in the past four years and had \u201cnever seen one operate under such poor standards\u201d as the video evidence showed. Experts said altering kill dates could artificially stretch the commercial life of the meat and dupe consumers into buying chicken past its use-by date. While Boparan apologised for the factory\u2019s problems and admitted that the footage showing the changing of kill dates looked wrong, he contested that altering the labels was a breach of regulations. He claimed employees were actually correcting slaughter dates erroneously attached to trays of chicken crowns. Later, his technical director, Chris Gilbert-Wood, told the committee that this view was what \u201ccould be\u201d happening in the footage. The worker shown changing the kill dates has been dismissed, after the company instigated disciplinary proceedings citing allegations he had breached food safety regulations. When asked several times by John Grogan MP if there had been breaches of regulations, the most Boparan would concede was: \u201cI said mistakes were made.\u201d The company also admitted to the MPs that changing kill dates should only be done by a quality control worker and never by a member of production. The sacked worker \u2013 and the supervisor who instructed him to change the labels \u2013 are both understood to have worked in production. Boparan also acknowledged that he had a conversation eight years ago with Jack Dromey, the shadow business secretary, who was then a union official. The politician told the businessman that 2 Sisters workers had informed him that dates on the company\u2019s chicken were being changed, \u201cso that meat, that should have been thrown away, was sold to supermarkets\u201d. The millionaire said that he had asked Dromey to \u201cgive me the evidence\u201d but that he \u201cnever heard anything else\u201d. Boparan\u2019s appearance came after an uncomfortable hearing in front of the committee for food inspectors, including representatives from the Food Standards Agency who were forced to admit they had last performed an unannounced inspection at the West Bromwich plant almost a year ago, with the last announced audit in July. In a separate session, the committee also heard from BRC Global Standards, which conducts audits at food plants, the British Poultry Council, an industry body, and Assured Food Standards, which promotes and regulates food quality and licenses the Red Tractor quality mark. They were all accused of being \u201cculpable\u201d for the standards exposed at the plant, as the committee pledged to launch a more thorough parliamentary inquiry into food standards next year.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s borrowers can withstand the impact of the first rise in interest rates in a decade, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group said on Wednesday. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio believes any increase from the current record low of 0.25% would be gradual and said the bank \u2013 the biggest mortgage lender and savings institution in the UK \u2013 did not expect rates to reach 1% until 2019. He was speaking as the bank reported a 38% rise in profits in the first nine months of the year, and ahead of next month\u2019s meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. The market expects rates to be increased for the first time since July 2007. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said a rate rise would not put \u201cstress\u201d on the economy and would merely be an unwinding of the emergency rate cut \u2013 from 0.5% \u2013 made in the immediate aftermath of the vote for Brexit. Prior to that, rates had been at 0.5% since March 2009. With inflation running at 3%, real interest rates would remain negative, he said. \u201cAsset quality remains strong, reflecting our prudent approach to risk, while the UK economy remains resilient,\u201d Horta-Os\u00f3rio said. The bank is back under private ownership after the government sold off the last of its shares in May, after taking a 43% stake during the height of the 2008 crisis. It is focused on the UK market and has started to expand in the credit card market, buying MBNA last year, giving it a market share of 26%. It has a 25% share of current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages. It is also a player in the motor finance market but Horta-Os\u00f3rio sought to calm concerns about the consumer credit market \u2013 car loans, credit cards and personal borrowing \u2013 saying the bank took a conservative approach to its lending. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warned on Tuesday that the rise in the UK\u2019s consumer debt to \u00a3200bn was unsustainable. The Bank of England will tell lenders next month how much extra capital they need to hold to counter the risk. The bank did admit it was expecting an increase in its capital requirement but finance director George Culmer said it still expected to pay a dividend for the full year and would consider the use of buy-back or special dividend at the end of the financial year. Lloyds made profits of \u00a34.5bn in the first nine months of the year, helped by the absence of provisions for payment protection insurance or fines in the third quarter for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. Claims for PPI, though, are running faster than the bank had expected following an industry-wide advertising campaign featuring The Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to raise awareness of the 2019 deadline for making complaints about the mis-sold insurance product. The bank is yet to use \u00a32.9bn of its \u00a318bn PPI provision \u2013 the highest in the industry. It received 16,000 complaints a week after the campaign was launched and although this has fallen back to 11,000 a week it is higher than the 9,000 a week it had forecast. Impairment charges for bad loans rose 20% to \u00a3539m but Culmer said this was not caused by a deterioration in consumers\u2019 ability to repay loans but a \u201csingle large corporate\u201d running in to trouble.",

The economy\u2019s trend rate of growth is a touch above 2% a year, so by that benchmark the 0.4% rise in gross domestic product in the third quarter was modest. Growth has been weaker in the first three quarters of 2017 than it was in the six months after the June 2016 EU referendum. Even so, the pickup from the 0.3% recorded in each of the first two quarters of this year surprised the City, and the pound rose on the foreign exchanges as a result. Helped by the weakness of the pound and a stronger outlook for exports, manufacturing put in a strong performance and the service sector \u2013 the mainstay of the economy \u2013 also expanded. Construction, however, is having a really tough time. A second quarter of contraction means the sector is technically in recession. Most of the recent evidence suggests the economy will continue to chug along at around its current rate in the final three months of 2017. The squeeze on consumers\u2019 real incomes mean Christmas is going to be challenging for retailers. So why is the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee gearing up for a rate rise? Three arguments have been canvassed. First, the MPC cut rates in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote because it expected a recession. Those fears have not materialised, so there is no need for rates to be left at the emergency level of 0.25%. Second, many MPC members think that the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 will at some point trigger wage inflation, even if it has not done so yet. Third, the noises coming out of the Bank in recent months have been so hawkish that a failure to deliver what the markets want would be a blow to the MPC\u2019s credibility. If rates are left unchanged, Mark Carney will be pilloried as a Grand Old Duke of York figure. Despite all that, in its 20-year history the MPC has not previously dared to raise rates when the economy is so sluggish. The vote might be closer than the City expects. There are likely to be dissenters on the committee and their arguments will carry some weight.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Toyota has warned the government to \u201clift the fog\u201d surrounding Brexit negotiations and secure a deal that would safeguard the competitiveness of its Derbyshire factory. The Japanese carmaker said uncertainty over the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trading relationship with the EU was hindering its ability to plan for the future of its business in the UK, where it employs about 3,000 people. It came as the latest industry figures showed the number of cars built in Britain went into reverse for a fifth month this year in September, with those destined for the UK market plunging by 14.2% in September as Brexit fears hit consumer and business confidence. Didier Leroy, an executive vice-president of Toyota, said businesses needed to see progress to be able to plan. \u201cThe UK government should \u2026 understand that we cannot stay in this kind of fog when we don\u2019t know what will be the output of the negotiation. As quick as we can get clarity on that, better will be the way we can prepare [for] the future.\u201d Speaking at the Tokyo motor show, Leroy said any new import levy imposed on the cars made at its factory in Burnaston, Derbyshire, would have a profound impact on its business. \u201cToday they [Burnaston] export 80-85% of their production to continental Europe, so if we move to something like an import tax, trade tax or any kind of additional penalty, it will create a big negative impact in terms of competitiveness for this plant,\u201d he said. Leroy added however that the company had trust in the plant and its workers and would fight hard to make it as competitive as possible, even if there are tariffs. Leroy\u2019s comments, reported by the Financial Times, reflect the rising anxiety among Britain\u2019s business leaders over the lack of clarity on Brexit, more than seven months after Theresa May triggered article 50. Multinational companies including banks have signalled a willingness to relocate jobs from the UK to other European towns and cities where they can be certain of continued access to the single market. \u201cBrexit is the greatest challenge of our times and yet we still don\u2019t have any clarity on what our future relationship with our biggest trading partner will look like, nor detail of the transitional deal being sought,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. \u201cLeaving the EU with no deal would be the worst outcome for our sector so we urge government to deliver on its commitments and safeguard the competitiveness of the industry.\u201d Figures published by the SMMT showed the number of cars rolling off UK production lines fell 4.1% in September compared with a year earlier, to 153,224. The drop was driven by the sharp fall in domestic demand as well as a 1.1% in vehicles bound for export markets which account for about 80% of the total. In the first nine months of the year, manufacturing fell 2.2% compared with the same period last year, with 1.256m cars made. As well as the Burnaston plant, where about 180,000 vehicles roll off the production line every year, Toyota makes engines at a factory in Deeside, north Wales. This year, Toyota announced plans to invest \u00a3240m to upgrade equipment and systems Burnaston, where it makes the Auris hatchback and Avensis family car. It warned at the time that tariff-free access from the UK to the continent was vital to the future success of the plant. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the rival Japanese carmaker Nissan also pledged to invest more in its UK plant in Sunderland by building new versions of its Qashqai and X-Trail, but only after its chief executive received private assurances from the government about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.",

    "webTitle": "Treasury secretary says officials caught off-guard by extent of wages slowdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Treasury secretary, John Fraser, has expressed optimism that Australia\u2019s record-low wages growth could have bottomed out as wages pick up in some pockets of the country. But he has admitted Treasury officials were caught off-guard by the extent of the wages slowdown since the global financial crisis, saying the economic \u201cscars\u201d from the crisis have run deeper than expected in Australia. Nigel Ray, the deputy secretary of Treasury\u2019s macroeconomic group, has also revealed that someone has lodged a freedom-of-information request to get their hands on internal Treasury \u201canalysis\u201d that the treasurer, Scott Morrison, has been promoting in recent weeks but refusing to release publicly. Morrison told the Business Council of Australia last month that Treasury had found, in specific analysis, that wages were growing slowly across most industries in the economy, and most regions of the country, which demonstrated that income inequality was not growing in Australia. Excerpts of Morrison\u2019s BCA speech were printed in a story in the Australian newspaper the morning before his speech, along with details from the unreleased Treasury analysis. Ray said on Wednesday that Treasury had not given its analysis to anyone in the media \u2013 it had only given its analysis to Morrison\u2019s office. Fraser told senators that there were signs Australia\u2019s workers could soon enjoy real wages growth, after years of stagnating wages. \u201cWe would welcome wages growth to get back to something like the longer-term norms,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged, actually, that there are signs of it. I rely very heavily on the heads of Treasury group and at the meeting we had in Adelaide there were pockets, and I don\u2019t want to over-egg this, there were pockets or signs of wages growth. \u201cAnd in the consultations we did as part of the report for the Council on Federal Financial Relations later this week we saw pockets also where there were increased wages demand \u2013 in construction in Victoria, there are signs in the semi-skilled area in north-west Sydney and, interestingly, in some of the regional centres for construction workers. \u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t want to over-egg it but I think it is starting to pick up a little. That has been the experience overseas as well.\u201d Fraser said that, as with business investment, it was clear many workers had been shaken by the experience of the GFC, adding Treasury was caught off-guard by the protracted slowdown in wages growth after the crisis. \u201cThe scars of the GFC probably run deeper and broader, and rawer, than we expected,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cI know a lot of people in the farming sector, for instance, they still feel it. They\u2019re worried about that. \u201cThe construction sector, that\u2019s certainly the case with tradies and whatever. We haven\u2019t uninvented the business cycle but it\u2019s certainly a much longer business cycle that, in my experience, I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Overall, he said the economy was evolving broadly in line with Treasury\u2019s expectations in the 2017-18 budget. The International Monetary Fund earlier this month said Australia was among countries with the highest growth in income inequality in the world over the past 30 years. Vitor Gaspar, the IMF\u2019s director of fiscal affairs, told an audience at the launch of the IMF\u2019s latest Fiscal Monitor that Australia\u2019s income inequality growth has been similar to the US, South Africa, India, China, Spain and the UK since the 1980s. \u201cMost people around the world live in countries where inequality has increased,\u201d Gaspar said.",

      "body": "<p>The Treasury secretary, John Fraser, has expressed optimism that Australia\u2019s record-low wages growth could have bottomed out as wages pick up in some pockets of the country.</p> <p>But he has admitted Treasury officials were caught off-guard by the extent of the wages slowdown since the global financial crisis, saying the economic \u201cscars\u201d from the crisis have run deeper than expected in Australia.</p> <p>Nigel Ray, the deputy secretary of Treasury\u2019s macroeconomic group, has also revealed that someone has lodged a freedom-of-information request to get their hands on internal Treasury \u201canalysis\u201d that the treasurer, Scott Morrison, has been promoting in recent weeks but refusing to release publicly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/19/australias-unemployment-rate-falls-to-four-year-low-of-55\">Australia\u2019s unemployment rate falls to four-year low of 5.5%</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/30/penalty-rate-cuts-long-weekend-loss-will-run-into-millions-for-workers\">Morrison told the Business Council of Australia last month</a> that Treasury had found, in specific analysis, that wages were growing slowly across most industries in the economy, and most regions of the country, which demonstrated that income inequality was not growing in Australia. </p> <p>Excerpts of Morrison\u2019s BCA speech were printed in a story in the Australian newspaper the morning before his speech, along with details from the unreleased Treasury analysis.</p> <p>Ray said on Wednesday that Treasury had not given its analysis to anyone in the media \u2013 it had only given its analysis to Morrison\u2019s office. </p> <p>Fraser told senators that there were signs Australia\u2019s workers could soon enjoy real wages growth, after years of stagnating wages.</p> <p>\u201cWe would welcome wages growth to get back to something like the longer-term norms,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged, actually, that there are signs of it. I rely very heavily on the heads of Treasury group and at the meeting we had in Adelaide there were pockets, and I don\u2019t want to over-egg this, there were pockets or signs of wages growth.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in the consultations we did as part of the report for the Council on Federal Financial Relations later this week we saw pockets also where there were increased wages demand \u2013 in construction in Victoria, there are signs in the semi-skilled area in north-west Sydney and, interestingly, in some of the regional centres for construction workers.</p> <p>\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t want to over-egg it but I think it is starting to pick up a little. That has been the experience overseas as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/home-ownership-for-under-35s-fell-by-a-third-since-1989-report\">Home ownership for under-35s fell by a third since 1989 \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fraser said that, as with business investment, it was clear many workers had been shaken by the experience of the GFC, adding Treasury was caught off-guard by the protracted slowdown in wages growth after the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe scars of the GFC probably run deeper and broader, and rawer, than we expected,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cI know a lot of people in the farming sector, for instance, they still feel it. They\u2019re worried about that.</p> <p>\u201cThe construction sector, that\u2019s certainly the case with tradies and whatever. We haven\u2019t uninvented the business cycle but it\u2019s certainly a much longer business cycle that, in my experience, I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, he said the economy was evolving broadly in line with Treasury\u2019s expectations in the 2017-18 budget.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund earlier this month said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/imf-says-australia-has-one-of-the-fastest-rising-income-inequality-rates\">Australia was among countries with the highest growth in income inequality in the world over the past 30 years</a>.</p> <p>Vitor Gaspar, the IMF\u2019s director of fiscal affairs, told an audience at the launch of the IMF\u2019s latest Fiscal Monitor that Australia\u2019s income inequality growth has been similar to the US, South Africa, India, China, Spain and the UK since the 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cMost people around the world live in countries where inequality has increased,\u201d Gaspar said.</p>",
