      "bodyText": "The Productivity Commission has raised concerns about governance at the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) and about the scope for political interference in the funding of projects, including a new coal-fired power station in Queensland, and the Adani rail link. It has also criticised a raft of recent government interventions in the energy sector, including Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s much vaunted Snowy 2.0 project, and Jay Weatherill\u2019s $550m energy self-sufficiency program, characterising recent developments as \u201cfrenetic activity by governments, often in the midst of crises\u201d that could ultimately drive up power prices for consumers. The commission \u2013 the federal government\u2019s independent research and advisory body on economic policy \u2013 has used its broad-ranging, annual review of industry assistance, to telegraph concerns about the Turnbull government\u2019s interventions in infrastructure, energy, and also restate its opposition to the re-regulation of the Queensland sugar industry. Of the Naif \u2013 the Coalition\u2019s flagship $5bn concessional loan scheme for projects in northern Australia \u2013 the commission warns a \u201clack of transparency to date and the promotion of certain projects by politicians in the absence of credible supporting investment data\u201d has raised concerns about the viability of projects currently under consideration. The commission\u2019s report, released on Saturday, puts an explicit question mark over three projects that have been floated through media coverage \u2013 a rail line attached to the controversial Adani project from the Gallilee basin to Abbott Point, one or more irrigation dam projects in various locations in Northern Australia, and more \u201cclean\u201d coal power generation in north Queensland. The commission notes that Adani has said publicly it doesn\u2019t need the loan to build the rail link, which it says raises questions about whether it can satisfy core Naif criteria for a loan. It says new dam construction would likely meet the Naif criteria, \u201chowever, based on experience with large water catchment activities in northern Australia, there is a real question of whether any new dams would be sufficiently commercial to be able to repay a loan\u201d. On the new coal-fired power station championed by federal Nationals, including the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and the former resources minister, Matt Canavan, the commission notes \u201cthe commercial viability of coal generation has been questioned, particularly if a carbon price is introduced in the future\u201d. As well as the risks associated with new coal investments at a time when countries are looking to reduce their carbon emissions, the commission says regional development strategies, like the Naif investments, \u201ccan also result in long-term dependency on industry assistance\u201d. In more general commentary, it warns there is a \u201creal danger\u201d of programs like the Naif triggering escalations in industry assistance by governments, as governments plough more and more funds into regional development in order to prevent their flagship infrastructure investments becoming \u201cwhite elephants\u201d. The commission says it is critical that the Naif ensure that the business case for all proposed investments is able to demonstrate an ability to cover their operational costs and the costs of servicing the loan at market rates in the future. As well as putting a significant question mark over the activities of the Naif, the commission also warns governments against stepping in a piecemeal fashion into a policy vacuum of its own making in energy. Identifying Snowy 2.0, the Weatherill plan, and possible new coal plants in Queensland, the commission notes it is uncertain whether the mooted investments will proceed, \u201cbut there is a risk that they will lead to the wrong infrastructure in the wrong place and the electricity consumer will end up paying higher prices as a result\u201d. It says current behaviour by governments exposes future generation of taxpayers to significant risk. \u201cIt is important that any proposals be carefully evaluated and that consideration be given to alternatives that might address emerging problems in the electricity market in a more efficient and less costly manner\u201d. \u201cA risk, otherwise, is that future generations of taxpayers will be called on to foot the bill for precipitate responses to perceived crises now\u201d. \u201cThe more that market forces dictate what and where, the less likely that the investments will end up as white elephants\u201d. While the commission\u2019s sharply worded criticisms are likely to fall on deaf ears in Canberra, the arguments about the Naif echo concerns previously raised by the progressive thinktank, the Australia Institute, which has argued the fund lacks resources and is not being transparent about its internal procedures. The Australia Institute released a report in March arguing the Naif is behind other comparable government organisations in terms of process and disclosure, and in operational funding. The Australian National Audit Office has flagged interest in examining the Naif\u2019s independence and systems of analysis in response to complaints about a lack of transparency. In May, officials from Infrastructure Australia told a Senate estimates hearing they had not identified the proposed rail line linking the controversial Adani coalmine with the Abbott Point port as a priority, nor discussed the Adani project with the Naif, even though the rail project has completed its preliminary assessment and been referred for further consideration.",

      "bodyText": "An Adani executive has said he was flummoxed by the controversy attached to the company\u2019s coal ambitions, which led him to wonder whether prejudice against an Indian company in Australia was at play. Muthuraj Guruswamy said hackers trying to compromise Adani\u2019s jobs website were the latest hostile distraction, just as the company launched a $1.4m national advertising campaign alongside its overseas push to clinch funds to build Australia\u2019s largest coalmine. The four-month public relations drive began on Sunday with primetime national TV slots during Australian Ninja Warrior, and a four-page liftout in Fairfax\u2019s Sydney and Melbourne newspapers that highlighted jobs, rail sleeper and steel orders but avoided mention of the word coal. The \u201cThis is Adani\u201d campaign followed advice from a lobbying firm which is staffed by former strategists from both major political parties and helps targets of activism with \u201cissues management\u201d. The Guardian understands a former federal Liberal party advisor, Mark Hrycek, now working for Next Level Strategic Services, is overseeing the Adani campaign, which is produced by global advertising firm Starcom. Next Level\u2019s directors are Cameron Milner, a former Queensland Labor secretary and chief of staff to Bill Shorten during the 2016 election campaign, and David Moore, a one-time chief of staff to Howard government minister Mal Brough. Guruswamy, Adani\u2019s general manager of corporate affairs in Australia, said he \u201chad this thought in my head for some time now\u201d that the company\u2019s Indian roots were a factor in opposition to the Carmichael mine. \u201cAs a guy coming in as an Indian-born, naturalised Australian for the last 24 years, I\u2019ve gone through certain jobs and other areas [where] I felt sometimes like, \u2018Man, is it because I\u2019ve an Indian background I\u2019m not moving forward in my life?\u2019,\u201d he said. Some reactions to a recent report predicting Adani\u2019s opening of the Galilee would harm coal projects elsewhere in Australia prompted similar thoughts, Guruswamy said. \u201cI thought [critics] were talking about coal and climate change [but] you\u2019ve got Newcastle coal, you got some expansion of mines in the Surat Basin and the Bowen Basin, which are giving thermal coal and all of a sudden it\u2019s all OK. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking, hang on, is it because it\u2019s an Indian company?\u201d The day after Adani launched its pitch for public hearts and minds, IT staff reported that \u201cwe have people trying to hack into our system\u201d, Guruswamy said. \u201cWe know where it is coming from with the hackers, it\u2019s coming from this particular IP,\u201d Guruswamy said, declining to say if it was within Australia. The same day, in an unrelated leak, an environmental protest group, the Galilee Blockade, said it had been given details of the players behind Adani\u2019s advertising campaign. Galilee Blockade spokesman Ben Pennings said these showed \u201cthe revolving door between mainstream politics and the fossil fuel lobby is going so fast it could generate electricity itself\u201d. \u201cWe have a recent Liberal Party operative working for an ex-Labor Party big wig, trying to convince us a complete lemon is a sweet Bowen mango,\u201d Pennings, a former Greens candidate, said. \u201cNo wonder people take to the streets when both Queensland Labor and the federal Coalition happily meet with lobbyists they used to work with.\u201d Milner and Moore did not return calls, and an email request for comment from Hrycek did not receive a response. Guruswamy said when he first looked at the proposed Galilee mines as an \u201coutsider\u201d working at QR National during the mining boom, \u201cpeople were making fun of Clive Palmer with his Waratah coal, GVK had some issues [but] I don\u2019t think this [Adani] project was looked at as a controversy\u201d. \u201cWhy is this [now] a controversial project? I don\u2019t understand it at all.\u201d Guruswamy said the advertising campaign would \u201cgo everywhere\u201d, from supportive regional Queensland communities to southern capitals where many of its activist opponents are based. Adani\u2019s campaign marked \u201ca time to say to the world\u201d that jobs were flowing and finance would be clinched, despite the scepticism of some critics and longstanding opposition from environmentalists and some traditional owners, he said. Guruswamy said he took \u201csome consolation\u201d that politicians across the spectrum who \u201csupport us openly and take all the hits from their constituencies \u2013 or the GetUps or the ABCs or the Guardians of the world - would have done some due diligence\u201d on Adani and its ability to deliver the US$16bn project. The campaign came at a time when Adani considered its solar projects in Queensland a riskier investment than a $2b railway to open up the Galilee basin coalfields, he said. This was despite uncertainty about how much private finance Adani would gain for its railway, and therefore the amount of \u201cgap funding\u201d it would seek from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) to make up the difference, Guruswamy said. Pennings said Adani, which had reportedly applied for up to $900m in Naif funding for its railway, \u201cwill need to spend more than one and a half million to convince us they should get a cool billion of our taxes\u201d. But marketing and public relations experts said it was not green-leaning opponents but people on the street, along with \u201cbusiness influencers\u201d in Sydney and Melbourne, that were the targets of Adani\u2019s advertising. \u201cAt the end of the day, green groups, you\u2019re not going to change their minds, so really any kind of advertising is aimed at those who don\u2019t have a strong opinion,\u201d Margaret Lawson, who runs a Brisbane PR firm, said. \u201cThe general person in the street probably realises there\u2019s some opposition and different opinions but they may not be able to articulate the difference on issues and what the opposition has been around. \u201cIf the only impression in detail they have is from the ads, it\u2019ll be a positive one, [leading] the undecided to, even if not supporting the project, to not be openly opposed to it.\u201d Lawson said coal companies \u201cneed a social licence to operate, which is more than just your regulatory approvals and your funding agreements\u201d. \u201cUltimately their business objectives won\u2019t be achieved if there\u2019s widespread community opposition, and that\u2019s ongoing,\u201d she said. \u201cA social licence to operate is about having people know what you stand for and having an unimpeded channel to communicate your key messages, instead of getting them diluted in the debate on policy issues and regulation.\u201d Lawson said an example of this was the advertisements\u2019 reference to a total 10,000 \u201cdirect and indirect\u201d jobs, instead of the 1464 net average annual mine jobs modelled by Adani\u2019s own expert witness for the land court. Guruswamy said he had recently quipped to a senior government figure that he should be able to count paid roles stemming from the Stop Adani campaign as jobs generated by Adani. \u201cI see \u2018Stop Adani\u2019 signs everywhere \u2013 somebody\u2019s creating that sticker, somebody\u2019s manufacturing it, I want to know all those jobs and I want to put it as part of my indirect jobs created.\u201d Branding consultant Allan Bonsall said the general public would regard \u201cthe Adani brand as an Indian mining magnate that probably makes too much money for his own good\u201d. \u201cThey know there\u2019s a mine and vested interests involved, probably not a lot of positive vibes around it, but not necessarily negative,\u201d he said. Adani was trying to \u201cwin that emotional space just as much as winning the rational space\u201d in debate over the mine. \u201cAdani\u2019s no dummy, they know people are reacting from a point of view of renewables, coal is dirty etcetera,\u201d Bonsall said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that underpinning of the emotional reasons why Adani is a good corporate citizen, reinforcing its business credentials. \u201cClearly what they\u2019re wanting to do is reaffirm in everybody\u2019s head that idea that there\u2019s a positive side, and the fact they don\u2019t make any reference to coal shows they don\u2019t want to flag that as an immediate negative.\u201d Guruswamy said Adani considered its five-year pipeline of 1500MW in solar projects across Queensland to be \u201cmore risk [financially] than putting in 388km of railway line\u201d for a coal mine. \u201cThat\u2019s no joke.\u201d As no Australian governments had set renewable energy targets beyond 2030, banks were refusing to lend for large-scale solar projects that took longer to deliver a return, Guruswamy said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Capita, one of the UK\u2019s largest outsourcing companies, has demanded payouts of up to \u00a321,000 from graduates who tried to pull out of an unpaid training scheme under which they were not guaranteed a job. The company, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging of offenders to store card services for retailers and BBC licence fee collection, has been criticised for advertising a number of roles in its IT resourcing division that stipulate applicants must be a graduate and able to attend between two and four months of unpaid training in London or Manchester. Former trainees who spoke to The Guardian said they had been disappointed with the scheme, as the training consisted almost exclusively of online reading from a digital library without any direct teaching or on-the-job experience. One former trainee described the course as \u201cabsolutely useless\u201d. They said: \u201cAll you get is academic textbooks to read. Anyone expecting a hands-on approach would be disappointed. I was offered a few opportunities by other graduate schemes and companies [during the Capita training] but I refused them as I was under the threat of a liability to pay \u00a321,000. I thought at the end of it how foolish I was.\u201d Another former trainee said that they had decided to leave after just over a year of working for Capita and had been asked to pay about \u00a321,000. After protesting, the trainee ended up without her last month of pay, or about \u00a31,200. \u201cI think they knew I was vulnerable as I started as a graduate,\u201d the trainee said. The trainee sought a new job after finding they were being used to \u201cfill HR gaps\u201d rather than being given roles suitable to her training. Capita said that it now charged \u00a313,000 to trainees who wanted to leave before completing their training and two years of work. It said it had previously charged different rates depending on the role involved. A spokesperson said: \u201cAll participants in the training are made fully aware, at numerous times prior to commencing the training, that it is provided free of charge to only those people who successfully complete the course and are engaged by Capita or a Capita client. Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.\u201d Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capita\u2019s rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs. The group\u2019s graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job. The company also demands that trainees pay up to \u00a320,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work. A spokeswoman for FDM said: \u201cThe professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of \u00a320,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting. We have a commitment to transparency with all applicants to ensure that they understand the terms clearly. Trainees have 14 days from when they start training to trial the programme and leave with no fees charged.\u201d \u201cWe have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels. \u201cIndividuals undertaking our bespoke training do not engage in any work or provide any services for us or any of our clients until they have successfully completed their training, passed all relevant internal and external examinations and been assessed as ready for the workplace.\u201d",

I was offered a few opportunities by other graduate schemes and companies [during the Capita training] but I refused them as I was under the threat of a liability to pay \u00a321,000. I thought at the end of it how foolish I was.\u201d</p> <p>Another former trainee said that they had decided to leave after just over a year of working for Capita and had been asked to pay about \u00a321,000. After protesting, the trainee ended up without her last month of pay, or about \u00a31,200.</p> <p>\u201cI think they knew I was vulnerable as I started as a graduate,\u201d the trainee said. The trainee sought a new job after finding they were being used to \u201cfill HR gaps\u201d rather than being given roles suitable to her training.</p> <p>Capita said that it now charged \u00a313,000 to trainees who wanted to leave before completing their training and two years of work. It said it had previously charged different rates depending on the role involved.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cAll participants in the training are made fully aware, at numerous times prior to commencing the training, that it is provided free of charge to only those people who successfully complete the course and are engaged by Capita or a Capita client. Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.\u201d</p> <p>Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capita\u2019s rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs.<br></p> <p>The group\u2019s graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job.</p> <p>The company also demands that trainees pay up to \u00a320,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for FDM said: \u201cThe professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of \u00a320,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting. We have a commitment to transparency with all applicants to ensure that they understand the terms clearly. Trainees have 14 days from when they start training to trial the programme and leave with no fees charged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.</p> <p>\u201cIndividuals undertaking our bespoke training do not engage in any work or provide any services for us or any of our clients until they have successfully completed their training, passed all relevant internal and external examinations and been assessed as ready for the workplace.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has become the first UK supermarket to cover the cost of the tampon tax for customers, after it cut the price of nearly 100 women\u2019s sanitary products by 5%. The retailer said that the move \u2013 which sees Tesco absorb the cost of VAT, set at 5% on sanitary items \u2013 would help women who found themselves in financial difficulty. Michelle McEttrick, Tesco group brand director, said: \u201cFor many of our customers, tampons, panty-liners and sanitary towels are essential products. However, the cost of buying them every month can add up, and for many women and girls it can be a real struggle on top of other essential items. That\u2019s why we are reducing the cost of these products by 5%.\u201d The price cut will affect both Tesco\u2019s own-label items and more well-known brands. Campaigners have been demanding that the government scraps VAT entirely on women\u2019s sanitary products for years, but due to EU rules it has been unable to lower the rate below 5%. To stave off a backbench rebellion by an alliance of feminist and Eurosceptic MPs, David Cameron persuaded European ministers last year to agree to change the rules to allow zero-rating of sanitary products. But the earliest a new law could come into force would be 2018. Until then, the government promised to spend the revenue from the tax on women\u2019s charities, initially including the anti-abortion and pregnancy counselling organisation Life. In March, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport announced the latest tranche of grants, which took the total handed out to \u00a317m. Paula Sherriff, the Labour MP who has led the campaign against the tampon tax, has praised Tesco\u2019s decision and called on its rivals to follow suit. She said: \u201cIt would have been completely unacceptable if abolishing the tampon tax had just led to big businesses boosting their bottom line at the expense of women buying what are essential goods, which is why we pushed the supermarkets to sign up to a deal to pass the cut on. \u201cBut this goes a step even further, by reducing prices right now \u2013 and I hope the other big retailers now consider doing the same.\u201d The government and the EU should now announce a clear timetable for abolishing VAT on sanitary items altogether, Sherriff also said. Five major supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose \u2013 and Boots, the high street chemist, had originally pledged last year to pass the savings on to customers when the VAT is finally removed.",

      "bodyText": "In Britain the number of flavours available to KitKat fans can be counted on the fingers of two hands. In Japan the varieties on sale at any given time stretch to dozens, including purple sweet potato, edamame bean and wasabi, and owner Nestl\u00e9 is opening a new factory to cater to demand. Opening on Tuesday in the western city of Himeji, the first new KitKat factory to open in Japan in 26 years will specialise in producing small quantities of a wide variety of premium versions of the snack, including strawberry and maple as well as pistachio and raspberry combinations. Launched 82 years ago in the UK as the ideal accompaniment to a cup of tea, the world\u2019s third largest chocolate brand is No1 in Japan. While sales at home have fallen in recent years, they have risen by 50% in Japan since 2010, as KitKat has won over a growing number of fans thanks to a combination of marketing nous and serendipity. The bar first went on sale there in 1973, and was instantly helped by the lucky coincidence that its name closely resembles kitto katsu, a phrase meaning \u201cyou will surely win\u201d in Japanese. In Japan\u2019s gift-obsessed culture, the snack has been adopted as a way to encourage school kids ahead of their exams. Special postable versions and packaging decorated with slogans such as \u201cdo your best\u201d have helped, so that about half the 600,000 students sitting exams each year have munched on a lucky KitKat. The creation of more than 300 flavours since 2004 is also part of cashing in on the tradition of omiyage, in which family members, colleagues and friends bring back gifts for each other from holidays or work trips. There are about 30 dedicated regional flavours of KitKat as well as seasonal specialities, such as cherry blossom, as well as one-off versions in packaging resembling a bottle of sake, Mt Fuji or cheesecake. \u201cInnovative flavours are not uncommon in Japan, but KitKat stands out for its volume of Japan-centric flavours,\u201d says Marcia Mogelonsky, global food and drink analyst at market research firm Mintel. \u201cThe collectible flavours of the products, which leverage some extremely specific Japanese flavours and food ways, are one of the major reasons for its success.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 may have gone to court to try to protect the trademark on its four-fingered bars in Europe, but in Japan KitKats mainly come in chunky two-fingered form or as single fingers or chunks. This year they launched a sushi-shaped version. The launch of KitKat specialist Chocolatory boutiques, overseen by celebrity patissier Yasumasa Takagi, have given the brand an even more upmarket image in Japan. Punters can create a personalised KitKat from a range of 10,000 possible combinations and buy packages of speciality flavours for as much as 3,500 yen (\u00a324), or 10 times the cost of a regular bag Fancy packaging and cheffy twists make the snack a more appropriate gift than might be appreciated in the UK. The development of unusual flavours in Japan, which kicked off with a green tea version in 2004, has also made KitKats a popular buy for tourists from all over Asia as well as Europe. Japan is currently in the middle of a tourism spending boom. Visitors\u2019 spending on sweets, including chocolate, alone has more than tripled over the past four years to 131bn yen in 2016, according to the country\u2019s environment ministry and KitKat is determined to get a bite of that. The Japanese business began to supply some of its unusual flavours, including matcha green tea, to South Korea for the first time last year as it tried to cash in on the snack\u2019s popularity with tourists. There are now Chocalatory outlets in Melbourne, Australia, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, with more planned around the world this year. A pop-up opened in the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, last year. But it\u2019s unlikely that melon and mascarpone or sweet red bean KitKat will be widely on sale in the UK any time soon. In the early noughties, KitKat tried to revive falling sales by bringing in experimental flavours including Christmas pudding, tiramisu and an Atkins diet friendly low-carb bar. The experiment was a sticky mess. In just two years, KitKat\u2019s sales in the UK dived 18%. Now the company sticks to a handful of safe bets including milk chocolate, dark chocolate, peanut butter and cookie dough. Of course it\u2019s always possible to dunk one of those in some green tea for a more Japanese experience.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a flurry of growth reports today, it\u2019s becoming clear that Britain\u2019s economy has underperformed its rivals in the last quarter. Two days ago, we learned that the UK expanded by merely 0.3% in April-June, following a modest expansion of 0.2% in January-March. Today\u2019s data has shown that other advanced countries did rather better. Namely: France: Grew by 0.5% in Q1 and Q2 US: Grew by over 0.6% in Q2, and 0.3% in Q1 Spain: Grew by 0.9% in Q2, and 0.8% in Q1 Sweden: Grew by a rollicking 1.7% in Q2, and 0.6% in Q1 Ireland is likely to post impressive GDP figures, following the growth upgrades from its central bank today (details here). Canada is also enjoying a good quarter, judging by the surge in growth during June (details here). Many of today\u2019s GDP reports showed that trade made a positive contribution to growth in the last quarter; that\u2019s a good sign for the global economy. Britain, though, is being held back by rising inflation and concerns over Brexit. Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says Britain is lagging behind other leading economies. While growth in Q2 has recovered somewhat from its anaemic performance in the first three months of the year, there is still a high level of political and economic uncertainty. Based on our data and analysis, we are maintaining our \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK until there is more clarity on how Brexit and the fallout from the general election will impact businesses operating in the UK market. \u201cOur advice to businesses is to continue to monitor economic indicators and how Brexit negotiations develop over the coming months. Furthermore, we are maintaining our baseline scenario of a gradually slowing economy over the next two years. Leaving the EU will undoubtedly pose challenges, especially for companies whose supply chains involve sourcing from or selling to the continent. Although the weak pound is currently providing support for some sectors, such as manufacturing and tourism, it is far from certain that this stimulus will be enough to counterbalance the adverse Brexit effects over the medium to long term.\u201d Sky News\u2019s political editor, Faisal Islam, reckons this slowdown is forcing the UK government to adjust its Brexit strategy: And on that note, it\u2019s time to stop for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting, and I hope you have a great weekend. GW European stock markets have closed in the red tonight. The FTSE 100 shed 74 points, or 1%, partly due to the slump in tobacco shares. The French and German markets also suffered losses, amid worries that the strong euro will hurt profits. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Investors in the UK market have a high threshold for being impressed by company earnings, but they are quick to punish you if the result doesn\u2019t measure up. It is almost like dealers are looking for excuses not to go long the FTSE 100. Stock markets in Continental Europe have been losing ground since between May and June, and indices like the DAX and CAC 40 can\u2019t seem to shake off the bearish sentiment surrounding them. The strength of the euro is hindering eurozone equity benchmarks, and the market chatter that the European Central Bank will rein in their very aggressive bond buying scheme is also adding to their problems. Wall Street is also down, hit by the healthcare vote debacle - and not helped by reports that North Korea has fired a missile which landed in Japanese waters. Looking back at GDP, Canada has blown past expectations by reporting 0.6% growth in May alone. That suggests its growth during the second quarter will be strong. Back in the markets, shares into tobacco companies are tumbling after US authorities announced a new clampdown on the industry. The Food and Drug Administration is planning to curb the number of deaths caused by tobacco. One of the ideas is to cut the amount of nicotine in combustible cigarettes to \u201cnon-addictive levels\u201d. The FDA\u2019s goal is to save millions of lives, says FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb: \u201cThe overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes \u2013 the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users. \u201cUnless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.\u201d City investors reacted swiftly to the plan, driving British American Tobacco\u2019s shares down by over 10% (it makes Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans). Other major tobacco firms, including Imperial Brands and Philip Morris, are also sliding -- a sign that the FDA\u2019s plan could have a profound effect on their businesses. Back in Greece, Hollywood A-listers are giving the economy\u2019s tourist sector a boost. A steady stream of celebrities are cropping up among the record 30 million choosing the country for holidays this summer. After Australian star Hugh Jakeman spending time on the Cycladic isle of Antiparos (where Tom Hanks regularly summers and has a home), Angelina Jolie and Keanu Reeves have followed suite holidaying this week on the Ionian island of Paxos. Jolie had promised to return to Greece when in her role as ambassador of the UN refugee agency she met prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens last year. The record number of tourists are expected to help the debt-stricken country\u2019s growth prospects following its return to markets on Monday. But .....with visitor numbers growing the economic crime police have also been swooping on islands in a bid to crack down on tax evasion by stores and restaurants. Greece\u2019s independent public revenues body has announced it will undertake an urgent audit of a sample 2.500 hotels country-wide amid widespread speculation that, at the height of the tourist season, they are not declaring all overnight stays. Auditors have been ordered to cross-check declared income with tax remittances filed to the state. Restaurants are also thought to be in the firing line as the leftist-led government seeks to crack down on big time tax evaders. Well-known eateries on popular isles such as Mykonos and Paros are said to earn as much as one million euros a month which they fail to declare. At least some of the revenue, from catering for weddings and other socialite events, is never seen in Greece as it is deposited straight into UK bank accounts.... Oxford Economic\u2019s Gregory Daco has tweeted some useful charts, showing how America\u2019s growth rate picked up in the last quarter.... ...and how consumer spending and exports helped drive the recovery. Associated Press have a good take on today\u2019s US growth report. Here\u2019s a flavour: The U.S. economy revved up this spring after a weak start to the year, fuelled by a surge in consumer spending. But the growth spurt still fell short of the optimistic goals President Donald Trump hopes to achieve through tax cuts and regulatory relief. The Commerce Department said Friday that growth in the gross domestic product, the economy\u2019s total output of goods and services, expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter. That\u2019s more than double the revised 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter. The improvement was powered in large part by robust consumer appetite for items such as clothing and furniture. The 2.6% GDP gain came in close to economists\u2019 expectations. \u201cConsumers continue to drive the economy\u2019s growth, but firmer business investment is also a plus,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWeaker housing construction was the only significant drag on growth in the quarter.\u201d Trump campaigned on a pledge to boost growth to rates of 4% or better. So far, his economic program has not advanced in Congress. More here: Another detail from today\u2019s growth report: Despite accelerating in the last quarter, America\u2019s economy isn\u2019t (yet) achieving the growth rates targeted by Donald Trump. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: \u201cThe US economy has improved following a slow start to the year, in spite of a lack of fiscal stimulus so far from Trump\u2019s presidency. A strong performance in export and industrial sectors has been buoyed by weaker dollar, and we\u2019ve seen a steady increase in earnings too. We\u2019re still some way from the President\u2019s 3%+ growth target, but the good news is this wasn\u2019t priced in by the market, so any additional tax relief or infrastructure spending could support markets into year end. \u201cDespite improving growth, wage inflation remains somewhat elusive, but the labour market remains reasonably strong, and we anticipate the Fed will proceed as planned with its slow and steady programme of interest rate normalisation.\u201d John Ross of the Renmin University of China shows how growth is close to its long-term average: Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says America\u2019s economy is benefitting from consumer spending and business investment: The 2.6% annualised gain in real GDP in the second quarter was driven by a rebound in real consumption growth, and suggests that GDP is still on track for growth of around 2.2% for 2017 as a whole. This should convince the Fed that, despite the recent weakness of core inflation, the real economy remains in good shape. Real consumption increased by 2.8% annualised, up from 1.9% in the first quarter. Furthermore, business investment posted a healthy 5.2% annualised gain, although residential investment declined by nearly 7%. The weakness in the latter is unlikely to last. Meanwhile, after subtracting a massive 1.5% points from growth in the first quarter, inventories were a negligible drag in the second. The annual revisions didn\u2019t change much, with growth in the previous two quarters revised down slightly, and growth for 2016 as a whole nudged down to 1.5%, from 1.6%. Heather Long of the Washington Post says the acceleration in US growth in the last quarter isn\u2019t exceptional. She points out that America\u2019s economy usually accelerates in April-June.... Jason Furman, one of President Obama\u2019s economy advisors, says the economy has grown at its trend level this year. Patrick Chovanec of Silvercrest Asset Management is encouraged the businesses kept investing. US companies helped the American economy grow in the last quarter, according to today\u2019s GDP report. Business spending on equipment rose by 8.2% in the last three months, the fastest since the third quarter of 2015. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts more than doubled, while investment on nonresidential structures increased at a 4.9% pace. Trade added 0.18 percentage point to growth, but investment on homebuilding shrank by 6.8%. Breaking: The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.6% in the second quarter of 2017, more than twice as fast as in Q1. That\u2019s the equivalent of 0.65% quarter-on-quarter growth; double Britain\u2019s 0.3% growth rate,and quicker than France\u2019s 0.5% growth too. American GDP was driven by consumer spending, which grew by 2.8%. Net trade also contributed to growth, with exports up 4.1% and imports up only 2.1%. This is a significant acceleration compared to the first quarter, where growth has been revised down to 1.2% annualised growth (or 0.3% quarter-on-quarter). But it\u2019s very slightly below the consensus forecast, of 2.7% annualise growth. More to follow.... It\u2019s nearly time for the biggest event of the day - the first estimate of US GDP in the second quarter of the year. Wall Street\u2019s finest minds agree that the growth rate probably rebounded after slowing in Q1, although they don\u2019t agree by how much.... These figures are all annualised, so divide by four to get the true quarterly growth rate.... The figures land at 1.30pm BST, or 8.30am in Washington.... The Economist Intelligence Unit have hailed Sweden\u2019s eye-catchingly fast growth: Economic issues are also on the agenda in Greece today, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been hailing its return to growth earlier this year. Helena Smith our correspondent in Athens, reports: Addressing the second in a series of regional growth conferences in the central town of Lamia, the leftist leader declared that economic recovery was now the equivalent of thrice-bailed out Greece regaining its national sovereignty. He told an audience of local business leaders, politicians and regional officials that: \u201cThe goal of growth is connected to the very existence of our nation, our national sovereignty, the prosperity of our people, our children.\u201d Tsipras said that Greece is finally heading out of seven long dark years, after returning to the financial markets on Monday with its first bond sale since 2014. The government hopes to repeat that test run soon, as it prepared to exit its current \u20ac86bn bailout programme in August 2018. The prime minister had made a similar pledge in an exclusive interview with the Guardian on Monday in which he described Greece\u2019s regaining of economic sovereignty as a \u201cpriority.\u201d There\u2019s another reason why stock markets are edgy today \u2013 Amazon. The e-commerce giant missed earnings forecasts last night, sending its shares down 3% in after-hours trading. Although Amazon\u2019s sales beat expectations, profits were lower than expected as the company spent more on infrastructure like warehouses and data centres. It\u2019s a reminder that Amazon\u2019s strong growth, and its habit of expanding into ever-new areas, comes at a price.... This meant that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos lost the crown of being the world\u2019s richest man, just a few hours after wrestling it from Bill Gates. I suspect his time will come again... Ireland\u2019s central bank has hiked its growth forecasts for this year, but warned that Brexit is a significant threat. The Central Bank of Ireland now expects GDP to surge by 4.5% this year, up from the 3.5% it expected back in April. It also raised its 2018 growth forecasts to 3.6%, from 3.2%. Central Bank Chief Economist Gabriel Fagan explained that Ireland is benefitting from Europe\u2019s recovery: \u201cRevised projections for growth this year and in 2018 reflect both stronger momentum in the domestic economy and improved prospects for external demand, especially from our European trading partners,\u201d But..... \u201cAs a small and open economy, Ireland continues to face economic risks externally. And despite there being little new information emerging to date, it is clear that the economic impact of Brexit on Ireland is set to be negative and material. At home, we must continue to prudently monitor the risk of overheating.\u201d The full economic impact depends on exactly what form of Brexit Britain ends up with. If it exits the customs union and the single market, then robust border controls would probably be reinstalled between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However, there are reports today that Dublin is pushing for border controls to be shifted to the coastline. That idea has already been attacked by Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist politicians - including the DUP, who are propping up the UK government in Westminster... European stock markets have responded to today\u2019s solid growth reports by, er, falling to their lowest level in three months. France\u2019s CAC is the worst performer, down 1.4%, with Germany and the UK not too far behind. This is partly due to the strength of the euro, which has rallied to a 2.5 year high this week. Traders are also nervous after watching the US Senate shoot down Donald Trump\u2019s latest attack on Obamacare. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Market explains: \u201cEquities are in the red mid-morning, sentiment dented by fresh dollar weakness as even a \u2018skinny\u2019 US healthcare repeal bill fails in the Senate, delivering more unwelcome pound and euro strength. Breaking! Economic confidence across the eurozone has inched up to its highest level in a decade. It\u2019s the latest in a stream of upbeat data, which underline how Europe is putting its debt crisis behind it. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment index, just released, has hit 111.2 for July, up from 111.1 in June. That\u2019s the highest level since the financial crisis began a decade ago. Construction firms and service sector companies reported the biggest improvement in sentiment, while consumer confidence dipped. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says: \u201cWhile the UK wrestles with its lowest levels of consumer confidence since the Brexit vote, things are far rosier on the continent. The latest reading suggests that spending is at healthy levels in the eurozone despite the heightened political and economic uncertainty. \u201cWith the first quarter of the year proving to be a challenge for the eurozone following UK and French general elections, spirits haven\u2019t been dampened in the aftermath and consumers refuse to be unfazed by tricky economic conditions. \u201cWith steady employment figures continuing to have a positive bearing on consumer confidence and showing no signs of letting up, Michel Barnier will feel he holds the chips while looking across the table at David Davis, as Brexit talks rumble on.\u201d Today\u2019s eurozone growth figures have helped to push the euro a little higher against the US dollar. The euro is back over $1.17 this morning, a gain of 0.2%. The dollar, though, is also suffering from Donald Trump\u2019s latest failure to dismantle Obamacare. After a dramatic late-night vote, the so-called \u201cskinny repeal\u2019 bill was rejected by the Senate, by 51 votes to 49. Crucially, veteran lawmaker John McCain was one of three Republicans to vote against the measure, which would have left millions more Americans without healthcare cover. This makes it even less likely that Trump can achieve a major infrastructure spending programme, or tax reforms (cuts). Kit Juckes of Societe General explains: The man of the moment this morning is John McCain who voted no and so the Senate failed to repeal Obamacare by a single vote. Another hurdle for President Trump\u2019s healthcare reform, another hurdle backing the funds for tax reform, another hurdle in the way of higher Treasury yields and a so nothing good for the dollar in that announcement. Update: Although McCain\u2019s vote was both dramatic and decisive, Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have led the battle against Trump\u2019s healthcare plans. More here: Silvia Walter of Swiss Life Asset Managers is impressed by Spain\u2019s recovery: Sweden\u2019s growth rate is \u201ccrazy strong\u201d, says Torbj\u00f6rn Isaksson of Nordea Markets. He reckons the Swedish economy continues to perform very well, mainly due to strong domestic demand. Isaksson adds: GDP rose by a full 1.7% q/q and as much as 4.0% y/y. Our call was 1.1% q/q while the Riksbank\u2019s forecast was 0.7% q/q. Moreover, the first quarter was revised upwards by 0.2% points to 0.6% q/q. The main surprises are fixed investments and inventories. Residential construction continues to be a very important growth driver (scary!), but also other investments seem to have picked up and more than forecast. Inventories weighed on growth but much less than we had in mind. Wowzers! Sweden\u2019s economy grew by a blistering 1.7% in the last quarter. That smashes analyst forecasts of 1% growth, and means Sweden\u2019s economy has expanded by an impressive 4% over the last year. Sweden appears to be benefitting from its current loose monetary policy - interest rates are negative, to encourage banks to lend..... Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.8% in the last quarter, thanks to a boost in trade. New figures show that exports jumped by 2.4% in April to June, up from 2.0% in January to March. Spain\u2019s economy has finally reached its pre-crisis peak, thanks to the 0.9% growth recorded in the last quarter. That\u2019s an important moment, but it has come at a cost. As El Pais points out, Spain still employs 1.9 million fewer people than in 2008. Newsflash: Spain has recorded another strong quarter of growth, beating both the UK and France. Spanish GDP rose by 0.9% in the last three months, new figures from statistics body INE show. That\u2019s three times as fast Britain managed during the quarter, and nearly double France\u2019s growth rate. That\u2019s up from 0.8% in the first quarter of 2017, and means Spain\u2019s economy has now grown for 15 quarters in a row (or nearly four years). On an annual basis, Spanish GDP grew by 3.1%. More to follow.... Ouch. Shares in BT have fallen by 1.7% at the start of trading after posting a 40% drop in profits. My colleague Mark Sweney explains why.... BT\u2019s profits slumped more than 40% in the first quarter of its new financial year after it was forced to pay out \u00a3225m to two shareholders following the accounting scandal at its Italian operation. Deutsche Telekom and Orange became shareholders in BT after the company struck a \u00a312.5bn cash and shares deal to buy mobile company EE in 2015. As part of that deal the two companies were issued a warranty as a protection against a slump in BT\u2019s performance. DT and Orange triggered a claim under the warranty after BT\u2019s stock market value plunged by almost \u00a38bn, after the company revealed the extent of a \u00a3530m accounting scandal at its Italian operation. BT\u2019s share price remains more than 20% lower that it was a year ago. The news that France\u2019s economy grew by a healthy 0.5% last quarter should reassure investors, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: Over in Europe, the French GDP data brought more light for the Eurozone\u2019s economy. The problem child of the Eurozone is no longer a problem child, in fact, it has grown up and living up to the expectations. Bloomberg journalist Mark Deen reckons the French economy has entered a purple patch: Over in the City, Barclays has told shareholders its setting aside another \u00a3700m to cover the cost of the PPI scandal (in which customers were sold insurance they didn\u2019t need, or ask for). Barclays has also posted a net loss of \u00a31.2bn for the last six months, having losing \u00a32.2bn through the sale of its Africa business. More on that shortly.... Diego Iscaro, senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight, thinks France\u2019s economy is in decent shape. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s GDP figures: France\u2019s GDP rose by 0.5% q/q during the second quarter of 2017, according to seasonally-adjusted figures released by the INSEE. The economy had grown by the same magnitude during the first three months of the year. Net foreign trade was the main driver of growth during the second quarter, adding 0.8 percentage point to the total change in demand, as exports rebounded strongly. Domestic demand, excluding stocks, also made a positive contribution. Internal demand was boosted by a new increase in investment spending (although it decelerated compared to the first quarter) and a modest acceleration in private consumption. The figures show France\u2019s economy posting solid growth during the second quarter and support our view that GDP is likely to grow by around 1.6% in 2017. This would be the strongest performance in six years. We expect growth to remain healthy during the second half of the year, boosted by gradually improving labour market situation, muted inflation and solid external demand. Confidence indices suggest that firms and households are also more upbeat about the economic outlook, which should also help to support domestic demand. Investment spending should also be supported by favourable credit conditions and improving demand levels during the second half of 2017. The French economic recovery seems to be well stablished, but there are still risks on the horizon. Although hopes for the implementation of reforms \u2013 particularly on the fiscal and labour market fronts \u2013 are high, the risk of the government not delivering as expected is not negligible, despite its large majority in the National Assembly. Today\u2019s growth figures should cheer France\u2019s new leader, says Mehreen Khan of the FT. She writes: The official figures will be a boon for president Macron who has vowed to overhaul the French economy after years of lagging behind its major eurozone rival, Germany. Unemployment in France is now at its lowest since the eurozone crisis, inflation has been tamed, and business surveys are revealing the best confidence levels in a decade. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics agrees that France did well in the last quarter.... Bloomberg\u2019s Fergal O\u2019Brien flags up that France\u2019s economy has now grown for a year. This chart shows how net trade boosted French growth in the last quarter. Breaking: France\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2017. That matches economists\u2019 forecasts, and outpaces Britain\u2019s 0.3% growth in the last three months. It means that France\u2019s economy has now grown steadily for the last year, and by 0.5% per quarter for the last nine months. That\u2019s a pretty solid performance. The French economy was helped by a surge in exports - they rose by 3.1% in April to June, while imports only rose by 0.2%. Consumer spending rose too, to 0.3% from 0.1% in Q1. However, business investment slowed to 0.5% from 2.1% in January to March. On an annual basis, French GDP grew by 1.8% - again, slightly faster than Britain\u2019s 1.7% year-on-year growth. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get two key pieces of economic data this morning - new growth figures from France and America. Together, they\u2019ll help us to see how the global economy performed in the second quarter of this year. Economists expect that both countries grew fairly solidly, with French GDP tipped to rise by 0.5% and America\u2019s by around 0.7% (or 2.7% on an annualised basis). We also find out how Canada\u2019s economy performed in May. Update: Spanish growth figures are also coming this morning. It\u2019s also another busy morning for financial news. Barclays bank, telecoms group BT, airline operator IAG and online estate agent Rightmove are among those reporting results.

      "bodyText": "The beautiful, listed facades of the Port of London Authority and the Central Cold Store, which once held animal carcasses from Smithfield market opposite, stand as a reminder of London\u2019s industrial and commercial past. But behind these brick walls in the heart of London is a hidden power station that could resolve how the UK heats, cools and powers business of the future. The station, Citigen, has been owned and run by E.ON since 2002 but has been generating electricity since 1993, producing enough power for 11,300 homes and capturing the byproduct heat to send it off to buildings in the City of London via a network of tunnels. It also provides chilled water, which is used for cooling in several properties\u2019 air conditioning systems. There is no other combined heat and power plant of such scale in the centre of a UK city. E.ON has just finished a three-year, \u00a326m refurbishment that involved replacing the plant\u2019s two unreliable and dirty ship engines with smaller, cleaner gas versions at the start of this year. In the process, it has signed up new customers such as Blake Tower, a recently refurbished block of flats and Barts Square, a mixed residential-commercial development \u2013 the first new connections to the heat network for a decade. John Armstrong, who heads E.ON\u2019s decentralised energy unit, said: \u201cThe company previously didn\u2019t necessarily know what to do with it [Citigen], but now we\u2019ve invested heavily in it and recognise its importance in the heart of the city. The new connections show that there\u2019s a demand for lower carbon heating and chill.\u201d The central location and listed buildings made the upgrade a challenge. The roof was taken off and a tower crane used to pluck out the enormous old engines and vast tank holding the 1m tonnes of diesel that powered them. Above ground sits a new control room that now not only runs the power station beneath it but manages the 60 other district heating schemes that E.ON owns around the UK. Wending your way deeper inside, across fragments of the building\u2019s original tiling, are the rooms that house Citigen\u2019s beating heart: the two gas engines, the equipment that recovers the engines\u2019 heat and make the plant so efficient, the 50-metre tall thermal store (effectively a big hot water tank), and the chilling machines. Water is heated to 105C-110C in the thermal store, before being piped out to the 17 connections served by the plant. The facility produces three times as much heat as it does chill, but the demand for cooling is growing faster, said Armstrong. The fabric of historic buildings in the capital\u2019s centre have been upgraded to retain much of their heat, but they were never designed for increasingly hot summers and are not good at keeping cool as the world warms. From Smithfield, the network spiders out underground for 4 miles of heating and 2.7 miles of chill, taking in Guildhall to the south-east and the Barbican Centre to the east. Around half of the pipes, made from steel and insulated with a foam doughnut around them, run through existing City of London tunnels, already crammed with power, communication and sewage pipes and cabling. The rest snakes through underground car parks, subways and basements. In the basement of Blake Tower, the pipes connect to a heat substation, which takes up roughly the same space as around half a dozen parked bicycles. The compact nature of this kit and the space-saving it offers businesses is one of Citigen\u2019s selling points in a part of the city where every square foot is at a premium. But expansion and new connections are not always straightforward. While there are many existing tunnels, new digging and road closures are required too \u2013 sometimes at a cost of as much as \u00a310,000 per metre in the capital. Emily Lister, business development manager for Citigen, said: \u201cThe problem in London is that what seems like a short distance, in district heating terms is a very long distance. It\u2019s very difficult because of the history of the city, it\u2019s so congested.\u201d Such networks are niche in the UK today, especially compared to technology leaders such as Denmark and Sweden, but experts say they must expand if the UK is to meet its legally binding carbon targets. While great strides have been made in cutting emissions from power \u2013 50% of which is now low carbon \u2013 the much larger problem of decarbonising heat has barely been touched. Heat networks such as Citigen at present supply around 2% of UK heating demand, but the government\u2019s climate advisers believe that could reach 10% by 2030. As a result, the government is funding heat networks with \u00a3320m over five years. \u201cThe last big challenge is heat,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cYou can electrify heat but that would require significant infrastructure investment. That\u2019s where heat networks come in, as an alternative for how you provide carbon savings.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Santander has reduced its mortgage lending and its loans for car purchase amid Bank of England warnings about reckless lending and a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d over mounting consumer debt. Its total mortgage lending fell by \u00a31bn to \u00a311.6bn in the first half of 2017 compared with 2016, with lending for buy-to-let down significantly. Net lending \u2013 which takes into account how many people remortgaged away from Santander \u2013 fell over the half year by \u00a3200m. Net consumer finance lending \u2013 covering car loans and credit cards \u2013 fell to \u00a397m from \u00a3266m, partly due to \u201ca decrease in the stock of new car registrations\u201d. Nathan Bostock, the Santander UK chief executive, said: \u201cWe do face uncertainty and that was my view at our last results. Generally we have done less unsecured and credit card lending, and are probably down 10% on balances.\u201d Bostock said intense competition is driving down interest rates to historically low levels, and accused competitors of offering better rates on car loans and credit cards than are charged to much more secure mortgage customers. But he added that the risks of car loans should be put in a broader context. \u201cUnsecured lending is a \u00a360 to \u00a370bn market, but the mortgage market is \u00a31.3tn.\u201d He added that non-performing loans (where customers have fallen behind payments) stood at just 0.48% of the unsecured book of lending, and that mortgage arrears remained very low. Bostock pledged not to make further rate cuts to the hugely popular 123 account, where interest rates were halved in November last year. About 3.6 million people in the UK have the account, which was paying 3% interest on balances up to \u00a320,000, but the rate was halved to 1.5%. Despite slashing interest payouts on 123, Santander said its \u201cloyal retail customer base\u201d continued to grow, rising to 3.9 million customers. The typical mortgage lent by Santander remained steady at \u00a3198,000, with the average for London and the south-east at \u00a3263,000 and in the rest of the country at \u00a3146,000. It said the typical buyer was taking out a loan equal to 3.18 times their income, up from 3.16 times in December 2016. Santander\u2019s total profit for the half year was down 1% to \u00a31,063m from \u00a31,078m, with \u00a369m set aside to cover PPI payouts.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has set aside an extra \u00a3700m for the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal and revealed it has taken a loss on the sale of part of its African business. The bank reported profits for the first six months of the year of \u00a32.3bn, up 13%, but the accounting treatment of the sale of its African arm resulted in a \u00a31.2bn loss for shareholders. Even so, Jes Staley, the bank\u2019s embattled chief executive, said the restructuring he had embarked upon since taking the helm in December 2015 was now complete. \u201cOur business is now radically simplified, the restructuring is complete, our capital ratio is within our ... target range, and while we are also working to put conduct issues behind us, we can now focus on what matters most to our shareholders: improving group returns,\u201d said Staley. The bank\u2019s legal disclosures outline the investigation under way into Staley\u2019s efforts to unmask a whistleblower and the fraud charges the bank\u2019s holding company faces in relation to the way it raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008. Running to more than 10 pages, the bank repeats legal claims it faces for a range of issues including a competition investigation in Portugal to terrorist financing investigations in the US. The bank is fighting accusations by the US Department of Justice \u2013 made in December \u2013 over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal. With regards to the whistleblowing investigation, the bank said it and Staley \u201care cooperating fully\u201d with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. \u201cBarclays is also providing information to, and cooperating with, authorities in the United States with respect to these matters,\u201d the bank said. Staley did not elaborate on the investigation but said he had the support of the board and pointed to the bank\u2019s strong results. The additional provision for PPI mis-selling takes Barclays\u2019 total bill to \u00a39.1bn and follows the move by Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday to increase its PPI provisions, taking its total to \u00a318.1bn. In pulling back from Africa, Staley broke away from his predecessors who had regarded the operation as a key area for growth. The retreat has been performed at a loss \u2013 which was caused by a \u00a31.4bn deficit on the sale of the 33% stake and a \u00a31.1bn impairment charge on the sale. But his aim is to free up capital and eventually step up dividends to shareholders after cutting payouts when he joined. The dividend is 1p a share for the first half and the bank will set out a new dividend plan with the full year results in February. The bank\u2019s shares were down nearly 1% at 206.7p by lunchtime \u2013 below the 233p level at which Staley bought shares in November 2015 before taking the helm. The bank has a large credit card business, Barclaycard, part of the consumer credit market that is being scrutinised by the Bank of England, which this week warned of a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d about mounting consumer debt. Staley said impairments were not a concern but noted that debt was increasing at a time when consumer confidence was falling which could be cause for concern. However, he added: \u201cWe have a very conservative approach to credit ... We are not pulling back from extending credit to the UK.\u201d He also said the bank had signed a co-branded credit card deal with Uber. Overall profits at the corporate and investment banking arm were up 7%, but in the division\u2019s bond trading operation profits fell 20% at time when rivals are also experiencing a slowdown. The bank is undergoing a restructuring to comply with new rules that require banks to ringfence their high street operations from the investment banking operations \u2013 known as the Vickers rules \u2013 by 2019. It is also making changes to cope with Brexit and is expanding in Dublin. Staley said businesses in the UK would need to start their Brexit contingency planning and said the government was reaching out to the business community as negotiations begin. There was going to be a \u201cdegree of uncertainty for the next couple of years\u201d, he said. Barclays\u2019 13% rise in profits was in part generated by a \u00a3615m gain from the sale of its stake in Visa, and the completion of the restructuring prompted Staley to set a new target to achieve a return on equity \u2013 a measure of performance for shareholders \u2013 of greater than 10%. Analysts at Shore Capital said the results \u201care worse than expected due to weaker than anticipated income performance and a further material PPI\u201d charge.",

    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot's 'pivotal' year is turning out horribly | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This year would be \u201cpivotal\u201d for AstraZeneca, its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, has said for ages. It would mark the moment when the firm would display the new wonders from its laboratories. The march towards annual revenues of $45bn (\u00a334.5bn) by 2023, the target set when Pfizer\u2019s takeover offer was rebuffed three years ago, would begin in earnest. So how is 2017 shaping up? Horribly. The share price has just crashed by 15% because a key lung cancer drug flopped in clinical trials. In January, Luke Miels, the European boss, hopped off to join its arch-rival, GlaxoSmithKline. And Soriot himself has spent a fortnight declining to shed useful light on the story that he considered quitting to join the Israeli outfit Teva. The failure of the so-called Mystic lung cancer drug trial is plainly the most serious in that list. Success would have demonstrated AstraZeneca\u2019s credentials in the new field of immunotherapy, with drugs that use the body\u2019s own defence mechanisms. Imfinzi, the drug in question, was spoken about as a potential replacement for chemotherapy. All is not lost yet, it should be said. The first stage of the trial merely measured the drug\u2019s ability to prevent a cancer becoming worse. The second stage, which looks at survival rates, is arguably more important. The results are due next year and Soriot has appealed for patience. But you can\u2019t blame investors for assuming more bad news could follow: AstraZeneca chose a two-stage structure because it was expecting to celebrate early. Soriot was on firmer ground when he argued there\u2019s more to AstraZeneca\u2019s pipeline and new products than just Mystic. That\u2019s definitely true. Another lung cancer pill, Tagrisso, has produced good data and the company is forming a potentially big partnership with Merck on another immuno-oncology drug, Lynparza. Jolly good, but neither development fills the Mystic-sized hole. The $45bn revenue target now has a huge credibility deficit. The City can\u2019t see how the growth can possibly be achieved. There was a parallel credibility shortfall in Soriot\u2019s answers about the Teva tale. Having said he wouldn\u2019t comment on rumours, he then offered a series of ambiguous comments, such as \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d and, finally: \u201cI\u2019m not a quitter.\u201d Did the latter mean he\u2019s the sort of chap who is generally up for a challenge, or was it a 100% commitment to AstraZeneca? It was impossible to tell. The board should hope Soriot is unswervingly loyal because it would look even sillier for paying him \u00a313m last year. The largest slice compromised rewards for supposed long-term success. Now that the long-term is arriving, success is revealed as a work in progress, to put it mildly. The share price is \u00a343, a far cry from the \u00a355 that Pfizer was waving. Failures in clinical trials are part of life, of course. Rewarding success before it has happened doesn\u2019t have to be. At last, the last Lloyds PPI provision? The state is no longer a shareholder, but some things never change at Lloyds Banking Group. There\u2019s always another provision for past mis-selling of payment protection insurance, or PPI. The bill this time was \u00a31bn, taking the running total to \u00a318.1bn. The latest whack is intended to be the last. We\u2019ve heard the same boast many times, but it sounds more believable now because an industry-wide deadline for claims has been set for 2019. So does a nice clean set of accounts lie over the horizon? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Banks\u2019 ability to confess to fresh \u201cconduct\u201d issues seems limitless. Lloyds\u2019 out-of-leftfield announcement was a \u00a3340m bill for giving redress to customers who were mistakenly hit with fees when they were in arrears on mortgage payments. That episode does, genuinely, seem to have been an honest mistake, as opposed to the deliberate gouging of customers that was PPI. Lloyds, as the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio keeps saying, is a much-improved bank these days. But half a billion, here and there, saps investors\u2019 enthusiasm. Sky\u2019s limited earnings Sky\u2019s outside shareholders won\u2019t care how much its chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and finance director, Andrew Griffith, earn as long as they get their hands on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s takeover cash eventually. All the same, there\u2019s something odd about the latest share-based windfalls for the top duo. Darroch will collect \u00a311.5m and Griffith \u00a36.75m after an incentive scheme allocated a maximum payout based on Sky\u2019s operational performance to the three years to the end of June. This seems surprising. In terms of hard financials, 2014-17 will not be remembered as a vintage period for Sky. What were the performance yardsticks? One was earnings per share, which makes the maximum award even odder. From a base level of 57p in 2013-14, Sky\u2019s earnings, expressed in its preferred \u201cadjusted\u201d format, were: 56p, then 63.1p and now 61.4p. In other words, earnings fell in two out of the three years. Yes, the earnings may count as respectable in a rough media climate. But isn\u2019t Sky supposed to believe in better?",

      "body": "<p>This year would be \u201cpivotal\u201d for AstraZeneca, its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, has said for ages. It would mark the moment when the firm would display the new wonders from its laboratories. The march towards annual revenues of $45bn (\u00a334.5bn) by 2023, the target set when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/astrazeneca-board-reject-pfizer-takeover-bid\">Pfizer\u2019s takeover offer was rebuffed</a> three years ago, would begin in earnest. So how is 2017 shaping up?</p> <p>Horribly. The share price has just crashed by 15% because a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/astrazeneca-shares-mystic-lung-cancer-drug-trial\">key lung cancer drug flopped in clinical trials</a>. In January, Luke Miels, the European boss, hopped off to join its arch-rival, GlaxoSmithKline. And Soriot himself has spent a fortnight declining to shed useful light on the story that he considered quitting to join the Israeli outfit Teva.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/astrazeneca-shares-mystic-lung-cancer-drug-trial\">AstraZeneca shares dive after failure in key lung cancer drug trial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The failure of the so-called Mystic lung cancer drug trial is plainly the most serious in that list. Success would have demonstrated AstraZeneca\u2019s credentials in the new field of immunotherapy, with drugs that use the body\u2019s own defence mechanisms. Imfinzi, the drug in question, was spoken about as a potential replacement for chemotherapy.</p> <p>All is not lost yet, it should be said. The first stage of the trial merely measured the drug\u2019s ability to prevent a cancer becoming worse. The second stage, which looks at survival rates, is arguably more important. The results are due next year and Soriot has appealed for patience. But you can\u2019t blame investors for assuming more bad news could follow: AstraZeneca chose a two-stage structure because it was expecting to celebrate early.</p> <p>Soriot was on firmer ground when he argued there\u2019s more to AstraZeneca\u2019s pipeline and new products than just Mystic. That\u2019s definitely true. Another lung cancer pill, Tagrisso, has produced good data and the company is forming a potentially big partnership with Merck on another immuno-oncology drug, Lynparza. Jolly good, but neither development fills the Mystic-sized hole. The $45bn revenue target now has a huge credibility deficit. The City can\u2019t see how the growth can possibly be achieved.</p> <p>There was a parallel credibility shortfall in Soriot\u2019s answers about the Teva tale. Having said he wouldn\u2019t comment on rumours, he then offered a series of ambiguous comments, such as \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d and, finally: \u201cI\u2019m not a quitter.\u201d Did the latter mean he\u2019s the sort of chap who is generally up for a challenge, or was it a 100% commitment to AstraZeneca? It was impossible to tell.</p> <p>The board should hope Soriot is unswervingly loyal because it would look even sillier for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/astrazeneca-shareholders-revolt-again-over-executive-pay\">paying him \u00a313m last year</a>. The largest slice compromised rewards for supposed long-term success. Now that the long-term is arriving, success is revealed as a work in progress, to put it mildly. The share price is \u00a343, a far cry from the \u00a355 that Pfizer was waving. Failures in clinical trials are part of life, of course. Rewarding success before it has happened doesn\u2019t have to be.</p> <h2>At last, the last Lloyds PPI provision?</h2> <p>The state is no longer a shareholder, but some things never change at Lloyds Banking Group. There\u2019s always another provision for past mis-selling of payment protection insurance, or PPI. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/lloyds-ppi-compensation-claims-banking-group-mortgages\">The bill this time was \u00a31bn</a>, taking the running total to \u00a318.1bn. The latest whack is intended to be the last. We\u2019ve heard the same boast many times, but it sounds more believable now because an industry-wide deadline for claims has been set for 2019.</p> <p>So does a nice clean set of accounts lie over the horizon? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Banks\u2019 ability to confess to fresh \u201cconduct\u201d issues seems limitless. Lloyds\u2019 out-of-leftfield announcement was a \u00a3340m bill for giving redress to customers who were mistakenly hit with fees when they were in arrears on mortgage payments.</p> <p>That episode does, genuinely, seem to have been an honest mistake, as opposed to the deliberate gouging of customers that was PPI. Lloyds, as the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio keeps saying, is a much-improved bank these days. But half a billion, here and there, saps investors\u2019 enthusiasm.</p> <h2>Sky\u2019s limited earnings</h2> <p>Sky\u2019s outside shareholders won\u2019t care how much its chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and finance director, Andrew Griffith, earn as long as they get their hands on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s takeover cash eventually.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT\u2019s profits fell more than 40% in the first quarter of its new financial year after it was forced to pay out \u00a3225m to two shareholders following the accounting scandal at its Italian operation. Deutsche Telekom and Orange became shareholders in BT after the company struck a \u00a312.5bn cash and shares deal to buy mobile company EE in 2015. As part of that deal the two companies were issued a warranty as a protection against a slump in BT\u2019s performance. BT\u2019s stock market value dropped by almost \u00a38bn in January after the company revealed the full extent of a \u00a3530m accounting scandal at its Italian operation. BT\u2019s share price remains more than 20% lower than it was a year ago. BT said the \u00a3225m payout represented a \u201cfull and final settlement in respect of these issues\u201d. The company\u2019s share price fell by more than 4% in early trading on Friday as investors digested the latest bad news to hit the company. Gavin Patterson, the BT chief executive, said DT and Orange \u201conly very recently\u201d raised the issue of a payment ahead of a deadline to make a claim at the end of the day on Friday. He said the settlement was better than facing a longer legal process that would have been triggered if an official claim was lodged. He added that there were still a \u201csmall number\u201d of class action suits related to the accounting scandal lodged by investors in the US. \u201cWe think we have a strong case to defend but I can\u2019t comment on those,\u201d he said. The ongoing fallout of the Italian accounting scandal has resulted in Patterson\u2019s pay for last year being slashed by \u00a34m, and prompted a restructure with the axing of 4,000 jobs, about half in the UK. The charge hurt BT\u2019s financial performance badly, with pre-tax profits slumping 42% from \u00a3717m to \u00a3418m in the three months to the end of June. Stripping out the impact of the one-off \u00a3225m payment, BT\u2019s adjusted profits still fell by 2% to \u00a31.78bn in its first quarter. The company attributed this to increased pension costs, programme rights and investing in bringing all of its call centre operations back to the UK. In March, BT paid \u00a31.18bn for Champions League football rights, 32% more than the previous deal, to fend off Sky. The rising cost of sports rights has also affected Sky, which on Thursday said a one-off \u00a3629m step-up in Premier League rights costs drove a 14% drop in profits at its UK and Ireland operation. \u201cThe days of rampant [rights cost] inflation I think are behind us,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cI think we are getting to a point where rights fees will increasingly be challenged in terms of inflation. We are prepared to walk away if the price is too high.\u201d Upcoming sports rights auctions include the Football League, which is expected to be a high-stakes bidding war with Sky, and ATP World Tour Tennis. BT added just 8,000 new TV customers, following an equally anaemic 11,000 in the first quarter of the year \u2013 close to a record low. Patterson said overall BT delivered an \u201cencouraging performance\u201d in its first quarter, with total revenues up 1% to \u00a35.8bn. BT pointed to a healthy 9% increase in broadband and TV revenue, fuelled by price rises, and a 4% rise at EE to \u00a31.3bn. The company also announced a further restructure that will see its BT Consumer division, home to its TV service and broadband operation, merged with mobile business EE. As a result the BT Consumer chief executive John Petter, a 13-year BT veteran, is to leave the company. Marc Allera, the chief executive of EE, will take control of the enlarged division. Patterson indicated that the merger was likely to lead to job cuts beyond what the company announced in May.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has filled the vacancy on the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setting committee left by the departure of Charlotte Hogg, following the appointment of Sir David Ramsden as the central bank\u2019s new deputy governor. The chancellor said Sir David, who is the Treasury\u2019s chief economic adviser, would take up the role as deputy governor of markets and banking, making him Threadneedle Street\u2019s eyes and ears on the banking sector while also giving him a position on the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC). City analysts said they expected Sir David, who advised Hammond and former chancellor George Osborne on the government\u2019s austerity programme, to vote with the bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney and the majority of the MPC to hold interest rates when he takes up his post on 4 September. With the appointment, Hammond has filled the last MPC vacancy after Hogg quit and external member Kristin Forbes left following a three-year term, although he has failed in his mission to improve the committee\u2019s gender balance. The former London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro will be the only woman on the MPC when it votes next week. Known for his role in keeping the UK out of the euro, Sir David is a life-long civil servant who has risen through the ranks of the Treasury to be its most senior economist and head of the government\u2019s economic service, which effectively puts him in charge of economic advisers across Whitehall. In the late 1990s, Labour chancellor Gordon Brown put Sir David in charge of evaluating Britain\u2019s readiness to join the euro. Eighteen reports later, he and his team condensed their efforts into one assessment of five tests that Brown said needed to be met before the UK could join. Sir David persuaded Tony Blair in 2003 that joining the euro would prove disastrous. Carney is expected to appreciate Sir David\u2019s reputation for loyalty. A keen cyclist, he is known to value a range of opinions and has spoken in favour of a more pluralist approach to the way universities teach economics. However, it was his department that produced the economic forecasts that paved the way for Osborne\u2019s austerity programme which critics argue has left the economy in a weaker situation almost a decade after the 2008 financial crash. Carney said: \u201cAs an outstanding public servant, he will bring a wealth of experience and economic expertise to the Bank\u2019s policy committees.\u201d Sir David replaces Hogg, the scion of the Hogg political dynasty and BoE official who resigned earlier this year after she failed to disclose that her brother was a senior executive at Barclays \u2013 a bank she would have regulated. Hogg was also chief operating officer. That job has gone to Joanna Place, who was previously the central bank\u2019s human resources director. Sir David has a long list of responsibilities in his new role, the Treasury said, including managing the government\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and the gathering of market intelligence relevant to policy decisions. Sir Dave, as he is known, will also be a member of the financial policy committee, the prudential regulation committee and the court of the Bank of England.",

      "bodyText": "The Libor interest rate benchmark used to price billions of pounds of financial products, which was linked to a series of bank scandals, is to be phased out. The index will be phased out in 2021 despite a series of reforms put in place to clean up the way the rate is set. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, made the announcement after admitting banks no longer wanted to participate in setting the rate, which underpins the financial system and is used to price more than $350tn of financial products around the world. Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered rate \u2013 was a little-known benchmark until the financial crisis and the subsequent discovery that banks had been manipulating the rate. Their activities led to fines totalling billions of pounds. Several senior bankers lost their jobs as a result of the manipulation, and one trader, Tom Hayes from the Swiss bank UBS, was jailed for 11 years for distorting the index. The scandal prompted a change in the way the rate was set. Previously it was an estimate of the price a panel of banks would pay to borrow from each other, in a number of currencies and over different time periods. The rate was changed to more accurately reflect the actual price the banks paid. But Bailey said that not enough activity was taking place for the benchmark rates to be priced under the new format. However, the benchmark is so widely used to price financial products that it would take five years for an alternative to be found. Libor is used to price loans to companies and also \u2013 in some countries \u2013 to price mortgages. The problem, said Bailey, was that the market Libor was trying to measure \u2013 the price banks lend to each other \u2013 was no longer active in the way it was before the 2008 crisis, when banks funded their business by borrowing from one another. Bailey said regulators did not \u201csuspect further wrongdoing or have any evidence of such\u201d. He said: \u201cOver the past years I, and my predecessors and colleagues at the FCA, have spent a lot of time persuading panel banks to continue submitting to Libor. We have been concerned that withdrawal of panel banks would weaken the representativeness and robustness of the rate. And we have been concerned about the risk that if one or more banks leave, other panel banks would want to do the same. \u201cWe could not \u2013 and cannot \u2013 countenance the market disruption that would be caused by an unexpected and unplanned disappearance of Libor.\u201d He said work must \u201cbegin in earnest\u201d on shifting to an alternative benchmark. To illustrate the problems faced, he said one of the interest rates being set was based on submissions from a panel of banks which only conducted 15 relevant transactions in the whole of 2016. Bailey said: \u201cIf an active market does not exist, how can even the best run benchmark measure it? The regulator has the power to force banks to make submissions to Libor \u2013 but not for the five-year transition period envisaged. So 20 banks have agreed to keep doing so. One possible solution is Sonia \u2013 the sterling overnight index average \u2013 which reflects bank and building societies\u2019 overnight funding rates in sterling.",

Sports Direct has bought out activist investors, including Gatemore Capital Management \u2013 a London-based hedge fund that had an 8% stake \u2013 and OTK, an investment firm that owned about 7%, to add to an existing 11% stake. Under takeover rules, a shareholder owning shares worth 30% or more of a company\u2019s stock must launch a formal takeover bid. Ashley has a long history of building strategic stakes in rival retailers, including Debenhams, online specialist Findel and, most recently, Game Digital. It is not clear what his plans are for French Connection. It is understood he has met with the fashion chain\u2019s boss and 42% shareholder Stephen Marks in recent months, but not laid out any clear demands. French Connection said: \u201cSports Direct is recognising the value that is in French Connection shares. We cannot comment on what their plans are.\u201d Marks, who founded French Connection in 1972, will be key to deciding the future of the business. The sale of Gatemore and OTK\u2019s stakes brings to an end a power struggle in which the two investors put Marks under pressure to relinquish his hold on the business he founded.

On Thursday, Meidar said he was pleased with Gatemore\u2019s 44% gain on its investment over the past two years. But he added: \u201cFrench Connection remains a glaring example of the shortcomings of the UK corporate governance code; namely, that companies can get away with such violations with zero repercussions to the people at the top.\u201d At this year\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, about 53% of independent shareholders who voted via proxy were against the reappointment of both Marks and the non-executive director Dean Murray. A higher proportion, nearly 56%, voted against the company\u2019s remuneration policy after shareholder groups expressed concern about unclear targets. Investors aimed to bring about change after five years of losses, which have led to a 52% slump in the value of the FTSE-listed fashion chain since 2014. On Thursday shares closed down 1% at 43p.",
