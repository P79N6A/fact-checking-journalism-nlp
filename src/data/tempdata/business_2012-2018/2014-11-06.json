      "bodyText": "The home improvement giant Home Depot revealed on Thursday that hackers stole 53m email addresses, in addition to obtaining payment card data during a five-month data breach earlier this year. The hackers entered Home Depot\u2019s network using a vendor\u2019s user name and password, the world\u2019s largest DIY home retailer said in a statement on Thursday. In September, the Atlanta-based company admitted that 56m credit and debit card numbers were compromised over a five-month period in one of the worst breaches of customer data ever recorded. The new disclosures are the result of a weeks-long investigation into the attack by the company and law enforcement officials. Home Depot said the stolen the stolen files with customers\u2019 email addresses did not contain passwords, payment card information or other sensitive personal information, but said customers in the US and Canada should be wary of phishing scams. The company is notifying affected customers. It said hackers stole information through malware installed on self-checkout systems in the US and Canada. \u201cThe hackers then acquired elevated rights that allowed them to navigate portions of Home Depot\u2019s network and to deploy unique, custom-built malware on its self-checkout systems in the US and Canada,\u201d the statement said. Home Depot said its working with cyber security experts to improve protections against future hacks. The Home Depot data breach is the latest in a series of other large-scale breaches on US firms including Target and JP Morgan. The Target hacking compromised 40m cards, and JP Morgan breach went on for several months without the bank\u2019s knowledge. Target\u2019s breach forced banks, retailers and card companies to increase security by speeding the adoption of microchips in US credit and debit cards, which supporters say are more secure. Home Depot reiterated on Thursday that it will be activating chip-enabled checkout terminals at all of its US stores by the end of the year. The breach, which lasted from April to September, affects the company\u2019s finances. Home Depot\u2019s outlook for its fiscal 2014 year includes estimates for the cost to investigate the data breach, providing credit monitoring services to its customers, increasing call center staffing and pay for legal and professional services. The profit outlook does not not include any potential losses related to the breach, however. Home Depot is expected to announce third-quarter results on 18 November On Thursday it confirmed its sales growth estimate for the year and said it still expects annual profit of $4.54 per share. The company\u2019s stock rose 5 cents to $97.34 in extended trading Thursday. Shares have gained 18% in 2014. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

    "webTitle": "Luxembourg and Juncker under pressure over tax deals", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "French, German and Dutch finance ministers have rounded on Luxembourg for allowing multinational companies to create complicated structures to avoid billions of dollars of tax. Pressure is also mounting on Jean-Claude Juncker, the new president of the European commission and former long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg, who oversaw the introduction of laws that helped turn the tiny European country into a magnet for multinationals who are seeking to reduce their tax bills. The calls for Luxembourg to stop arranging special deals that help corporations avoid tax came after a vast cache of 28,000 leaked tax papers from the Grand Duchy revealed the country had been rubber-stamping tax avoidance on an industrial scale. Details of the documents were revealed by 80 journalists in 26 countries working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), including the Guardian. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, said the revelations about Luxembourg\u2019s secret tax deals showed that the Grand Duchy had \u201ca lot to do\u201d to meet global standards. The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, said such deals were \u201cno longer acceptable for any country\u201d. He added: \u201cI wish that in a few years we never have to talk about something like this again.\u201d The Netherlands finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is also chair of the Eurogroup of all 18 finance ministers in the eurozone, said that Luxembourg was breaching international tax standards. \u201cMany countries make agreements with companies to provide security. But these agreements need to comply with international standards. We still have some work here.\u201d At Westminster, Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \u201c[Juncker has] just taken over the European commission, [yet] he\u2019s presided over the biggest exploitation of European nations in his own little country for decades.\u201d Despite the criticism, Juncker was said to be \u201cvery serene\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d. Juncker, who took over as president of the commission on Saturday after serving 19 years as premier of Luxembourg, was scheduled to take part in a public debate on Thursday in Brussels. But he pulled out on Wednesday night as news organisations prepared to publish the leaked tax documents. His official spokesman said Juncker did not feel under any pressure to explain how he oversaw changes to Luxembourg\u2019s tax laws. He said: \u201cIf he were a teenager I\u2019d say he was cool.\u201d Many of the tax deals \u2013 secured for companies including Ikea, Pepsi, Burberry, FedEx and Procter &amp; Gamble \u2013 were aided by laws written during Juncker\u2019s term of office. The Danish tax minister, Benny Engelbrecht, said the revelations were \u201cshocking\u201d. \u201cTax payments are down to percentages that are so crazy that you can almost not even describe the challenges that they create for other countries,\u201d Engelbrecht told the Danish paper Politiken. Juncker is credited with helping transform Luxembourg\u2019s economy from one relying on agriculture and steelmaking into a low-tax centre for financial services. His changes turned the small nation into the world\u2019s richest country with a per capita income of $111,000, compared with $39,000 in the UK, according to the World Bank. Luxembourg\u2019s current prime minister, Xavier Bettel, called an emergency press conference to defend his country. \u201cThese rulings, as they have been done in Luxembourg, are in line with international and national rules,\u201d he insisted. Pierre Gramegna, the Grand Duchy\u2019s finance minister, said the comfort letter tax deals exposed in the leaked documents are \u201cnot something that\u2019s particular to Luxembourg. It exists in a lot of countries.\u201d Gramegna will face tough questioning from his counterparts across Europe on Fridaywhen EU finance ministers meet in Brussels on Friday. Up for discussion is a new anti-tax-avoidance measure targeted at multinationals. Luxembourg is already the subject of EU probes into claims that local tax agreements for Amazon and a subsidiary of Fiat amount to state aid. Hodge, who hauled the bosses of Starbucks, Google, Amazon and the big four accountancy firms to parliament to explain their roles in UK tax avoidance, told the Guardian that Juncker should be forced to come clean about his role in turning Luxembourg into a low-tax haven for multinationals. \u201cI think he should come clean and talk about it, certainly try to explain it,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can we know he\u2019s working in the interest of Europe when as prime minister in Luxembourg he has exploited populations in every European country and elsewhere for decades?\u201d Ronen Palan, professor of international relations at City University, London, a specialist on tax havens, said: \u201cLuxembourg is extremely secretive. I can\u2019t underline [enough] how aggressive they are in denying that they are a tax haven. Now we have evidence. For the first time we have real evidence as opposed to supposition, as opposed to suspicions and so forth.\u201d The revelations have sparked political outrage across the world. The Australian tax office said it had launched an investigation into whether multinational firms operating in Australia were avoiding tax by using deals arranged through Luxembourg. ICIJ documents show that Ikea\u2019s Australian arm has paid hardly any tax on an estimated $1bn profit earned since 2003, according to the Australian Financial Review\u2019s report on the leaked documents. Guy Verhofstadt, president of the alliance of liberals and democrats for Europe and former prime minister of Belgium, said: \u201cRecent allegations against the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on tax avoidance practices need to be clarified immediately. The commission should come to the European parliament immediately to explain if these practices are in accordance with EU law. It must be made clear, if the setup chosen by Luxembourg is legal or not.\u201d The anti-corruption campaign group Transparency International said: \u201cEU ministers must now take action to end the secrecy of corporate tax deals in Europe. The Luxleaks deals could not have been kept secret if all companies were required to report details of their tax payments in every country where they operate.\u201d Oxfam\u2019s tax adviser, Catherine Olier, said: \u201cThe leaks underline the scale of tax dodging \u2013 it\u2019s not just one isolated scandal; we\u2019re talking about a whole industry making profits disappear. Tax-dodging results in both developing and European countries missing out on billions in tax. This is money that would be much better spent on healthcare or education rather than lining already wealthy corporate pockets. \u201cG20 leaders meeting next week should adopt ambitious rules that will benefit all countries, including the developing countries that suffer most from corporate tax dodging.\u201d The anti-poverty campaign group ActionAid said: \u201cThis exposure of the industrial scale of global tax avoidance involving Luxembourg clearly highlights the need for global action. \u201cA fundamental rethink of the world\u2019s tax system is needed, that puts all the issues on the table and includes all countries, including developing countries, as equal partners, to tackle these kinds of abuse.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November. The original said that the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, warned Luxembourg she was considering launching a series of fresh investigations into state aid. Commissioner Vestager actually said: \u201cWe have at this stage not yet formed an opinion about these rulings and a possible formal follow-up by the Commission ... we will be vigilant to enforce state aid control in fair and justified manner.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Halfords to revive Cycle Republic chain", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Halfords is to revive its Cycle Republic chain next month, five years after the wheels came off the specialist bike shops. Matt Davies, chief executive of the retailer, said he could envisage as many as 100 cycle stores across the country within a few years, as Halfords tried to benefit from the UK\u2019s cycling boom. The first store will open in London\u2019s Euston Tower on 12 December and Davies said about a quarter of the chain was likely to be in the capital. \u201cWe believe there is a lot of opportunity in major towns and cities across the UK and believe this will be a key driver of how we continue to generate growth for Halfords over the longer term,\u201d he said. Halfords closed its eight Bikehut and Cycle Republic stores in 2009 at a cost of \u00a31.2m as it said they did not deliver sufficient returns on their investment. Davies, who joined the group just over two years ago, said the new Cycle Republic would give Halfords a way to operate in central London and other big cities where it wasn\u2019t economic to operate its main stores. He also hopes the smaller stores will draw in cycle enthusiasts who didn\u2019t think the range or expertise on offer in its main stores was good enough. Davies revealed the plans as the company reported an 11.2% rise in pre-tax profits and 6.8% rise in sales for the six months to the end of September. Sales at Halfords stores open more than a year rose 6.8%, largely thanks to a 16% lift in sales of cycling gear. Despite the strong performance, which met City expectations, shares in the company slid 4%, partly on concerns about rising costs and slowing pace of growth in the last three months of the half year in cycling, car maintenance goods and travel items such as tents. Sales of bikes and cycling gear, which are now the biggest contributors to Halfords sales, rose 5.7% in the second quarter compared to 7.9% in the first quarter, despite the Indian summer. Davies insisted that the warm weather was of little help to Halfords, as adults wanted to buy bikes when they had the whole summer ahead of them and the weather meant car drivers were less likely to replace windscreen wipers, de-icer or headlight bulbs. He said the cycling market was growing by about 5% a year and government support continued to give it momentum that would last beyond this summer\u2019s great weather and the hype surrounding the Tour de France\u2019s visit to Yorkshire. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d Davies said. \u201cThere is real recognition of the health benefits and the pleasure generated by cycling.\u201d The company said retail operating costs would rise by between 5% and 6%, about 1% ahead of its earlier prediction, as it spent more on stock, distribution centres and staff training to ensure it could serve customers better. Davies said he wanted to move Halfords\u2019 store staff off the national minimum wage as they gained qualifications. Currently the vast majority are paid the most basic legal rate but Davies said half of the company\u2019s employees would earn 8% more than the minimum by next spring and 80% would by 2016. However only two people in every store, about 8% of the total, would be earning the living wage laid down by workers rights groups, by 2016. Davies said he would like to see more staff sharing in Halfords\u2019 improving profits by earning the living wage and was \u201cnot proud\u201d of the current situation on pay. \u201cI would love to wave a magic wand and put everyone on the living wage but the reality is we cannot do everything at once,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct group has increased its interest in Debenhams, taking control of thousands more shares via a complex financial instrument. The sports chain\u2019s total interest in the ailing department store group has risen from 11.2% to 12.7% after it sold a 4.6% stake bought last month and swapped it for a put option agreement which gives Sports Direct influence over shares equivalent to 6.1% of Debenhams. The share sale is likely to have netted a profit for Sports Direct of around \u00a32m. The put option instrument gives Sports Direct the right to take ownership of 74.2m shares at a set price in future. The financial arrangement, effectively a bet on a rise in the price of Debenhams shares, could cost Sports Direct a maximum of about \u00a346m. The latest move almost exactly echoes Sports Direct\u2019s actions in January when it bought a 4.6% stake and then sold it less than a week later when it invested in a put option arrangement over a 6.6% stake in Debenhams. The two deals are likely to be intended to apply pressure on Debenhams management team as it considers closer ties with Sports Direct. The sports specialist currently has four concession areas within Debenhams stores and is also thought to want to introduce its fashion brands, such as Firetrap and Kangol, into the department store. \u201cSports Direct continues to work together with Debenhams and looks forward to building a long-term relationship,\u201d the company said in a statement. The Sports Direct concessions are part of Debenhams\u2019 attempt to fill 1m sq ft of its space with more productive alternatives. It is also trialling concessions from Costa Coffee, Mothercare and Monsoon. Ashley has a history of taking stakes in companies under stress in a bid to influence the business. Previously Ashley was able to force talks with outdoorwear retailer Blacks Leisure, and now defunct rival sports chain JJB Sports, by snapping up chunks of shares in the businesses which were both formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange. In September, Sports Direct entered into a deal with Goldman Sachs over 23m shares in Tesco, equivalent to about 0.3% of the supermarket\u2019s stock. The put option is effectively a \u00a343m bet that shares in the troubled supermarket will recover.",

Italy and Spain, however, were an exception, ending the day slightly lower. Investors will now be looking ahead to the final key event of the week - Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 12.01 points or 0.18% higher at 6551.15 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.66% to 9377.41 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.46% higher at 4227.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.73% to 19,285.76 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.15% at 10,261.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 29 points or 0.17% higher. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Today\u2019s ECB event has lead Deutsche Bank to repeat its belief that QE could happen in the first quarter of next year. The bank\u2019s economists Mark Wall and Marco Stringa said: As we expected, no new measures were announced by the ECB today. But the overall message was as dovish as we could have realistically hoped for. Indeed, the ECB prepared press statement was in line with our call that the ECB will have to include government bonds in its QE programme by March 2015. We maintain our view of public QE in the first quarter, possibly later in the first quarter. A move could come as soon as December, but the news-flow would have to be especially weak over the next few weeks for that to happen. Mario Draghi silenced any dissent in the ECB\u2019s governing council and prepared the ground for further stimulus measures, according to Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank: As expected the ECB kept its ammunition dry at today\u2019s meeting. However, within the first ten minutes of the press conference, the ECB president made clear that any possible revolution within the Governing Council had been defeated. Instead, the ECB is preparing the XXL version of its monetary happy meal. The macro-economic picture didn\u2019t give any justification to change the monetary stance or to decide on new measures (this might change in December when the next staff projections will be released). However, Draghi\u2019s comments at the press conference sent a strong message that the ECB is clearly ready to decide on additional measures, if needed. According to Draghi, the two conditions for additional measures are i) the current measures are insufficient in reaching the targeted balance sheet size; and/or ii) a worsening of the inflation outlook. In particular, the size of the balance sheet is back. Remarkably, the recently heatedly discussed issue of the size of the balance sheet even made it into the introductory statement. Just two days ago, there was market news about increasing concerns within the Governing Council about giving out an explicit target. While Draghi had given a clear hint already in September, other ECB members didn\u2019t like the idea of a new target. Now, with the phrase that all recent ECB measures should \u201chave a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012\u201d, by referring to March 2012 during the Q&amp;A session. Draghi has obviously gained the upper hand in this inner ECB discussion. In addition, there was a second remarkable comment by Draghi, underlining the ECB\u2019s determination. Despite recent quarrels, the introductory statement repeated the Governing Council\u2019s unanimous commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. During the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that purchasing government bonds would fall in the mandate. The final important sentence was the announcement that the Governing Council \u201chas tasked ECB staff and the relevant Eurosystem committees with ensuring the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed.\u201d A clear message. All in all, there are at least two important take-aways from today\u2019s ECB meeting: i) if there was any internal conflict within the Governing Council, Mario Draghi hushed it; and ii) the ECB is determined to find an XXL version of its current monetary happy meal. Aengus Collins, Eurozone analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, agrees that it was another assured appearance from Mario Draghi (as the Twitter crowd reckoned too). This was a typically adroit performance from Mr Draghi, on whose credibility and effectiveness the euro zone is far too reliant. Had the recent rumours of dissent been allowed to fester and to damage his authority, the potential damage could have been grave. However, it is important to put Mr Draghi\u2019s latest statements in perspective. He has formalised a previously verbal commitment to balance-sheet expansion, but the fact remains unchanged that the level of intervention being promised is unlikely to deliver a sufficient jolt to the real economy to lift the euro zone onto a markedly improved trajectory. The ECB is still not promising a game-changer. Jake Trask, corporate dealer at UKForex, reckons the ECB has moved another step closer to full-blown quantitative easing today: Mario Draghi hinted during his press conference that the governing council was unanimous on implementing more stimulus if the current measures fail to revive a flagging economy. With the eurozone economy grinding to a halt, and inflation running dangerously low, it seems that full-blown QE is moving closer and closer. The next eurozone growth figures could be crucial: Next week\u2019s eurozone GDP figures will be pivotal on this matter. Should Germany slip into technical recession, the ECB may decide the time has come to pull the trigger and buy government bonds in a full blown QE programme. Mario Draghi has caught the markets out again, says Jonathan Pryor, head of FX Dealing at Investec Corporate and Institutional Treasury: \u201cThe market should know by now to not underestimate the free spending Mario Draghi but it got caught out today as he delivered a surprisingly dovish tone in his press conference. The message here is clearly that the European Central Bank are prepared to roll out further programmes to stimulate the European economy and deter deflationary threats but the most notable fragment of the statement was that there is now a unanimity amongst member states in the Euro-zone regarding the potential need for further action. Today\u2019s message is likely to put the single currency in a precarious position over the coming weeks.\u201d Mario Draghi never fails to deliver, eh? Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s ECB press conference (highlights start here). 1) The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has tasked its staff to start work to ensure further measures to stimulate the eurozone economy, if needed. 2) The governing council also unanimously agreed that the ECB\u2019s balance sheet should be expanded back to towards its level in March 2012. That means up to one trillion euros more. 3) The euro has hit a new two-year low, falling to $1.243 as Draghi addressed the press pack. 4) Draghi has played down reports of splits at the heart of the ECB -- saying that last night\u2019s central bank chief\u2019s dinner was remarkably constructive. And he insisted that bank chiefs from North and South Europe are not at each other\u2019s throats. 4) Draghi was less keen to discuss whether the ECB held a gun to the head of Ireland to take a bailout in 2010, as correspondence released today suggests. He did argue that Ireland\u2019s economy has done well since the bailout ended -- cold comfort for those years of austerity, I suggest. 5) The broad economic picture remains weak, with Draghi warning that risks remain to the downside. The weakening in the euro area\u2019s growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment. In addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook. Finance Twitter have given Draghi a good review: And that\u2019s the end of the press conference -- several minutes early. Maybe Draghi wants to remind the press pack who\u2019s the boss, after those reports about his erratic management style.... A long question about the ECB\u2019s balance sheet ends with Draghi reiterating that the ECB plans to move towards the level in March 2012. Eva Taylor of Reuters asks whether there were any bilateral talks after last night\u2019s governing council dinner, and whether there was any discontent raised. A brave question, given she co-wrote the story that central bank governors are concerned about Draghi\u2019s management style. Didn\u2019t you write that story, Draghi asks? Yes I did, she replies. Well, it was a very successful meeting. No concerns were raised. We had rich, interesting, very candid discussions. The dinner went very well, even better than expected, Draghi adds.  But were there any bilateral talks after the meeting, Taylor presses? I\u2019m not ubiquitious. Draghi replies. What additional measures might the ECB take? If it\u2019s not monetary financing of debt, it\u2019s in our mandate, Draghi replies. Arthur Beazley of the Irish Times demands a proper answer from Mario Draghi on the Irish bailout letters. You were on the governing council, Mr Draghi. Was it really appropriate to threaten the Irish government in this way, and to protect senior bond holders at the expense of Irish taxpayers? Draghi isn\u2019t keen to engage, saying: It is a very big mistake to look at past events with today\u2019s eyes. and he then adds that Ireland has recovered well from the crisis. So the bailout can\u2019t have been that bad, right? Draghi also confirmed that the specific balance sheet target is March 2012 -- the time after the ECB had boosted its balance sheet with two long-term loan offers to eurozone banks. What\u2019s deadline have the ECB staff been work on additional measures that may be needed? We don\u2019t set our people a deadline, Draghi smiles. When they have an instruction, they work! They know when we need this work done by. Draghi bats away a question about the Ireland bailout letters released today, and whether they show the ECB \u201cholding a gun to the head\u201d of the Dublin government. Read the letters, he says (reminder, there\u2019s a link here) Any progress towards releasing the minutes of ECB meetings? Draghi says that the governing council had a very constructive talks about this issue last night (look how well we get on!) It is important that people can still speak with \u201ccandour\u201d, and we need to help the financial markets interpret our discussions, he says. We should be able to have a full discussion next month. The ECB\u2019s balance sheet will expand under all circumstances, Draghi says -- either if we simply do what we\u2019ve already agreed, or if we do more. Draghi insists that there is no split at the ECB between governors from Northern European countries, and those from the South. Not at all! He wishes he could give some examples of countries agreeing with each other, but alas, confidentiality precludes it. What lessons can the ECB learn from Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to end QE this month, and the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to boost its stimulus programme, asks the FT\u2019s Claire Jones. And what about these reports about divisions at the ECB? Draghi replies that there are lessons from other bank\u2019s stimulus measures. The effects of QE are different, depending on the conditions, Draghi replies In the UK and the US, their fiscal deficits were several times bigger than in Europe, for example. And on the reports of ECB tension -- Draghi says that such arguments are a normal part of \u201chealthy diversity\u201d. He points out that we often hear differing views from the Federal Reserve. Draghi also points out that the governing council unanimously agreed to release the correspondence with Ireland today. A sign of teamwork. What does the decision to \u201ctask ECB staff\u201d to prepare for further measures mean exactly, asks Brian Blackstone of the WSJ. Draghi says the ECB wants to get all the relevant staff up to speed now, in case those measures are needed. Blackstone adds that Draghi told the press pack not to worry about the balance sheet goals last month - so why the change? Draghi agrees that the ECB has given more guidance here - both on balance sheet size and the composition of what assets it holds. Draghi then checks his folder, and decides that he told the European Parliament that the balance sheet would rise towards 2012 levels. Yes, Mario, but you weren\u2019t as forthcoming last month.... Onto questions. Does the ECB now have a specific target for expanding its balance sheet? Draghi replies by reading out this section from his statement: Following up on the decisions of 2 October 2014, we last month started purchasing covered bonds under our new programme. We will also soon start to purchase asset-backed securities. The programmes will last for at least two years. Together with the series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted until June 2016, these asset purchases will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012. I think that\u2019s a yes. That statement is now online here, by the way. And could big decisions be taken with a simply majority of national central bank chiefs? Draghi points out that today\u2019s statement was signed by the entire governing council, including this crucial sentence: The Governing Council has tasked ECB staff and the relevant Eurosystem committees with ensuring the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed. The statement ends with Draghi\u2019s usual plea to eurozone governments to implement reforms: It\u2019s a dovish statement from Draghi -- who also doesn\u2019t sound like a man beaten into submission by his critics on the governing council. Draghi is painting a gloomy picture of the eurozone economy -- not a surprise. Inflation will remain low in the coming months, he says. The ECB will focus on \u2018dampened\u2019 growth prospects, Draghi adds -- citing geopolitical threats and the recent fall in the oil price. Look how the euro fell after Draghi said the ECB was unanimous that it would take more unconventional measures, if needed: The euro has fallen against the US dollar, now down half a cent to $1.2426. Draghi says that ECB staff have been told to prepare for more unconventional measure if needed! Draghi says that the ECB has responded to inflation outlook, weakening growth and subdued monetary and credit dynamics. We believe these measures will move inflation back towards its target, he says. And the governing council is unanimously committed to taking further \u201ctimely measures\u201d, if needed. That\u2019s important -- the ECB isn\u2019t out of firepower. Draghi begins by confirming that the ECB left borrowing costs unchanged. The ECB has started buying covered bonds, he confirms - a decision taken last month. And we will start to buy asset-backed securities soon. These programmes will run for 2 years, and have a \u201csizeable impact\u201d on our balance sheet, moving it towards its 2012 levels. That\u2019s interesting -- Reuters reported this week that some governing council members were unhappy that Draghi appeared to put a size on the asset purchase programme at an earlier press conference. Ah, here we go. Draghi is starting to read his statement (which will be online shortly). Hold on tight, traders.... The ECB are late...... The ECB press conference will be streamed live, here (right-click to open in a new tab). OK, time for the main event of the afternoon - the European Central Bank press conference, from 1.30pm GMT or 2.30pm in Frankfurt, with president Mario Draghi. We\u2019re not expecting any new policy announcements, after the ECB left interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s meeting. But there are several things to watch out for: 1) Any more details of the ECB\u2019s new stimulus programme, under which it is buying assets from banks. It started buying covered bonds last week - and should move onto asset-backed securities soon. But is it considering widening the plan to include corporate bonds, as rumoured in recent days? And how widely will it expand its balance sheet? 2) Mario Draghi\u2019s view of the eurozone economy, especially after the OECD warned today that it faces stagnation unless the ECB does more. Is he still confident that the eurozone will avoid deflation? 3) Draghi\u2019s take on the letters exchanged between the ECB and Ireland in 2010, which show pressure being imposed on Dublin to take a bailout. 4) Hopefully someone in the press pack will ask Draghi about Reuters\u2019 claim that several central bank chiefs have concerns over his managerial style. Is there a rift widening in Frankfurt? The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at their record lows, at today\u2019s meeting. The means: headline rate remains at 0.05%, the marginal lending date (charged to banks) stays at 0.3%, and the deposit facility rate (paid on bank deposits at the ECB) stays at minus 0.2%. Next.... the ECB\u2019s press conference in under 45 minutes. The ECB has just published details of letters exchanged with the Irish government in the run-up to the country\u2019s bailout in 2010. They\u2019re online here: 6 November 2014 - ECB publishes letters from 2010 on Ireland The ECB claims that this dcumentation shows \u201cdomestic factors\u201d pushed Ireland towards its programme, rather than pressure from Frankfurt. Perhaps... but the first letter, from then Jean-Claude Trichet, ends with a warning that the ECB could withdraw its liquidity support for Ireland\u2019s banks unless Trichet wrote that: Further decisions by the governing council of the ECB regarding the terms of liquidity provision to Irish banks will...need to take into account appropriate progress in the areas of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and financial service restructuring. Unfortunately, a second letter from Trichet hasn\u2019t uploaded properly.... Last night, the Irish Times reported that this later later showed that the governing council of the ECB would only agree to provide further emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to the banks if it received \u201cin writing a commitment\u201d from the government to apply immediately for a bailout. JUST IN: The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee has voted to leave UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. It has also made no changes to its asset purchase scheme (quantitative easing), which remains at \u00a3375bn. And there\u2019s no statement from the BoE either. Not a surprise - most economists think rates won\u2019t rise until 2015.... Over in Brussels, the European Commission is refusing to engage with last night\u2019s revelations that major corporations have been avoiding tax through Luxembourg on an industrial scale. Even though the EC\u2019s new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister and finance minister for most of the last decade. Margaritis Schinas, chief EC spokesperson, says these revelations are a matter for Luxembourg, and said Junker is serene and calm. But it\u2019s a crucial issue, especially as the EC is probing Luxembourg\u2019s tax affairs.... Time for a quick recap before the Bank of England and European Central Bank decisions on monetary policy (at noon and 12.45pm), and then the ECB press conference (1.30pm-2.30pm). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned that the eurozone faces stagnation. In its latest report, it trimmed its growth forecasts, warned that global growth is slow and financial risks are rising. It also urged the ECB to launch more aggressive stimulus measures. OECD chief economist Catherine Mann has told us that France, Germany and Italy must agree to jolt the eurozone economy back to life or face a long period of low growth, low inflation and an increasing debt burden. The warning came after new data showed Germany\u2019s factories have failed to bounce back from their summer slump. Orders only rose by 0.8% in September, and domestic demand dipped again. Economists fear that Germany faces a tricky winter. Elsewhere... UK industrial production has beaten forecasts, though, growing by 0.8%. Britons have registered two million new cars already this year, for the first time in seven years. But the UK\u2019s housing market appears to be cooling. UK house prices fell 0.8% last month, according to Halifax. OECD chief economist Catherine Mann has urged the eurozone\u2019s three largest economies to do more to stimulate growth, or risk sliding into stagnation. She was speaking to our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, who reports: France, Germany and Italy must agree to jolt the eurozone economy back to life or face a long period of low growth, low inflation and an increasing debt burden, according to a stinging report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Paris-based thinktank, which counts the world\u2019s major trading states as members, said Spain and other smaller countries had shown the way by pushing through reforms to reorganise their economies while the core nations were locked in discussions over how to lift growth. Speaking before a meeting of world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, this month, the OECD\u2019s chief economist said eurozone governments needed to support efforts by the European central bank to lower borrowing costs in addition to boosting public spending on education and infrastructure investment. Catherine Mann said: \u201cFiscal spending in the near term to support innovation, education, and infrastructure will both support near-term growth as well as turn back the legacy of low potential output and complement the engines of trade and investment.\u201d She praised Spain and other countries hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis for restructuring their banking sectors and driving down labour costs to revitalise the economy. She said the continent\u2019s core countries needed to unlock the potential for growth in their economies with a similar programme of reform. And here\u2019s the full story: France, Germany and Italy urged to follow Spain\u2019s lead to revive eurozone Today\u2019s Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s report is called \u201cGetting the world economy into higher gear\u201d. It\u2019s online here as a pdf. Here are some key points: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also urges US and European governments not to cut their deficits too quickly. With significant progress already made to strengthen the fiscal position of many advanced economies, a considerable easing of the pace of consolidation is warranted in many cases, notably the United States and the euro area. All available room under the EU fiscal rules should be used to avoid negative effects on demand and to allow the automatic stabilisers to work fully. Fiscal consolidation should proceed steadily in Japan. The OECD\u2019s new chief economist, Catherine Mann, says the global recovery is still weak in historical terms. She told Reuters that: \u201cEven though we are looking at global growth to increase up to 3.9 percent by the end of 2016, that still leaves us about a half a percentage point below our historical experience.\u201d This chart from the OECD\u2019s new report highlights the eurozone\u2019s weak prospects: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned that the weak eurozone is dragging back the global economy. In new forecasts just released, the Paris-based group warned that the world is only achieving a \u2018low-gear\u2019 recovery. OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda has warned there is an \u201cincreased risk\u201d of stagnation in Europe, and rising risks in the financial markets. Gurr\u00eda says: \u201cWe have yet to achieve a broad-based, sustained global expansion, as investment, credit and international trade remain hesitant,\u201d adding: \u201cFinancial risks remain high and may increase market volatility in the coming period. There is an increasing risk of stagnation in the euro area. Countries must employ all monetary, fiscal and structural reform policies at their disposal to address these risks and support growth,\u201d The OECD also repeated its call for the European Central Bank to launch more stimulus measures, beyond those recently announced. With euro area inflation far below target and drifting downward, the European Central Bank should expand its monetary policy stimulus \u2013 even beyond measures already announced - building on the positive steps taken to date. We\u2019ll find out what Mario Draghi, the ECB chief, thinks about that in a few hours when the ECB holds its monthly press conference. Here are the OECD\u2019s forecasts: OECD FORECASTS WORLD GDP GROWTH OF 3.3 PCT IN 2014, 3.7 PCT IN 2015 OECD FORECASTS U.S GDP GROWTH OF 2.2 PCT IN 2014, 3.1 PCT IN 2015 OECD FORECASTS EURO AREA GROWTH OF 0.8 PCT IN 2014, 1.1 PCT IN 2015 OECD FORECASTS JAPANESE GDP GROWTH OF 0.9 PCT IN 2014, 1.1 PCT IN 2015 OECD FORECASTS CHINESE GDP GROWTH OF 7.3 PCT IN 2014, 7.1 PCT IN 2015 There are more details here, on the OECD\u2019s website. Reaction to follow.... Just in... UK manufacturing has beaten expectations. Industrial output rose by 0.6% in September, the Office for National Statistics reports, beating expectations of a 0.4% gain. The manufacturing sector expanded by 0.4%, partly due to strong output in the food industry, and a rebound in car production. The reopening of some of the large North Sea oil fields, such as Buzzard, after summer maintenance also boosted output. However, UK industrial production is still 9.5% below its pre-crisis level, with manufacturing 4.1% below that peak. .... as are other international rivals: Britain\u2019s housing market may be cooling (see Halifax\u2019s data), but the nation\u2019s love affair with the car continues. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that 2 million cars have now been registered so far this year, the best performance in over seven years. But the SMMT does reckon that the growth rate is cooling, and will be flat in 2016. Here\u2019s the key points: New car registrations jumped 14.2% in October to 179,714 units, marking the 32nd consecutive month of growth. 2,137,910 cars registered in the year-to-date \u2013first time the market has passed two million in October since 2007. October performance exceeded expectations; demand for new cars set to stabilise in coming months. Rising demand for alternatively-fuelled vehicles continues, with market up more than 50% in both month and year-to-date. Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority has vowed to get to grips once and for all with the country\u2019s banks. It announced a full, 18-month inquiry into the sector this morning, to decide whether there is effective competition in retail banking. Consumer groups and new entrants to the sector have welcomed the move. As Jill Treanor explains, the inquiry could help break the stranglehold of the \u201cbig four\u201d. Alex Chisholm, the head of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), is to embark on the most detailed analysis of the sector for a decade after concluding that customers were not getting a good enough deal from the major high street players. Major banks could be be broken up or forced to be more transparent about their fee structures and a previous deal over the treatment of small business customers \u2013 in operation since 2002 \u2013 is also to be reviewed. According to the CMA the big four \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 have a 77% share of personal current accounts and a 85% share of small business banking, market shares which have barely shifted despite almost a dozen of investigations in the last 15 years. Over in Greece, the left-wing opposition party, Syriza, has a significant lead over the right-wing New Democracy which leads the coalition. That\u2019s according to the latest opinion poll, provided by university lecturer Spyros Gkelis: The prospect of charismatic left-wing firebrand Alexis Tsipras becoming Greece\u2019s next leader is looming over the eurozone. Tsipras has already been smartening up his act, meeting with European leaders and explaining that he wants to help Europe grow out of its crisis. Back to the first story of the morning, Germany\u2019s weak economy. Chris Williamson of Markit sees signs of recovery, even though September\u2019s 0.8% rise in factory orders was much weaker than expected (see opening post for details) But this morning\u2019s figures certainly show that Germany, and the wider European economy, are weak. Domestic orders dropped by 2.8 percent in September, while orders from abroad increased by 3.7 percent over August.... ..but orders from the eurozone increased by 2.5%, while those outside the euro area were up 4.4%. The 0.4% drop in house prices last month is a clear sign that the market is cooling, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Evidence of a housing market slowdown is now coming pretty thick and fast, with October\u2019s dip in house prices reported by the Halifax being a striking example. Archer predicts that prices will rise by 0.5% over the final two months of 2014, and by around 5% in 2015. Is Britain\u2019s housing market running out of steam? UK house prices fell by 0.4% in October, according to figures just released by the Halifax building society. It\u2019s the latest signal that Britain\u2019s housing market is cooling, as tighter mortgage rules hit demand.Economists had expected a 0.4% rise. Halifax\u2019s monthly house price index can be volatile. But over the last three months, prices are up by just 0.8% -- the smallest rise since the last three months of 2012. Martin Ellis, Halifax\u2019s housing economist, says demand has weakened in recent months: \u201cActivity continues to decline with mortgage approvals in September falling for the third successive month to a 14 month low, whilst home sales are at their lowest level since October 2013. The associated weakening in demand has brought supply and demand into better balance. \u201cThe economy is, however, continuing to grow at a healthy pace and employment is still rising. These factors should support housing demand over the coming months. However, while the chances of an imminent interest rate hike may have receded, a recent Halifax survey found that many borrowers are concerned about the impact a rise could have on their monthly mortgage repayments over the next 12 months. This concern is likely to curb buying intentions.\u201d Reaction to follow.... There\u2019s a shake-up underway in Britain\u2019s milk industry -- Dairy Crest is selling its dairies operations to rival M\u00fcller , for \u00a380m. The move allows Dairy Crest to focus on its cheeses and spreads operations, such as Cathedral City and Utterly Butterly, where profit margins are higher. Dairy Crest says: [we] believes the Transaction to be in the best interests of consumers, customers, dairy farmers, employees and Dairy Crest\u2019s shareholders. But it also means that Britain\u2019s milk industry is dominated by just a few players -- including two overseas titans. So there could be competition concerns. Farmers won\u2019t want to see their prices pushed down even further now M\u00fcller has cornered the market. M\u00fcller will get Dairy Crest\u2019s factories at Foston, Chadwell Heath and Severnside; they produce 1.3 billion litres of milk per year. The deal also includes the Hanworth glass bottling site, where Dairy Crest is consulting with employees on the site\u2019s future, and 72 depots. Older readers will remember that Dairy Crest was once part of the Milk Marketing Board -- so this is something of a moment. Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP Bank, says Russian sanctions appear to have \u201cdeeply unsettled German industry\u201d. He reckons that the 0.8% rise in September\u2019s factory orders suggests the next few months will be tough: \u201cThese figures show things will be difficult for German industry in the winter months of the year.\u201d Thomas Harjes, Frankfurt-based European economist at Barclays Plc, reckons Germany is being buffeted by problems overseas: \u201cA slump in exports to Russia and lackluster shipments to the rest of the euro area weighed on output,\u201d \u201cGermany\u2019s domestic fundamentals remain sound. We expect private consumption to gradually strengthen again.\u201d Bad news from Germany - factory orders across Europe\u2019s largest economy have missed expectations in September, intensifying concern over its growth prospects. The economy ministry reported this morning that factory orders rose by just 0.8% in September, way below forecasts of a 2.3% rise. It blamed \u201cglobal crises and weak eurozone growth\u201d, for weighing on German industry. Alarmingly, domestic orders actually fell, by 2.8%, showing weak demand as Germany teeters on the brink of recession. Foreign orders rose by 3.7%, suggesting the rest of the world economy is holding Germany up rather than the other way around. The only good news is that August\u2019s shocking figures have been revised up a little - from a 5.7% tumble to \u2018just\u2019 a 4.2% slide. But generally it\u2019s a worrying sign, as Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet explains: More reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Central Bank Thursday, which means the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are holding their monthly meetings. We\u2019re not expecting any policy changes, but we are hoping for a corker of a press conference with Mario Draghi at 1.30pm GMT. The ECB president will surely face questions over claims that some central bank governors are revolting against the \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201cerratic\u201d way he allegedly operates.

However, within the first ten minutes of the press conference, the ECB president made clear that any possible revolution within the Governing Council had been defeated. Instead, the ECB is preparing the XXL version of its monetary happy meal.</p> <p>The macro-economic picture didn\u2019t give any justification to change the monetary stance or to decide on new measures (this might change in December when the next staff projections will be released). However, Draghi\u2019s comments at the press conference sent a strong message that the ECB is clearly ready to decide on additional measures, if needed. According to Draghi, the two conditions for additional measures are i) the current measures are insufficient in reaching the targeted balance sheet size; and/or ii) a worsening of the inflation outlook.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b019f4c6e829461d0fea23d6426caeeba9d4bae\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415288408127/cf824885-5cee-4021-8b6b-e91bc0cc6b46-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Draghi looks forward to his happy meal.

Remarkably, the recently heatedly discussed issue of the size of the balance sheet even made it into the introductory statement. Just two days ago, there was market news about increasing concerns within the Governing Council about giving out an explicit target. While Draghi had given a clear hint already in September, other ECB members didn\u2019t like the idea of a new target. Now, with the phrase that all recent ECB measures should \u201chave a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012\u201d, by referring to March 2012 during the Q&amp;A session. Draghi has obviously gained the upper hand in this inner ECB discussion.<br></p> <p>In addition, there was a second remarkable comment by Draghi, underlining the ECB\u2019s determination. Despite recent quarrels, the introductory statement repeated the Governing Council\u2019s unanimous commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. During the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that purchasing government bonds would fall in the mandate. The final important sentence was the announcement that the Governing Council \u201chas tasked ECB staff and the relevant Eurosystem committees with ensuring the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed.\u201d A clear message.<br></p> <p>All in all, there are at least two important take-aways from today\u2019s ECB meeting: i) if there was any internal conflict within the Governing Council, Mario Draghi hushed it; and ii) the ECB is determined to find an XXL version of its current monetary happy meal.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-545b921ae4b0cd3bb748bdbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-06T15:22:43.812Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ccbf74bdb40a41d665f9b3edeff83aac08ff3a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415287319203/cee36bd1-6766-40e1-89a9-e0a26b22e333-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mario Draghi (R), president of the European Central Bank (ECB) and his Vice-President V  tor Constancio (L) speak to the media following the monthly ECB board meeting on November 6, 2014 in Frankfurt, Germany.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-545b9130e4b04832ea3e5c58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-06T15:19:12.862Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Economist Intelligence Unit: Another adroit performance from Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Aengus Collins,</strong> Eurozone analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, agrees that it was another assured appearance from Mario Draghi (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/nov/06/german-factory-orders-morrisons-ecb-bank-of-england-live#block-545b8d67e4b0f2956002af6f\">as the Twitter crowd reckoned too</a>).<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This was a typically adroit performance from Mr Draghi, on whose credibility and effectiveness the euro zone is far too reliant.

Catherine Mann has urged the eurozone\u2019s three largest economies to do more to stimulate growth, or risk sliding into stagnation.</strong></p> <p>She was speaking to our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, who reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>France, Germany and Italy must agree to jolt the eurozone economy back to life or face a long period of low growth, low inflation and an increasing debt burden, according to a stinging report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p> <p>The Paris-based thinktank, which counts the world\u2019s major trading states as members, said Spain and other smaller countries had shown the way by pushing through reforms to reorganise their economies while the core nations were locked in discussions over how to lift growth.</p> <p>Speaking before a meeting of world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, this month, the OECD\u2019s chief economist said eurozone governments needed to support efforts by the European central bank to lower borrowing costs in addition to boosting public spending on education and infrastructure investment.</p> <p>Catherine Mann said: \u201cFiscal spending in the near term to support innovation, education, and infrastructure will both support near-term growth as well as turn back the legacy of low potential output and complement the engines of trade and investment.\u201d</p> <p>She praised Spain and other countries hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis for restructuring their banking sectors and driving down labour costs to revitalise the economy. She said the continent\u2019s core countries needed to unlock the potential for growth in their economies with a similar programme of reform.</p> </blockquote> <h2>And here\u2019s the full story: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/06/eurozone-economy-france-germany-italy-spain\">France, Germany and Italy urged to follow Spain\u2019s lead to revive eurozone</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-545b4eb8e4b012fe577e0925\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-06T10:43:18.413Z\">10.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">OECD's growth warning': the key points</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u2019s Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s report is called \u201cGetting the world economy into higher gear\u201d.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/Advance-G20-release-of-OECD-Economic-Outlook.pdf\">It\u2019s online here as a pdf</a>.</p> <p>Here are some key points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c703bb85fcfc2abd785caf6bdd37ffe51340222\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415270101254/e27c6ccd-46ec-4b21-88fd-4bfe8d84ba89-460x339.png\" alt=\"OECD report, key points, November 6 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OEC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1763d15652da18289f77bf0284d888494d4d54a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415270400755/e4aedce3-efac-4bb6-82df-e02ea57b5b11-460x313.png\" alt=\"OECD forecasts, November 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OECD</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2d8aabbeac828458cc4a54f641d0c41cdd0878\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415270420412/7828591a-fb23-47ee-a734-967823dd6e8b-460x356.png\" alt=\"OECD forecasts, November 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"356\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OECD</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3c80d959e9b65a2328c259f7232d179ba620cec\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415270560725/20cbdbaa-d39b-43a3-a2eb-99e4bd06e453-460x330.png\" alt=\"OECD forecasts, November 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OECD</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-545b4db5e4b02eca99a361a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-06T10:31:13.802Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also urges US and European governments not to cut their deficits too quickly</strong>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With significant progress already made to strengthen the fiscal position of many advanced economies, a considerable easing of the pace of consolidation is warranted in many cases, notably the United States and the euro area.</p> <p> All available room under the EU fiscal rules should be used to avoid negative effects on demand and to allow the automatic stabilisers to work fully.

    "webTitle": "Northern England to get new train links to combat economic decline", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plans to create a northern economic powerhouse to rival London will need to cope with a workforce that produces less per head on average than other parts of England, an over-reliance on public sector employment and an exodus of younger workers to other regions. According to a report by official statisticians on the state of the region, taking in the north east, north west and Yorkshire, the attractions of northern towns and cities relative to other regions has declined since the Edwardian era. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the proportion of the country\u2019s population living in the north reached a peak in 1911 at 36.5% only to decline over the rest of the century. By 2013 it had fallen to 27.9%, back to the level last seen in 1821. Local leaders hoping to arrest the decline face an uphill struggle while the south and east can still lure away younger workers. One chart produced by the ONS shows how the north enjoys a huge influx of 18- and 19-year-olds almost exclusively to its highly-rated universities, only for all of them to return south in their early 20s, followed by a large proportion of homegrown talent. Employers in the north find it hard to attract better-educated graduates, especially in the services sector where Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle are weakest compared to their southern rivals. This week George Osborne supported moves to give Greater Manchester its first mayor and said he hoped the other newly formed combined authorities covering Merseyside, Tyneside, Leeds/Bradford and South Yorkshire would follow suit. The chancellor said he would back plans for faster train links to promote economic growth and control over \u00a3500m worth of skills training previously handled by the Skills Funding Agency. Nick Clegg is due to tell an audience in Leeds on Thursday that the chancellor has agreed to support a fully upgraded and electrified train network between Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield by 2025. Speaking in Leeds at the Northern Futures summit, the deputy prime minister will look to Osborne\u2019s announcement of the move in his autumn statement next month. \u201cLondon and the south east have had billions of transport investment over recent years from HS1 to Crossrail to the Northern Line extension. The perfectly reasonable requests I have been hearing from the north are basics that are needed if we are to create a true economic hub in the north of England,\u201d he said. An electrified Pennine train line would shorten journey times to 40 minutes between any two of Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. Council leaders have claimed a 20-minute cut in journey times between Leeds and Manchester would be worth \u00a36.7bn and create nearly 30,000 jobs across the north of England. According to its supporters HS2, which will connect London with Birmingham and then Manchester and Leeds, will generate \u00a360bn in benefits once it is completed and \u00a313bn in wider economic benefits. A report last month by the City Growth Commission, Unleashing Metro Growth, called for the creation of a northern \u201csupercity\u201d, dubbed ManSheffLeedsPool, with devolved powers in parallel with Scotland. Describing Britain\u2019s centralised political economy as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, the report said heavy investment in transport would help close the income gap with the south and boost the UK economy by \u00a379bn a year by 2030. But campaigners for a resurgence of economic growth in the north must battle population decline, low productivity and a reliance on public sector jobs. The north\u2019s population has declined since the 1970s before reaching a plateau in the late 1990s. Between 1971 and 2001 the number of people decreased from 14.7 to 14.3 million, followed by a small increase of 762,000 this century. Since the 1960s the UK\u2019s population has increased by 12 million to 64 million, 4 million of the increase coming since 2001. Unemployment is likely to have played a large part in the constant exodus southwards. The ONS figures show that apart from a brief period between 2004 and 2006 when unemployment rates in the north and the rest of England were the same, the jobless numbers have been higher since 1992. While factories like the Jaguar plant at Halewood are renowned as world class manufacturing centres, fears remain that work will move abroad to cheaper countries with lower wage costs. Halewood\u2019s 18,000 staff are currently balloting on strike action over pay. Productivity has remained low for decades, according to official figures. The low rating given to productivity in the public services and the lack of high productivity service industries is likely to offset higher productivity from the manufacturing sector. The ONS said: \u201cThe north of England continues to have a higher share of its output created by the manufacturing industry compared with the rest of England. This strength in manufacturing means that the value of the north of England\u2019s exported goods slightly exceeds the value of its imported goods. By contrast, the rest of England imports more than it exports,\u201d it said. \u201cThe north of England lags behind the rest of England, however, in terms of economic output from private sector services. In the sectors related to finance and insurance, information and communication, and professional, scientific and technical activities, output in England tends to be concentrated in the south east of the country and as a result these sectors make up a much lower proportion of output in the north.\u201d",

The Paris-based thinktank, which counts the world\u2019s major trading states as members, said Spain and other smaller countries had shown the way by pushing through reforms to reorganise their economies while the core nations were locked in discussions over how to lift growth.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons has claimed its three-year turnaround plan is working after sales declines slowed and its new Match and More loyalty card proved popular with customers. The Bradford-based supermarket chain reported a 6.3% drop in like-for-like sale in its third quarter, down from the 7.4% fall seen in the six months to 3 August. Profits slumped 51% to \u00a3181m in the first half, underlining the challenge the Morrisons boss, Dalton Philips, faces. The company said: \u201cIt will take time for our initiatives to fully benefit our sales performance.\u201d Shares in Morrisons rose 5% in early trading. As the supermarket price war escalated, Morrisons slashed prices on 1,200 products by an average 17% in May. It spent \u00a3135m on price cuts and improving products in the first half and has \u00a3165m to splash out on the all-important runup to Christmas. The chain said its Match and More card, whose launch in October was hailed as a \u201cbig move\u201d by Philips, was proving \u201cextremely popular\u201d with customers. It is the first of the big grocers to pledge to match the price of discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda on branded and own-label goods. Philips said Morrisons\u2019 prices were already the same as Aldi and Lidl on many branded items. He said on Thursday he was \u201cencouraged by the further progress we have made, especially on a number of key operational measures, cash flow and costs\u201d. The items-per-basket measure continued to improve and was down only 2.4% year-on-year, compared with a low of 6.9% hit in the fourth quarter of last year. The chain has opened 12 M local stores and is on track to meet its target of opening 60-70 convenience stores by the end of the year. It also opened an online hub in Greater Manchester. Morrisons is paying down its borrowings faster than expected and expects to cut its debt pile to \u00a32.3bn to \u00a32.4bn by year end, from \u00a32.6bn currently. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \u201cWhile it is too early to say whether Morrisons\u2019 throwing down the gauntlet to the discounters will succeed, the current picture is one of a beleaguered supermarket within a tough sector. \u201cThere are some indications of progress \u2013 the financial stability mentioned at the interims seems to have been maintained given the group\u2019s capital discipline, the Match and More scheme is a clear statement of intent, and the roll out of convenience stores remains on track. However, Morrisons is still a \u2018jam tomorrow\u2019 stock, in the midst of a three-year plan which aims to eliminate the current loss of sales, market share and inevitably, therefore, profit.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Morrisons has claimed its three-year turnaround plan is working after sales declines slowed and its new Match and More loyalty card proved popular with customers.</p> <p>The Bradford-based supermarket chain reported a 6.3% drop in like-for-like sale in its third quarter, down from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/11/morrisons-profits-slump-2014-supermarkets-dividend\" title=\"\">7.4% fall seen in the six months to 3 August</a>. Profits slumped 51% to \u00a3181m in the first half, underlining the challenge the Morrisons boss, Dalton Philips, faces.</p> <p>The company said: \u201cIt will take time for our initiatives to fully benefit our sales performance.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in Morrisons rose 5% in early trading.</p> <p>As the supermarket price war escalated, Morrisons slashed prices on 1,200 products by an average 17% in May. It spent \u00a3135m on price cuts and improving products in the first half and has \u00a3165m to splash out on the all-important runup to Christmas.</p> <p>The chain said its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/02/morrisons-promises-match-aldi-lidl-prices\" title=\"\">Match and More card, whose launch in October</a> was hailed as a \u201cbig move\u201d by Philips, was proving \u201cextremely popular\u201d with customers. It is the first of the big grocers to pledge to match the price of discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda on branded and own-label goods. Philips said Morrisons\u2019 prices were already the same as Aldi and Lidl on many branded items.</p> <p>He said on Thursday he was \u201cencouraged by the further progress we have made, especially on a number of key operational measures, cash flow and costs\u201d. The items-per-basket measure continued to improve and was down only 2.4% year-on-year, compared with a low of 6.9% hit in the fourth quarter of last year.</p> <p>The chain has opened 12 M local stores and is on track to meet its target of opening 60-70 convenience stores by the end of the year. It also opened an online hub in Greater Manchester.</p> <p>Morrisons is paying down its borrowings faster than expected and expects to cut its debt pile to \u00a32.3bn to \u00a32.4bn by year end, from \u00a32.6bn currently.</p> <p>Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \u201cWhile it is too early to say whether Morrisons\u2019 throwing down the gauntlet to the discounters will succeed, the current picture is one of a beleaguered supermarket within a tough sector.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some indications of progress \u2013 the financial stability mentioned at the interims seems to have been maintained given the group\u2019s capital discipline, the Match and More scheme is a clear statement of intent, and the roll out of convenience stores remains on track. However, Morrisons is still a \u2018jam tomorrow\u2019 stock, in the midst of a three-year plan which aims to eliminate the current loss of sales, market share and inevitably, therefore, profit.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The number of road traffic accidents staged by criminal gangs intent on making money from whiplash compensation has hit an all-time high, according to one of the UK\u2019s biggest insurers. So far this year the levels of organised fraud are already 21% higher than in the whole of 2013, according to Aviva, with more than 50% of the insurer\u2019s fraudulent motor injury claims being made by organised gangs. The majority involve \u201ccrash for cash\u201d incidents, where fraudsters either deliberately crash two of their own vehicles together in private or brake sharply in front of an innocent driver\u2019s car, causing that driver to go into the back of them. As it is the driver of the car behind that is deemed to be at fault in such collisions, fraudsters attempt to claim large sums in compensation for apparent whiplash caused by that driver. Gangs will target the vehicles most likely to have insurance and drivers least likely to cause a scene \u2013 often parents with children in the car or older drivers. In 2013 a report from the Insurance Fraud Bureau estimated the annual cost of this type of incident to be \u00a3392m, adding around \u00a314 to every motor insurance premium. \u201cCrash for cash is not just a financial problem \u2013 it\u2019s a serious social problem. No other form of insurance fraud puts the public at risk of serious injury,\u201d said Tom Gardiner, head of claims fraud for Aviva\u2019s UK and Ireland general insurance business. \u201cLast year Aviva found these accidents increased by 51%, and they are continuing to grow. Part of the growth is coming as fraudsters are moving away from a small number of hot spot locations to a much wider footprint.\u201d In the past the north-west \u2013 particularly Manchester \u2013 had been the focal point for the fraudulent claims but partly as a result of the number of successful prosecutions there, fraudsters have now moved on. Birmingham, Luton and north London are at the top of the list, according to Aviva. Earlier this year the government announced that it will cut the medical assessment fees for people who claim they have suffered whiplash in England and Wales. Charges of up to \u00a3700 for an initial medical report will be reduced to \u00a3180, the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, said. The move was part of a series of measures being looked at to reduce the number of fraudulent motor insurance claims. One of the problems with whiplash is that it can be difficult to prove whether someone is suffering from the condition or not. Under new rules insurance companies will also be urged not to accept claims without a doctor\u2019s report showing evidence of an injury. \u201cInsurers recognise that crash for cash is a serious issue that impacts not just on premiums but also on the safety of innocent motorists,\u201d a spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said. \u201cThat is one of the reasons that insurers are investing over \u00a3200m in tackling fraud.\u201d",

Only NAB, which earned $5.18bn, saw a reduced profit from the year before (down 10%).</p> <p>Just to ram home the point, yesterday Commonwealth Bank announced that in the first quarter of this financial year it made cash earnings of $2.3bn \u2013 up from $2.1bn the same time last year. </p> <p>So you would think the banks would be pretty happy, and above all grateful about having not only survived, but thrived during the GFC. For they thrived not because of their own superior management, but primarily because of the government. </p> <p>Firstly, our financial laws had not been watered down as was the case in the USA, which meant our banks were not as exposed to the risky funding that occurred there. </p> <p>Secondly, our money was guaranteed by the government during the GFC (meaning no danger of a run on the bank). In 2008, the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2400967.htm\">Rudd government guaranteed</a> deposits up to $1m without risk, and then on a sliding scale for deposits over that amount. And just to make sure the banks were happy, they were charged a smaller fee for those deposits than other lending institutions were. </p> <p>Then the government told the ACCC to not make too much of a fuss about all those buyouts, even though they have clearly reduced competition. </p> <p>And to top it all off, as the Australian Financial Review\u2019s Christopher Joye noted <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/blogs/christopher_joye/why_capitalism_is_not_doing_its_2jQRxPhxWW8HivdgmnOz4J\">this week</a>, the easy monetary policy around the world has ensured borrowing rates have remained low and have fuelled asset prices (such as the housing) which in turn boosts the profits of banks. </p> <p>So all in all, banks should be bloody grateful. </p> <p>And yet you wouldn\u2019t know it from their response to suggestions that the Murray inquiry might recommend banks increase their capital ratios (ie the amount of equity they hold relative to their risk bearing assets) from the current level of 8% by 2016 to possibly 10%-12%.

      "body": "<p>Sainsbury\u2019s push into discount groceries through its UK joint venture with the Danish chain Netto has less than a year to prove itself, the head of its Danish partner has warned.</p> <p>As the last deliveries arrived for the opening of the first store at a retail park in Leeds on Thursday, Per Bank, chief executive of Netto\u2019s owner, Dansk Supermarked, said: \u201cI hope we can set new standards for discounters in the UK. It\u2019s a big risk but I believe we are able to deliver that. We\u2019re a discounter, but a discounter with a Scandinavian twist.\u201d</p> <p>Netto\u2019s bright yellow signs and distinctive scottie dog logo are making their reappearance four years after beating a retreat from the cut-throat UK market. Bank signed a joint venture with Sainsbury\u2019s in June to bring Netto back to the country as the German supermarket rivals Aldi and Lidl continue to grow rapidly.</p> <p>The falling price of groceries, and British shoppers\u2019 desire to save pennies by cutting down on waste and shopping around, are putting pressure on Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is fighting back by buying its own slice of the fast-growing discount market, which is expected to double to account for 15% of grocery sales within five years. The plan is to open 15 stores, by the end of next year, close to the M62 corridor between Liverpool and Hull, to test the water. Five will open this month in Sheffield, Ormskirk, Doncaster, Manchester and Leeds.</p> <p>Bank said Netto would not hang around if it proved to be on the losing side.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to come to a decision fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t meet the needs of customers then we will come to a point where we say it doesn\u2019t work and we will have invested a limited amount of money. But we are confident it will work.\u201d</p> <p>Dansk Supermarked and Sainsbury\u2019s are each investing \u00a312.5m in the joint venture and expect to incur losses of \u00a35m-\u00a310m each before March next year. Bank said the decision whether the chain would be here to stay would be based on \u201cwhether we get customers who like our offer\u201d.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s and Dansk appear to be trying to create the Ikea of the discount world \u2013 light, bright and cheap, with a Scandinavian touch. Many aspects of the Leeds store will be familiar to discounter fans. It is relatively small, at just 10,000 sq ft, and stocks a tight range, including some quirky products and unknown brands; it charges 3p for carrier bags, and has shelf-ready packaging so fewer staff are needed and cost are reduced.</p> <p>With about 2,200 products the Netto range is similar in size to that of Aldi\u2019s and Lidl\u2019s, but much less than the 40,000 average for large supermarket chains. About two-thirds of the produce is own-label goods; another 20% is made up of third-party brands most Britons will never have heard of, and 10% is big international brands such as Heinz, Marmite and Kelloggs.</p> <p>Own labels include Kat cat food, which sells in Netto\u2019s stores across Europe, and Snaxters crisps and Bell\u2019s cereals, both created especially for the UK by the joint Sainsbury\u2019s and Netto product team.</p> <p>From the evidence of the Leeds store what makes the venture stand out from those of its rivals is that arriving shoppers are confronted near the shops\u2019 entrances with piles of fresh fruit and vegetables, many of which are stored in chillers.</p> <p>The Danish brand Lego is also playing a part in the Netto launch, with cheap prices on the toy bricks among the bargain offers and a giant Lego version of its scottie dog logo touring Leeds to try to drum up social media chatter about the opening.</p> <p>Less familiar Danish treats include upmarket Anthon Berg chocolates and herring in curry sauce. \u201cYou have to be a little bit brave but it\u2019s delicious,\u201d promised Netto UK\u2019s head, Morton M\u00f6berg.</p> <p>Like Aldi and Lidl, Netto is looking for more affluent shoppers with bargains on champagne, wine and chocolates as well as cheap basics. It will accept credit cards and there is an emphasis on fresh British meat and freshly baked cakes and bread.</p> <p>The ambition to cater to the middle classes and open in a wide range of locations is what sets Netto\u2019s latest attempt to crack the UK apart from its previous failed venture. That ended in 2010 when Dansk sold its 200 outlets to Asda.</p> <p>\u201cAt that time the thinking was that discount was only for those on low incomes. Now it is for everyone. Everybody wants value for money,\u201d Bank said.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s, which has had a downturn in sales this year after nearly 10 years of growth, is clearly hoping Netto will give it a new avenue for expansion.</p> <p>Mike Coupe, the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, said the launch would bring \u201csome much needed Scandinavian flair to the UK discount market\u201d.</p> <p>But just a quick walk from the car park serving the Leeds Netto store is a large Sainsbury\u2019s store, which owns the retail park where its new discount partner has just set up shop.</p> <p>Bank said: \u201cBoth formats benefit from being close to each other.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s push into discount groceries through its UK joint venture with the Danish chain Netto has less than a year to prove itself, the head of its Danish partner has warned. As the last deliveries arrived for the opening of the first store at a retail park in Leeds on Thursday, Per Bank, chief executive of Netto\u2019s owner, Dansk Supermarked, said: \u201cI hope we can set new standards for discounters in the UK. It\u2019s a big risk but I believe we are able to deliver that. We\u2019re a discounter, but a discounter with a Scandinavian twist.\u201d Netto\u2019s bright yellow signs and distinctive scottie dog logo are making their reappearance four years after beating a retreat from the cut-throat UK market. Bank signed a joint venture with Sainsbury\u2019s in June to bring Netto back to the country as the German supermarket rivals Aldi and Lidl continue to grow rapidly. The falling price of groceries, and British shoppers\u2019 desire to save pennies by cutting down on waste and shopping around, are putting pressure on Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s. Sainsbury\u2019s is fighting back by buying its own slice of the fast-growing discount market, which is expected to double to account for 15% of grocery sales within five years. The plan is to open 15 stores, by the end of next year, close to the M62 corridor between Liverpool and Hull, to test the water. Five will open this month in Sheffield, Ormskirk, Doncaster, Manchester and Leeds. Bank said Netto would not hang around if it proved to be on the losing side. \u201cWe hope to come to a decision fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t meet the needs of customers then we will come to a point where we say it doesn\u2019t work and we will have invested a limited amount of money. But we are confident it will work.\u201d Dansk Supermarked and Sainsbury\u2019s are each investing \u00a312.5m in the joint venture and expect to incur losses of \u00a35m-\u00a310m each before March next year. Bank said the decision whether the chain would be here to stay would be based on \u201cwhether we get customers who like our offer\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s and Dansk appear to be trying to create the Ikea of the discount world \u2013 light, bright and cheap, with a Scandinavian touch. Many aspects of the Leeds store will be familiar to discounter fans. It is relatively small, at just 10,000 sq ft, and stocks a tight range, including some quirky products and unknown brands; it charges 3p for carrier bags, and has shelf-ready packaging so fewer staff are needed and cost are reduced. With about 2,200 products the Netto range is similar in size to that of Aldi\u2019s and Lidl\u2019s, but much less than the 40,000 average for large supermarket chains. About two-thirds of the produce is own-label goods; another 20% is made up of third-party brands most Britons will never have heard of, and 10% is big international brands such as Heinz, Marmite and Kelloggs. Own labels include Kat cat food, which sells in Netto\u2019s stores across Europe, and Snaxters crisps and Bell\u2019s cereals, both created especially for the UK by the joint Sainsbury\u2019s and Netto product team. From the evidence of the Leeds store what makes the venture stand out from those of its rivals is that arriving shoppers are confronted near the shops\u2019 entrances with piles of fresh fruit and vegetables, many of which are stored in chillers. The Danish brand Lego is also playing a part in the Netto launch, with cheap prices on the toy bricks among the bargain offers and a giant Lego version of its scottie dog logo touring Leeds to try to drum up social media chatter about the opening. Less familiar Danish treats include upmarket Anthon Berg chocolates and herring in curry sauce. \u201cYou have to be a little bit brave but it\u2019s delicious,\u201d promised Netto UK\u2019s head, Morton M\u00f6berg. Like Aldi and Lidl, Netto is looking for more affluent shoppers with bargains on champagne, wine and chocolates as well as cheap basics. It will accept credit cards and there is an emphasis on fresh British meat and freshly baked cakes and bread. The ambition to cater to the middle classes and open in a wide range of locations is what sets Netto\u2019s latest attempt to crack the UK apart from its previous failed venture. That ended in 2010 when Dansk sold its 200 outlets to Asda. \u201cAt that time the thinking was that discount was only for those on low incomes. Now it is for everyone. Everybody wants value for money,\u201d Bank said. Sainsbury\u2019s, which has had a downturn in sales this year after nearly 10 years of growth, is clearly hoping Netto will give it a new avenue for expansion. Mike Coupe, the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, said the launch would bring \u201csome much needed Scandinavian flair to the UK discount market\u201d. But just a quick walk from the car park serving the Leeds Netto store is a large Sainsbury\u2019s store, which owns the retail park where its new discount partner has just set up shop. Bank said: \u201cBoth formats benefit from being close to each other. The alternative to going to Netto is another discounter or stores elsewhere.\u201d With that in mind Sainsbury\u2019s is putting several of the Netto stores close to its own. In Heaton Park, Manchester, the Netto store will sit in space split off from part of a very large Sainsbury\u2019s outlet. But Bank admitted it was likely that Netto would win some sales from its co-owner. \u201cIt is important that we compete head on with other discounters and our prices are competitive with them. But where we take customers from is not important, whether that\u2019s from our parent or elsewhere.\u201d Even the small corner shop was in his sights. \u201cWe will take over from a lot of smaller corner stores that do not offer the value for money that customers are looking for,\u201d he said. The Netto dog is back \u2013 only time will tell whom it will bite.
