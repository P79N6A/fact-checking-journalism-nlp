      "bodyText": "The rise of machines, robots and algorithms in the workplace stands to create almost double the number of jobs for the global economy by the middle of the next decade than it puts at risk of being replaced. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), about 133m jobs globally could be created with the help of rapid technological advances in the workplace over the next decade, compared with 75m that could be displaced. The findings will go some way towards assuaging fears that the rise of the robot economy could cost millions of workers their jobs, with widespread ramifications for pay, living standards and inequality across developed nations. The WEF report suggests new technologies have the capacity to both disrupt and create new ways of working, similar to previous periods of economic history such as the Industrial Revolution, when the advent of steam power and then electricity helped spur the creation of new jobs and the development of the middle class. The findings, from a survey of company executives representing 15 million workers in 20 different nations by the organiser of the annual Davos gathering of business leaders and politicians, does, however, warn of risks posed by automation. Klaus Schwab, chairman of the WEF, said employment gains from technology were not a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d and would require greater investment in training and education to help workers adapt. The report found there are urgent challenges for reskilling workers and that safety nets are required to protect at-risk workers. \u201c[This] is a call to action to governments, businesses, educators and individuals alike to take advantage of a rapidly closing window to create a new future of good work for all,\u201d he wrote in the report. The risks of inaction highlighted by the report were stark. Company bosses said more than half of all workplace tasks in existence at their firms today could be performed by machines by 2025. White collar workers \u2013 such as those in accounting, data entry and payroll services \u2013 would be among those most at risk from displacement. More than eight out of 10 businesses surveyed in Britain said it was likely they would automate work in the next five years, with half saying it was likely they would make staff who lacked the skills to use new technologies redundant. A study of workers by the Fabian Society and the Community trade union found that more than 6 million people across Britain are worried their jobs could be replaced by machines over the next decade. The Bank of England has previously warned that up to 15m jobs across the UK could be under threat. Some companies are already beginning to shed jobs in favour of automation, including the online retailer Shop Direct, which earlier this year warned 2,000 jobs were at risk as it moves to a new distribution centre. Ideas previously floated for supporting workers have ranged from a universal basic income to help the unemployed to greater government spending on education and adult learning.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has downgraded its prediction for UK growth this year and the following, joining a growing number of forecasters that warn Brexit uncertainty has sapped the economy\u2019s strength. Looking ahead to the end of the year, economists at the BCC said GDP growth will fall to 1.1% from a previous forecast of 1.3% while next year it will hit only 1.3%, down from 1.4%. By 2020 the UK economy will have suffered its second weakest decade of average economic growth on record as as business investment and export growth slow, said the BCC. The figures chime with most other mainstream forecasters, though they follow upbeat official figures that showed the economy expanded by 0.6% in just three months to the end of July. The BCC said the high cost of doing business in the UK and ongoing uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU would continue to stifle business investment, and drag down growth in the second half of the year. The jobs market is expected to continue to be a source of strength for the economy, with the unemployment rate predicted to remain close to its 40-year low. But the BCC said businesses will continue to face significant skills gaps, undermining their potential to grow, while workers are unlikely to experience meaningful real wage growth as the gap between pay and price growth is forecast to remain negligible. Adam Marshall, BCC\u2019s director general, said the forecast will put pressure on Philip Hammond to put together a budget that supports struggling businesses. \u201cBrexit uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on many firms, as most of the practical questions facing trading businesses remain unanswered. \u201cAt a time of massive change and uncertainty, business would not forgive a timid \u2018business as usual\u2019 autumn budget,\u201d he said. There is also pressure on the chancellor to set aside funds to reverse planned cuts to public services. Hammond needs to find an extra \u00a320bn for the health service following promises by the prime minister to boost health spending by more than 3% a year. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) said several government departments without any explicit spending protections from ministers \u2013 such as prisons, public health and housing - would be exposed to severe funding shortfalls by 2023\u201324 that could damage their ability to provide decent public services. NEF said Britain\u2019s prisons would face a budget black hole worth \u00a370m per year by the middle of the next decade while funding for public health \u2013 which covers addiction services \u2013 would face cuts worth \u00a380m by the middle of the next decade under the current departmental spending restrictions if left unchanged. Housing and planning \u2013 including schemes to incentivise the building of new homes and homelessness prevention \u2013 would risk cuts worth about \u00a330m per year over the same time period. The findings come ahead of the autumn budget, when the chancellor also plans to unveil the total amount of money available for a comprehensive spending review covering Whitehall departments next year. Although the government has pledged to protect spending on areas such as the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid, some departments face tighter constraints on spending that can result in cuts over time. NEF\u2019s analysis is based on rolling forward the current spending restrictions imposed by the government until 2023-24, which would be the likely final year of a four-year spending review. It suggests Hammond could meet his current deficit targets even if the government borrows a further \u00a324.1bn per year by 2023-24. Hammond has previously argued there was \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d for the public finances, raising the prospect of greater spending on public services at the autumn budget to bring austerity to an end. While allocating funds at the budget, the government would conduct the spending review next year after Brexit. Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the NEF, said: \u201cThe decade of austerity so far has arguably been the worst policy error in a generation.\u201d \u201cIf the chancellor fails to take the opportunity to learn from the lessons of the past by taking action at the spending review, we could be living with the consequences of deteriorating service quality and lost living standards for years if not decades to come.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The stationery chain Paperchase has come under mounting pressure after one of its main credit insurers reduced cover after a slump in profits. Euler Hermes has refused to cover new contracts with Paperchase\u2019s suppliers, although the retailer\u2019s existing agreements with suppliers are unaffected. The move follows a similar row over insurance cover at the struggling department store chain Debenhams, which has fought off claims that it is about to go bust after it was refused cover for new contracts. A withdrawal or reduction in cover can mean that suppliers demand payment upfront, putting a strain on cash reserves. A number of well-known high street retailers have struggled this year as weak consumer spending has led to business failures, mass store closures and tens of thousands of job losses. Paperchase\u2019s profits before tax plunged 88% to \u00a3613,000 in the year to 28 January, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Paperchase, which sells greeting cards, stationery, quirky mugs and other accessories, is owned by the private equity firm Primary Capital, which backed a \u00a320m management buyout of the UK retailer in 2010 from the bookseller Borders UK, which collapsed into bankruptcy. At the time, Paperchase, run by Timothy Melgund, had 65 standalone stores, along with 35 concessions in House of Fraser, Selfridges, Harrods and Waterstones. It expanded rapidly under new ownership , opening 75 stores in the UK, and now employs about 2,000 people. Primary Capital, which has also owned Yo Sushi and Coffee Nation in the past, tried to sell Paperchase in 2014 and considered a stock market flotation two years later. Paperchase told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cWe are disappointed Euler Hermes has reduced credit insurance. We don\u2019t think it is fair and we think they should reverse it. There is no cash issue. We have been around for 50 years and plan to be for another 50.\u201d The company was founded in 1968 by Chelsea art students Judith Cash and Eddie Pond. The highstreet retailer WH Smith invested in the firm in 1985 before a management buyout by Melgund and a business partner backed by Graphite Capital in 1996. It was bought by Borders in 2004 for \u00a318.7m.",

It expanded rapidly under new ownership , opening 75 stores in the UK, and now employs about 2,000 people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Primary Capital, which has also owned Yo Sushi and Coffee Nation in the past, tried to sell Paperchase in 2014 and considered a stock market flotation two years later.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/09/15/paperchase-left-crumpled-insurers-axe-cover/\">Paperchase told the Sunday Telegraph</a>: \u201cWe are disappointed Euler Hermes has reduced credit insurance.

      "bodyText": "Can craft beer and sourdough pizza heal Britain\u2019s ailing market town centres after a pummeling from the internet and retail parks? Macclesfield is joining a growing band of small towns about to find out. The Cheshire town is trying to harness the national foodie obsession to claw back the social purpose of its centre. The council is poised to approve plans for a communal food hall in a redundant cinema in an effort to turn the heart of the former weaving town into a place where people congregate again. It follows a successful trial of the concept in nearby Altrincham, in which a food hall has been combined with a gastro-regeneration project, helping slash vacancy rates in half. Leaders in about 30 other struggling town centres across the UK have expressed an interest in the model. Visits to UK town centres are down 17% over the past decade as online purchases rise 10% a year. On average, more than one in 10 shops have stood empty for at least 12 months, partly the legacy of 50m sq ft of out-of-town retail space being built from 2000 to 2009. Town centres\u2019 function as a social adhesive has been eroded, sociologists warn. Macclesfield\u2019s move comes as MPs launched an inquiry into the state of the UK\u2019s town centres which heard a warning from Savills, the property consultancy, that high streets could no longer be primarily retail locations but \u201cneed to become vibrant, flexible social hubs\u201d. We are entering \u201cthe era of the experiential consumer\u201d, Savills said. Amid grave warnings for the current style of high street shopping, Andrew Carter, the director of the Centre for Cities thinktank, said town centres must be reimagined as a place where \u201cthe theatre of life can thrive\u201d. Big retailers such as BHS and House of Fraser are high-profile casualties but many other high street fixtures which serve a rich social purpose have suffered badly, too. The number of independent bookshops almost halved between 2005 and 2018, with 677 shops folding. But some towns are fighting back. Since 2012, Bradford has offered business rate rebates and capital grants to revitalise its city centre, resulting in 45 new startups creating 730 jobs. Rochdale is trying to increase the amount of housing in its town centre, converting empty offices, which will boost footfall. In Macclesfield, a bank, a couple of furniture shops and a solicitors office are just some of the vacanct buildings on its high street. The idea to reboot the town is being championed by Nick Johnson, a property developer and former government advisor on regeneration. Five years ago, he took charge of the Altrincham market and helped bring the town centre back from a 25% vacancy rate in 2014 to 10% today. Its market now turns over \u00a35m a year and, on one lunchtime this week, the communal tables in the foodhall were nearly all full with schoolgirls eating pizza at one table and some retirees sharing a bottle of wine at another, alongside young families and office workers. With halloumi fries and Lebanese wraps and market stalls selling \u00a3200 jeans alongside regular fishmongers and butchers, it undeniably appeals to bourgeois tastes. Johnson says it is vital to bring the middle classes back to the centres of market towns, not least for their disposable income. \u201cIt has changed Altrincham,\u201d said Alan Gurley, 76, a retired garage owner sharing wine with friends. \u201cIt has brought people in and lots of other bars around here have opened up.\u201d Johnson \u201ccurates\u201d the market with outlets handpicked for quality and with an emphasis on giving new businesses a chance. Macclesfield will be the same. Unlike the high street where occupants face leases and business rates that are payable regardless of their trading performance, Johnson charges a percentage of their turnover. It means less risk for the business and no need for failing businesses to linger on waiting for a lease to expire before eventually quitting and leaving a void. \u201cI see this as a model for how you could restore the high street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to do it is to bring in the quality goods that you can\u2019t buy online and reward customers with an experience that you don\u2019t get sitting lonely, ordering on your computer screen.\u201d Macclesfield people seemed keen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got too many secondhand shops,\u201d complained Shelley Heath, 68. \u201cMothercare closed, Next moved. We\u2019ve got nothing. This might liven things up.\u201d A spokeswoman for Cheshire East council said: \u201cWith the rise of internet shopping we need more footfall. A food market could be a massive footfall generator by creating a social space. We want to have places in the borough that are inclusive.\u201d The Local Data Company, which analyses retail, currently gives Macclesfield just four out of 10 in its high street health index, while its out of town retail parks are ranked as in much better shape. ProfeCathy Parker, a Macclesfield resident and academic at the Manchester Metropolitan University\u2019s business school who studies town centres, said good markets had been shown to raise footfall by almost a third when they are operating. \u201cPeople need town centres to thrive for their sense of identity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like to feel we have put down roots. If it is all boarded up shops, what is that saying about us? It is a visual indication of failure. If all of our towns are struggling, it is not surprising there is national angst.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kweku Adoboli, the former UBS banker jailed for the UK\u2019s biggest ever fraud, will on Monday file for a judicial review of the decision to deport him to Ghana, in a last-ditch attempt to stop his \u201cbanishment\u201d from the UK, where he has lived since he was 12. Adoboli, 38, who was found guilty in 2012 of fraud that lost his Swiss bank $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn), is being deported to Ghana because he is not a British citizen, despite having lived in the UK for 26 years. Adoboli, who is being held in an immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport, is expected to be placed on a flight to Accra, the Ghanaian capital, on Tuesday. Under UK law, if a foreign national has been sentenced to more than four years in jail \u201cthe public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances\u201d. Adoboli was sentenced to seven years and served half of that time. The supreme court suggests the compelling circumstances to consider for the prevention of deportation are close relationships with children and long-term partners, and long-term employment. Adoboli does not have children, is in a newly formed relationship and is prevented from carrying out paid work by the terms of his release. His lawyer, Jacqueline McKenzie, said the judicial review would seek to highlight the charitable work Adoboli has been doing to educate others in the financial services industry and wider community to learn from his mistakes. His work has included training courses for the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and Barclays. On one three-day officer development course for the UK special forces he and Tony Blair were the keynote speakers. Adoboli is also appealing to the prime minister and the home secretary to \u201cshow some compassion\u201d and intervene to prevent his \u201cbanishment\u201d. Some 114 MPs and MSPs have signed a letter to Theresa May and Sajid Javid demanding they intervene to stop Adoboli\u2019s deportation. \u201cIf Mr Adoboli were deported, he will be removed from the country he has called home since the age of 12, taken away from the close relationships he has formed here and returned to a country he has not lived in from the age of four and lacks familiarity with,\u201d his MP, Hannah Bardell, said in the open letter. She added: \u201cThe recent comment by the former home secretary Amber Rudd MP that \u2018the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual\u2019 is apt in this case and we are sure no one in the cabinet wishes to have another \u2018Windrush Generation\u2019 scandal on their hands anytime soon.\u201d More than 73,000 people have signed a petition supporting the campaign to keep Adoboli in the UK. Adoboli, who was earning \u00a3350,000 a year in his 30s, said: \u201cI did four years in prison for a nonviolent act. I\u2019ve served my time but I\u2019m being given an extra punishment \u2013 a banishment \u2013 and just because I didn\u2019t get around to becoming a citizen. This punishment is so much worse than being in prison. \u201cPrison is a finite; you do your time, you hold your head high and you know you will get out. This [being deported] is really inhumane.\u201d Adoboli believes there are racist overtones to his treatment. \u201cPeople say it is OK for me to be sent back because it is where I am from,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I left when I was four. My life is here, my friends are here. If I were British my punishment would be over and I could get on with life.\u201d Not becoming a British citizen when he had the opportunity was, he said, the biggest oversight of his life. \u201cIronically, it was because I was trying to be good at my job that I didn\u2019t go through the citizenship steps,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the public face of UBS\u2019s Delta One desk running a \u00a350bn portfolio. At the drop of a hat I had to get on a plane to Frankfurt, New York or the Eurostar to Paris. I kept my passport in my desk drawer.\u201d",

It happens when the storm is about to break. Back in 2008, the Bank of England failed to predict the biggest postwar slump in the UK\u2019s history even after it had started. This less than impressive record should act as a cautionary note in the current circumstances when the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers has generated a thriving cottage industry devoted to predicting when the next crisis will occur. The honest answer is that nobody really knows. Meteorology has improved in the past 40 years, economic forecasting has not. When a weather forecaster says a hurricane is imminent, the public does well to take notice. When an economic forecaster gives a similar warning, the chances are that it is already too late. This might be about to change. Just as satellite technology has made weather forecasting far more accurate, so machine-learning algorithms could bring economic forecasting into the 21st century. Rickard Nyman and Paul Ormerod have compared economic forecasting by humans and machines in both the US and the UK, and come up with some stark conclusions. At the start of 2008 the survey of professional forecasters in the US failed to predict that within a year their country would be in a deep recession. Had US policymakers relied on machine-learning algorithms they would have been much better prepared for the trouble ahead. Even more impressive results using machine learning were obtained for the UK. There\u2019s more, however. Nyman and Ormerod sift through all the economic and financial variables that might have been responsible for causing the downturn and come up with a conclusion that explodes the myth that overspending governments were to blame. \u201cThe evidence suggests quite clearly that public sector debt played no causal role in generating the Great Recession\u201d they say. \u201cIn contrast, the ratio of private sector debt to GDP does appear to have played a significant role, especially in the UK.\u201d In truth, the idea that state profligacy caused the Great Recession has never been credible. What really happened was that the expansion of the global marketplace led to cheap goods flooding the west. Inflationary pressure abated and that persuaded central banks to cut interest rates. Financial deregulation meant the only remaining constraint on excessive borrowing \u2013 high interest rates \u2013 was removed \u2013 and so credit was cheap and readily available. The private sector loaded up on debt, which was fine so long as the assets on the other side of the balance sheet were going up in value. When the markets turned, things went pear-shaped very quickly. Only at that point, did public sector debt become a problem because governments sought to ameliorate the impact of the recession by cutting taxes and increasing spending. The debts incurred by the private sector were, to an extent, nationalised. Bill White, then chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements was one of the very few who sought to prick the bubble of complacency in the boom years, making the point that periods of low inflation could still end in crisis. His warnings were not heeded. The BIS remains concerned about debt levels, which is where the work of Nyman and Ormerod is relevant to the state of the world 10 years after Lehman. Put simply, the cure for the Great Recession was for central banks to slash interest rates and to increase the supply of money by buying bonds from the private sector in the process known as quantitative easing. Debt levels in the private sector fell for a while as households and companies retrenched but have subsequently started rising again. Low interest rates were designed to provide incentives for investors to seek out riskier assets, which is what they have done. Money has flooded into emerging markets, where yields are juicier because the risks are higher. Turkey, where the central bank raised interest rates to 24% last week, is one example of what can happen in a world of footloose capital. Speculative money comes in from abroad. It finances a construction boom and drives up the exchange rate. Eventually, the trade deficit starts to balloon and inflation starts to rise. At that point, the speculators take fright and the exodus of capital triggers a fall in the exchange rate. At that point, the central bank has to raise interest rates to punitive levels to defend the currency and recession becomes inevitable. The BIS says in its latest annual report that there are already material risks to financial stability. \u201cIn some respects, the risks mirror the unbalanced post-crisis recovery and its excessive reliance on monetary policy. Where financial vulnerabilities exist, they have been building up, in their usual gradual and persistent way. More generally, financial markets are overstretched \u2026 and we have seen a continuous rise in the global stock of debt, private plus public, in relation to GDP. This has extended a trend that goes back to well before the crisis and that has coincided with a long-term decline in interest rates.\u201d Behind the dry official language, the message is clear. A recovery that is based around high and rising levels of debt is really no recovery at all. The world economy is, in all material respects, the same as it was in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. The necessary reforms to a flawed model have not taken place, which is why the BIS warning should not be ignored. While it is not possible to say when the next recession will arrive, or where it will start, history is repeating itself. And you don\u2019t need a machine learning-algorithm to know there are dangers involved in that.",

    "webTitle": "How the florals and frills of Laura Ashley came to define an era", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Laura Ashley built a commercial empire upon romantic fabrics and a line of cleverly tweaked \u201ctraditional\u201d English clothing. This autumn, 65 years after the business was founded, her name still summons up images of puffed sleeves and bows in pretty floral prints. The company\u2019s private archive, opened this week to the Observer, is a compendium of the designs and patterns that chart the changing desires of British women. Ashley\u2019s dresses, sold with the help of soft-focus, bucolic photographs of young women swishing through corn fields in floppy hats, located a nostalgic thread running through British taste. It is a look that has gone on to inspire other leading British designers, from Cath Kidston\u2019s quaint domestic wares, to the homely pottery of Emma Bridgewater. The design company \u2013 which now faces turbulent trading conditions \u2013 was the first high street chain to market an ideal of countrylife to modern shoppers. In the 1970s, Ashley\u2019s trademark flowing flowery frocks chimed well with a hippie impulse to reject city sophistication. But the fashion house, run by Ashley alongside her husband Bernard, went on to peak in popularity in the following decade, with its industrial output of fitted velvet evening wear and sailor-collared shifts. Just as Mary Quant had fed women a vision of the sleek technological age with her monochrome mini dresses in the early 1960s, so Ashley\u2019s dreamy designs offered an imagined memory of a safer past. And when a brasher mood began to take hold in the 1980s, Ashley adapted by steering towards a crisper, posher look. In 1982 style commentator Peter York identified the phenomenon of the \u201cSloane Ranger\u201d in the handbook he co-authored with Ann Barr. York had noticed the pin-tucked white shirts and traditional pearl necklaces favoured by upper middle-class women near London\u2019s Sloane Square. Laura Ashley\u2019s skill was to quickly cater to the needs of all those aspiring Sloanes with less money to spend. And yet the designer herself, who was born in Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil in 1925, was not originally a fan either of frills or lace. She preferred the starched cotton pinnies and plain linen workwear that had surrounded her during her strict Baptist, Edwardian-style childhood. \u201cShe grew up in quite a disciplined household and that kind of simple clothing really meant a lot to her,\u201d said Imogen Hunt, the archivist who looks after the company\u2019s increasingly treasured catalogue of patented Ashley fabrics and dress designs. An early love of quilting, Hunt explained, first drew Ashley towards her lifelong concern with reviving old prints and patterns. The tiny floral designs on the antique quilts she wanted to recreate were no longer being manufactured, so Ashley made her own. Later, after a \u00a310 silk screen, some dyes and a few yards of linen had been laid out on the kitchen table of the London flat she shared with Bernard in Cambridge Street, Pimlico, Ashley began to print headscarves, napkins and tea towels. Most were decorated with the kind of Victoriana \u2013 music hall playbills and penny farthings \u2013 that was becoming all the rage. In 1955, a former coaching house in Kent produced the Ashleys\u2019 first factory-made fabrics. Before long, they expanded and moved manufacturing to Carno, in a remote part of mid-Wales. In 1968 the couple, now parents of four children, opened their first shop in Pelham Street, South Kensington. Within a decade they had more than 70 shops across the world and a turnover of \u00a325m. A series of beguilingly \u201cnatural\u201d promotional shots taken by Jane Ashley, their eldest child, peddled the company\u2019s dream during this era. \u201cThere was a strong work ethic in the family. Business was discussed at every mealtime. My parents had a real can-do ethos,\u201d she has recalled. Her amateur style of photography conveyed the idea that real people were wearing these old-world outfits. Using friends as models, Jane snapped the maxi-length cotton dresses and broderie anglaise blouses that were to make her parents multimillionaires. Among her portfolio is a striking, unused image of one of her friends in an uncharacteristic Ashley halter-neck red jersey dress. These punk-influenced shots, taken near the Roundhouse in north London, were judged as not in keeping with the brand\u2019s tone. The billowing dresses Ashley produced in the 1980s, once Jane had left the company, are also now enthusiastically collected by vintage connoisseurs. This softer look is typified by the innocent advertising image of a young Kate Moss in a cotton wedding dress. But in 1985, the Ashleys\u2019 joint success story ended abruptly when the designer died suddenly at 60 of a brain haemorrhage after falling downstairs in her daughter\u2019s house. By then, the business, which had 220 shops in 12 countries and had expanded into home furnishings, was on the brink of flotation on the stock market, where it was valued at \u00a3200m. The flotation went ahead and within five years Sir Bernard Ashley, as he had become, had sold on the company to foreign investors. The fortunes of the brand since then have been varied. Home furnishings, wallpaper and paint, all made at the company\u2019s factory in Newtown, Powys, have become the centre of the business since Malaysian owners took over the company in 1998 and now account for about 80% of its sales. Earlier this year, the company issued a profit warning. Like many British firms it has been hit by currency movements in the wake of the Brexit vote. Last year it also hit the headlines when Laura Ashley\u2019s chairman, Khoo Kay Peng, and his wife, the former Miss Malaysia Pauline Chai, settled a lengthy divorce battle. In April 2017, the 78-year-old Khoo, who with his company, MUI, owns about 60% of Laura Ashley, was ordered to pay his ex-wife \u00a364m. This summer the company took another financial blow following charges made on the sale of its HQ in Singapore, slashing its profits. The Ashleys\u2019 famous chintz reproductions have been on a long journey since the designer spotted a new trend for cotton headscarves inspired by Audrey Hepburn\u2019s character in Roman Holiday. The couple were on an Italian holiday in 1952 when they hatched a plan to make similar scarves at home in Pimlico.

      "body": "<p>Laura Ashley built <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/laura-ashley\" title=\"\">a commercial empire </a>upon romantic fabrics and a line of cleverly tweaked \u201ctraditional\u201d English clothing. This autumn, 65 years after the business was founded, her name still summons up images of puffed sleeves and bows in pretty floral prints. The company\u2019s private archive, opened this week to the <em>Observer</em>, is a compendium of the designs and patterns that chart the changing desires of British women.</p> <p>Ashley\u2019s dresses, sold with the help of soft-focus, bucolic photographs of young women swishing through corn fields in floppy hats, located a nostalgic thread running through British taste. It is a look that has gone on to inspire other leading British designers, from Cath Kidston\u2019s quaint domestic wares, to the homely pottery of Emma Bridgewater.</p> <p>The design company \u2013 which now faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/15/laura-ashley-profits-fall-as-furniture-sales-slump-hits-home\" title=\"\">turbulent trading</a> conditions \u2013 was the first high street chain to market an ideal of countrylife to modern shoppers. In the 1970s, Ashley\u2019s trademark flowing flowery frocks chimed well with a hippie impulse to reject city sophistication. But the fashion house, run by Ashley alongside her husband Bernard, went on to peak in popularity in the following decade, with its industrial output of fitted velvet evening wear and sailor-collared shifts.</p> <p>Just as Mary Quant had fed women a vision of the sleek technological age with her monochrome mini dresses in the early 1960s, so Ashley\u2019s dreamy designs offered an imagined memory of a safer past. And when a brasher mood began to take hold in the 1980s, Ashley adapted by steering towards a crisper, posher look.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60509cfe2b211b7dd33b1a7dcaa39505f83b1e6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60509cfe2b211b7dd33b1a7dcaa39505f83b1e6a/0_216_2800_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Princess Diana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Princess Diana\u2019s love of Laura Ashley clothes inspired a generation of Sloane Rangers to buy them for themselves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1982 style commentator Peter York identified the phenomenon of the \u201cSloane Ranger\u201d in the handbook he co-authored with Ann Barr. York had noticed the pin-tucked white shirts and traditional pearl necklaces favoured by upper middle-class women near London\u2019s Sloane Square. Laura Ashley\u2019s skill was to quickly cater to the needs of all those aspiring Sloanes with less money to spend.</p> <p>And yet the designer herself, who was<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34290383\" title=\"\"> born </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34290383\" title=\"\">in Dowlais, </a>Merthyr Tydfil in 1925, was not originally a fan either of frills or lace. She preferred the starched cotton pinnies and plain linen workwear that had surrounded her during her strict Baptist, Edwardian-style childhood.</p> <p>\u201cShe grew up in quite a disciplined household and that kind of simple clothing really meant a lot to her,\u201d said Imogen Hunt, the archivist who looks after the company\u2019s increasingly treasured catalogue of patented Ashley fabrics and dress designs. An early love of quilting, Hunt explained, first drew Ashley towards her lifelong concern with reviving old prints and patterns. The tiny floral designs on the antique quilts she wanted to recreate were no longer being manufactured, so Ashley made her own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72ff2edc907dc55137d5143177d4cb1607e9c74d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ff2edc907dc55137d5143177d4cb1607e9c74d/0_0_1488_2521/590.jpg\" alt=\"A page from Laura Ashley\u2019s notebook\" width=\"590\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from Laura Ashley\u2019s notebook, released for the first time, showing details of ideas for a new dress</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Ashley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, after a \u00a310 silk screen, some dyes and a few yards of linen had been laid out on the kitchen table of the London flat she shared with Bernard in Cambridge Street, Pimlico, Ashley began to print headscarves, napkins and tea towels. Most were decorated with the kind of Victoriana \u2013 music hall playbills and penny farthings \u2013 that was becoming all the rage.</p> <p>In 1955, a former coaching house in Kent produced the Ashleys\u2019 first factory-made fabrics. Before long, they expanded and moved manufacturing to Carno, in a remote part of mid-Wales. In 1968 the couple, now parents of four children, opened their first shop in Pelham Street, South Kensington. Within a decade they had more than 70 shops across the world and a turnover of \u00a325m.</p> <p>A series of beguilingly \u201cnatural\u201d promotional shots taken by Jane Ashley, their eldest child, peddled the company\u2019s dream during this era. \u201cThere was a strong work ethic in the family. Business was discussed at every mealtime. My parents had a real can-do ethos,\u201d she has recalled.</p> <p>Her amateur style of photography conveyed the idea that real people were wearing these old-world outfits. Using friends as models, Jane snapped the maxi-length cotton dresses and broderie anglaise blouses that were to make her parents multimillionaires. Among her portfolio is a striking, unused image of one of her friends in an uncharacteristic Ashley halter-neck red jersey dress. These punk-influenced shots, taken near the Roundhouse in north London, were judged as not in keeping with the brand\u2019s tone.</p> <p>The billowing dresses Ashley produced in the 1980s, once Jane had left the company, are also now enthusiastically collected by vintage connoisseurs. This softer look is typified by the innocent advertising image of a young Kate Moss in a cotton wedding dress.</p> <p>But in 1985, the Ashleys\u2019 joint success story ended abruptly when the designer died suddenly at 60 of a brain haemorrhage after falling downstairs in her daughter\u2019s house. By then, the business, which had 220 shops in 12 countries and had expanded into home furnishings, was on the brink of flotation on the stock market, where it was valued at \u00a3200m. The flotation went ahead and within five years Sir Bernard Ashley, as he had become, had sold on the company to foreign investors. The fortunes of the brand since then have been varied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0fa7d2276986ab2517bd38c188a43ba97af3bae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0fa7d2276986ab2517bd38c188a43ba97af3bae/0_489_6458_3875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 1976 photoshoot by Jane Ashley, featuring Paul Simonon and Viv Albertine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1976 photoshoot featuring Paul Simonon of The Clash and Viv Albertine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Gilbert/Laura Ashley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Home furnishings, wallpaper and paint, all made at the company\u2019s factory in Newtown, Powys, have become the centre of the business since Malaysian owners took over the company in 1998 and now account for about 80% of its sales.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the company issued a profit warning. Like many British firms it has been hit by currency movements in the wake of the Brexit vote. Last year it also hit the headlines when Laura Ashley\u2019s chairman, Khoo Kay Peng, and his wife, the former Miss Malaysia Pauline Chai, settled a lengthy divorce battle. In April 2017, the 78-year-old Khoo, who with his company, MUI, owns about 60% of Laura Ashley, was ordered to pay his ex-wife \u00a364m.</p> <p>This summer the company took another financial blow following charges made on the sale of its HQ in Singapore, slashing its profits.</p> <p>The Ashleys\u2019 famous chintz reproductions have been on a long journey since the designer spotted a new trend for cotton headscarves inspired by Audrey Hepburn\u2019s character in <em>Roman Holiday</em>. The couple were on an Italian holiday in 1952 when they hatched a plan to make similar scarves at home in Pimlico.</p> <p>Some might wonder why the company has not kept a firmer commercial hold on a market for nostalgia that it helped to invent.

Thursday\u2019s AGM, in the City North hotel in Co Meath, will take place behind closed doors and without the presence of the press, breaking with a long-standing tradition that journalists report on the annual meetings of publicly listed companies. Last week, the airline said the meeting would be just for shareholders so that the discussions did not become twisted. Nor will there be a press briefing afterwards. So why the reticence to let the media in? The company said: \u201cWe wish to allow shareholders to discuss all matters freely with the board without these discussions being distorted for PR purposes.\u201d It is not, it would appear, any new sense of shyness on behalf of O\u2019Leary, who just last week told Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to \u201cget off his backside\u201d and strike a deal with the EU to avoid flights being grounded by a no-deal Brexit. It is has been a trying time for the airline \u2013 it was forced to cancel 20,000 flights last year amid staff rostering problems and industrial disputes in several countries. O\u2019Leary himself has admitted making mistakes in his handling of the strikes and waived a \u20ac1m (\u00a3890,000) bonus over the cancellations. \u201cI need to improve my own performance,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly, we\u2019ve made mistakes \u2026 with the unions.\u201d This summer Ryanair suffered its worst-ever strikes, as action by pilots and cabin crew forced it into cancellations. A deal with striking Irish pilots was reached last month and the airline has said it is hopeful it can secure deals in other markets. But unions representing cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands have threatened to extend the summer of industrial action to a stoppage on 28 September. O\u2019Leary has refused to back down in the face of that threat, claiming that Ryanair was willing to accept strikes and not \u201croll over like easyJet\u201d every time it was threatened. Last week, a Belgian union said the stoppage planned for later this month was due to ongoing discussions having not yielded results. Another issue is the position of the chairman, David Bonderman. Earlier this month, the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation and the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation joined with Glass Lewis, a shareholder advisory company, in calling for investors to vote against the re-election of Bonderman, the US billionaire who has been in his position since 1996. The workers\u2019 representatives want him removed to change what they see is an anti-union culture at the company; the airline predicts he will remain. On Friday, Britain\u2019s Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) also recommended members vote against Ryanair\u2019s financial report and oppose the re-election of Bonderman, citing \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the airline\u2019s treatment of workers. The current disruptions have created the worst period for the budget airline in its modern history. It is, of course, not obliged to let press into the AGM, but it is breaking a tradition held by most public companies by shutting the doors. So with Ryanair\u2019s difficulties continuing, will closing the doors mean the events inside will remain a secret? Unlikely. Although the venue has moved inland and away from the airline\u2019s headquarters, it is unlikely to stop the press from gathering outside the doors to pick up the anger of shareholders.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ten years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the financial crisis that followed, it is clear that far from being safer, the world is a more unstable and worrisome place. In the UK, average wages remain below pre-crisis levels and inequality is high. Investment in equipment and hi-tech processes, the cornerstone of future growth, is low. Not surprisingly, given the emphasis on extracting funds from companies rather than investing them, the productivity of the average worker, as measured by their output per hour, is well behind that of comparable developed nations. In the G7 countries, the picture is not much better. They might boast higher levels of productivity, but investment is low by historical standards and growth is slow. Where economies expand at an accelerated rate, it is always with the help of government stimulus, which is certainly the case in Donald Trump\u2019s US, where annual GDP growth has topped 4% following $1.1tn in tax cuts that mostly benefited the richest. These trends fuel widespread discontent and destabilise mainstream politics. All across the developed world democracies are under pressure to reduce inequality, only to find that many of the solutions either require money that most taxpayers are unwilling to supply or rule changes and tax reforms that cannot find enough support. Answering the call for progress, politicians flounder. Some things have improved. While total debt-to-GDP ratios are high in the countries that were hit hardest in 2008, including the US and UK, they have been broadly stable in the past five years. Trump\u2019s tax cuts will push the US public debt ratio higher over the coming years, but the debt ratio of American households, which rocketed ahead during the noughties, is now much lower than in 2008. In a similar vein, there has been a reduction in the amount of risky lending by banks, including sub-prime mortgages; banks themselves are better capitalised; and property and share prices have soared but are not as overvalued as they were a decade ago. Where sovereign debts have climbed to fresh highs, such as in China, and taken the total for global debt into new territory, the state\u2019s control of the financial sector makes for a much more stable situation. History suggests debt accumulation on the scale experienced in the world\u2019s second largest economy must end badly, but the financial system is relatively closed, most of the debt is denominated in local currency and the Chinese government has the means to rejuvenate the banking sector with extra reserves without pushing the public debt burden to worrying levels. Yet a crash in Beijing would ripple out to the rest of the world, and although banks in Europe and the US might be better prepared to withstand the shocks, the lack of worker productivity \u2013 an economy\u2019s main source of income growth \u2013 and the depleted stock of firepower in finance ministries and central banks leave the west vulnerable. Some economists regard the worrying trend for low productivity and household incomes as the developed world\u2019s achilles heel going into the 2020s. The trend is for global GDP to run at 3-3.5%, down from 4-4.5% a decade ago. The result will be slower wage and profits growth, leading to lower tax receipts at a time when debt servicing costs are rising. That leaves finance ministers with less money to spend when a crisis hits. Persistently low interest rates deny central bankers the ability to cut the cost of credit in a downturn, leaving them with not much more than reassuring platitudes for the public. Central banks may have sufficient room to counter a mild recession with conventional rate cuts, but a sharper downturn would almost certainly require them to resort to more quantitative easing. QE no longer has the shock and awe impact that it had in 2008. And without it, only paper soldiers stand in the line of defence against another crash. Electric cars are the future: it\u2019s time to unfreeze fuel duty Motorists will naturally be worried at the prospect of the oil price climbing even higher, as the world\u2019s energy watchdog warned it would last week. Petrol prices have, after all, already increased 11% in the past year. But the answer does not, as some Tory MPs and motoring groups have argued, lie in shying away from a rise in fuel duty. As the chancellor, Philip Hammond, told parliament, the tax needs to go up to pay for the NHS and other public spending. The prize is too big \u2013 the Treasury has already lost out on \u00a346bn from the fuel duty freeze. The smart response to rising oil prices, for drivers and policymakers alike, is to speed up the switch to electric vehicles. Moving to battery-powered cars would also help address another of Britain\u2019s big problems \u2013 illegal levels of air pollution that are causing thousands of premature deaths. As Norwegian politicians put it, tax what you want less of and promote what you want more of. There are signs that Downing Street understands this: Theresa May announced \u00a3106m last week for green vehicles. But there appears to be little appetite for bringing forward the government\u2019s unambitious goal of a ban on new petrol and diesel cars sales from 2040. Consumers are already voting with their wallets, won over by cheap running costs and cleaner technology. Electrified vehicles \u2013 hybrids, plug-in hybrids and 100% electric cars \u2013 accounted for one in 12 cars sold in August. Jaguar only delivered the first of its flagship electric cars days ago but expects to sell more than 100 this month. Now is the time for ministers to hit the accelerator and steer towards the electric revolution. It is not the moment for letting polluting vehicles dodge essential tax rises. Engaging in party politics could cause a schism Naivety is not necessarily a bad quality in an archbishop of Canterbury. One doesn\u2019t want the head of the Church of England to be too worldly-wise. Yet Justin Welby would have done himself a favour this week by employing some common sense before giving us his political views. One mistake wasn\u2019t terribly serious. The fact that Amazon \u2013 a company denounced by Welby for paying \u201calmost nothing\u201d in taxes \u2013 is a top-20 holding in the Church of England\u2019s investment portfolio is not surprising. It is hard for any organisation with a large and diversified pool of investments to avoid having some exposure to the world\u2019s second-largest public company. Since Welby won\u2019t be taking the investment decisions himself, he can hide behind the plea that the Church wants to \u201cengage\u201d with Amazon, even if Jeff Bezos probably isn\u2019t quaking in fear. More seriously, Welby railed against zero-hours contracts while failing to mention that two cathedrals are advertising jobs on precisely such terms. On that score, he can fairly be expected to have the facts at his fingertips. If he is going to call zero-hours contracts \u201cthe reincarnation of an ancient evil\u201d, he is open to the charge of hypocrisy. If one disregards that failing, Welby\u2019s speech itself was strong. As a standalone analysis of deep causes of poverty in modern Britain, it would enjoy a sympathetic response from liberal quarters. The problem is the political context and where he chose to make his pronouncements, namely from a platform at the TUC conference. In doing so, the archbishop of Canterbury strayed into party politics by appearing to ally himself with the Labour party. It cannot be a good look for the Church of England to be seen to be so close to one political party. If the position were reversed, and the archbishop was closely echoing Tory policies, there would be uproar. Welby is a well-meaning and serious figure, but his tactics are misguided.",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney\u2019s stress tests reinvent project fear by accident", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The case for staying inside the EU remains solid, but reinventions of project fear are wrecking the chances of ever persuading Leave voters, possibly in a second referendum, that quitting the single market and customs union would harm the economy irrevocably. That\u2019s because project fear \u2013 as first put forward by the Treasury before the referendum vote and supported by the likes of the International Monetary Fund \u2013 is full of almost as many barmy assumptions as are held true by Jacob Rees-Mogg and his European Research Group (ERG). Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, was drawn into the debate last week, after he was forced to clarify claims that he had told Theresa May\u2019s cabinet a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit could be worse for the economy than the 2008 financial crisis. Carney rejected this interpretation of his remarks, saying he had told ministers about \u201cstress test\u201d scenarios designed to check the stability and durability of Britain\u2019s banks in a crisis. He said the worst case scenario, which showed house prices falling sharply in the next downturn, did not amount to a prediction by the Bank as to what would happen should the UK leave with no deal. Despite his denials, however, some supporters of the prime minister\u2019s Chequers deal have argued that the Bank\u2019s most pessimistic outlook could in fact be triggered by a no-deal Brexit. Carney is on solid ground when he argues that the stress tests cannot be considered a forecast: a forecast would contain a more plausible assumption of the Bank\u2019s own actions. Instead, the tests suggest that, in the carnage of a global financial meltdown, the Bank would increase interest rates to 4%. If the Bank stuck to this remedy \u2013 even in the different setting of a UK-only disaster rather than a global meltdown \u2013 the path to a terrible outcome would start on the day it became clear that a no-deal exit was certain. Rising inflation As no-deal became a reality, investors would panic, triggering a slump in the pound. International investors are a nervous bunch and over a period of weeks sterling could fall further than it did following the Brexit vote, when it dropped by around 20% against the dollar and a little less against the euro. It\u2019s possible to argue that a lower-valued currency might help exports in the long run. But in the short term Britain would be forced to pay more for imports, fuelling higher prices in the shops. On this most economists agree. Higher interest rates The first step in tackling higher inflation would be to restrict consumers\u2019 access to credit, according to the stress test. Higher interest rates would mean consumers had less buying power. As a result, shops and businesses that import goods might have to absorb the higher costs of imports rather than pass them on. Carney insists this is a possible course of action. House price crash However, any success in restricting prices rises would send tidal waves though the rest of the economy, including a housing panic as buyers found mortgage loan rates soaring, increasing the cost of purchasing a home. In the stress tests, the Bank says a 25% to 35% fall in house prices across the country is possible, wiping hundreds of billions off the value of UK property and the banks\u2019 balance sheets. Unemployment hits double figures Faced with rising import costs and higher interest rates, businesses would be forced to lay off workers. increasing unemployment. Some industries would be especially hard hit by the rise in interest rates, including the construction industry and housebuilders. The ripple effects on other businesses would send unemployment above 10%, the Bank suggests in its bleakest scenario. Depressed economic growth The Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has estimated that last year 90% of the UK\u2019s 1.8% GDP growth was the result of household spending. So higher unemployment would have the effect of reducing household spending and therefore GDP growth. A recession is the likely result. Unfortunately, the Bank\u2019s worst case scenario has a familiar ring to it. It reads like the Treasury\u2019s project fear forecasts before the Brexit vote, and rests on Carney and his policymakers making the mistake of tightening monetary policy just as the commercial banks do the same and private businesses and households stop spending. That was not a mistake the Bank made after the 2008 financial crash, when its base rate was cut from 5% to 0.5% and over subsequent years \u00a3375bn was pumped into the economy. It was also not the central bank\u2019s policy response following the Brexit vote. Carney should be clear and say the Bank would always loosen monetary policy: then the project-fear-mongers would stop putting rising interest rates in their scenario planning, including the Bank of England.",

Instead, the tests suggest that, in the carnage of a global financial meltdown, the Bank would increase interest rates to 4%.</p> <p>If the Bank stuck to this remedy \u2013 even in the different setting of a UK-only disaster rather than a global meltdown \u2013 the path to a terrible outcome would start on the day it became clear that a no-deal exit was certain.</p> <p><strong>Rising inflation </strong>As no-deal became a reality, investors would panic, triggering a slump in the pound. International investors are a nervous bunch and over a period of weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">sterling could fall further than it did following the Brexit vote</a>, when it dropped by around 20% against the dollar and a little less against the euro. It\u2019s possible to argue that a lower-valued currency might help exports in the long run. But in the short term Britain would be forced to pay more for imports, fuelling higher prices in the shops. On this most economists agree.</p> <p><strong>Higher interest rates</strong> The first step in tackling higher inflation would be to restrict consumers\u2019 access to credit, according to the stress test. Higher interest rates would mean consumers had less buying power. As a result, shops and businesses that import goods might have to absorb the higher costs of imports rather than pass them on. Carney insists this is a possible course of action.</p> <p><strong>House price crash</strong> However, any success in restricting prices rises would send tidal waves though the rest of the economy, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jan/06/house-prices-fall-in-december\" title=\"\">a housing panic</a> as buyers found mortgage loan rates soaring, increasing the cost of purchasing a home. In the stress tests, the Bank says a 25% to 35% fall in house prices across the country is possible, wiping hundreds of billions off the value of UK property and the banks\u2019 balance sheets.</p> <p><strong>Unemployment hits double figures</strong> Faced with rising import costs and higher interest rates, businesses would be forced to lay off workers. increasing unemployment. Some industries would be especially hard hit by the rise in interest rates, including the construction industry and housebuilders. The ripple effects on other businesses would send unemployment above 10%, the Bank suggests in its bleakest scenario.</p> <p><strong>Depressed economic growth</strong> The Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has estimated that last year 90% of the UK\u2019s 1.8% GDP growth was the result of household spending. So higher unemployment would have the effect of reducing household spending and therefore GDP growth. A recession is the likely result.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Bank\u2019s worst case scenario has a familiar ring to it. It reads like the Treasury\u2019s project fear forecasts before the Brexit vote, and rests on Carney and his policymakers making the mistake of tightening monetary policy just as the commercial banks do the same and private businesses and households stop spending.</p> <p>That was not a mistake the Bank made after the 2008 financial crash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/05/interest-rates-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">when its base rate was cut from 5% to 0.5%</a> and over subsequent years \u00a3375bn was pumped into the economy. It was also not the central bank\u2019s policy response following the Brexit vote. Carney should be clear and say the Bank would always loosen monetary policy: then the project-fear-mongers would stop putting rising interest rates in their scenario planning, including the Bank of England.</p>",
