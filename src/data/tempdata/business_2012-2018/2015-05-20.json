      "bodyText": "George Osborne has told Whitehall departments that the fresh squeeze on government spending has begun, ordering them to make an immediate start on finding the \u00a313bn of cuts needed for the next phase of his deficit reduction plan. The chancellor told the CBI he wanted to be able to announce savings from all spending apart from the ringfenced areas of health, schools and overseas aid in his summer budget on 8 July. With Osborne eager to enact tough measures as early as possible, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, Greg Hands, has started to ask departments whether they can find ways of trimming their 2015-16 plans to fast-track the three-year squeeze. Osborne told the annual dinner of the employers\u2019 organisation in London: \u201cWhen it comes to saving money, we all know that the more you can do early, the smoother the ride. \u201cAnd without fixing the public finances so our country lives within its means, there can be no economic security for businesses or working people.\u201d The Conservative party said in its election manifesto that it would adopt a three-pronged approach to deficit reduction in the current parliament: \u00a313bn of departmental spending cuts, \u00a312bn of welfare cuts and \u00a35bn of extra revenue from a crackdown on tax avoidance. Osborne said Whitehall departments underspent their budgets in previous years and Hands was asking them to find ways of doing so again in the current financial year. Treasury sources said the expectation was that the savings would be found from day-to-day running costs rather than capital projects but it would be up to departments to come up with suggestions. Before the election, Osborne served notice on Whitehall that he would be expecting fresh cuts in the event of a Conservative victory. These savings have to be made by 2017-18, but if departments have already identified savings they will come under pressure to bring them forward. No fixed target or timetable has been set at this stage. By the time the spending squeeze is over in 2017-18, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that the budgets of unprotected Whitehall departments such as justice, transport and the Home Office, will have been cut by a third once inflation has been taken into account. Opposition to Osborne\u2019s plans will centre on what the cuts mean for sensitive areas of public spending, including policing, prisons, the armed forces and the courts. Job cuts and pay restraint are likely to feature as important parts of the money-saving programme designed to turn the UK\u2019s budget deficit \u2013 forecast to be \u00a375bn in 2015-16 \u2013 into a surplus by 2018-19. Traditionally, governments of both left and right have tried to impose spending cuts and tax increases in the first budget of a parliament in the expectation that the pain will have been forgotten by the next election. Osborne will also use his second budget of 2015 to outline how he intends to shave about 10% off the \u00a3120bn slice of the welfare budget that is not spent on pensioners. The Conservatives refused to detail where the cuts would be made during the election campaign, but the IFS said child benefit and disability allowances would inevitably have to be looked at. The chancellor announced that he would seek to tackle Britain\u2019s poor productivity record, starting with the publication of a new \u201cPlan to make Britain Work Better\u201d before the budget. The Treasury said this would identify what needed to be done to alleviate long-running weaknesses in areas such as transport, broadband, planning, skills, ownership, childcare, red-tape, science and innovation. \u201cLet me be clear: improving the productivity of our country is the route to raising standards of living for everyone in this country\u201d, Osborne said. \u201cSo by the budget, I will publish our productivity plan, our plan to make Britain work better. Our future prosperity depends on it.\u201d Britain\u2019s productivity has stagnated since the country went into its deepest postwar recession in 2008, with output per head 15% below where it would have been had the pre-crisis trend continued and about 30% lower than in rival countries such as the US, Germany and France. Osborne said nobody knew why Britain\u2019s record had been so poor but said he would rather \u201chave the productivity challenge than the challenge of mass unemployment\u201d. Hinting that the government would soon announce plans for the siting of a new runway in the south-east of England and pledging extra investment in roads, railways, broadband, housing and skills, the chancellor said: \u201cIt is now within our grasp to make Britain the most prosperous country in the world and the best place to do business. \u201cIt would be very easy at the beginning of a second term to take our foot off the pedal. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do. I want Britain to find that extra gear.\u201d The chancellor announced the creation of a new government-owned company, UK Government Investments (UKGI), as part of the government\u2019s plan to reduce the national debt by selling of more than \u00a323bn of publicly-owned corporate and financial assets in 2015-16. UKGI will bring together the two bodies that manage the taxpayer stake in businesses \u2013 the Shareholder Executive and UK Financial Investments \u2013 into one holding company.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry shares have taken a hit after the luxury fashion retailer admitted it will get far less benefit from foreign currency gains than it had anticipated only a few weeks ago. Burberry had expected a \u00a350m boost from favourable foreign exchange movements, but yesterday the label warned that boost would now be just \u00a310m, as a result of currency movements including a rise in value of the pound against Hong Kong and US dollars. \u201cUnderneath, the numbers read well and are ahead of forecasts and the company is doing a lot to make the business sustainable, but lowering 2016 guidance has hurt Burberry today, and luxury is always going to be a choppy sector, quick to react to changes in consumer confidence,\u201d said Will Hedden, a dealer at London Capital Group. Trenchcoats, monogrammed scarves and check blanket ponchos, all made in Britain, underpinned sales growth during the financial year ending 31 March. The company beat City forecasts with an 11% rise in revenues to \u00a32.5bn and a 7% rise in pre-tax profit to \u00a3456m. But investors took fright after a slowdown in Asia, and Burberry shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, plunging more than 6% to 1697p. Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, one of Burberry\u2019s most profitable markets, have damaged business in recent months. Tourism has fallen away in the territory, with fewer visitors from mainland China \u2013 who are typically big spenders. The result was a mid-single-digit decline in Hong Kong spending during the second half of the year, the company said, accompanied by a slowdown in mainland China, but countered by a slight lift in Europe. A weaker euro also increased grey market sales, with unauthorised traders buying luxury brands in Europe and selling them at a profit in China and other Asian markets. Burberry responded by raising prices in Europe and reducing them in Asia. A decision to simplify the variety of trenchcoats on offer helped boost sales of the company\u2019s classic British-made garment, along with Scottish-made scarves, which can now be monogrammed via online order for \u00a375 on top of the \u00a3335 retail price. Burberry\u2019s finance chief, Carol Fairweather, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this absolute focus on our heritage icons, there is a lot more to come from the scarves and poncho story as we move forward this year.\u201d The trenchcoat, made from fabric woven in Keighley in Yorkshire and sewn nearby in Castleford, now uses cotton grown on Burberry\u2019s sustainably managed plantation in Peru. International events with a British theme helped raise the brand\u2019s profile, with London streets recreated in a Shanghai warehouse and James Corden, the Beckhams and the Queen\u2019s Grenadier Guards starring at a one-off fashion show in Los Angeles in April. And the company reasserted its digital credentials by using the brand new Periscope app to live stream the event. LINE, which has 52m Japanese users, broadcast its February womenswear show to a large Asian audience.",

      "bodyText": "A late newsflash: The European Central Bank has reportedly decided to increase the emergency liquidity it provides offer to Greece, but only by \u20ac200m. That takes the ELA limit to \u20ac80.2bn. That\u2019s a surprisingly small increase. But one source has told Reuters that Greece hasn\u2019t hit the \u20ac80bn limit yet; it now has a \u20ac3bn buffer to cope with capital withdrawals. In short, it leaves plenty of pressure on Athens to come to a deal with its creditors, before facing that \u20ac305m repayment to the IMF on June 5. And finally, some important news from Greece as it strives to reach a deal with its creditors. Speaking to the Guardian in Athens tonight, government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides said the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras would be meeting Angela Merkel on Thursday night, after EU leaders had attended an official summit dinner in Riga, Latvia. Sakellarides told us: \u201cWe know that decisive decisions ultimately are taken at the level of finance ministers in the Euro Group but at this critical moment a meeting between Tsipras and Merkel can only be helpful.\u201d Talks would focus on the headway negotiators had made since the two leaders last met, said Sakellarides. They will also cover the urgency of Greece\u2019s liquidity problem, and issues such as VAT, pensions and labour deregulation which continue to be the major stumbling blocks between the two sides. But Sakellarides, who is among Tsipras\u2019 closest allies, denied that the leftist-led government now faced the dilemma of sticking to its \u201cred lines\u201d or seeing the county rejected from the euro zone. \u201cIt is not a question of red lines or the eurozone. It boils down to what everybody has understood in the last five years which is that the regime of austerity has failed. The persistence of the architects of this regime and their insistence of keeping the country on the same track, is simply irrational. We want to stop the vicious cycle of debt and recession. It\u2019s not about stubbornness. It\u2019s about preserving Greece and its people.\u201d And that\u2019s probably all for tonight. Back tomorrow. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Time for a recap: Major banks, including Barclays, Citigroup and Royal Bank of Scotland, have been fined a record $5.7bn (\u00a33.7bn) for rigging foreign exchange markets in the latest scandal to engulf the banking industry. Announcing the fines Loretta Lynch, US attorney general, said the banks had exhibited \u201cbreathtaking flagrancy\u201d setting up a group they called \u201cthe cartel\u201d to manipulate a market valued at $5trn a day. Lynch told a press conference that: \u201cThe penalty these banks will now pay is fitting considering the long-running and egregious nature of their anticompetitive conduct. It is commensurate with the pervasive harm done. And it should deter competitors in the future from chasing profits without regard to fairness, to the law, or to the public welfare,\u201d The new fines are a second wave of punishments for fixing forex markets. Six major banks were fined \u00a32.6bn in November 2014. This takes the total penalties to \u00a36.3bn. Barclays, which was hit by the UK regulator\u2019s biggest ever fine, will fire eight employees. Transcripts showed that its managers had urged traders to manipulate markets at the expense of their customers. RBS has dismissed three staff, with two more suspended. RBS chairman Philip Hampton siad: We strongly condemn the actions of those responsible and regret the control failings that allowed such misconduct to take place. Chat room information also showed that UBS staff had used finger gestures to conspire against clients. Shares in Barclays and RBS both rallied today after the fines were announced, as the markets welcomed the fact the fines weren\u2019t bigger. The Treasury said the scale of the fines showed that financial regulation is working. The Labour opposition, though, called for a new review to clean up the City. Here\u2019s the full story, by Jill Treanor: And here\u2019s a Q&amp;A explaining the scandal: Despite the concerns about bank culture voiced today, several top bank executives have been playing the \u201cbad apple\u201d defence. Bloomberg has the details: \u201cThe conduct of a small number of employees was unacceptable and we have taken appropriate disciplinary actions,\u201d UBS Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti and Chairman Axel Weber said in a statement. JPMorgan said in a statement that the conduct underlying the antitrust charge against the bank is \u201cprincipally attributable\u201d to a single trader, who has since been dismissed. \u201cThe conduct described in the government\u2019s pleadings is a great disappointment to us,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. \u201cWe demand and expect better of our people. The lesson here is that the conduct of a small group of employees, or of even a single employee, can reflect badly on all of us.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy breakdown of all today\u2019s fines, and the previous ones announced last November, from Sky News analyst Guy Harding: [Incidentally, there are different ways of calculating the total , depending if you use today\u2019s $/\u00a3 exchange rate or last November\u2019s one] Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, is alarmed that bank staff were conspiring to fix foreign exchange rates as late as 2013. \u201cSurely the time has come for fundamental reform and tougher penalties for banking misconduct. \u201cIf ever there was an example of appalling collusion between bankers putting their own interests ahead of customers, then this is it. \u201cMinisters refused to act in 2012 when we pressed for broader regulation of financial benchmarks such as those in foreign exchange. \u201cWe need to rebuild the reputation of British banking, which plays such a crucial role in our economy.\u201d Benjamin M. Lawsky, the US Superintendent of Financial Services at the New York State Department (NYDFS), has issued a truly damning report into Barclays. It explains how the bank conspired with rivals to trigger its clients stop-loss orders, in a \u201cHeads I Win, Tails You Lose\u201d approach to FX trading. Lawsky adds bluntly: Put simply, Barclays employees helped rig the foreign exchange market. In one instance, a manager told his staff that their aim was to give customers the worst deal they could get away with. Another had a remarkable rallying cry: \u201cif you ain\u2019t cheating, you ain\u2019t trying.\u201d For example: NYDFS also explains how the collaboration between banks was crucial: Without the active cooperation and coordination among the traders at multiple banks, via the use of chat rooms, the Barclays trader would have had neither the information to indicate that pushing the price was feasible, since there were not large contrary orders pending, nor the tools to attempt to accomplish that forced, temporary push lower. NYDFS ANNOUNCES BARCLAYS TO PAY $2.4 BILLION, TERMINATE EMPLOYEES FOR CONSPIRING TO MANIPULATE SPOT FX TRADING MARKET David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, argues that today\u2019s \u201ccolossal\u201d fines may not be enough to stamp out bad behaviour: \u201cIt\u2019s clear our softly softly approach to the finance industry isn\u2019t working. Fines alone are not enough - much bolder action is needed to ensure banks work in our greater interest.\u201d The London stock market just closed, with Barclays sitting proudly as the second-biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index, up almost 3.5%. That means Barclays is worth \u00a31.5bn more than this time yesterday, or almost exactly its total fines. RBS was the fifth-best performer, up 1.7% - putting \u00a3715m on its value, rather more than it has been fined. Another bank has been fined today too -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BAML has been hit with a $205m penalty by the Federal Reserve for \u201cunsafe and unsound practices in the foreign-exchange market\u201d. The City must embrace a major cultural shift to avoid a repeat of the FX scandal, argues professor Mark Taylor, Dean of Warwick Business School. He says: Imposing heavy penalties - together with the accompanying adverse publicity - is one way of shifting that culture. \u201cThis sort of practice strikes at the heart of business ethics and is yet another blow to the integrity of the banks. Our pension funds invest billions of pounds in the financial markets and if they are being cheated in this way it affects every one of us. A bank\u2019s culture is the responsibility of those at the top; Taylor wonders whether any senior executives will now resign. Taylor is a former foreign exchange trader. He reckons that it could make sense to end the practice of taking a daily \u2018fix\u2019 of FX rates -- which proved a tempting target for some traders, so has experience of the market. \u201cRegulation of the forex markets would be very difficult, but one solution would be to take away the temptation to do this by taking the average over an hour - so 30 minutes either side of 4pm fix rather than 30 seconds. It\u2019s a simple, workable solution because it would be a lot harder, if not impossible, to move a market as big as the FX market for an hour. Removing the incentive is much better than regulation because of the global, decentralised nature of the foreign exchange market.\u201d Cornell Law professor Robert Hockett says it\u2019s significant that the banks have admitted guilt in criminal, not merely regulatory, investigations. These are the first admissions of criminal guilt by large banking concerns in many, many years. And with similar investigations into benchmark interest rate and precious metal price manipulation schemes still underway, there are likely to be more such to come. Today\u2019s case also confirms that some traders knew very well in 2008 that the Libor rate (not to be confused with today\u2019s FX fines) was being manipulated. Here\u2019s a snippet from its settlement with UBS, showing one newbie being brought up to speed by an old hand: This really is shocking -- UBS staff were making gestures between each other to mark up the prices that they offered customers, in the hope of making illicit profits. Literally giving two fingers to their own clients.... Wall Street is also taking today\u2019s fines in its stride: Here\u2019s the press release from the Department of Justice: Five Major Banks Agree to Parent-Level Guilty Pleas It includes links to the five separate pleas, from Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan, Citigroup and UBS. It also includes this stinging rebuke, from Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer: The charged conspiracy fixed the U.S. dollar \u2013 euro exchange rate, affecting currencies that are at the heart of international commerce and undermining the integrity and the competitiveness of foreign currency exchange markets which account for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of transactions every day. \u201cThe seriousness of the crime warrants the parent-level guilty pleas by Citicorp, Barclays, JPMorgan and RBS.\u201d US attorney general Loretta Lynch has said the banks were guilty of \u201cbreathtaking flagrancy\u201d, at a press conference taking place now. Lynch said the Department of Justice was still investigating the cartel and declined to comment on whether individuals would eventually be charged. The investigation entailed the assessment of 680,000 pages of financial documents and a terabyte of complex bank trading data/. The issues were \u201cso systemic\u201d that prosecutors said the parent companies had to be sanctioned at the highest levels. Today\u2019s fines are proof that the City is being regulated properly, according to The Treasury. A spokesman says: \u201cThe integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain, which is why the government took action to deal with the abuses and unacceptable behaviour by implementing the key recommendations of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and setting up the Fair and Effective Markets Review, to ensure that Britain\u2019s financial markets are working as they should and similar scandals cannot happen again.\u201d Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have risen by 2%. It says that today\u2019s fines are fully covered in existing provisions. So, like Barclays, there is relief that the penalties aren\u2019t worse. Barclays\u2019 share price has jumped by 3%! That\u2019s not the reaction you might expect, given the bank has been fined a record \u00a3284m by UK regulators and chastised over its failings. But it makes sense - Barclays had set aside more in provisions than it\u2019s actually being fined by global regulators. This could free up \u00a3500m in spare cash.... The FX market is huge, with over $5 trillion of currency deals taking place each day. And today\u2019s evidence shows that traders didn\u2019t always succeed in rigging the rate at which currencies were changing hands. On one occasion, a Barclays trader spent \u00a310m trying to drive the pound higher, and trigger a client\u2019s stop-loss order, only to see the attempt fizzle out and leave them nursing a loss. This is the second time that regulators have announced fines over the Forex-rigging scandal. They take the total penalties up to $10bn. A big number, but one that is dwarfed by the profits of the banks involved: Royal Bank of Scotland has dismissed three employees, and suspended two more, following its role in the manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. Philip Hampton, chairman of the bank - bailed out by the UK taxpayer in 2009 - says it fully accepts today\u2019s penalties. Hampton added: We strongly condemn the actions of those responsible and regret the control failings that allowed such misconduct to take place. \u201cThis episode has exposed serious shortcomings at both individual and collective levels from which we continue to learn. As part of this effort we are committed to implementing further improvements to systems and controls. RBS is paying $395 million to the DoJ and $274 million to the Federal Reserve to resolve the investigations. As well as fining Barclays a record \u00a3284m, the FCA is damning about the conduct of the traders who rigged the foreign exchange rates. It says they formed secret groups with names such as \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d -- and actually tried to trigger their clients\u2019 own stop-loss orders; costing their clients money, but making money for the traders. The FCA says: Barclays engaged in collusive behaviour in which traders from different banks, including Barclays, formed tight knit groups and communicated through electronic messaging systems including chat rooms. Certain groups described themselves or were described by others using phrases such as\u201cthe players\u201d \u2013 one chat room participant referred to himself and others in the chat room as \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d and commented \u201cwe all die together\u201d. The information obtained through these groups helped traders determine their trading strategies. They then attempted to manipulate fix rates and trigger client \u201cstop loss\u201d orders (which are designed to limit the losses a client could face if exposed to adverse currency rate movements). This involved traders attempting to manipulate the relevant currency rate in the market, for example, to ensure that the rate at which the bank had agreed to sell a particular currency to its clients was higher than the average rate at which it had bought that currency in the market to ensure a profit for Barclays. Today\u2019s fines include the biggest ever penalty imposed by Britain\u2019s financial watchdog, \u00a3284m, against Barclays. The Financial Conduct Authority says Barclays failed to control its foreign-exchange trading operations properly. This means its traders could collude with employees at rival banks, to share market-sensitive information. The scale of the wrong-doing undermined confidence in the UK financial system and putting its integrity at risk. Georgina Philippou, the FCA\u2019s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, says:: \u201cThis is another example of a firm allowing unacceptable practices to flourish on the trading floor. Instead of addressing the obvious risks associated with its business Barclays allowed a culture to develop which put the firm\u2019s interests ahead of those of its clients and which undermined the reputation and integrity of the UK financial system. Firms should scrutinise their own systems and cultures to ensure that they make good on their promises to deliver change.\u201d BREAKING: Barclays, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS have been fined a total of $5.7bn for their role in manipulating the foreign exchange markets. Barclays will also fire eight people, as part of a deal with regulators. Here are the snaps from Reuters: FIVE BANKS TO PAY ABOUT $5.7 BLN IN FOREX SETTLEMENT WITH AUTHORITIES \u2013 U.S. DEPT OF JUSTICE JPMORGAN, CITIGROUP, ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND, BARCLAYS TO PLEAD GUILTY TO CRIMINAL CHARGES OVER FOREX RIGGING \u2013 US DOJ UBS PLEADS GUILTY TO CRIMINAL CHARGE OVER LIBOR RATE MANIPULATION - DOJ JPMORGAN TO PAY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT $550 MLN, CITIGROUP $925 MLN IN CRIMINAL FINES - DOJ ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND TO PAY $395 MLN CRIMINAL FINE, BARCLAYS $650 MILLION IN CRIMINAL FINE ALONE OVER FOREX UBS TO PAY $203 MLN CRIMINAL PENALTY OVER LIBOR \u2013 DOJ FIVE BANKS ALSO TO PAY FINES OF OVER $1.6 BILLION TO U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE - DOJ FEDERAL RESERVE SEPARATELY FINES BANK OF AMERICA $205 MILLION OVER FOREX BARCLAYS SETTLES RELATED CLAIMS WITH NEW YORK REGULATOR, CFTC AND UK REGULATOR FCA FOR ADDITIONAL $1.3 BILLION PENALTY - DOJ BARCLAYS ALSO TO FIRE 8 EMPLOYEES OVER FOREX MISCONDUCT IN DEAL WITH NEW YORK REGULATOR BARCLAYS\u2019 OVERALL FINES TOTAL $2.4 BILLION - NEW YORK BANKING REGULATOR Our City editor, Jill Treanor, has helpfully written a Q&amp;A about the forex scandal, to help explain today\u2019s fines. And here it is: What are the foreign exchange markets? Each day, \u00a33.5tn changes hands in the foreign exchange markets. Each week, the equivalent of a year\u2019s global trade in physical goods takes place. The markets are open 24 hours a day, although 40% of the activity takes place in London. This is because of the city\u2019s central position in time zones. Hong Kong dealers pass their trading to London, which in turn transfers to New York before slipping back to the Asian time zone. Where does it trade? There is no equivalent of a stock exchange for currencies. Dealers trade between each other, and prices flash up on trading terminals in a wide range of currencies. A price of any currency has to be set against another, say the pound, and they are known as pairs. The most commonly traded pairs are the euro against the dollar, the dollar against the yen, and sterling against the dollar. Many of them have nicknames. \u201cCable\u201d is sterling-dollar because of cable laid under the Atlantic ocean in 1858 to improve communications between the US and the UK. The \u201cloonie\u201d is the Canadian dollar, named after the bird. Such is the size of the market, dealers trade in millions, and often billions (known as yards). Why does it matter? The prices of currencies have an impact on everyone, from holidaymakers to companies manufacturing cars or selling clothes. How did the traders rig it? As the markets never close, there is no single closing price in the currency markets. But when the Financial Conduct Authority fined five banks in November 2014, it outlined two points in the day \u2013 at 1.15pm and 4pm \u2013 when the prices for currencies are \u201cfixed\u201d. Most of the focus has been on the 4pm fix which is set on the basis of a 60-second trading period each side of the hour. Customers give banks orders to trade at 4pm and if banks know the trading positions of their rivals they are able to work out at what price the \u201cfix\u201d will take place. Through chatrooms, traders shared information about their client orders and were able to influence the price. The FCA found the traders at rival banks formed groups through which they shared information and referred to their teams using names like \u201cthe players\u201d, \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d, \u201c1 team, 1 dream\u201d, \u201ca co-operative\u201d and \u201cthe A-team\u201d. Is this like the Libor scandal? To a certain extent. The interest rate rigging scandal increased scrutiny on other markets, although the process of manipulation was different. Libor was set using estimates submitted by banks about what rate of interest they expected to be charged for borrowing. The currency fixes are based on actual trades. OK. Financial regulators are about to announce fines against some of the world\u2019s largest banks, over their role in the foreign exchange-rigging scandal. We believe thats several banks will be penalised, with fines possibly running to \u00a33bn. They could also plead guilty to offences relating to manipulating foreign exchange markets. As Bloomberg\u2019s Max Colchester tweeted earlier, we\u2019re probably also going to receive transcripts of conversations between traders, discussing their activities. Time for a recap of the main Greek developments today. Concern is growing that Greece will miss its next repayment to the International Monetary Fund, triggering a new phase of the crisis. Government spokesman Nikos Filis insisted this morning that Greece would miss its \u20ac305m repayment, due on June 5, unless lenders hand over fresh funds soon. With fellow spokesman Thanassis Petrakos reiterating this point, it\u2019s clear that Greece has barely two weeks to get a deal. Fears over Greece have knocked the euro today, and left Europe\u2019s financial markets nervous. Moody\u2019s added to the gloom, warning that there is a high risk that capital controls could be imposed in Greece, meaning bank accounts could be frozen. Lawyers fear that Greece could be plunged into chaos if it missed an IMF payment, potentially triggering a default and possibly leading to a parallel currency. Some left-wingers in the Greek government may revolt if they are asked to approve austerity measures that go against their pre-election commitments. Anti-austerity protesters have marched through Athens; it began with pensioners, and was followed by healthcare workers. The European Central Bank has been deliberating whether to continue providing emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. We expect a decision later today. According to Bloomberg, Athens has asked for more help: The New York Times has run a long profile of Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, in which he says he would rather resign than accept a deal that extends Greece\u2019s misery. And here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s news story, with all the latest details: A group of protesters have broken into the Athens headquarters of Allianz, the German financial services group, according to Greek newspaper Enikos. They say: According to reports the demonstrators, without using violence, asked all employees to leave the building. Health workers have now marched through Athens, to mark a 24-hour strike calling for more funding and extra staff for the sector. Over in Athens, the speaker of the Greek parliament has gone toe-to-toe with police officers, insisting they stop restricting today\u2019s anti-austerity protesters [see earlier photos] Greece would enter a legal minefield if it were to default on its IMF repayments, as it is now threatening. Benedict James, a partner at law firm Linklaters, explains: \u201cWith a number of repayment deadlines for Greece in the coming weeks, if a bailout package isn\u2019t agreed, the government seems likely to run progressively out of euros. This may lead to the imposition of capital controls and issuance of government IOUs as a sort of quasi-currency (as happened in Argentina and California). That may or may not be a precursor to a full exit of the euro. The legality of capital controls is complicated under the EU treaties and the IMF framework, the imposition of a quasi-currency may be in breach of the eurozone rules, and there is no mechanics in the relevant EU treaties for a legal departure from the eurozone. This would all therefore be a highly complex legal situation, both for the relevant countries, and for businesses and financiers trying to work out whether their contracts are enforceable, and if so in what currency.\u201d When we profiled Yanis Varoufakis in February, Greece\u2019s new finance minister told us that \u201cIf I weren\u2019t scared, I\u2019d be awfully dangerous.\u201d Today\u2019s NYT profile shows that he\u2019s now even more worried about the situation. Reuters is reporting that Greece has suggested bringing in a transaction tax on bank customers: GREEK GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED IMPOSING A BANKING TRANSACTION TAX IN TALKS WITH EU/IMF LENDERS - SOURCES There were reports earlier this month that Greece could impose a small levy when people accessed their accounts, to deter a bank run and to raise funds. The New York Times has just published a profile of Yanis Varoufakis today, which gives a detailed, sympathetic picture of the challenges facing Greece\u2019s finance minister. I think it\u2019s appearing in next Saturday\u2019s NYT magazine; but we can read it now. Here\u2019s a flavour: Imagine that President Obama had, instead of picking Timothy Geithner to be his Treasury secretary in the midst of the financial crisis, appointed a progressive academic economist like Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz, only edgier and funnier, someone who had spoken out scathingly against bank bailouts, freely expressing himself however he wanted on television and in public debates because he wasn\u2019t running for office.... The interview begins with Varoufakis showing frustration with his European colleagues over their refusal to cut a new deal: The Greek finance minister had just returned to Athens from a hopscotch tour of European capitals, during which he warned his fellow European leaders that they faced a Continental crisis: If they didn\u2019t lend money to his ailing country soon, Greece might end up forced to leave the eurozone. And yet Greece wouldn\u2019t accept many of the conditions they were demanding in return. He sounded angry. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I will accept another package of economic policies that perpetuate this same crisis. This is not what I was elected for.\u201d He would resign, he said, rather than push the Greek people deeper into economic despair: \u201cIt\u2019s not good for Europe, and it\u2019s not good for Greece.\u201d And the Marxist professor (surprisingly?) even compared his challenge to Conservative PM Margaret Thatcher: From the European point of view, Greece has no right at all to argue about reforms, so utterly did previous governments, after torpedoing their own economy, fail to implement them over the past five years. But Varoufakis and Syriza regard their election as a sort of \u201cDay Zero\u201d for Greece. \u201cWe are the guys who spent all our lives in Syntagma Square outside my office protesting what the people inside my office were doing,\u201d Varoufakis said. \u201cWe were being bombarded with gas, because we didn\u2019t see how we could repay a loan under the circumstances.\u201d He compared himself to Margaret Thatcher, elected in 1979 in opposition to the welfare state. \u201cHow intelligent is it to blame Margaret Thatcher for the postwar corporatism that came before her?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot much. So what we have here is a serious case of deeply rooted racism that all Greeks are the same, that whether or not they protested the bailout, they are still responsible for it.\u201d Worth a read: A Finance Minister Fit for a Greek Tragedy? Over in Athens there is mounting speculation that prime minister Alexis Tsipras is struggling to control his increasingly fractious far left Syriza party. Helena Smith reports There are growing suggestions in Athens this morning that Alexis Tsipras may soon be dealing with a full-scale mutiny within the ranks of his radical left party. Last night, John Milios, the party\u2019s chief economist who played a leading role in drawing up Syriza\u2019s manifesto, spoke excoriatingly of the concessions the government was now making to strike a deal with lenders. \u201cWe have to help Syriza stay with its pre-election commitments,\u201d he told a gathering of leftist dissidents in Athens before exerting heavy criticism of the strategy pursued by finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. \u201cThe party can\u2019t have its feet in two boats.\u201d Default, he added, would be preferable and would not have any bearing on Greece\u2019s place in the euro zone. Tsipras was forced to address his parliamentary group for over five hours yesterday with increasingly divisive MPs arguing that a split from the eurozone, and a return to the drachma, would be infinitely more sensible than years of \u201cdead-end austerity.\u201d The infighting is such that even if a deal is eventually reached with creditors there are real \u2013 and growing questions - over the ability of the government to enforce it. \u201cIf he can\u2019t get it through [parliament], and his people don\u2019t vote for it, we will have a serious crisis,\u201d the New Democracy MP Anna Assimakopoulou told me. \u201cFailure to support it will bring up questions of implementation and the stability of the political system. I don\u2019t think lenders are going to give up money if they think the government is going to fall,\u201d added Assimakopoulou, a shadow finance minister for the main opposition New Democracy. \u201cThe big question is can Tsipras strike a deal inside his own party when so many are now speaking openly about the benefits of going back to the drachma? Personally, I seriously doubt that they can find an internal, workable compromise.\u201d Syriza\u2019s militant Left Platform, lead by energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, has also been racheting up the pressure. On Tuesday, the radicals\u2019 news portal, ISKRA, lashed out at the concessions being made in a story headlined \u201clenders are preparing plans for the unprecedented submission of the country.\u201d \u201cThey are preparing ultimatums of the kind \u201ctake it or leave it,\u201d it said, adding that the debt-stricken country was being economically asphyxiated to force its hand. It added: \u201cAn agreement with the \u201cinstitutions will either comply with the government\u2019s programme or it can\u2019t happen, and it that case it won\u2019t happen.\u201d The risk of Greece freezing bank accounts and imposing restrictions on the movement of money has \u201cmaterially increased\u201d in the last few weeks, rating agency Moody\u2019s has just warned. Moody\u2019s fears that the outlook for the Greek banking sector is \u201cnegative\u201d, due to the \u201csignificant deterioration in banks\u2019 funding and liquidity\u201d. Moody\u2019s says: The outlook for the Greek banking system is negative, primarily reflecting the acute deterioration in Greek banks\u2019 funding and liquidity, says Moody\u2019s Investors Service in a new report published recently. These pressures are unlikely to ease over the next 12-18 months and there is a high likelihood of an imposition of capital controls and a deposit freeze. They also warns that Greece\u2019s banks will remain dependent on central bank help for some time: Moody\u2019s notes that significant deposit outflows of more than \u20ac30 billion since December 2014 have increased banks\u2019 dependence on central bank funding. In our view, the banks are likely to remain highly dependent on central bank funding, as ongoing uncertainty regarding Greece\u2019s support programme continues to compromise depositors\u2019 confidence. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has now published a transcript of his interview with Die Zeit (see earlier post). It shows Varoufakis described Wolfgang Schauble as a \u201clegendary\u201d figure...although one whose view of the crisis should be challenged. And although he does believe the German finance minister makes mistakes, Varoufakis had the grace to admit the feeling is mutual. 1. If you would explain to a teenager, maybe your own daughter, what your relationship to the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble looks like \u2013 what would you tell her? YV: I would tell my daughter that it is, from my perspective, a multi-layered relationship. There is a sense of awe that I feel from meeting with a legendary figure whose work I have been following critically for decades. Then there is a strong urge to counter his overarching approach to common problems regarding Europe. Additionally, there is some frustration at not having the opportunity to discuss in a different setting; to stage these meetings in a proper federal, democratic context in which arguments, rather than relative power, would play a more prominent role. 2. What are the European topics you probably could agree on with Mr Sch\u00e4uble? YV: That Europe needs a political union and that, without it, our monetary union is problematic. 3. Do you think Mr Sch\u00e4uble makes mistakes in his analysis of the Greek situation? If yes, which ones? YV: Yes I do (as I am sure he thinks that I err in my analysis). Primarily, he associates past Greek governments with the Greek people; as if the former reflect the character of the latter. And he does not appreciate how helpful it would be for mainstream Northern Europe to find a modus vivendi with a movement (like SYRIZA in Greece) which may be very critical of European institutions but which is profoundly pro-European and eager to help bring Europe closer together. Investors just paid for the privilege of lending money to Portugal, suggesting investors aren\u2019t panicking about an anti-austerity government winning power this autumn. The Lisbon debt agency just sold \u20ac300m of six-month Treasury bills at an average yield of -.002%. That means buyers will make a tiny loss when the bonds mature in November -- unless they manage to sell them to the European Central Bank\u2019s QE programme, of course. In another sign of rising tensions, Greek pensioners are holding an anti-austerity protest in Athens, against cuts to welfare and healthcare. The demonstration, which looks peaceful, could be a taste of what\u2019s to come if Greece is forced to implement more cutbacks by its lenders. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has apparently told a German newspaper that his counterpart, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, makes mistakes in his analysis of Greece. Reuters reports: The left-wing economist, asked by Die Zeit in excerpts of an interview to be published on Thursday whether the conservative finance German minister commits such mistakes, answered: \u201cYes, he does.\u201d Varoufakis added: \u201cIt is frustrating that we are not able to speak with each other in a context where arguments count more than relative power.\u201d That\u2019s the difference between politics and academia, I guess. It\u2019s not clear which particularly errors Varoufakis has in mind. These comments may not improve relations between Athens and Berlin at this critical time. A second Greek government representative has now declared that Athens will miss its \u20ac305m repayment to the IMF early next month, unless a deal is reached. Thanassis Petrakos, Syriza\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, echoed Nikos Filis\u2019s comments this morning, on Star TV. Petrakos also argued that Greece wouldn\u2019t suffer if it failed to pay up, according to Twitter user The Greek Analyst who tweeted the key points: Britain\u2019s central bank can\u2019t agree whether wage are going to rise strongly, or not. The Bank of England also believes UK economic growth will accelerate this quarter, after slowing to just 0.3% in the first three months of 2015. The minutes say: The Committee judged that GDP growth would pick up in Q2 to close to its historical average rate, supported by the boost to real incomes from the fall in food, energy and other import prices, and would continue to grow at, or just a little below, historical average rates throughout the forecast period. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee was unanimous in voting to leave interest rates unchanged this month, according to the minutes of the meeting which were just released. However, the decision of whether to hold or raise Bank Rate was \u201cfinely balanced\u201d for two MPC members. That\u2019s probably Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, who recently stopped voting for a rate rise once they realised that inflation was falling really quite sharply (to -0.1% last month). The minutes also show that the MPC is confident that borrowing costs will rise in the medium term, having been pegged at 0.5% since March 2009: While there was a range of views over the most likely future path for Bank Rate, all members agreed that it was more likely than not that Bank Rate would rise over the three-year forecast period. The minutes are online here: Europe\u2019s stock markets are rather becalmed this morning, as the Greek crisis continues to worry traders. Most of the major indices are slightly in the red: The Athens stock market has also dipped, down 0.2% in early trading. Stan Shamu of IG says: Unfortunately Greece remained a thorn with no positive developments and reduced expectations of a swift solution. In London, Burberry\u2019s share have slid 4% after the fashion chain cut its profit forecasts for 2016 and blamed currency fluctuations. It was a better day in Japan, where the Nikkei touched a 15-year high. That followed the news that the Japanese economy grew by 0.6% in the last quarter (an annualised rate of 2.4%). That beat expectations, and also outperformed the US, the UK and the eurozone. We\u2019re making progress with Greece, but we\u2019re not there yet. That\u2019s the message from Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, this morning. Speaking in Paris a few moments ago, Moscovici said that negotiations are advancing, but they need to accelerate. Worryingly, he also warns that pensions and labour market issues remain unresolved -- those are the red lines which Greece is sticking to. EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS TALKS OVER GREECE HAVE PRODUCED MORE RESULTS OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS THAN THE PREVIOUS MONTHS EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS THERE IS IMPORTANT PROGRESS ON GREECE BUT WE ARE NOT THERE YET, STILL BIG GAPS ON PENSION AND LABOUR ISSUES EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS WE MUST ACCELERATE TALKS ON GREECE, NEED TO REACH DEAL IN NEXT FEW WEEKS, IT\u2019S POSSIBLE TO DO IT EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS THERE IS NO PLAN B ON GREECE, MUST STAY IN EURO ZONE Greece\u2019s governing Syriza party has called a rally in Paris tonight, to show support for Athens in its battle with its creditors. The event, at 18:30 in Republic Square, will call on Greece\u2019s lenders to respect its \u201cred lines\u201d; the promises on pensions and labour market reforms, ahead of an EU summit tomorrow in Riga, Latvia. That summit meeting will be \u201ca decisive meeting in the political confrontation between austerity and social justice, between neo-liberalism and democracy in Europe\u201d, they say. More details here. Investors are bracing for Greece to miss its \u20ac305m repayment to the IMF on June 5, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. In Europe this morning indications are that, while there has been progress in negotiations, Greece will miss its June debt payment to the IMF unless a deal is reached by the end of May. Concessions for Greece are highly unlikely - the EU will almost certainly face a second revolt in the form of Portugal\u2019s ascendant socialists if any are afforded to Athens. Portugal holds a general election this autumn, and opinion polls show the opposition Socialists holding a small lead. Their leader, Antonio Costa, has vowed to reverse the austerity measures imposed since its 2011 bailout, suggesting the eurozone crisis could flare again soon..... The foreign-exchange rigging scandal took another twist this morning. Swiss bank UBS revealed it had dodged being prosecuted by the US Department of Justice...because it blew the whistle that traders had been conspiring to fix the rates at which currencies were changing hands. Other banks could be hit with big fines today, as City editor Jill Treanor explains: The announcement from UBS signals that the US DoJ is preparing to impose punishments on other banks \u2013 including Barclays and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 as soon as Wednesday. Barclays is also awaiting punishment from the FCA and has already prepared the ground for penalties of as much as \u00a32bn. The punishments, also expected on two US banks, could result in total penalties of over \u00a33bn and require the banks to plead guilty to offences relating to manipulating foreign exchange markets \u2013 a sanction rarely imposed by the DoJ The euro fell sharply following the warning that Greece could miss its repayment to the IMF on June 5. It hit a two week low against the US dollar at $1.107. Greece will prioritise pensions and wages rather than repaying the IMF, if creditors don\u2019t unlock some of the \u20ac7.2bn in outstanding bailout funds, added Nikos Filis. \u201cThere is no money for the foreign (lenders) when they have not given us any funds for a year...We don\u2019t have it to make the payment and this is part of the discussion.\u201d The Greek government has warned that it will miss its next repayment to the International Monetary Fund unless a deal is reached soon. Nikos Filis, the government\u2019s parliamentary speaker, raised the stakes in its negotiations with its lenders this morning. He told the ANT1 TV station that the IMF won\u2019t get the \u20ac305m due in a fortnight\u2019s time, unless creditors have unlocked some bailout funds. \u201cNow is the moment that negotiations are coming to a head. Now is the moment of truth, on June 5. \u201cIf there is no deal by then that will address the current funding problem, they won\u2019t get any money.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Filis\u2019s comments could reverberate around the European Central Bank\u2019s HQ in Frankfurt, as the governing council meets to discuss the crisis. This echo a warning from Greece\u2019s Labour minister Panos Skourletis. As we covered in Tuesday\u2019s liveblog, Skourletis warned that \u201cthings will be difficult\u201d if Greece hits June without a deal. A glance at Greece\u2019s repayment schedule confirms that June will be very sticky unless the two sides have reached agreement.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The European Central Bank will hold the fate of Greece\u2019s banking system in its hands today. The 25 members of the ECB\u2019s governing council will discuss whether to keep pumping emergency liquidity into Greek banks to keep them afloat. They might decide to impose a higher haircut on the assets provided by the Bank of Greece in return for this support. According to the Financial Times, this is a serious possibility: It is possible that two thirds of the council will support the move as soon as the Wednesday vote. The haircuts were lowered last year after Greece returned to capital markets. The council is considering returning to the levels applied before the reduction, according to two people familiar with the matter. This would lower the level of collateral held by Greek banks eligible for emergency loans from \u20ac95bn to \u20ac88bn and is viewed by insiders as a relatively incremental shift. At the moment, Greek banks can access \u20ac80bn of liquidity. The ECB could even cut the emergency liquidity scheme off altogether, if it reckons Greece simply poses too much risk to the rest of the eurosystem. That would be the nuclear option, though, and take the central bank even further into political considerations. Does it really want to be responsible for the break-up of the single currency? The decision is expected this afternoon. Also coming up today... Some of the world\u2019s biggest banks are expected to be fined billions of dollars, and face criminal charges, over the foreign-exchange rate rigging scandal. In the City, investors will be digesting results from high street stalwart Marks &amp; Spencer, fashion chain Burberry and travel firm Thomas Cook. And we get minutes of the last meeting of the Bank of England at 9.30am BST, and then the Federal Reserve tonight (7pm BST).",

Each week, the equivalent of a year\u2019s global trade in physical goods takes place. The markets are open 24 hours a day, although 40% of the activity takes place in London. This is because of the city\u2019s central position in time zones. Hong Kong dealers pass their trading to London, which in turn transfers to New York before slipping back to the Asian time zone.</p> <h2><strong>Where does it trade?</strong></h2> <p>There is no equivalent of a stock exchange for currencies. Dealers trade between each other, and prices flash up on trading terminals in a wide range of currencies. A price of any currency has to be set against another, say the pound, and they are known as pairs. The most commonly traded pairs are the euro against the dollar, the dollar against the yen, and sterling against the dollar.</p> <p>Many of them have nicknames. \u201cCable\u201d is sterling-dollar because of cable laid under the Atlantic ocean in 1858 to improve communications between the US and the UK. The \u201cloonie\u201d is the Canadian dollar, named after the bird.</p> <p>Such is the size of the market, dealers trade in millions, and often billions (known as yards).</p> <h2><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></h2> <p>The prices of currencies have an impact on everyone, from holidaymakers to companies manufacturing cars or selling clothes.</p> <h2><strong>How did the traders rig it?</strong></h2> <p>As the markets never close, there is no single closing price in the currency markets. But when the Financial Conduct Authority fined five banks in November 2014, it outlined two points in the day \u2013 at 1.15pm and 4pm \u2013 when the prices for currencies are \u201cfixed\u201d. Most of the focus has been on the 4pm fix which is set on the basis of a 60-second trading period each side of the hour.</p> <p>Customers give banks orders to trade at 4pm and if banks know the trading positions of their rivals they are able to work out at what price the \u201cfix\u201d will take place. Through chatrooms, traders shared information about their client orders and were able to influence the price.</p> <p>The FCA found the traders at rival banks formed groups through which they shared information and referred to their teams using names like \u201cthe players\u201d, \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d, \u201c1 team, 1 dream\u201d, \u201ca co-operative\u201d and \u201cthe A-team\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Is this like the Libor scandal?</strong></h2> <p>To a certain extent. The interest rate rigging scandal increased scrutiny on other markets, although the process of manipulation was different.</p> <p>Libor was set using estimates submitted by banks about what rate of interest they expected to be charged for borrowing. The currency fixes are based on actual trades.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-555c90b8e4b0c086d6b71319\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-20T13:56:21.646Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble: FX fines due very soon</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>OK.

While for Vodafone this would be \u201cnice to have\u201d on top of its existing converged assets, Liberty may be more driven by a lack of sufficient mobile assets and the unsatisfactory nature of renting capacity to create a virtual operator \u2013 also Sky\u2019s strategy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere analysts at Deutsche Bank looked at the prospects for <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>, up 5p at 1447.5p being a takeover target for US rival Pfizer.<br></p> <p>On the results front, <strong>Burberry</strong> dropped 91p or 5% to \u00a317.17 as the luxury goods group said its profits for 2016 would be \u00a340m lower due to adverse exchange rates. </p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> dipped 2p to 583.5p on profit taking after it reported an annual rise in profits for the first time in four years.</p> <p>Property shares were under pressure. <strong>Great Portland Estates</strong> dropped 46.5p to 829p as its net asset value failed to rise as much as that of rival <strong>Land Securities</strong>. The fall came despite Great Portland saying it would develop more property than it had planned in London due to rising prices, and also undermined the rest of the sector. Land Securities lost 25p to \u00a313.38, <strong>Intu Properties</strong> was down 7.3p at 346.8p and <strong>Hammerson</strong> fell 13.5p to 690p.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> added 8.85p to 271.55p despite being fined around \u00a31.55bn as one of five banks accused of manipulating foreign exchange markets. The bank had set aside more than \u00a32bn so investors were anticipating a write-back in the bank\u2019s second quarter accounts.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong>, fined \u00a3254m, rose 6.2p to 354.7p. Ian Gordon at Investec said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As part of a multi-bank foreign exchange settlement with the US Department of Justice/Federal Reserve, RBS pays $669m. This is (more than) covered by an existing \u00a3704m forex-related provision, (including \u00a3334m charged in the first quarter of 2015). RBS had already settled with the UK\u2019s FCA and the US\u2019 CFTC for \u00a30.4bn in November 2014.</p> <p>We believe that investors had (rightly) seen foreign exchange and Federal Housing Finance Agency [mortages] as the two key \u201coutstandings\u201d on RBS\u2019 conduct agenda. As such, we see today\u2019s news as an important stepping-stone towards a \u00a310bn share buyback in 2016. Buy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Patisserie Holdings</strong> - the company behind cafe chain Patisserie Valerie - put on 25p to 305p after it unveiled a 45% rise in first half profits to \u00a37m and issued an upbeat outlook statement for the second half. It said it had successfully trialled new product launches, including afternoon tea and a revamped website allowing customers to \u201cbuild your own cake.\u201d It has opened 10 stores so far this year and is on track for a similar number in the second half. Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Patisserie Holdings delivered a strong set of first half results which demonstrated the operational leverage in the business. As well as the expansion programme we are encouraged by the progress made in areas such as menu development, digital marketing and third party relationships. The high rating is justified for a business growing 20% year on year, with added spice presented by the potential for acquisitions. Buy.</p> </blockquote>",

Vodafone has acknowledged that, at a certain price, a merger makes sense. However, agreement on price looks unlikely at this stage and we would treat it as a potential upside, given that shareholders anyway will have to approve it. While for Vodafone this would be \u201cnice to have\u201d on top of its existing converged assets, Liberty may be more driven by a lack of sufficient mobile assets and the unsatisfactory nature of renting capacity to create a virtual operator \u2013 also Sky\u2019s strategy. Elsewhere analysts at Deutsche Bank looked at the prospects for GlaxoSmithKline, up 5p at 1447.5p being a takeover target for US rival Pfizer. On the results front, Burberry dropped 91p or 5% to \u00a317.17 as the luxury goods group said its profits for 2016 would be \u00a340m lower due to adverse exchange rates. Marks &amp; Spencer dipped 2p to 583.5p on profit taking after it reported an annual rise in profits for the first time in four years. Property shares were under pressure. Great Portland Estates dropped 46.5p to 829p as its net asset value failed to rise as much as that of rival Land Securities. The fall came despite Great Portland saying it would develop more property than it had planned in London due to rising prices, and also undermined the rest of the sector. Land Securities lost 25p to \u00a313.38, Intu Properties was down 7.3p at 346.8p and Hammerson fell 13.5p to 690p. Barclays added 8.85p to 271.55p despite being fined around \u00a31.55bn as one of five banks accused of manipulating foreign exchange markets. The bank had set aside more than \u00a32bn so investors were anticipating a write-back in the bank\u2019s second quarter accounts. Royal Bank of Scotland, fined \u00a3254m, rose 6.2p to 354.7p. Ian Gordon at Investec said: As part of a multi-bank foreign exchange settlement with the US Department of Justice/Federal Reserve, RBS pays $669m. This is (more than) covered by an existing \u00a3704m forex-related provision, (including \u00a3334m charged in the first quarter of 2015). RBS had already settled with the UK\u2019s FCA and the US\u2019 CFTC for \u00a30.4bn in November 2014. We believe that investors had (rightly) seen foreign exchange and Federal Housing Finance Agency [mortages] as the two key \u201coutstandings\u201d on RBS\u2019 conduct agenda. As such, we see today\u2019s news as an important stepping-stone towards a \u00a310bn share buyback in 2016. Buy. Lower down the market Patisserie Holdings - the company behind cafe chain Patisserie Valerie - put on 25p to 305p after it unveiled a 45% rise in first half profits to \u00a37m and issued an upbeat outlook statement for the second half. It said it had successfully trialled new product launches, including afternoon tea and a revamped website allowing customers to \u201cbuild your own cake.\u201d It has opened 10 stores so far this year and is on track for a similar number in the second half. Peel Hunt said: Patisserie Holdings delivered a strong set of first half results which demonstrated the operational leverage in the business. As well as the expansion programme we are encouraged by the progress made in areas such as menu development, digital marketing and third party relationships. The high rating is justified for a business growing 20% year on year, with added spice presented by the potential for acquisitions. Buy.",

      "bodyText": "Virgin Trains has cancelled its west coast train services next Monday and Tuesday and plans only a very limited east coast timetable, although talks continue between Network Rail and unions over the planned bank holiday strike. Other operators have drawn up contingency plans for vastly reduced services should the industrial action go ahead, after Network Rail urged passengers to be prepared for massive disruption next week. The track operator and the unions have signalled their willingness to continue talking to avert the strike, after rail workers voted overwhelmingly to reject a four-year pay deal. The pay offer consisted of a one-off \u00a3500 bonus but wages would be frozen this year and then held at inflation, with only a limited guarantee against feared mass redundancies. The RMT and the TSSA unions have given notice of a 24-hour walkout from 5pm on Monday. Talks have entered a third day at the conciliation service Acas. Virgin, whose services were already expected to be disrupted by engineering work across the mainline on the Monday, decided that the complications made blanket cancellations the best solution. It has not ruled out restoring trains if an agreement is reached. Customers with advance tickets for those dates will be able to travel on Sunday or Wednesday. The train operator announced on Wednesday that it was scrapping all services on Monday and Tuesday on the west coast mainline between London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. On the east coast line, Virgin recommends customers whose plans are flexible to travel on Sunday or later in the week, when existing tickets would be valid. On Monday, east coast services will operate as normal until early afternoon, with the exception of services in Scotland beyond Edinburgh. There will be no Virgin services to and from Aberdeen, Glasgow and Inverness. On Tuesday, a limited number of trains are likely to run on Virgin\u2019s London-Leeds and London-York-Newcastle routes from late morning to early afternoon. Network Rail\u2019s chief executive, Mark Carne, said: \u201cWe are continuing to talk with the unions and we believe there is a settlement to be had. I sincerely hope we can reach one and my team will be available all week, and into the weekend if necessary, to find a deal to prevent strike action. \u201cFrom the start of negotiations we made clear that we want to reward our staff for the incredible job they do, but that any pay rise needs to be linked to smarter, more effective ways of working. We can\u2019t bank on the unions calling off the strike, so we are now concluding our contingency plans so passengers can make decisions about their journeys. \u201cIf the strike goes ahead, it\u2019s important that people check before travelling and are aware of the special measures put in place by train operators for people who have already booked tickets.\u201d The RMT said it was continuing to push for a negotiated settlement and would be available for talks at the weekend if necessary, but warned that its strike arrangements had \u201crock solid support\u201d from its members. The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cWe would remind the public that we have been forced into this dispute through a wholly unwarranted attack on safety-critical jobs, pay and working conditions that would seriously undermine the safety of passengers on our railways into the future. \u201cRMT members are standing up for the principle of \u200ea properly staffed and resourced railway where safety comes first and where corners aren\u2019t cut to hit budget targets.\u201d Train operators have been drawing up contingency plans in conjunction with Network Rail, with most expected to issue amended timetables this week should talks not reach a successful conclusion on Wednesday. A legal challenge by Network Rail against the TSSA ballot is listed for Thursday afternoon in the high court. Should the strike go ahead, First Great Western, Abellio Greater Anglia, Southeastern, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry Trains, Arriva Trains Wales, ScotRail and c2c have warned passengers to expect considerable disruption. National Express, the UK\u2019s largest coach operator, said it would be adding 18,000 seats to its network to meet demand from passengers affected by the strike. In a separate development, train drivers at Southern, one of the country\u2019s busiest rail operators, have voted to go on strike in a row over pay. Members of the Aslef union backed walkouts by 91% and other forms of industrial action by 95%. The turnout was 85.3%. Aslef said it would meet Southern bosses on Thursday to try to resolve the dispute.",

      "bodyText": "2009 18 November \u2013 M&amp;S announces that Marc Bolland will join as chief executive from Morrisons, where he increased sales and profits during three years at the supermarket chain. M&amp;S shares rise more than 5% as the City bets the Dutch-born retailer has what it takes to revive the group. Bolland says the job is too big to pass up: It was an opportunity that passed by which I could not miss. 2010 1 February \u2013 With Bolland yet to arrive, M&amp;S reveals it agreed a \u00a315m deal to lure him from Morrisons, including \u00a37.5m compensation for bonuses and shares he had given up and a \u00a34m \u201cexceptional\u201d share award. The large golden hello adds to uproar about bosses\u2019 earnings as living standards fall. 4 May \u2013 Bolland joins M&amp;S with expectations high that he can find a way through M&amp;S\u2019s problems, including ageing customers and competition from rivals such as Next in clothing and Waitrose in food. The chain\u2019s woes are apparent in its share price, which has halved in the past three years. 7 July \u2013 Bolland announces his first set of trading figures and warns that George Osborne\u2019s recent emergency budget is likely to dampen consumer spending. His downbeat comments send M&amp;S shares down, despite the company notching up its third quarterly sales rise in a row. 14 July \u2013 M&amp;S suffers a rebuke over Bolland\u2019s pay at its annual meeting. More than 16% of shareholder votes failed to back the company\u2019s remuneration report but the board holds firm on his contentious package. 10 November \u2013 Bolland unveils his strategy for M&amp;S, promising to spend an extra \u00a3300m a year for three years to revamp UK stores and increase sales by \u00a32.5bn. He scraps a clothing line for the over-50s, scales back stocks of branded food and ditches a push into selling appliances such as TVs. He also announces international expansion plans, nine years after M&amp;S shut its European stores. 2011 6 April \u2013 Bolland warns that higher living costs are eating away at already low consumer confidence. Food sales rose 3.4% but like-for-like sales of general merchandise, including clothes, fell in its fourth quarter. 24 May \u2013 Annual profits up 13% narrowly beat expectations but general merchandise sales fell sharply towards the end of Bolland\u2019s first full year in charge. 8 November \u2013 Pressure starts to build on Bolland as he reports weak sales just before Christmas trading begins. He says M&amp;S was forced to cut prices to compete with rivals\u2019 offers. Sales at stores open a year or more register their first quarterly fall for two years as like-for-like general merchandise revenue drops 2.5%. 2012 22 May \u2013 Annual profits fall for the first time in three years. Bolland slashes sales targets set out early in his tenure, blaming tough high street conditions caused by the stagnant economy. Realism has prevailed. People don\u2019t like targets you can\u2019t reach. 10 July \u2013 Kate Bostock leaves role as head of general merchandise and Bolland brings in Belinda Earl, the high-profile former Debenhams boss, as style director to overhaul womenswear. 2013 10 January \u2013 After grim Christmas trading figures are leaked, Bolland faces questions about his future. He admits that a 3.8% fall in like-for-like general merchandise sales is \u201cnot yet satisfactory\u201d. Persistently poor sales of womenswear are now a thorn in his side. We are very confident on the strategy, and I will be there next year. 12 January \u2013 Pressure on Bolland increases when David Cumming, the head of Standard Life Investments, a top 10 M&amp;S shareholder, says his job is under threat unless the clothing business starts to revive soon: I think the market will wait to see how that range \u2013 which doesn\u2019t really come through until six to nine months \u2013 is going to work. If that is poor then he\u2019ll be under a lot of pressure. 11 April \u2013 M&amp;S reports its seventh straight quarter of falling clothing sales as it loses market share but says it still has the support of shareholders. Rising food sales are Bolland\u2019s saving grace as investors, including Nick Moakes of the Wellcome Trust, give him more time: They have had some bad screwups, but that said, any company can have that, and it\u2019s about how they react that\u2019s important. 5 November \u2013 Bolland pleads for more time after quarterly women\u2019s clothing sales fall again, though not as badly as expected: This is a journey on quality and style that will take a few collections to get a positive momentum behind it. 2014 9 January \u2013 Clothing sales miss M&amp;S\u2019s own expectations at Christmas as Bolland blames rivals for forcing him into deep discounts on fashion lines. M&amp;S\u2019s performance looks bad compared with Next, which had record Christmas sales and withstood pressure to cut prices. We tried to hold it but the market went extremely promotional. 20 March \u2013 M&amp;S\u2019s decline is underlined as Next reports soaring profits that beat M&amp;S for the first time. 20 May \u2013 Bolland misses three of four sales targets he set out in 2010. He says turning M&amp;S round after decades of underinvestment was a bigger job than he had thought. Staff bonuses, including Bolland\u2019s, are scrapped after a third consecutive year of falling profits as clothing continued to struggle. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital said: M&amp;S has consistently underestimated how much damage has been done to its clothing brand over the years. 8 July \u2013 In a trading update, signs of growth in womenswear are overshadowed by problems at M&amp;S\u2019s new website, which hit homeware sales. Bolland faces angry shareholders at M&amp;S\u2019s annual general meeting, including Michael Brown, a former employee: Each [AGM] your promises have filled us full of confidence for the forthcoming year, only to return a year later full of disappointment. 5 November \u2013 M&amp;S shares jump almost 10% after Bolland reports the first increase in profit for four years. Clothing sales were affected by unusually warm weather in the first half of its financial year that hit the wider sector but Bolland says the underlying signs are encouraging: Consumers are coming back to us and saying: \u2018M&amp;S has got the style back.\u2019 2015 8 January \u2013 Bolland blames distribution trouble, mild weather and fierce discounting by competitors for bad Christmas trading figures. General merchandise notches up four years of quarterly sales falls. 12 January \u2013 Standard Life\u2019s Cumming intervenes again to question Bolland\u2019s future at M&amp;S: Marc Bolland has been there for some time, almost five years, so I think the chairman and the senior independent director are probably asking themselves whether his scorecard is acceptable, and they should be asking M&amp;S shareholders the same question. 2 April \u2013 After four years of trying, M&amp;S manages to increase quarterly sales of clothing as shoppers warm to its new range, including an A-line suede skirt. Our spring-summer collection has done very well. Customers have reacted very positively to it and it\u2019s been bang on trend.\u201d 20 May \u2013 M&amp;S announces its first annual profit rise for four years, increases its dividend and says it will return \u00a3150m to shareholders. Bolland hails an \u201coutstanding year in a difficult market\u201d and says he will be in the job in a year\u2019s time: Absolutely - is that clear enough?",

      "bodyText": "The reputation of the banking industry took another hammering on Wednesday as the fines imposed on major banks \u2013 including Barclays and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 for rigging foreign exchange markets topped \u00a36.3bn. The US Department of Justice accused the industry of \u201cbreathtaking flagrancy\u201d as, along with other regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, it imposed a record $5.7bn (\u00a33.7bn) of punishments on six banks. The new fines followed\u00a32.6bn of penalties announced in November for manipulation of the \u00a33.5tn a day currency markets. Barclays was fined \u00a31.5bn by five regulators, including a record \u00a3284m by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority. The FCA will hand its fine to the chancellor, George Osborne. Yet Barclays\u2019 stock market value rose by \u00a31.5bn as a result of a 3% rise in its share price amid relief the fine was not even larger. RBS\u2019s shares also rose 1.8%. The increases came even though the regulators said there could be more fines to come. An unprecedented series of guilty pleas was extracted by the US DoJ from four of the banks: Barclays, RBS, Citigroup and JP Morgan. Swiss bank UBS was granted immunity for being the first to report the manipulation of the foreign exchange markets, although it was forced to admit to wrongdoing in other offences. Bank of America was fined by the Federal Reserve. Announcing the fines, Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, said bank traders had exhibited \u201cbreathtaking flagrancy\u201d in setting up a group they called \u201cthe cartel\u201d to manipulate the market between 2007 and the end of 2013. \u201cThe penalty these banks will now pay is fitting considering the long-running and egregious nature of their anticompetitive conduct. It is commensurate with the pervasive harm done. And it should deter competitors in the future from chasing profits without regard to fairness, to the law, or to the public welfare,\u201d she said. The banks, which have been hit by billions of pounds of Libor fines in the last three years and admit they face further penalties for rigging other markets such as metals, faced a torrent of criticism. \u201cThis sort of practice strikes at the heart of business ethics and is yet another blow to the integrity of the banks. Our pension funds invest billions of pounds in the financial markets and if they are being cheated in this way, it affects every one of us,\u201d said Mark Taylor, dean of Warwick Business School and a former foreign exchange trader. Andrew McCabe, FBI assistant director, said: \u201cThese resolutions make clear that the US government will not tolerate criminal behaviour in any sector of the financial markets.\u201d Campaigners for a tax on financial transactions at the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: \u201cThese colossal fines are a shocking reminder that for too long our banks have had a rotten core. In what other sector would we tolerate the frequency and severity of such damaging behaviour?\u201d Barclays was ordered to fire eight staff as part of a deal with the New York department of financial services \u2013 including a global head of trading \u2013 although other individuals are also expected to leave. Benjamin Lawsky, who is stepping down as the head of the New York DFS, said Barclays \u201cengaged in a brazen \u2018heads I win, tails you lose\u2019 scheme to rip off their clients\u201d. The FCA said Barclays engaged in collusive behaviour with rivals and used chat rooms to manipulate rates secretly. In one chat room, a trader described himself and his fellow participants as \u201cthe three musketeers\u201d and said \u201cwe all die together\u201d. Georgina Philippou, the FCA\u2019s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said of the Barclays fines: \u201cThis is another example of a firm allowing unacceptable practices to flourish on the trading floor.\u201d Top bankers lined up to offer apologies and their frustrations. Antony Jenkins, appointed to run Barclays in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging scandal, said: \u201cI share the frustration of shareholders and colleagues that some individuals have once more brought our company and industry into disrepute.\u201d As RBS was fined \u00a3430m \u2013 on top of the \u00a3400m of penalties announced in November \u2013 boss Ross McEwan said: \u201cThe serious misconduct that lies at the heart of today\u2019s announcements has no place in the bank that I am building. Pleading guilty for such wrongdoing is another stark reminder of how badly this bank lost its way and how important it is for us to regain trust.\u201d RBS, which is 79% owned by taxpayers, warned it could still face further action and has fired three people and suspended two more. Citigroup was fined \u00a3770m, while JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US \u2013 which has paid fines totalling more than \u00a326bn since 2009 \u2013 was fined another \u00a3572m. Its boss, Jamie Dimon, said: \u201cThe conduct described in the government\u2019s pleadings is a great disappointment to us. We demand and expect better of our people. The lesson here is that the conduct of a small group of employees, or of even a single employee, can reflect badly on all of us, and have significant ramifications for the entire firm.\u201d Barclays also became the first bank to be fined for fixing another benchmark, known as the ISDAfix. It is paying \u00a374m to the US regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",

Benjamin Lawsky, who is stepping down as the head of the New York DFS, said Barclays \u201cengaged in a brazen \u2018heads I win, tails you lose\u2019 scheme to rip off their clients\u201d.</p> <p>The FCA said Barclays engaged in collusive behaviour with rivals and used chat rooms to manipulate rates secretly. In one chat room, a trader described himself and his fellow participants as \u201cthe three musketeers\u201d and said <em tabindex=\"-1\">\u201c</em>we all die together\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\">.</em></p> <p>Georgina Philippou, the FCA\u2019s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said of the Barclays fines: \u201cThis is another example of a firm allowing unacceptable practices to flourish on the trading floor.\u201d</p> <p>Top bankers lined up to offer apologies and their frustrations. Antony Jenkins, appointed to run Barclays in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging scandal, said: \u201cI share the frustration of shareholders and colleagues that some individuals have once more brought our company and industry into disrepute.\u201d</p> <p>As RBS was fined \u00a3430m \u2013 on top of the \u00a3400m of penalties announced in November \u2013 boss Ross McEwan said<strong tabindex=\"-1\">: </strong><em tabindex=\"-1\">\u201c</em>The serious misconduct that lies at the heart of today\u2019s announcements has no place in the bank that I am building. Pleading guilty for such wrongdoing is another stark reminder of how badly this bank lost its way and how important it is for us to regain trust.\u201d</p> <p> RBS, which is 79% owned by taxpayers, warned it could still face further action and has fired three people and suspended two more.</p> <p>Citigroup was fined \u00a3770m, while JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US \u2013 which has paid fines totalling more than \u00a326bn since 2009 \u2013 was fined another \u00a3572m. Its boss, Jamie Dimon, said: \u201cThe conduct described in the government\u2019s pleadings is a great disappointment to us. We demand and expect better of our people. The lesson here is that the conduct of a small group of employees, or of even a single employee, can reflect badly on all of us, and have significant ramifications for the entire firm.\u201d</p> <p>Barclays also became the first bank to be fined for fixing another benchmark, known as the ISDAfix. It is paying \u00a374m to the US regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>",

Asked last Friday about a mooted joint parliamentary inquiry into claims that BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have flooded the market to drive down the iron ore price and damage competitors, Tony Abbott said: \u201cI think we do need an inquiry.\u201d Asked Wednesday, after public differences between cabinet ministers on the issue, he said no decision had been made but he strongly suggested the government would not be backing the idea. \u201cThe last thing we would want to see is anything that smacked of a witch hunt against some of our most important businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that this government would ever seek to regulate the iron ore market. It\u2019s a free market. Always been a free market, should always be a free market and there\u2019s no way that we want to interfere with it.\u201d The opposition leader initially demanded to see the terms of reference, but his position has also hardenedin recent days. \u201cI have grave concerns about such an inquiry and the prime minister and treasurer\u2019s stated position in support of it,\u201d Shorten said on Wednesday night, suggesting an inquiry could cost Australia iron ore sales to China and Japan. \u201cIt also sends a terrible signal to customers and flies in the face of commitments to our largest customers such as China and Japan that they can count on secure supply at sustainable prices. \u201cI am hugely concerned that our customers may look with greater favour at our competitors. They have never contemplated a similar inquiry and will make the most of the proposed inquiry in their favour.\u201d He called on Abbott to \u201cput [the issue] to bed, end his dithering ... bring back some certainty to business, investors and customers\u201d. Forrest told ABC radio the big miners had \u201cgone into full panic mode\u201d. \u201cThey flew planeloads of lobbyists into Canberra. I have never seen multinationals fighting so hard against the cause of transparency,\u201d he said. And he linked the issue to separate revelations to a Senate committee on corporate tax avoidance about the big miners reducing their taxable income through complicated international structures. \u201cMy whole reason for doing this is that I believe ... Australians need to know what goes on inside this most important industry ... why they transfer profits away from the Australian economy, why they only pay tax on 50% of their revenue ... these are questions Australians want answered,\u201d he said. Independent senator Nick Xenophon has said he will push for a Senate inquiry despite the apparent opposition from both major parties. \u201cThis talk of a witch hunt is completely overblown,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is verging on hysterical for some companies and some cabinet ministers to assert that somehow this will damage our relationship with China for simply having an inquiry.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The euro has come under pressure on the foreign exchanges after leading Greek politicians warned the country would be unable to make its next debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 5 June without a rapid deal with its creditors. At the start of a crucial two-week period for Greece, the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s said there was a high and increasing risk that the crisis stricken country would have to impose capital controls to stem capital flight from its banks. The first hints of measures to prevent bank runs came as Reuters reported that the Syriza-led coalition in Athens was considering imposing a transaction tax on bank customers. With the European central bank discussing whether to expand emergency lending to Greece, the single currency lost fresh ground against the US dollar \u2013 extending this week\u2019s fall to 3%. Investors are becoming alarmed at the prospect \u2013 fuelled by signs of a split in Syriza\u2019s ranks \u2013 of Greece running out of money, defaulting on its debts and leaving the single currency. Nikos Filis, the parliamentary speaker, said the IMF would not get the \u20ac305m (\u00a3218m) due in two weeks unless creditors unlocked some bailout funds. Stressing that the government would prioritise wages and salaries over repayments to Greece\u2019s creditors, Filis said: \u201cNow is the moment that negotiations are coming to a head. Now is the moment of truth, on 5 June. \u201cIf there is no deal by then that will address the current funding problem, they won\u2019t get any money.\u201d Filis\u2019s comments were echoed by Thanassis Petrakos, Syriza\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, who said the country would not suffer if it reneged on its debts. The comments reflect a feeling among some coalition members that an exit from the euro and a return to the drachma would be preferable to a continuation of the austerity programme, which has seen the Greek economy shrink by 25% in five years. Moody\u2019s expressed concern about the state of Greece\u2019s banking system and said the banks would need help from the ECB for some time even if a deal is struck in the next fortnight. Noting that the outlook was negative following an outflow of \u20ac30bn since last December, Moody\u2019s said: \u201cThese pressures are unlikely to ease over the next 12-18 months and there is a high likelihood of an imposition of capital controls and a deposit freeze. \u201cIn our view, the banks are likely to remain highly dependent on central bank funding, as ongoing uncertainty regarding Greece\u2019s support programme continues to compromise depositors\u2019 confidence.\u201d",

A price of any currency has to be set against another, say the pound, and they are known as pairs. The most commonly traded pairs are the euro against the dollar, the dollar against the yen, and sterling against the dollar. Many of them have nicknames. \u201cCable\u201d is sterling-dollar because of cable laid under the Atlantic ocean in 1858 to improve communications between the US and the UK. The \u201cloonie\u201d is the Canadian dollar, named after the bird. Such is the size of the market, dealers trade in millions, and often billions (known as yards). Why does it matter? The prices of currencies have an impact on everyone, from holidaymakers to companies manufacturing cars or selling clothes. How did the traders rig it? As the markets never close, there is no single closing price in the currency markets. But when the Financial Conduct Authority fined five banks in November 2014, it outlined two points in the day \u2013 at 1.15pm and 4pm \u2013 when the prices for currencies are \u201cfixed\u201d. Most of the focus has been on the 4pm fix which is set on the basis of a 60-second trading period each side of the hour. Customers give banks orders to trade at 4pm and if banks know the trading positions of their rivals they are able to work out at what price the \u201cfix\u201d will take place. Through chatrooms, traders shared information about their client orders and were able to influence the price. The FCA found the traders at rival banks formed groups through which they shared information and referred to their teams using names like \u201cthe players\u201d, \u201cthe 3 musketeers\u201d, \u201c1 team, 1 dream\u201d, \u201ca co-operative\u201d and \u201cthe A-team\u201d. Is this like the Libor scandal? To a certain extent. The interest rate rigging scandal increased scrutiny on other markets, although the process of manipulation was different. Libor was set using estimates submitted by banks about what rate of interest they expected to be charged for borrowing. The currency fixes are based on actual trades.",

      "bodyText": "The British financial trader accused of contributing to a multibillion-dollar stock market crash in the US from his parents\u2019 suburban London home, will remain in custody after his appeal to vary his bail conditions was refused. Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, who is fighting extradition to the US on 22 counts of fraud and commodity manipulation, has been prevented from paying his \u00a35m bail by a worldwide freezing order. He has requested he be freed from Wandsworth prison after his parents provided a \u00a350,000 surety. He denies the charges against him. However, following a hearing in the high court in London on Wednesday, Mr Justice Cranston ruled: \u201cI accept Mr Summers\u2019 submission [for the US government] that until the applicant demonstrates that he has no access to any funds anywhere, so as to provide reassurance that any court in the world would want, the application is premature.\u201d Sarao was arrested last month after the US Department of Justice claimed he had made $40m (\u00a327m) by \u201cspoofing\u201d financial markets, using commercially available trading software to place $200m of false trades from his parents\u2019 home in Hounslow, west London. The Americans said Sarao\u2019s supposed manipulation contributed to the so-called flash crash on 6 May 2010, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 600 points in five minutes, creating havoc on Wall Street. The trader has been remanded in custody for four weeks after his arrest last month, when his bail was set at just over \u00a35m. His lawyers had said Sarao\u2019s trading account contained the funds, but they have since learned that his assets were subject to a freezing order by the US authorities, which made it impossible to produce the money. James Lewis QC, representing Sarao, told the court it was \u201cimpossible and unlawful for [Sarao] to comply with this condition. If it was right in principle to grant bail, it must follow that the conditions of bail [do not make it impossible].\u201d Lewis argued that Sarao should be freed to await a full hearing on his extradition starting in September, which is expected to last about a year, on the strength of the \u00a350,000 already provided as security by his parents. He also told the court that the trader\u2019s parents had offered to put up their home in Hounslow, on which they have paid the mortgage, as further security. However, Mark Summers QC, representing the US authorities, told the court that Sarao faced \u201cexceptionally serious allegations\u201d and had \u201clied\u201d to financial regulators when he claimed to be operating with \u201cbasic trading software\u201d. He added that Sarao faced a lengthy prison sentence in the US if extradited and convicted, as well as the disgorgement of the alleged $40m in profits. \u201cThis is a man with every reason to avoid that prospect,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a man whose attitude to all of this should give the court no comfort at all. When regulators and the stock exchange asked him about his activities he lied about using tailored software to undertake his activities.\u201d Summers added that the scale of Sarao\u2019s alleged profits meant that the \u201cidea that he couldn\u2019t compensate his parents [if he skipped bail] is unrealistic.\u201d Sarao\u2019s lawyers said the judge had \u201cleft the door slightly ajar\u201d for them to return to court after providing further information on Sarao\u2019s assets.",

SSE, which became the first of the big six firms to raise its gas and electricity prices at the end of 2013 when it put them up by 8.2%, said the increase in retail operating profits to \u00a3456.8m brought profitability only back to where it was in 2012.

After more than 500,000 customers left, the supplier had 8.5m accounts, the same number as in 2008, having peaked at 9.65 million in March 2011. SSE\u2019s adjusted pre-tax profits were flat at \u00a31.5bn for the year to March 2015, but the company has announced plans to raise the dividend by 2% to 88.4p per share. It said it would try to redeploy the 172 employees whose jobs are at risk with the closure of the 1,000 megawatt Ferrybridge coal-fired power station in West Yorkshire, which recently missed out on subsidies under the capacity mechanism to ensure security of supply. The company also plans to sell off \u00a3500m of onshore wind farms but expects to re-open a 720 MW gas-fired power station at Keadby in North Lincolnshire SSE\u2019s chairman, Lord Smith of Kelvin, who will step down in July, said: \u201cMarket conditions for thermal power stations have been persistently difficult, requiring us to take the difficult decision we have announced this morning to end coal-fired generation at Ferrybridge power station by next March. The new price control in distribution is driving significant change and energy supply has once again proved to be a highly competitive business.\u201d Matt Osborne, analyst at energy consultant Inenco, said the move would inevitably raise new concerns about Britain\u2019s fragile balance of supply and demand. \u201cWhile the closure in March 2016 will not impact security of supply this winter, this is another reminder that we need to secure further investment in new power generation to guarantee the security of our energy supply over the coming years as old plant comes offline.\u201d The GMB union described the closure as devastating. A spokesman said: \u201cAs things stand, the only thing consumers will get from some of these suppliers are higher bills.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s \u201cdinosaur\u201d culture may be to blame for its declining sales and waning stature, shareholders and corporate governance experts have warned, as a Guardian analysis revealed the extent of the company\u2019s tight-knit culture ahead of a tense meeting of the fast food giant\u2019s shareholders. According to an analysis of public records by the Guardian, the fast-food giant, which controls more than 35,000 restaurants in 119 countries, is run by a coterie of long-serving insiders whose relationships raise \u201cvery big red flags\u201d, according to critics. Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s newly appointed British-born chief executive, will preside over his first shareholder meeting Thursday in Chicago. The meeting comes as thousands of workers and union officials plan their largest ever protest over low wages at the chain. Media have been barred from attending, a move that has already raised the hackles of some shareholders. The Guardian\u2019s findings highlight the challenges for Easterbrook, who has promised to act as an \u201cinternal activist\u201d and turn the struggling company into a \u201cmodern and progressive\u201d burger chain. The analysis of McDonald\u2019s board, in advance of the company\u2019s shareholder meeting on Thursday, reveals that: The average tenure of McDonald\u2019s governance committee, which is responsible for appointing new directors, is 17 years. McDonald\u2019s paid more than $150m to companies linked to three of the company\u2019s longest serving board members. Ten of McDonald\u2019s 13 non-executive directors are from the Chicago business community. Eight of the 13 non-executive directors had a direct connection with a board member before they joined. McDonald\u2019s non-executive chairman, Andrew McKenna, is still chairman at 85, despite being meant to retire in 2003 when he reached the company\u2019s then mandatory retirement age of 73. Analysis of McDonald\u2019s proxy statements reveals that the company\u2019s three longest-serving directors \u2013 McKenna, Roger Stone and Enrique Hernandez \u2013 have been involved in more than $150m of related person transactions, in which McDonald\u2019s paid companies linked to the directors. The payments were legal and publicly disclosed. Last year was the first year since joining McDonald\u2019s in which McKenna did not declare a financial benefit from the company. In previous years, companies owned or partly owned by McKenna benefited to the tune of $81m from McDonald\u2019s contracts. Most of the deals were with Schwarz Paper Company, which McKenna owned and chaired until last year. McKenna, who has chaired Chicago\u2019s White Sox and Cubs baseball teams and is on the board of the Chicago Bears football team, has been named the \u201cbigwig other bigwigs seek out for advice\u201d by Chicago Magazine. He was due to leave the McDonald\u2019s board in 2003, when he reached the company\u2019s mandatory director\u2019s retirement age of 73 (which has subsequently been quietly dropped). He is still chairman today \u2013 four months shy of his 86th birthday. He has been at McDonald\u2019s so long that he has overlapped with six different chief executives. He\u2019s also not the only elderly director: Walter Massey is 77, and Roger Stone 79. Massey has been on the McDonald\u2019s board since 1998, and Stone since 1989. Companies linked to Stone have benefitted from about $64m of McDonald\u2019s business, according to official company filings. McDonald\u2019s dealings with Stone\u2019s main companies (Stone Containers and its successor, Smurfit-Stone Containers) ended in 1999, the year Stone retired as CEO. However, in 2003, McDonald\u2019s began buying supplies from Prairie Packaging, a company partly owned by Stone and his children. In 2007 the deals amounted to $29.7m. Since 2005, McDonald\u2019s has had a contract with Inter-Con Security Systems, a company at which Hernandez is CEO, chairman and 26% shareholder. As of 2013 the deals totalled $9.2m. Every non-executive member of McDonald\u2019s board is listed on past proxy statements as currently having or having had a relationship to a company with business ties to the global burger giant. Heidi Barker, a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s, said: \u201cIt is well within the norm for large public corporations to have routine transactions with companies with which their directors are somehow affiliated. Disclosure of these transactions is subject to securities laws and regulations with which we comply, and we\u2019re fully transparent in our proxy filings.\u201d For a truly international company, McDonald\u2019s executives have a very tight focus on Chicago. Ten past and present directors are linked to Chicago\u2019s failed 2016 Olympic bid; four directors sit on the civic committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago; and five serve (or have served) as trustees of the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago. Nell Minow, a co-founder of governance advisory firm GMI Ratings, who has been dubbed the \u201cthe queen of good corporate governance\u201d, said McDonald\u2019s should immediately move to shake up its \u201cdinosaur\u201d board. \u201cThis board has been a serial offender in overpaying its top executives and inadequate strategic planning,\u201d she said. \u201cThe McDonald\u2019s board is long overdue for an overhaul. The first step should be sitting down with the company\u2019s largest shareholders and, yes, its employees, to figure out what they need to do to find directors who are more in touch with today\u2019s trends and challenges. \u201cThis sort of thing was prevalent in the 1960s; it was not surprising through the 90s. But there has been a lot of house-clearing post-Enron, the financial crisis, and the dotcom crash era. Not, it seems, at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cIt raises very big red flags.\u201d Minow said the 17-year tenure of the governance committee was particularly worrying, as it makes it less likely that outsiders will be appointed. \u201cGenerally speaking, 12 years is considered the maximum tenure. Any more than that and you begin to think of them [the non-executive directors] as insiders rather than outsiders.\u201d Minow, who takes such a strong stance on good corporate governance that she once advised shareholders to vote against her father, former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Newton Minow, said that if McDonald\u2019s were performing well the poor governance could perhaps be overlooked, but not with a company rapidly losing sales and customers. She said the company must also bring the board\u2019s average age \u201cdown at least a couple of decades\u201d. Barker, the McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman, said the \u201cinference\u201d of the Guardian\u2019s inquiries about the company\u2019s tight knit board was \u201cquite puzzling\u201d. \u201cOur directors have wide-ranging professional and philanthropic affiliations, having served at the highest levels of major organizations from around the country. They offer a diversity of subject matter expertise, capabilities and perspectives. McDonald\u2019s has a robust annual board evaluation process. \u201cFor example, there is a new chairman of the governance committee in 2014. This year, two directors retired and two new directors have been named. This year, we disclosed in our proxy that the board engaged a search firm to help identify prospective candidates from a diverse candidate pool,\u201d she said. However, the latest new recruit to the McDonald\u2019s board \u2013 Margo Georgiadis, a Google executive \u2013 is also from the Chicago business community, having been named the highest-ranking woman in Chicago\u2019s tech world. Eleanor Bloxham, the chief executive of the Value Alliance and Corporate Governance Alliance, which advises many of the Fortune 500 companies on corporate governance issues, said it was \u201cabsolutely out of the norm\u201d that a company of the size and importance of McDonald\u2019s was drawing most of its directors from such a select pool of Chicago bigwigs. \u201cIt is problematic when you have a global company trying to make major changes and trying to adjust to changing demands of consumers when you don\u2019t have a diverse board, a board that\u2019s fresh,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving such long service board members can represent a real problem, as they\u2019ve been around each other so long that they may be reluctant to challenge each other. Also, if they revolve around the same business and social circles, they may not want to challenge each other if they see each other at a gala the next day. \u201cIt really is very problematic, and absolutely out of the norm for such a large company,\u201d she said. \u201cThe new CEO needs to change this. This is something that should have been changed decades ago and is well past due.\u201d The extremely tight-knit board is likely to come under intense scrutiny from shareholders at the meeting on Thursday. Some of McDonald\u2019s biggest shareholders \u2013 who declined to comment on the record \u2013 told the Guardian they would publicly raise their concerns. The shareholders will on Thursday attempt to force through a vote on proxy access that would allow shareholders to nominate directors directly. The motion is supported by Glass Lewis and ISS, the two leading shareholder advisers.",

M&amp;S\u2019s food side has been successful throughout Bolland\u2019s time, and helped to save his job, but a group-wide 6% improvement to \u00a3661m in underlying pre-tax profits offers promise of better times, nothing more. Bolland, rightly, is not getting carried away. \u201cWith our new infrastructure largely in place, we are focused on delivery,\u201d he says. It is the reason why investors would be alarmed if he jumped ship now: the job is not complete. Shareholders would wonder if the boss was declaring victory too early, as Bolland\u2019s predecessor Stuart Rose did when he launched a share buyback programme in 2007, just before life went downhill fast Bolland\u2019s buyback is more modest and more gradual. That\u2019s sensible. But he would have done better to copy Next\u2019s discipline of preferring special dividends if the share price runs ahead of events. At close to 600p, or 18 times last year\u2019s earnings, it might be.",

      "bodyText": "The comments from European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure suggesting an accelerated bond buying programme in May and June to avoid the summer lull sent the euro lower but stock markets higher. Investors were also hoping a deal to save Greece could be worked out, with some positive signs amid the usual confused commentary. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.23 points or 0.38% higher at 6995.10 Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.23% at 11,853.33 France\u2019s Cac closed up 2.09% at 5117.30 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.22% to 23,713.26 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.35% at 11,497.7 The Athens market rose 2.59% to 846.43 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 22 points or 0.125 higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on Christine Lagarde\u2019s comment that progress was being made in the Greek negotiations. Reuters reports: The International Monetary Fund is making \u201csome\u201d progress in discussions with Greece over an aid agreement, but it must also consider the views of the broader international community, the head of the institution said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have constant discussions, and are making some progress in those negotiations with the Greek authorities,\u201d IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said at a conference. Greece and its international creditors are trying to reach a deal that would keep Athens from running out of money in exchange for commitments on economic reforms. \u201cBut it\u2019s clearly a difficult situation, and one where we all have to be mindful of the economic success, the financial stability, but also the accountability for the commitments that have been made with the international community,\u201d Lagarde added. Faced with criticism that the institution is biased towards its richer members, Lagarde has sought to show the Washington-based IMF will be tough with all of its 188 member countries, she said. But Lagarde added that talks with Greece also have to account for the political reality in the country, where a new leftist government was elected earlier this year on a strong anti-bailout program. \u201cIf one set of measures is not adjustable to a new political paradigm, fine,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cBut something else has to be substituted for it.\u201d The remarks by senior ECB policymaker Benoit Coeure made last night but released this morning have caused some controversy. Coeure said the ECB was planning to speed up the pace of its bond-buying stimulus programme before the summer lull, comments which sent the euro tumbling. However investors are upset he made them to a select audience of bankers and hedge fund managers rather than making them generally available. Bloomberg has the story here, including the central bank\u2019s response: The ECB said in a statement that the intention had been to release the remarks on Monday as Coeure spoke, and that a procedural error prevented that happening until Tuesday morning. It also said the speech was covered by Chatham House Rules, meaning it wouldn\u2019t normally be published. On a more positive note, the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde has said that some progress is being made in the Greek negotiations. Back with Greece: (subscription required) France\u2019s economy is recovering but its growth potential is still much weaker than before the crisis. This is the view of International Monetary Fund staff after the end of an official visit to the country. The IMF is forecasting real GDP growth to rise to 1.2% this year after almost four years of near stagnation, above the government\u2019s prediction. It added: The recovery is supported by a highly accommodative external environment, in particular sharply lower oil prices, a depreciated euro, and interest rates at historic lows. The initial rebound has been driven by household consumption and exports are set to pick up as well. However, investment has not yet responded, unemployment remains stubbornly high, and public debt continues to rise. Overall the mission concluded: We see a solid short-term recovery, but structural rigidities continue to weigh on medium-term prospects. Important progress has recently been made to address them, notably by reducing the tax wedge on labor and advancing supply-side reforms. However, continued efforts are needed to tackle France\u2019s fundamental economic problems: high structural unemployment, low potential growth, and record-high public spending. Our main recommendations are to: Adopt structural reforms, at all levels of government, to improve the efficiency of public spending and limit its growth to inflation. Enhance flexibility for social partners at the firm level and facilitate the employment of the young and low skilled. Maintain the momentum on supply-side reforms to restore competitiveness and encourage investment, including by removing obstacles to enterprise growth. The full statement is here: France: 2015 Article IV Consultation\u2014Concluding Statement Whatever happens it seems unlikely that any deal between Greece and its creditors will be reached at this week\u2019s EU summit in Riga. The summit is mainly concerned with Eastern Europe but Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to talk to fellow leaders on the sidelines of the meeting. But, Reuters reports: Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Tuesday it was unlikely Greece would reach a deal with its lenders when European leaders meet for a summit in Riga, Latvia, this week. Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister, said a decision on Greece\u2019s debt and reform negotiations would be made during talks with the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. \u201cIt\u2019s not on the agenda for Friday,\u201d he told Dutch broadcaster RTL in a televised weekly interview. \u201cI think it is unlikely.\u201d An uncertain opening on Wall Street has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now back below the 7000 level although it is still up around 0.35%. French and German shares have also come off their best levels, but are still holding on to reasonable gains after an ECB member suggested an acceleration in its bond buying programme. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 9 points or 0.05%, with poor figures from Wal-Mart upsetting investors. Meanwhile US housing starts rose to their highest level in nearly seven and a half years in April, a positive sign for the US economy after recent disappointing data. Another call for the Greece talks to speed up, this time from European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis: There\u2019s a very good reason why Greece needs a deal by June 5th, as Labour minister Panos Skourletis warned today -- it owes \u20ac305m to the IMF that day. But that\u2019s just the start.... The leaders of the eurozone\u2019s two largest countries have both called for the negotiations between Greece and her creditors to speed up. Speaking at a press conference in Berlin today, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande both warned that there is no time to waste. Chancellor Merkel told reporters: \u201cI\u2019d say the talks need to speed up, rather than that they are going too fast, and we hope the relevant forum - the Brussels Group - can make clear progress because the agreement in February was that a programme should be set up by the end of May.\u201d Officials from Greece and her lenders have been talking in Brussels for some weeks, and are still divided over pensions, labour market reforms and the minimum wage. Hollande insisted that European leaders does not want to lose Greece: \u201cWe all have the same stance which is that Greece must stay in the eurozone.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) These comments come hours after Greek labour minister warned the country must have a deal by 5 June (see here), before facing further repayments to the IMF. German chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to prevent a potential rebellion among her own party against approving more aid for Greece, reports Bloomberg. Here\u2019s a flavour: Caucus leaders of Merkel\u2019s party are working on the objectors, telling them they may be asked to approve further aid to ward off a default even if Greece refuses to implement all changes demanded by creditors, according to three officials. Merkel has been calling small groups of dissenters to the chancellery to tell them that Greece leaving the euro area would risk causing geopolitical instability in the region, one of the people said. All the officials asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Over in Athens word is coming through that June 5th is now being seen as the absolute deadline for a deal to be done. Helena Smith reports It\u2019s final and it\u2019s official, says Greece\u2019s Labour minister Panos Skourletis. The deadline date for an agreement to be sealed between Athens and its creditors is June 5th \u2013 and not a day later. \u201cIf a solution is not found financially by then, things will be difficult,\u201d the politician, a close ally of prime minister Alexis Tsipras told the Greek television station Ant 1 this morning. June 5th would fit in with the government\u2019s assessment that an emergency euro group meeting could be called at the end of May to rubber-stamp a deal. Skourletis, who has taken a step back from promises to augment the minimum wage, denied that Tsipras\u2019 far left Syriza party was becoming increasingly divided between radicals and reform-minded pragmatists. \u201cThere is no rupture with the Left Platform,\u201d he said referring to Syriza\u2019s militant wing that represents about a third of the party and is lead by the marxist Energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis. Any deal drawn up with foreign lenders at the EU and IMF would be endorsed by the entire party and approved by parliamentary vote, he insisted. Far left dissidents will be meeting in urgent session this evening to discuss whether they can stomach yet more austerity in the form of further reforms, taxes and cutbacks. Skourletis, often seen as a hardliner himself, suggested that foreign lenders appeared bent on \u201chumiliating Greece.\u201d A new law, outlining labour legislation that his ministry had drawn up, would not require the endorsement of technical teams representing creditors. He told Ant 1: \u201cPersonally and collectively we will not accept this humiliation. Any rejection [of the plan] is aimed at humiliating the government.\u201d Video: George Osborne has reiterated that today\u2019s inflation data is not bad news..... and also ducked the question about falling prices will mean for benefit payments (which are pegged to the CPI rate) News is coming through from Berlin that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to meet Angela Merkel on the sidelines of the Riga summit, which starts on Thursday. A chance to discuss Greece\u2019s ongoing bailout talks, as pressure mounts to reach an agreement. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: A spokesman for the chancellor has said no decision will be taken in regards to reforms or debt by the two leaders. Insiders in Athens are saying it is likely they will reconfirm the headway made by technical teams leading negotiations. Media reports here are suggesting that \u201ca working agreement\u201d has been drawn up and is now the basis of talks which would imply that the two sides are closer to an agreement. Let\u2019s turn back to the Greek crisis..... The European Commission continues to deny that it has drawn up a secret plan to bridge the rift between Athens and its lenders. Reuters has the story: Progress in talks between Greece and its creditors on more funding is slow, the European Commission said on Tuesday, denying the existence of a new proposal reported by the Greek press that would give Athens cash on more favourable terms. Greek newspaper To Vima said on Monday the Commission had prepared a possible compromise, proposing that creditors should accept a lower primary surplus target from Greece in return for tax reform and a hike in sales taxes. The report lifted the Athens stock market, but the Commission in Brussels and the Greek government both denied any knowledge of such a proposal. \u201cMore time and effort is needed to bridge the gaps on the remaining open issues. We consider that progress is being made albeit at a slow pace,\u201d Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a daily news briefing. \u201cWe cannot confirm any paper of the kind which has been mentioned in the Greek press. We cannot confirm the existence of any such paper and we really don\u2019t know where that story has come from,\u201d he said. One last chart.... Bank of England governor Mark Carney has vowed to get UK inflation back to its 2% target. He told ITV News: We expect inflation to be very low for several months. But over the course of the year, towards the end, inflation should start to pick up towards our 2% target. Our job is to ensure that inflation remains low, stable and predictable. The British people should enjoy this period of very low energy prices, very low food prices....enjoy it while it lasts. We\u2019re going to bring inflation back to that 2% target to keep this economy well functioning, to keep the jobs market growing and to bring income growth up. Time for a recap. Economists and government ministers have urged Britons not to panic after inflation turned negative for the first time since March 1960. Cheaper oil and food prices, and a drop in transport costs due to the early Easter, has pushed prices down across the UK. This caused the Consumer Prices Index to drop by 0.1% year-on-year in April. The Office for National Statistics reported that food prices have fallen by 3.0% over the last year, as supermarket continue to compete hard. The prices of motor fuels fell by 12.3%, as the fall in crude oil prices since last autumn feeds through to consumers. My colleague Katie Allen has the full story: Chancellor George Osborne argued that families should welcome the drop in the cost of living (according to the CPI, anyway). This is not damaging deflation, he insisted. Instead we should welcome the positive effects that lower food and energy prices bring for households at a time when wages are rising strongly, unemployment is falling and the economy is growing. Of course, we have to remain vigilant to deflationary risks and our system is well equipped to deal with them should they arise. A raft of City experts have predicted that inflation will soon turn positive again, and squashed talk of a damaging deflationary spiral. Reaction starts here But union leader Frances O\u2019Grady fears that the data could show trouble ahead; she urged Osborne to resist making new painful cuts to government spending. Click here for more charts Deflation, like cholesterol, can apparently come in good and bad flavours. Ben Southwood, Head of Research at the Adam Smith Institute argues that Britain is enjoying a dose of the good stuff: \u201cWe have deflation\u2014albeit extremely mild deflation of 0.1%\u2014for the first time since the 1960s. But this seems to be \u2018good deflation\u2019, coming mainly from cheaper goods \u2013 especially from cheaper oil\u2014 rather than from a drop in consumer demand. \u201cEconomists worry about deflation, but only the \u2018bad\u2019 kind, when prices are sliding at the same time as wages and output. Bad deflation makes debts harder to bear, puts people out of jobs, and can lead to a downward spiral. Good deflation, when wages and output are rising steadily, makes everyone better off. And here\u2019s Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, on today\u2019s inflation figures: \u201cAny relief for households is welcome, but this month\u2019s figures reflect global trends and doesn\u2019t change the reality that many are still struggling to pay the bills. \u201cThe Government must clearly guard against the risk that business investment might be deferred. We need stronger action now to raise productivity to deliver sustainable growth and rising living standards.\u201d Britain isn\u2019t the only country experiencing disinflationary pressures. America\u2019s annual inflation rate fell by 0.1% in March (we get April\u2019s data on Friday). And data this morning showed prices across the eurozone were flat in April, having fallen earlier this year. Alastair Winter, chief economist at investment bank Daniel Stewart, fears that global growth is slowing, pushing prices down: There is no doubt the US economy is no longer the world\u2019s locomotive while China is struggling to replace it and Japan and Germany have long since given up. Central banks seem to be running out of ideas and there is an increasing disconnect between economic fundamentals and asset prices. There are potentially very dark clouds gathering that could prolong this deflation and make it malign. Britain\u2019s inflation rate will soon spring back into positive territory, predicts Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club: \u201cCPI inflation in April recorded its first negative reading since 1960, but this looks likely to be a one-off. Overall today\u2019s reading may be an interesting piece of trivia, but it will have no tangible impact on the economic outlook beyond offering further evidence that UK consumers are enjoying a substantial boost to their spending power.\u201d TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady does not share George Osborne\u2019s optimism - she urges the chancellor to hold back from fierce cuts in his Budget in July: \u201cThe first period of negative inflation in over half a century could turn out to be the canary in the mine, signalling that there\u2019s something very wrong with the recovery. And with the threat of deflation set to continue, the Chancellor\u2019s plans for extreme cuts risk putting the economy into more serious trouble. \u201cWe need a better plan for growth if we are going to have a recovery built to last with a firm foundation for improving living standards. Stagnating prices are not a sound foundation for the strong and sustained pay rises that workers have been waiting years for.\u201d Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the accountancy firm PwC, reckons that inflation could be pushed up as British workers gets a long-awaited pay rise. \u201cThough prices are slightly down on a year ago according to the CPI, sustained deflation is not on the cards. Once the impact of the big drop in oil prices drops out of the annual inflation rate, it will move back up to 1-2% over the next year or so. With wage inflation picking up we may soon be considering the prospect of above target inflation. \u201cIn the meantime, flat or slightly falling consumer prices are good for growth, boosting real consumer spending power. So a temporary period of slightly negative inflation can be good for the UK economy.\u201d Falling prices means there\u2019s no reason for the Bank of England to raise interest rates soon. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Director of Economics, reckons borrowing costs will remain at their current record low until 2016: \u201cWith inflation set to remain below 1 per cent this year, a rise in interest rates anytime soon seems off the cards. Rates are likely to remain low into next year and beyond, continuing to help the domestic recovery.\u201d James Sproule, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, agrees with George Osborne that Britain hasn\u2019t lurched into a harmful period of deflation: Falling prices in necessities, such as food and transport, along with a period of sustained job creation and wage growth mean demand and consumption will remain buoyant. \u201cDeflation can be a chronic problem where it represents a lack of consumer confidence and an unwillingness to spend. This danger is very real in some parts of southern Europe, but is not even a distant threat in the UK. While deflation does cause the cost of debt to rise in real terms, the benefits to the wider economy of a period of falling prices far outweigh any downsides.\u201d For the worst housing inflation, look at Scotland -- where prices are up almost 15% since March 2014. There\u2019s not much sign of negative inflation in the UK housing market. New data this morning shows that UK house prices increased by 9.6% in the year to March 2015, up from 7.4% a month earlier. In England, the market was driven by an 11.4% surge in house prices in the East, and 11.2% in London and in the South East. The recent strength of the pound has also driven prices down over the last year, by making imports cheaper Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, explains: Sterling is around 5.8% stronger than this time last year and the past 12 months have obviously been a significant decline in oil and food prices. The subsequent effect on imports into the UK means that disinflation is piggybacking on every product that we bring in from abroad.\u201d \u201cAs oil prices recover and last year\u2019s declines fall out of the inflationary basket then this will become less of an issue. Another sign that Britain isn\u2019t in \u201cdamaging deflation\u201d - the Retail Prices Index, a broader measure of inflation that also includes housing costs, rose by 0.9% over the last year. Kevin Doran, Chief Investment Officer at Brown Shipley, a private bank, says we shouldn\u2019t read too much into the CPI index: \u201cDespite today\u2019s inflation numbers showing a fall into negative territory, investors shouldn\u2019t be fooled into thinking this is an accurate representation of the state of inflation in the UK. You don\u2019t have to look far to see that there is an abundance of inflation in asset prices, largely in bond and equity markets, with people rightly talking about bubbles in each of these respective asset classes, particularly tech stocks. Over the last year, food prices have fallen by 3.0% and prices of motor fuels fell by 12.3%, according to today\u2019s inflation report. This chart gives a better picture of price changes over the last 12 months and their impact on the inflation date: Here\u2019s another chart, showing how UK prices have risen (or very occasionally fallen) since the end of WW2 rationing: There is a caveat, though -- CPI didn\u2019t exist until 1996, so this is based on historical data.... A brief bout of negative inflation is NOT the same as full-blown deflation (defined as a protracted period of falling prices, where consumers expect things to keep getting cheaper). As Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne explains: \u201cToday we see good news for family budgets with prices lower than they were a year ago. As the Governor of the Bank of England said only last week, we should not mistake this for damaging deflation. Instead we should welcome the positive effects that lower food and energy prices bring for households at a time when wages are rising strongly, unemployment is falling and the economy is growing. Of course, we have to remain vigilant to deflationary risks and our system is well equipped to deal with them should they arise.\u201d We should enjoy falling prices while we can, says Tom Stevenson of Fidelity. Speaking on Sky News, he explains that Britain isn\u2019t turning into Japan [which suffered actual deflation for many years], and this isn\u2019t a return to the depression of the 1930. This chart confirms that transport costs were the biggest drag on inflation last month. That\u2019s because Easter fell in March in 2015, but in April in 2014 -- so transport firms didn\u2019t put their prices up this year. The Office for National Statistics confirms that this is the first negative inflation reading since 1960. This is the first time the CPI has fallen over the year since official records began in 1996 and the first time since 1960 based on comparable historic estimates. The largest downward contribution came from transport services - notably air and sea fares, with the timing of Easter this year a likely factor. Breaking: Britain is experiencing negative inflation for the first time in over half a century. The Office for National Statistics just reported that the consumer prices index fell by 0.1% in April. That\u2019s the first negative reading since March 1960. More to follow! This chart, from ING, shows how inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, hit a record low of zero this year. Incidentally, CPI was created in the mid-1990s, but has been calculated back to 1989 using historical data. More experimental data shows that it briefly turned negative in 1960, when Harold Macmillan was prime minister. Just 20 minute to go until we get the UK inflation data for April. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, predicts that the consumer prices index will have turned negative, after being unchanged in February and March. ING\u2019s economics team reckon inflation will soon start rising again: UK consumer price inflation could fall into negative territory for the first time in the series\u2019 history. This won\u2019t last long though with the BoE expecting inflation to be at 2% in 2 years\u2019 time..... Motor fuel prices are starting to move higher given the pick-up in oil prices. Furthermore, we are doubtful that much more food price deflation can be squeezed out of the supermarket fight for market share. And a small dose of negative inflation is no reason to panic, argues Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon: European stock markets have jumped, following the news that the ECB will accelerate its bond-buying programme in May and June (before heading to the beaches for the summer). Traders are deducing that a weaker euro and an extra dose of stimulus is good news for European firms, pushing up shares in Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Madrid: Newsflashes are coming in that Jean-Claude Juncker, EC president, has denied that he\u2019s drawn up a compromise plan to break the Greek deadlock. He\u2019s also ruled out a breakthrough at this week\u2019s meeting of EU leaders in Latvia, but still hopes for a deal by early June. [As we covered in Monday\u2019s liveblog, the To Vima newspaper had reported that Juncker had proposed more achievable Greek budget surplus targets and a cut-down list of economic reforms.] Greek car sales may be up 43% this year, but they\u2019re still way, way below their pre-crisis peak: The European Central Bank is planning to speed up the pace of its bond-buying stimulus programme before the summer lull, according to senior policymaker Benoit Coeure. In remarks that just send the euro tumbling, Coeure explained that the ECB wants to buy more bonds than average over the next six weeks, to avoid the \u201cnotably lower market liquidity\u201d in late July and August. The Eurosystem is taking this into account in the implementation of its expanded asset purchase programme by moderately frontloading its purchase activity in May and June, which will allow us to maintain our monthly average of \u20ac60 billion, while having to buy less in the holiday period. If need be, the frontloading may be complemented by some backloading in September when market liquidity is expected to improve again. Coeure denied that the ECB is putting its foot on the accelerator to calm the bond markets, after seeing wild swings in the price of bunds in recent weeks. The slightly higher purchase volume that market analysts may observe in the coming weeks is therefore unrelated to the recent episode of market volatility. The speech was given in London yesterday, but appears to have just been made public. The ECB is even tweeting the key points now, to make sure everyone gets the message: The prospect of the ECB buying even more government bonds in May and June has sent the euro tumbling by more than one cent against the US dollar, to $1.1195: Car sales across Europe have risen for the 20th month running, helped by a remarkable boom in demand in Greece. Industry body ACEA has reported that new passenger registrations in the EU rose by 6.9% year-on-year in April, as the pick-up in consumer spending continues. The recovery looks broad-based. ACEA says: All major markets contributed positively to the overall expansion, especially Italy (+24.2%), which posted double\u2010digit growth, followed by Germany (+6.3%), the UK (+5.1%), Spain (+3.2%) and France (+2.3%) that also performed better than in April 2014. The data also shows that 7,801 new cars were bought in Greece last month, a 43% jump on the 5,444 sold in April 2014. Analysts have suggested some nervous Greeks are taking money out of the banks, and buying cars, in case the country should plunge out of the eurozone or implement capital controls. As Mehreen Khan wrote in the Telegraph last week: Despite depreciating in value quite quickly, cars are still a handy asset to own because they can be put to productive use - especially if the alternative is just stashing your money under a mattress. In a strange irony of Greece\u2019s woes, German industry is perversely one of the main beneficiaries of the country\u2019s banking collapse. Greek consumers, like many of their fellow Europeans, buy German cars more than any other brand. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank has made a dramatic intervention into the debate over Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, revealing it might quit the City if the UK left the EU. This makes Deutsche, which employs 8,000 people in the UK, the first financial company to formally say it could shift its operations overseas in the event of Brexit. Last night, Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was grilled about the country\u2019s bailout negotiations in a live TV interview on Star TV. Here are the key points, in case you missed it: On the timing of any deal with creditors: \u201cI think we are very close....Let\u2019s say (it\u2019s a matter) of about a week.\u201d What would happen if Greece couldn\u2019t repay both the IMF and its pensions? \u201cI assure you that if we face a dilemma between paying a creditor who refuses to sign an agreement with us and a pensioner, we will pay the pensioner.....I hope we will be able to pay both.\u201d Who is to blame for Greece\u2019s liquidity squeeze? \u201cThe lack of liquidity is neither the choice nor the responsibility of the Greek government. It is a tough negotiating tactic of our partners, and I do not know whether everybody in Europe feels proud of it.\u201d Should Greece hold a referendum? \u201cIt would be unfair for Greek citizens to have to take a position on such a matter, answering with either a yes or a no.\u201d Enikos, which broadcast a live translation, tweeted some key points: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s headline inflation rate may turn negative for the first time in half a century. The cost of living has been unchanged for the last two months, but economists reckon it could actually have fallen in April, thanks to the cheaper oil and fuel. We find out at 9.30am BST, when the Office for National Statistics publishes the latest Consumer Prices Index data. Here\u2019s our preview: Greece is also dominating the attention again, on hopes that it could yet find a compromise with its lenders before running out of cash reserves. Last night, prime minister Alexis Tsipras claimed that a breakthrough was close, sentiments echoed by his finance minister in a late night TV interview (more on that shortly): And although reports that EC president Jean-Claude Juncker was working on a compromise deal were denied (although not very robustly) yesterday, they did raise hopes that the two sides could make enough progress to unlock some bailout funds. But tensions are rising in Athens. Later today, a group of prominent left-wing politicians from Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party will hold a meeting to argue that Greece must \u2018rupture\u2019 with its lenders, and possibly leave the euro. In a statement released yesterday, they declare said: With a suspension of repayments [of the debt], measures that restrict the \u201cfreedom\u201d of capital flight, governmental control over the banks, taxation of capital and of the rich for the financing of pro-people measures, support of this policy with any and all possible means, and with the possible break from the EMU. We also find out if the Greek crisis is hitting German economic sentiment, when the ZEW index is released at 11am. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to inch higher. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls: FTSE 6982, up 13 points DAX 11653, up 59 points CAC 5030, up 18 points IBEX 11384, up 39 points MIB 23280, up 82 points We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day....",

Important progress has recently been made to address them, notably by reducing the tax wedge on labor and advancing supply-side reforms. However, continued efforts are needed to tackle France\u2019s fundamental economic problems: high structural unemployment, low potential growth, and record-high public spending.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has delivered its first increase in profits since 2011 as a result of strong food sales and the first signs of an upturn in fashion sales and is planning to hand back \u00a3150m to shareholders. The chain, which has been struggling with tough competition in its clothing business for years, unveiled full-year profits of \u00a3661m, up 6% on a year ago, and pointed to less discounting, better deals with suppliers and tight control of capital spending for the improvement. However, the annual profit is still well short of the \u00a31bn reported in 1998 and 2008. Marc Bolland, the chief executive who has been under acute pressure to provide evidence of a turnaround in the group\u2019s fortunes, said he was very pleased with the performance. He said the company\u2019s food business had enjoyed an \u201coutstanding year in a difficult market\u201d and that M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and homewares division had significantly increased its profit margins even though sales of those ranges remained \u201cbelow our expectations\u201d. \u201cWe are transforming M&amp;S into a stronger, more agile business \u2013 putting the right infrastructure, capabilities and talent in place to drive our strategic priorities,\u201d he said. Total sales rose just 0.4% to \u00a310.3bn. Clothing sales fell 2.5%, but that downturn was offset by a 3.4% rise in food sales. However, like-for-like sales of clothing rose slightly in the final quarter of the financial year after four years without growth. Bolland refused to declare a definitive turn in M&amp;S\u2019s fortunes but said the retailer had now completed the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d of investment and was now ready to deliver improving profits and on-going cash pay-outs for shareholders. Bolland has been pouring cash into new warehouses and IT systems in a bid to update the chain, which was still counting stock by hand when he took over. \u201cWe know where we are going. This is clearly a step-by-step approach and this is a step forward and a step in the right direction,\u201d he said. Asked if he would still be around in a year\u2019s time to report on progress, Bolland, who has been criticised over the slow pace of reform at M&amp;S said: \u201cAbsolutely. Is that clear enough?\u201d In a veiled criticism of his predecessor, Lord Rose, Bolland said M&amp;S could have delivered a rise in profits earlier if he had ducked investment in new IT and distribution systems or in improving the layout of stores \u201cas had been done in the past\u201d. \u201cWe have chosen to do this the hard way,\u201d he said. The high street retailer is to return \u00a3150m to shareholders via a share buyback and is also increasing its final dividend by 7.4%. The company was able to signal a payout after increasing profit margins on clothing and homewares by 1.9 percentage points, thanks to better deals with suppliers and selling more goods at full prices. Profit margins also rose at the food business, which opened 62 new Simply Food outlets. Results from the overseas business, a key plank of Bolland\u2019s strategy, were more disappointing. Operating profits dived nearly 25% to \u00a392m and sales slid 2% on a constant currency basis, amid political and economic difficulties in Russia, the Ukraine and Turkey. The company plans to open four more Simply Food outlets in Hong Kong and at least six more in Paris, but the chief finance officer, Helen Weir, said M&amp;S was not expecting an improvement at its international business \u201cin the near term\u201d. Sales also went into reverse at M&amp;S.com, falling by 2% after problems at the group\u2019s hi-tech distribution centre in Castle Donington. Bolland said he expected the clothing and homeware markets to remain \u201chighly competitive\u201d. But he said M&amp;S would increase gross margins on its clothing and homeware ranges by between 1.5 to 2 percentage points as it improved its systems. The company is also confident it will improve clothing profitability by getting better deals with suppliers as it cuts out middlemen with the help of veteran sourcing experts, brothers Mark and Neal Lindsey, hired by Bolland last year. M&amp;S is also trying to lift sales by bringing more new ideas, better quality and more stylish design to shoppers as well as better availability of product. \u201cThere could be quarters where [clothing sales are] slightly positive and quarters that are slightly negative, but we are not nervous about that because we know where we are going with gross margin,\u201d Bolland said. On the food side, M&amp;S is stepping up expansion of its Simply Food chain. The company now plans to open 250 more of the small local stores in the three years to March 2017, compared to 200 it had promised previously. Analysts said M&amp;S\u2019s performance was in line with expectations but agreed with Bolland that it was too early to be certain that M&amp;S had turned a corner.

    "webTitle": "Australia's banks have 10% loans in risky fossil fuels, says investment adviser", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s largest banks have committed about 10% of their known loan arrangements to the financing of risky fossil fuel projects that may become \u201cstranded\u201d if the world is to avoid disastrous climate change, new research has estimated. The study by investment research firm MSCI found that the \u201cbig four\u201d banks \u2013 Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and NAB \u2013 have about 10% of their total syndicated loan books allocated to borrowers involved in coal, oil and gas projects. NAB told Guardian Australia that their exposure to the resources sector, which includes fossil fuels, as a percentage of their total is around 1% This exposure to fossil fuel lending has increased by 64% since 2012 and suggests that Australia\u2019s major banks are increasing their involvement in emissions-intensive industries at a time when banks around the world are pulling away, MSCI said. Fossil fuel assets can become \u201cstranded\u201d if investments are superseded by technological change or if governments intervene to ensure the Earth doesn\u2019t warm beyond 2C \u2013 a guardrail that 193 of the world\u2019s nations have signed up to. The research emerged as climate activists launched a fresh wave of protests aimed at the Commonwealth Bank, Australia\u2019s largest bank, both domestically and abroad. The activists want the Commonwealth Bank to distance itself from huge mining projects in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin, which would ship large volumes of coal for export via the Great Barrier Reef. MSCI\u2019s report states that the number of environmental \u201ccontroversies\u201d \u2013 which it classes as protest action or investigations into pollution \u2013 has leapt by 40% since 2011. Coal and gas firms such as Santos, Rio Tinto and Whitehaven Coal have been the major targets for protest action. Emily Chew, senior analyst at MSCI, said some companies were undertaking \u201cfire sales\u201d of assets deemed at risk of becoming stranded. \u201cAustralian banks do have strong environmental and risk management policies, the questions is are these being implemented given this trend in syndicated lending?\u201d she said. \u201cTheir exposure to these potentially stranded assets has gone up while other banks have wound back their exposure. \u201cGlobally, the sentiment around climate for investors and regulators is switching to lower carbon, greener, cleaner economy. The writing is on the wall for fossil fuel companies from the investment community.\u201d At least 11 international banks have ruled out financing the Galilee Basin mines, while a further bank, Standard Chartered, has said it will review its involvement with Adani\u2019s Carmichael project. The $16.5bn development is due to begin in 2017 and will, at capacity, dig up and export 60m tonnes of coal a year. Climate group 350.org has been staging protests at more than 50 branches of Commonwealth Bank this week, in Australia and also overseas outposts of the bank in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo. On Wednesday morning, about 50 activists occupied the first floor of the Commonwealth Bank branch on Bourke Street in Melbourne, where they unfurled banners criticising the potential financing of the Galilee Basin mines and the associated Abbot Point port, which lies adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cWe know Commonwealth Bank are advising Adani so the ultimate objective is for the bank to rule this project out,\u201d said Charlie Wood, campaigns director at 350.org. \u201cBanks overseas have already taken this step so it\u2019s time for Australian banks to take some leadership on climate change and fossil fuels.\u201d The global divestment movement notched up another minor victory this week when the University of Oxford ruled out future investment in coal and tar sands, although it will not divest from all fossil fuels. However, the mining industry in Australia is critical of the push to halt the Galilee Basin mines. Greg Lane, acting chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, said the anti-fossil fuels campaign was \u201csimplistic.\u201d \u201cAs well as potentially damaging Queensland\u2019s economy, this anti-fossil fuel push would ironically have no effect on global carbon emissions, and might even make things worse,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s coal is amongst the highest quality in the world, and extracted under some of the tightest environmental regulation. \u201cIf coal-importing nations like India had to seek alternative suppliers such as Indonesia or South Africa the outcome will only result in higher emissions.\u201d Steven Munchenberg, chief executive of the Australian Bankers Association, defended the banks, saying that they \u201cinvest a lot in reducing their carbon footprint and when making investment decisions they consider a range of environmental, social and political risks. \u201cWhile fossil fuels are a major source of jobs and income for Australia and a big part of our energy mix, banks are aware of evolving community attitudes and would be carefully monitoring Australian government discussions with international counterparts on climate change issues.\u201d This article was amended on 22 May 2015 to include response from NAB.",

      "body": "<p>Australia\u2019s largest banks have committed about 10% of their known loan arrangements to the financing of risky fossil fuel projects that may become \u201cstranded\u201d if the world is to avoid disastrous climate change, new research has estimated.</p> <p>The study by investment research firm <a href=\"https://www.msci.com/web/msci\">MSCI</a> found that the \u201cbig four\u201d banks \u2013 Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and NAB \u2013 have about 10% of their total syndicated loan books allocated to borrowers involved in coal, oil and gas projects.</p> <p>NAB told Guardian Australia that their exposure to the resources sector, which includes fossil fuels, as a percentage of their total is around 1%</p> <p>This exposure to fossil fuel lending has increased by 64% since 2012 and suggests that Australia\u2019s major banks are increasing their involvement in emissions-intensive industries at a time when banks around the world are pulling away, MSCI said.</p> <p>Fossil fuel assets can become \u201cstranded\u201d if investments are superseded by technological change or if governments intervene to ensure the Earth doesn\u2019t warm beyond 2C \u2013 a guardrail that 193 of the world\u2019s nations have signed up to. </p> <p>The research emerged as climate activists launched a fresh wave of protests aimed at the Commonwealth Bank, Australia\u2019s largest bank, both domestically and abroad. The activists want the Commonwealth Bank to distance itself from huge mining projects in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin, which would ship large volumes of coal for export via the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>MSCI\u2019s report states that the number of environmental \u201ccontroversies\u201d \u2013 which it classes as protest action or investigations into pollution \u2013 has leapt by 40% since 2011. Coal and gas firms such as Santos, Rio Tinto and Whitehaven Coal have been the major targets for protest action.</p> <p>Emily Chew, senior analyst at MSCI, said some companies were undertaking \u201cfire sales\u201d of assets deemed at risk of becoming stranded.</p> <p>\u201cAustralian banks do have strong environmental and risk management policies, the questions is are these being implemented given this trend in syndicated lending?\u201d she said. \u201cTheir exposure to these potentially stranded assets has gone up while other banks have wound back their exposure. </p> <p>\u201cGlobally, the sentiment around climate for investors and regulators is switching to lower carbon, greener, cleaner economy. The writing is on the wall for fossil fuel companies from the investment community.\u201d</p> <p>At least 11 international banks have ruled out financing the Galilee Basin mines, while a further bank, Standard Chartered, has said it will review its involvement with Adani\u2019s Carmichael project. The $16.5bn development is due to begin in 2017 and will, at capacity, dig up and export 60m tonnes of coal a year.</p> <p>Climate group 350.org has been staging protests at more than 50 branches of Commonwealth Bank this week, in Australia and also overseas outposts of the bank in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, about 50 activists occupied the first floor of the Commonwealth Bank branch on Bourke Street in Melbourne, where they unfurled banners criticising the potential financing of the Galilee Basin mines and the associated Abbot Point port, which lies adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>\u201cWe know Commonwealth Bank are advising Adani so the ultimate objective is for the bank to rule this project out,\u201d said Charlie Wood, campaigns director at 350.org. \u201cBanks overseas have already taken this step so it\u2019s time for Australian banks to take some leadership on climate change and fossil fuels.\u201d</p> <p>The global divestment movement notched up another minor victory this week when the University of Oxford ruled out future investment in coal and tar sands, although it will not divest from all fossil fuels.</p> <p>However, the mining industry in Australia is critical of the push to halt the Galilee Basin mines. Greg Lane, acting chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, said the anti-fossil fuels campaign was \u201csimplistic.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cAs well as potentially damaging Queensland\u2019s economy, this anti-fossil fuel push would ironically have no effect on global carbon emissions, and might even make things worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia\u2019s coal is amongst the highest quality in the world, and extracted under some of the tightest environmental regulation. </p> <p>\u201cIf coal-importing nations like India had to seek alternative suppliers such as Indonesia or South Africa the outcome will only result in higher emissions.\u201d</p> <p>Steven Munchenberg, chief executive of the Australian Bankers Association, defended the banks, saying that they \u201cinvest a lot in reducing their carbon footprint and when making investment decisions they consider a range of environmental, social and political risks.</p> <p>\u201cWhile fossil fuels are a major source of jobs and income for Australia and a big part of our energy mix, banks are aware of evolving community attitudes and would be carefully monitoring Australian government discussions with international counterparts on climate change issues.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 22 May 2015 to include response from NAB.</li> </ul>",
