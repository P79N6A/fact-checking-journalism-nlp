Lucas is one of four current and former directors being investigated by City regulators over a previous controversial cash raising from Qatar that made it possible for the bank to avoid a government bailout. He is being replaced by Tushar Morzaria, who is based in New York, and was expecting a long handover period with Lucas. It is the latest personnel change at the top of the bank since Jenkins was promoted to take over from Bob Diamond, who quit following a \u00a3290m fine on Barclays for rigging Libor inter-bank lending rates. The former chairman, Marcus Agius, and chief operating officer, Jerry del Missier, also left a year ago. Jenkins has been desperately trying to open a new chapter for the scandal-hit Barclays, which in the last six months of 2012 was the most complained about high street bank in Britain. He has introduced a range of strategies but some aspects of the bank's past are proving hard to shrug off. In July US regulators upheld a fine on Barclays and four of its traders of $453m (\u00a3300m) for allegedly manipulating electricity prices in California. The bank said it intended to \"vigorously defend this matter\" but one analyst warned that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could derail a deferred prosecution agreement signed with the US Department of Justice over the bank's involvement in Libor-rigging.",

Most of the almost \u00a34bn debt pile has been left in the AA, courtesy of a securitisation of the motoring organisation, leaving Saga able to pursue a stock market flotation. Sky News reported Acromas was set to begin discussions with banks before the end of this year about a stock market listing that would probably take place in 2014. It is thought the group would be keen to ensure Saga's customers \u2013 from insurance policyholders to monthly magazine subscribers \u2013 are at the front of the queue in the event of an initial public offering, which might mean reserving a percentage of the shares for them. Acromas is backed by three private equity firms, CVC, Permira and Charterhouse, which between them own 75% of the group, while its 38,000 employees own 20.2%. On 30 July the company announced a 5% rise in full-year operating profits to \u00a3548m. A spokesman for Acromas said: \"We don't comment on speculation.

They are not, however, difficult to imagine. We need only look back to the aftermath of the First World War for a case study. Then, trade barriers were erected, capital flows restricted, immigration controls imposed. What followed was not a halcyon period for the global social, economic and financial order.</p> <p>Reversing the rising tide of information would be an even more Canute-like task. While the library at Alexandria succumbed to fire, it is difficult to see the clouds suffering the same fate.

      "bodyText": "The unstoppable flood of information pouring down on us today is increasing the risk of another devastating finacial crisis. That's according to Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's executive director for financial stability, tonight The Bank just published a speech from Haldane today. Called \"Why institutions matter (more than ever)\", it warns that increased connectivity, closer communication and non-stop info leads to an \"information-rich-attention-poor world\". A world of increased short-termism, and under-investment in physical and human capital, infrastructure, and the environment. One where asset booms that hurt younger generations, and those not yet born - a \"weak coalition\". The whole speech is online here. Here's a flavour: The costs of a significant retreat in flows of capital, goods, services and people are difficult to quantify. They are not, however, difficult to imagine. We need only look back to the aftermath of the First World War for a case study. Then, trade barriers were erected, capital flows restricted, immigration controls imposed. What followed was not a halcyon period for the global social, economic and financial order. Reversing the rising tide of information would be an even more Canute-like task. While the library at Alexandria succumbed to fire, it is difficult to see the clouds suffering the same fate. Ending quarterly reporting will not bring an end of quarterly capitalism. The flood of information seems set to continue to rise, our cognitive in-box overflowing, our brains rewiring. Which feels like a perfect excuse to stop. Back tomorrow, for a day dominated by central bankers (and who knows what else?). Good night! GW Italy's stock market closed in the red tonight, as investors continued to fear a renewed political crisis over Silvio Berlusconi's possible expulsion from the Senate (see 3.28pm for the story). Most other markets ended slightly higher: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons that optimism over today's decent economic data was balanced out by fears over the Middle East: It seems once again that markets are taking a cautious approach to proceedings as markets continue to see Monday\u2019s gains come under pressure, despite some broadly positive economic data from the UK and Europe, which showed that the recovery seen in recent data continues to suggest that economic conditions are stabilising in Europe, while in the case of the UK pointing to a strong recovery. The slow drum beat towards some form of military response in Syria appears to be quickening once again after President Obama appeared to get some key multi party support towards his stance on a response to recent events in Syria. While, even of itself this doesn\u2019t guarantee that Congress will agree a vote for military action, it does shift the balance of probabilities towards such a response, and this appears to be being reflected in current attitudes towards the markets. The row over Neville Richardson's testimony to the Treasury committee today (see here) is heating up. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has issued a terse statement, pointing out that the Bank of England's Andrew Bailey gave them a quite different picture when he testified two months ago: Tyrie said: There appears to be a yawning gulf between the evidence the Committee heard today from Mr Richardson and the evidence we heard previously from Mr Bailey. The Committee will be investigating this a good deal further. In July, Bailey told MPs that he raised concerns over Co-op's capital situation two years ago. That doesn't square with Richardson's claim this afternon that there was \"no issue\u201d with its loan book when he resigned, also in 2011. The Bank of England appears to be seething over Neville Richardson's testimony about the Co-op Bank this afternoon. In particular, his claim that the Co-op's black hole was due to new rules imposed by regulators, not dud loans at the Britannia. Decent car sales from the US this afternoon. First... Chrysler Group, which reported its best August in six years today as truck sales drove the motor firm's sales 12% higher than last year. Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe explains here: The company reported particularly strong sales for its Dodge and Ram truck brands as well as Jeep and Fiat. The sales figure was the group's best August since 2007. The company has now increased sales year-over-year for 41 consecutive months. Four years ago Chrysler was close to collapse, being bailed out by the US government. Ditto GM, which also posted good results today. GM sales were up 15% in August, with pick-up trucks selling very well (more here on fastFT). A rare first edition of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations has sold at auction for \u00a346,000. There was \"fierce competition\" at Lyon &amp; Turnbull auctioneers in Edinburgh for the tome, in which the Scottish author and economist outlined his theories of free markets, productivity and labour. It was secured by an anonymous telephone bidder, having been expected to fetch between \u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000. Simon Vickers, book specialist at Lyon &amp; Turnbull, said: This is such a significant book in the history of economics; first editions do not readily appear on the market. In it, Smith argued...a nation's wealth is not the quantity of gold and silver in its vaults, but the total of its production and commerce, what today we would call gross national product. (quotes via the Press Association) It may be worth checking the attic for any dusty first editions of economics classics. In late 2011, a copy of Das Kapital by Karl Marx was auctioned for over $51,000 (nearly \u00a333,000 today). Italian shares have been sliding today on fears that Silvio Berlusconi could pull the plug on the country's coalition government. The FTSE MIB index has shed 1.5%, making it the biggest faller across the main European indices this afternoon. Berlusconi's allies are threatening to bring down Enrico Letta's administration if the former leader is expelled from the Senate following his conviction for tax fraud. La Repubblica reports that Berlusconi has decided it is time to \"unplug Letta\". Berlusconi's PDL party is a key partner in Letta's left-right coalition. PDL senator Altero Matteoli was asked if Berlusconi's expulsion would mean the government's collapse, and replied: \"Of course.\" The Senate committee on parliamentary immunities is due to meet on September 9 to decide whether Berlusconi should be expelled. Another Berlusconi ally, Maurizio Gasparri, told SkyTG24 that the government was on the ropes, and could easily collapse if Berlusconi were banished from the Senate. It was always difficult to imagine cooperation between parties that have different positions on so many issues. This has knocked 265 points off the FTSE MIB this afternoon to 16,678, down 1.5%. Neville Richardson also told MPs that Andew Bailey, of the Bank of England, had privately suggested that the Co-op found a partner for its ill-fated bid for the Lloyds branches, such as Rabobank. He's basically arguing that he shouldn't be the scapegoat for Co-op's problems, saying the board ignored his warnings about Lloyds and insisting that the Brittania takeover (his big deal) did not pollute Co-op Bank. The hearing is being streamed here. Over in the UK parliament Neville Richardson, former head of the Co-op Bank, is testifying to the Treasury Committee about the crisis that has gripped the bank in recent months. Richardson, who resigned in 2011, said he had quit because the board had ignored his opposition to bidding to buy 630 Lloyds branches. That deal dramatically collapsed in April as a dangerous black hole emerged in its balance sheet. In written evidence, Richardson said: I had expressed my grave concerns and as it was clear to me that my experienced view was not going to be acted on, my position became untenable and we mutually agreed that I would leave. Under questioning, he said board minutes would not include his concerns, but insisted he held \"substantial evidence\".....\"contemporaneous written evidence\" that backed him up. Mr Richardson has been blamed for some of the Co-op's problems because he masterminded the takeover of Britannia Building Society, which analysts say caused many of its problems. He's explaining to MPs that he was convinced that the Lloyds deal couldn't work because the Co-op was already tackling a review of its life and savings business, and an IT upgrade. ITN's Jess Brammar tweets more highlights: Our Dublin correspondent, Henry McDonald, has been watching the joint Irish parliamentary sub-committee grilling of bank bosses (as mentioned this morning). Henry reports: The head of the Bank of Ireland has claimed they can offer solutions to more than 80% of customers in default if they engage with the bank. Richie Boucher said that the \"vast, vast bulk\" of Bank of Ireland's mortgages in default were tracker mortgages, the Irish parliament's Finance Committee heard today. Boucher told TDs and Senators that at the end of March 11,774 of the bank's owner occupier mortgages were three months or more behind on their loans repayments.By the end of June the bank said it had offered a sustainable mortgage deal to 27pc of those accounts - some 3603 customers. He denied that many of the offers of help to default mortgage holders were in reality legal warning letters. The issue of mortgage holders unable to pay back loans to taxpayer rescued Irish banks remains of the most toxic in Irish economic affairs. And the plight of homeowners again illuminates how difficult it will be stimulate domestic demand even while the eurozone appears to be emerging from recession. America's trade deficit with China has hit a new record high, trade data released this afternoon shows. The US Commerce department reported that US exports to China dropped by 4.9% in July. Imports from Chinese firms rose by 8.3%, which meant the trade gap between the US and China widened to $30.1bn. The US also ran a record high trade deficit with the European Union, of $13.9bn. This all helped to push the US's total deficit in goods and services higher, to $39.1bn, up from $34.5bn in June. While total exports, including sales of US commercial planes and engines, dropped by 0.6% in July, imports rose by 1.6% -- partly due to higher spending on petroleum. More details here on the Bureau of Economic Analysis's website. Red faces at Barclays this lunchtime, after the bank linked to a US supplier of bull semen in a regulatory statement on its rights issue sent to the stock market. The document (online here), included a link to www.hereford.com, rather than to www.barclays.com. That took unsuspecting investors to the site of Colyer Herefords &amp; Angus, a ranch who specialise in supplying that crucial ingredient for breeding top-quality lifestock. Asked about the issue, a spokesman tells me: It's an udder mistake, or a bulls-up. Or even both. Barclays declined to say how the error occured, but insisted the bank hadn't been hacked. I'm sure he wasn't talking bullocks either. Opinion poll data from Germany this morning shows that the eurosceptic Alternative For Deutschland (AfD) party has hit a new high, of 4%. That's still below the 5% threshold to win seats in the Bundestag, but confirms that some in the German population remain deeply worried about the euro situation. The poll, by Forsa, showed that Angela Merkel's current coalition would win a majority in the election later this month, although it's pretty tight. The junior partners, the Free Democrats, are only just attracting enough support to get back into parliament CDU/CSU: 40% SPD: 23% Greens: 11% Linke: 9% FPD: 5% AfD: 4% Pirate Party 3% The news has been welcomed by maverick Tory MP Douglas Carswell: Things would be terribly interesting if FDP lost support to AfD..... Reuters reckons a late AfD surge would probably force Merkel into a larger coalition, including her main rival for the chancellorship, the SPD's Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, Were the AfD to make it into the Bundestag, it would make it more difficult for Chancellor Merkel to win another centre-right majority with the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), increasing the chances of a \"grand coalition\" between her conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). In Athens, school caretakers angry about plans to lay off thousands of public sector workers are holding a sit-in at the entrance to the Ministry of Interior. The rally also includes municipal police officers and members of the municipal workers\u2019 union. Kathimerini has more details: Over 2,200 school guards were included in the first wave of about 4,400 civil servants who were transferred to other positions in the public sector recently as part of a mobility scheme. School guards participating in Wednesday's sit-in said that they were also claiming unpaid wages. Elsewhere in the capital, medical staff have organised a rally outside the health ministry: Poland's central bank just decided to leave interest rate at current record lows, of 2.5%, broadly as expected. Irish politicians will be grilling top bankers about the country's financial crisis today, as Henry McDonald reports from Dublin: The appearance of men many see as the financial villains of the piece in Ireland - the head of the country's main banks - is a reminder of the fundamental weaknesss of the Republic's domestic economy. In front of a Dail parliamentary sub-committee yesterday the head of the Allied Irish Bank, David Duffy, came under fire after it emerged that deals offered to help thousands of mortgage holders in distress were in fact threatening legal letters. Duffy was forced to admit that 5,900 of the 8,600 mortgage customers received legal warnings rather than outright help to restructure their loans. Today it is the turn of the heads of the Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank to face the heat and fury of parliamentarians. The Irish Central bank revealed last month that almost 100,000 mortgage holders are in arrears and the issue remains a toxic one for the bans. Moreover, the numbers also illustrate the level of personal debt Irish people remain mired in since the credit crunch began. Which in turn has had a depressing effect on domestic demand. More heat and light later when the bankers are cross-examined in Leinster House today. The Irish unemployment rate has fallen for the fourth month in a row. New data shows that the number of people out of work fell by 3,400 in August. That cuts the jobless rate to 13.4%, from 13.5%. Good news? Or a sign that the potential labour force is shrinking? Fact of the day: Angry Birds* maker Rovio is making a bigger contribution to the Finnish economy than Nokia, which yesterday agreed to sell its once-mighty handset division to Microsoft. FastFT has the details, including this graph showing how software and services firms filled the gap left by Nokia: \u2022 it's a mobile phone computer game, M'Lud. Even the prime minister plays it A profits warning from Ryanair this morning has send alarm bells ringing through the airline sector. The company cited tough economic conditions in Europe, and warned that it expected the European airline market to be weaker than expected for the next few months. Unless the situation improves, it cautioned, profits will be at the low end of expectations. Shares in everyone's favourite/least favourite (delete as applicable) airline have tumbled almost 15% on the Dublin stock market this morning. Easyjet has been dragged down by 7% in London, with IAG (owner of British Airways and Iberia) is down 3%. Donal O'Neill, analyst with Goodbody stockbrokers wasn't impressed: This is a surprise statement from Ryanair and comes contrary to some of the commentary from the peer group and indeed Ryanair's own commentary at its June investor days. More here: Ryanair shares tumble as it warns weak bookings will hit full-year profits Portugal posted the strongest growth last quarter across the European Union, according to Eurostat's new data, with GDP rising by 1.1% between April and June. It was followed by Germany, Lithuania, Finland and the UK (all up by +0.7%). Bailed-out Cyprus stands out as the worst performer, shrinking by 1.4%, as this chart from Eurostat shows: More here Eurostat has confirmed that the eurozone recession is over. Updated GDP data, just released, reiterated that the euro area grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013 (as it reported last month). The figures also showed that exports rebounded, while household spending also picked up. James Knightley of ING reckons that the Bank of England will have to abandon its plan of keeping interest rates at their record low of 0.5% for three more years, given today's strong economic data. Given the strength in orders, rising business optimism and a pick-up in investment intentions and employment hiring surveys we look expect the Bank of England to be forced into tightening monetary policy well before the 3Q16 date that they are currently suggesting is the earliest point policy tightening will start. We are currently forecasting 1H15, but the recent data flow suggests it could potentially be even sooner than that. * third quarter of 2016, and first half of 2015 Here's some early reaction to the news that Britain's service sector reported its biggest rise in activity since December 2006 (see 9.41am). George Buckley of Deutsche Bank: The [PMI] levels are exceptionally high, and the composite was the highest on record. That's consistent with GDP growth in excess of 1% during the third quarter, if we see these figures retained in the September numbers, which I suspect they will be. I wouldn't be surprised to see growth double what the Bank of England is expecting for that quarter, because they're currently forecasting 0.6 percent. - there are clear upside risks to that. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the good news on the UK economy \"just keeps on coming at the moment\", adding: A very strong services survey completes a hugely impressive hat-trick of improved purchasing managers surveys for August. The survey is particularly encouraging given the dominant role of the services sector (it accounts for 77.8% of total output). With the corresponding manufacturing and construction surveys seeing sharply improved performances in August, it is looking ever more probable that UK GDP growth in the third quarter will top the 0.7% quarter-on-quarter expansion achieved in the second quarter. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First, said: One person who will have some reservations about this reading is the Bank of England chief, Dr Carney, who is likely to see expectations about near-term rate rises increase as the economy continues to show signs of real recovery. The surge in service sector activity means Britain's private sector (services, manufacturing and construction) grew at its fastest pace since Markit's 'composite' survey began in 1998. The UK service sector has recorded its strongest activity since before the financial crisis began. The monthly PMI reading of activity across Britain's dominant services firms rose to 60.5, up from 60.2 in July. That's the strongest reading since December 2006, beating expectations, building on last month's strength, and showing the UK economy continues to bounce back. Markit reported that new business had increased at its fastest pace in 16 years, since May 1997 (the month Tony Blair strode into Downing Street). Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said it was a fine result by British service sector firms: The UK service sector turned in another stellar performance in August, building on the growth momentum seen during July. Moreover, the sector\u2019s recovery, which has been evident since the start of the year, has legs. However, there was no immediate impact on jobs, which Markit said was \"in part due to an inability of service providers to replace leavers. Reaction to follow... And the conclusion of this morning's splurge of data, and Monday's manufacturing stats, is that August was the best month for the eurozone's private firms in two years. Activity rose for the second month in a row, Markit reported, with factories leading the way. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: The eurozone recovery is looking increasingly broad-based, with more sectors and more countries emerging from recession. Ireland recorded the strongest growth, followed by Germany, while both Spain and Italy's private sectors returned to growth. Manufacturing led the upturn in August, seeing production volumes expand to the greatest degree since May 2011. Meanwhile, the service sector moved back into growth territory for the first time in just over one-and-a-half years Nations ranked by all-sector output growth Ireland: 57.6 77-month high Germany: 53.5 7-month high Spain: 50.8 28-month high Italy: 50.3 27-month high France: 48.8 2-month low The 'composite PMI' came in at 51.5, up from July's 50.5, which means stronger growth. However that's below City expectations (seemingly dragged down by Italy's weak service sector performance - see 8.52am). And there's good news from Germany too, with its service sector has recorded its fastest rise in activity in seven months. Markit reports that Germany's service sector PMI rose to 52.8 in August, up from 51.3 in July. Firms reported a rise in new work, and in employment levels, as the eurozone's largest economy continued to grow. Firms were also confident about the future, as Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, explains: Germany\u2019s service economy joined its manufacturing sector in achieving an accelerated pace of output expansion in August, helped by the fastest rise in new business since the start of the year. Another increase in services employment highlighted that companies are increasingly confident about the business outlook for the months ahead. August\u2019s data indicated that the combined output of Germany\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors rose at the sharpest pace for seven months, suggesting that the wider economy is well on track to continue expanding at a solid clip in the third quarter of 2013. Good news for the French economy. Its service sector slump appears to be almost over. The French Services PMI rose to a 15-month high of 48.9 in August, much better than expected. Markit economist Jack Kennedy said the downturn was \"easing\", although the overall picture was \"far from rosy\". According to Markit, French service companies are more optimistic about the future, and are cutting jobs at a slower pace. Italy's service sector data is out, and it's missed expectations. The Italian services PMI came in at 48.8, barely an improvement on July's 48.7. That means another monthly contraction, in an economy that is already expected to shrink steadily this year. The City had hoped for a number close to 50 (the cut-off between growth and contraction). Worringly, there was also another \"solid round of job cuts\" across the sector. But on the upside, firms did report that new business was \"much improved\". Key points: \u2022 Rate of contraction in business activity little-changed since July \u2022 New business falls at slowest rate in two years \u2022 Solid round of job cuts Greek newspaper Kathimerini agrees that the Athens government is in turmoil over the latest Troika demands to overhaul its defence companies (as Helena Smith reported at 8.20am). It warns that the three firms could be forced to \"declare bankruptcy\" leading to \"workers being laid off without compensation\". More here. Just in: Activity in Spain's service sector has risen for the first time in 26 months. That may indicate its recession is ending. Data firms Markit reported that the Spanish service sector PMI rose to 50.4 in August (above the 50-point mark shows a rise in activity), from 48.5 in July. Spanish firms reported a rise in business activity, and new orders. However, employment across the sector continued to shrink -- another blow to its battered labour market. Markit said: \u2022 Activity and new business return to growth \u2022 Employment continues to fall \u2022 Input costs rise modestly It added that the rise in new business was solid and the strongest since March 2010. The Greek government is facing fresh demands from its international lenders to close down ailing companies \u2013 this time in the defense sector. This is adding to pressures on the debt-stricken country which already appears to need yet more aid. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Only days before Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras gives the keynote speech on the state of the Greek economy at the annual Thessaloniki trade fair, his two-party coalition government is under renewed threat \u2013 this time in the wake of Troika demands that it revamps its loss-making defense industry. Deputy defense minister Fofi Gennimata, a leading member of the socialist Pasok party, Samaras\u2019 junior partner, made clear that unimpressed with the government\u2019s own plans for a overhaul of the sector, foreign lenders were now pressing the coalition to force three of the country\u2019s defense companies to declare bankruptcy and fire personnel \u201cin some cases without compensation.\u201d The defense industry is among the debt-stricken country\u2019s biggest loss-makers. With unemployment nearing a record 28% \u2013 the highest in the euro zone \u2013 the demand has raised howls of protests less than two weeks before inspectors from the EU and IMF arrive in Athens for what is being touted as the most crucial review, yet, of the Greek economy. The government is already under unprecedented pressure to streamline the bloated public sector by moving up to 15,000 civil servants into a \u201cmobility scheme\u201d \u2013 shorthand for lay-offs that under that name, at least, are illegal constitutionally. German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble added to the furore earlier this week by saying that Athens is likely to need further aid in 2014 \u2013 in addition to the \u20ac11bn euro black hole it will need to plug between 2015 and 2016. Bracing for what many predict will be the most difficult winter since the crisis\u2019 outbreak, the Samaras government has gone into damage control mode launching a PR campaign described by one senior official as \u201cbeing woefully behind the times before it\u2019s even got off the ground.\u201d Australia's economy has now grown for 22 straight years in a row. Data released early this morning showed that its GDP expanded by 0.6% in the last three months, making it 2.5% larger than a year ago. But as the BBC reports, this hasn't allayed fears that Australia's economic boom is ending. Brian Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie Bank, said the latest numbers were a continuation of \"this distinctly sub-trend growth that we've seen over the last nine months now\". \"It doesn't suggest that the economy is falling into a hole yet, but there aren't really signs that we're going to break out of this rut either.\" \"I am ugly, but they\u2019re attracted to the brains. I\u2019m a rock star among geeks, wonks and nerds.\" No, not me (!), but top economist Dr Nouriel Roubini who is reeling from the news that he must remove his hot tub on the roof of his Manhattan penthouse in New York. Yes, you read that right. The hot tub, it seems, was the focal point for seriously rollicking fun. The New York Post reports that Roubini's place on First East Street is \u201cfamed for being packed with hot young models at his wild parties.\u201d However, he failed to get permission for it, and party-poopers at the New York's Department of Buildings has ordered its removal -- along with the deck area and party room. According to Roubini, the models who attend the parties \"love my beautiful mind\". I am ugly, but they\u2019re attracted to the brains. I\u2019m a rock star among geeks, wonks and nerds,\u201d he said. \u201c[What makes the parties so great are] fun people and beautiful girls. I look for 10 girls to one guy. Roubini could drag his hot tub indoors, apparently. But if that's not suitable, we'd be happy to take delivery... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Hopes that the world economy is recovering have already been boosted this morning, by surveys of the global service sector for August. In China, growth in the service sector has hit a five-month high. Data provider Markit (who we'll hear a lot more from today), said its Chinese service sector PMI climbed to 52.8 in August, up from July's 51.3. That eases some fears that Beijing's clampdown on shadow banking had sent a chill through its economy; although employment across the sector did slide. Xianfang Ren, senior economist with IHS Global Insight, told Reuters that Chinese firms remained optimistic: It's still too early to say that the economy has reversed its downward trend, but we have seen some signs of recovery. Between June and now, the biggest change has been in policy expectations, with China rolling out some steps to boost growth. That has helped business sentiment, hence lifting the PMI readings. While in Ireland, service scctor activity hit its highest level in six years. Its PMI (a measure of purchasing managers) soared to 61.6 from 57.6, which indicates very strong growth. The best reading since February 2007. Some of the credit must go to the decent weather this summer, which is credited with boosting Ireland's tourism sector. Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O'Sullivan explained: The principal cause of rising activity in August was the spell of unusually good weather in Ireland and the consequent boost to the tourism sector. Plenty more service sector data to come through the day, so we'll see if the optimism continues. We also get updated eurozone GDP data at 10am BST, which should confirm that the euro recession is over. Lots more coming up too....",

Sales of light-duty Ram pickups were up 34% in August and heavy-duty Ram sales increased 26%. \"Last month we achieved our strongest retail sales in the past 60 months,\" said Reid Bigland, head of US sales. \"All aspects of our business continue to improve.\" Chrysler reported a 16% jump in second-quarter profits in July, driven by rising demand for pickups and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). The company was close to closure in 2009 when it entered bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by the US government. It is now owned by Italy's Fiat, which bought out the government's stake in the firm in 2011. Edmunds.com senior analyst Michelle Krebs said Chrysler's figures had beaten Edmund's 9% forecast and boded well for other car manufacturers. \"That indicates either the Labor Day close was very strong or Chrysler plugged some extra fleet sales into August,\" she said. \"If Chrysler's better-than-expected August performance is due to a strong Labor Day close, we likely will see other automakers beating forecasts as well.\"",

Duddy, the person credited with inventing \"click and collect\" ordering and securing the survival of the quirky catalogue shop at a time when other retailers have succumbed to an online onslaught led by Amazon, has been boss of Argos for 15 years and chief executive of the parent company, which also owns Homebase, since 2006. The group's chairman, John Coombe, said he would look at both internal and external candidates to replace Duddy, 57. John Walden, the current boss of Argos who has been instrumental in driving a recent revival in sales, is seen as the frontrunner. Coombe said: \"Terry is one of the longest serving chief executives in the industry and he has provided strong leadership during one of the toughest periods of economic uncertainty faced by the business. As a result of the Group's exceptional cash generation in recent years, we have the financial strength to support both Argos and Homebase in delivering their strategic plans.\" Duddy's exit comes after he agreed to cut his bonus by a third in June amid shareholder unrest after profits fell 10% last year. He nonetheless took home total pay of \u00a31.6m last year, 41% more than the year before. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: \"A year ago there was much muttering about his stewardship of the group, but the revival of Argos in the electricals market saved him.\" The last few years have been difficult for retailers specialising in goods for the home after the housing market has stalled and cash-strapped shoppers avoided expensive purchases such as sofas and new kitchens. Argos's less well off customers have been particularly under pressure as the government has trimmed benefits while the cost of food and other basics have risen. Many have long predicted the demise of the catalogue shop, yet Argos has managed to survive by leading the charge into \"multichannel\" shopping, offering customers different ways to order, collect or have their goods delivered. Other retailers have stepped up competition by embracing Argos ideas such as \"click and collect\" \u2013 in which items are ordered online for pick up at the store later. However, Duddy fought back by hiring Walden, an American who previously ran the online operations of the US electrical retailer Best Buy, to give Argos more digital firepower, a move which has so far paid off. The Homebase chain has continued to struggle. Duddy said on Wednesday: \"We have achieved a great deal and the positive momentum of the business is now such that I feel the time is right to move onto the next stage in my career.\" It is not clear what Duddy, a retail veteran who also spent years at the electricals chain Dixons before joining Home Retail's former parent company GUS, plans to do next.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's recovery is on track to outstrip the rest of Europe following a strong performance by the services sector in August. The purchasing managers index, published by Markit, jumped to a new post-financial-crash high of 60.5 in August, up from 60.2 in July and its highest level since December 2006. Markit said the latest survey of the all-important sector, which accounts for around 78% of the economy, sent the all-sector PMI to its highest level since the series began in 1998. Chris Williamson, the data provider's chief European economist, said growth was now accelerating in manufacturing, services and construction, and that GDP growth could exceed 1.0% in the third quarter of the year. The broad-based nature of the recovery will encourage George Osborne, who in public has remained careful to highlight the risks to the recovery. Williamson said the latest data showed that growth was principally supported by a rise in new business. Order books at companies ranging from banks to restaurants rose at the fastest pace since May 1997, the month Tony Blair first became prime minister. \"There were many reports of an ongoing strengthening of market confidence which helped companies convert enquiries into hard contract wins. Marketing and an improvement in the housing market were also noted as reasons for higher sales volumes,\" he said. However, hopes that growth would bring a quick end to persistently high unemployment were dashed after the survey of services firms showed a slowdown in hiring. The sector reported a net increase in employment for an eighth month in a row, but the rate of growth was described as \"marginal\". Markit said: \"A number of panellists attributed the slowdown to the non-replacement of leavers or cost considerations.\" The lack of jobs growth will dash expectations that the Bank of England will raise rates earlier than expected in 2016. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last month that he wanted to wait until the economy created an extra 750,000 jobs before considering a rise in base rates. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the services survey \"adds to the relentlessly good news on the UK economy\". He said: \"Following surprisingly strong gains in August's manufacturing and construction surveys, today's services result at face value points to quarterly GDP growth in Q3 not far off a rip-roaring 2%. \"However, this does not necessarily indicate that interest rates will have to rise earlier than the MPC expects.

The Italian services PMI improved only slightly on the previous month following a rise from July's 48.7 to 48.8.
