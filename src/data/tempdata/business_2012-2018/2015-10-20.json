      "bodyText": "The Coalition and Labor have reached a deal to pass legislation for the China-Australia free trade agreement (Chafta), ending an intense political dispute in Canberra and clearing the way for tariff cuts before the end of the year. The breakthrough follows the government\u2019s offer to amend migration regulations to ensure employers have made genuine efforts to recruit Australian workers before seeking them from overseas under a work agreement. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the bipartisan deal, saying it showed the parliament could work together and marked a \u201cgreat day for Australians\u201d. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said the opposition had achieved \u201csome legally enforceable grunt behind protecting Australian jobs\u201d. The main political parties argued the move to toughen migration regulations did not jeopardise the previously signed agreement with China, and did not discriminate against Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner because they had broader effect. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, said he had \u201cstayed in touch with the Chinese\u201d about the proposed measures and \u201cfound that they were satisfied\u201d there was no breach of the Chafta commitments. The proposed regulations will affect the type of work agreements that are struck as part of the proposed arrangements in Chafta for development projects worth at least $150m. The government has always argued it would impose the \u201clabour market testing\u201d as a matter of policy but the Labor party demanded a stronger guarantee that this measure could not be weakened. Robb committed to amend regulations under the Migration Act to ensure that \u201cthe proposed party to the work agreement ... must have demonstrated that they have made recent and genuine efforts to recruit Australian workers in the occupation and location covered by the work agreement\u201d. While this falls short of enshrining the requirement in the Migration Act itself, such regulations could be struck out by parliament, providing the Senate with the ability to step in if a minister changed the measures in future. In a letter to the shadow trade minister, Penny Wong, Robb also committed to amend project agreement and labour agreement guidelines to add extra criteria for the immigration minister to consider in approving such agreements. \u201cThese criteria include: analysis of labour market need; training plans; overseas worker support plans; and additional conditions that may be imposed by the minister,\u201d Robb said. The minister has also pledged to amend regulations for the 457 visa program so that the minister must ensure the terms and conditions of employment \u201cwill be no less favourable than the terms and conditions\u201d that would be provided to an Australian performing equivalent work at the same location. This could include looking at the terms and conditions set out in an enterprise agreement. He has promised to consider increasing the base rate of pay for 457 visa holders and indexing it, as part of a review to begin before the end of the year. The review will consult business bodies and unions. Robb has also pledged to toughen visa conditions to address concerns about the easing of mandatory skills assessments for licensed tradespeople such as carpenters and electricians. Regulations will require a person to obtain the relevant licence within 90 days after arriving in Australia and must notify the department of immigration if it is refused, revoked or cancelled. Robb and Wong reached a handshake agreement on Tuesday evening, before the plan went to the Labor caucus meeting on Wednesday morning. Announcing the breakthrough, Shorten noted it was the first anniversary of the death of Gough Whitlam, the Labor prime minister who opened diplomatic relations between Australia and China. Shorten said Labor had always supported the potential of Chafta to benefit Australians, but had stepped in to secure legal safeguards and protections for Australian jobs, wages and conditions, and trades licensing. \u201cRegulations have the force of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a ratcheting up of the level of legal protection for Australian jobs.\u201d Wong said the deal delivered \u201ca comprehensive package of safeguards\u201d. She said calculating the market salary rate for an overseas worker by reference to a relevant enterprise agreement would help ensure Australian wages and conditions were not undercut in the 457 visa regime. Robb said the \u201cspectacular outcome\u201d restored the Australian tradition of bipartisanship on trade liberalisation, which he saw as \u201ca very positive development for the country\u201d and for business confidence. \u201cEssentially, what we have done is seek to provide clarity and assurance in a number of areas for Labor in regard to the issues that they have raised,\u201d the trade minister said. \u201cThey just want to make sure that some of the measures, particularly labour market testing, is not changed just by government fiat some time in the future.\u201d Business groups welcomed the deal, but the union movement branded the concessions inadequate. The Electrical Trades Union vowed to continue its campaign against Chafta, saying it had no faith that the immigration department, as it was currently resourced, had the capability to enforce the licensing requirements for 457 visa workers. \u201cThe fact that the ALP could not achieve concessions on key areas of job security, safety and sovereignty is of significant concern to our union and its members,\u201d said the ETU\u2019s national secretary, Allen Hicks. \u201cWe are left with little option but to condemn both sides of politics for what has been done today.\u201d Ged Kearney, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said she still had serious concerns about Chafta because the proposed protections did not go far enough. But she added that responsibility for the agreement rested with the government. Patricia Ranald, who coordinates the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, said it was concerning that Chafta would include an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism giving companies an avenue to sue the government over domestic regulations. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said his party would vote against the legislation because such the dispute clauses were dangerous and could threaten Australia\u2019s sovereignty. His fellow Greens MP Adam Bandt said Labor had been \u201csold a pup\u201d and the deal left \u201ca gaping hole that will allow exploitation of overseas and local workers to continue\u201d. China and Australia formally signed the trade agreement in Canberra in June when Tony Abbott was still the prime minister, but the associated legislation needed to pass the parliament before it took effect. Labor had demanded \u201ccomplementary\u201d protections for Australian jobs as a condition of support, but Abbott ruled out negotiations with the opposition and sought unqualified support. Turnbull opened the door to talks with Labor after he ousted Abbott as Liberal leader last month, and the government hinted a deal was likely when the opposition released its proposed changes last week. On Wednesday, Turnbull sought to draw a line under the political dispute. \u201cI described the leader of the opposition on one occasion as just a cork bobbing along in the slip-stream of the CFMEU,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWell, I have to say today the leader of the opposition has struck out from the slip-stream and charted a course that is plainly in the national interest.\u201d Wong and Robb also praised each other for the \u201cconstructive\u201d nature of the negotiations. Robb said he was confident the government would be in a position to exchange letters with the Chinese government before the end of the year. This could achieve a first round of tariff cuts when the agreement came into force, followed by a second round on 1 January.",

But there are two problems with Tuesday\u2019s lobbying document, which carries a carefully worded subtitle: \u201cWhy the European Union is good for business, but how it should be better.\u201d Problem number one is: what if the EU doesn\u2019t get better for business, and what if David Cameron\u2019s renegotiation achieves nothing? Would the CBI still say it\u2019s better to remain in the tent? For now, the CBI\u2019s position is that it wants to stay in a reformed EU and, after a slapdown from the business secretary, Sajid Javid, it is studiously avoiding the issue of how it would regard an unreformed union. But the latter is the interesting business question. One strongly suspects the CBI is a stayer in all circumstances (that was the tone of Rake\u2019s speech) but, until it is prepared to defend that position openly, these lobbying documents will feel limp. The second problem is that the CBI\u2019s confident statements about \u201cwhat business thinks\u201d rest on an opinion poll taken in 2013. How about asking the members, in late 2015, how they feel about both a reformed and unreformed EU? If the answers differ, that would be worth knowing. Mark Price would make a good chairman at Channel 4 A month is a long time in the grocery trade. It was only a few weeks ago that Mark Price was telling the Evening Standard that wild horses would not tear him away from Waitrose. He\u2019d had a few job offers over the years but \u201cmy commitment to Waitrose, to the team here, to John Lewis, always wins out\u201d. Now a job vacancy at Channel 4 \u2013 as opposed to an actual offer \u2013 has prompted a rethink. He\u2019s off to enter the contest to be chairman of the broadcaster and, since he is already deputy chairman, will start as strong favourite. Fair enough, but this probably wasn\u2019t a decision taken on a whim. Why do the undying loyalty routine? Never mind. Price has played a terrific innings at Waitrose, a business that a decade ago was not guaranteed to prosper. The bet at the time was that bigger supermarket beasts, especially Tesco, would steal its customers with their upmarket Finest ranges and the like. The plot developed differently, for both companies. Waitrose has doubled its number of stores since 2007 and taken the fight to the opposition \u2013 its Essential basics range now accounting for \u00a31bn of a \u00a36.5bn of annual turnover, took Waitrose into the mainstream. Few call it a niche player these days. It would be harder to achieve a similar transformation at Channel 4, whatever its future ownership. But Price, the \u201cchubby grocer\u201d as he calls himself, is a rounded individual in the other sense. He would be a good choice as chairman. Whitbread boss departs on a good note Andy Harrison inherited a strong business at Whitbread five years ago and will leave the company in December in the same condition. That\u2019s the main requirement of all chief executives, and a 14% rise in half-year profits to \u00a3291m is a good note on which to depart. Costa Coffee has continued to outmuscle Starbucks in the UK and has expanded rapidly in China. Premier Inn has raced away from its main domestic rival, debt-constrained Travelodge. It is easy now to forget that, on arrival, Harrison was being lobbied in some quarters of the City to chop Whitbread in two. The demerger idea didn\u2019t make commercial sense because, at the time, Premier Inn\u2019s stable cashflows were funding the Costa roll-out. That didn\u2019t stop the fee-hungry investment bankers promoting the idea, of course. Harrison, wisely, squashed the chatter at the early stage. So should his successor, Alison Brittain. These days, Costa is big enough to stand on its own feet but cohabitation seems to work for Whitbread. Stick with the formula.",

That didn\u2019t stop the fee-hungry investment bankers promoting the idea, of course.</p> <p>Harrison, wisely, squashed the chatter at the early stage. So should his successor, Alison Brittain. These days, Costa is big enough to stand on its own feet but cohabitation seems to work for Whitbread. Stick with the formula.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline and five other major drugmakers have teamed up with the UK government to launch the world\u2019s first venture capital fund dedicated to finding new ways to prevent and treat dementia. The Department of Health, the charity Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK and the six pharmaceutical firms have raised $100m (\u00a365m) to invest in early-stage, novel treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. GSK\u2019s boss, Sir Andrew Witty, has been one of the main driving forces behind the initiative, in which the company is joined by the US drugmakers Johnson &amp; Johnson, Biogen, Eli Lilly and Pfizer, and Japan\u2019s Takeda. The goal of the dementia discovery fund is to come up with early diagnosis and effective treatment by 2025. The initiative was born at the G8 dementia summit in London in December 2013. Dennis Gillings, the UK-appointed world dementia envoy, said: \u201cDementia is a ticking bomb and with the global cost of dementia care expected to reach over $1tn by 2030 we must continue to do more. Research is currently not delivering the results we need. We need early and accurate diagnosis, effective treatment and improved care and support to avoid serious economic and social impacts.\u201d More than 40 million people around the world have dementia and the number is expected to triple to 135 million by 2050, but there are currently no medicines to prevent or cure the conditions in question. The drugs available merely ease some of the symptoms. This is due to the complexity of the brain and the slow onset of the disease. Many big pharmaceutical companies have turned their back on neuroscience research in recent years, because it is far more risky and costly than other areas. Dementia receives only a fifth of the money invested in diseases such as cancer. Biogen and Eli Lilly are working on new treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common form of dementia. In July, Eli Lilly\u2019s solanezumab became the first drug that appeared to slow the pace of patients\u2019 deterioration. GSK is giving $25m to the fund, the biggest contribution, and the UK government is giving $22m. Johnson &amp; Johnson is putting in $10m, with the remaining $43m coming from the other companies. Kate Bingham, a managing partner at SV Life Sciences, which will manage the fund, dampened hopes of a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s, but said that it should be possible to develop a treatment over the next 10 years that halts the progression of the disease. \u201cThere is enormous enthusiasm from academia,\u201d she said. She stressed that the fund would be able to move quickly, within weeks if necessary, to invest in promising treatments and help fund research at universities, biotech or pharmaceutical firms. The global heads of neuroscience and R&amp;D from the six companies involved in the initiative will hold three face-to-face meetings a year with the fund managers to share their expertise. The first meeting is scheduled for 12 November, and Bingham is in the process of recruiting two top neuroscientists from industry in Boston and London to help advise on investments. Patrick Vallance, GSK\u2019s head of R&amp;D, said: \u201cThis is a complex and costly area of research, and if we\u2019re to succeed in developing innovative new treatments, we must be prepared to work together and jointly shoulder the risk of ambitious new approaches.\u201d The London launch of the fund comes after a series of other public-private initiatives. The Dementias Platform UK, a \u00a353m research project, was set up by the Medical Research Council last year, bringing together six pharmaceutical companies including GSK and eight universities. It pooled 22 studies to create the largest group of people taking part in dementia research worldwide.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The CBI has signalled its determination to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, as the battle lines are drawn for the country\u2019s in-out referendum campaign. The UK\u2019s leading business group published a glossy report, Choosing Our Future, on Wednesday, liberally sprinkled with quotes from companies and trade bodies about the boost to their bottom line from remaining in the European single market. The referendum on EU membership David Cameron has promised may be as much as two years away, aand will follow the prime minister\u2019s efforts to renegotiate Britain\u2019s position in the union with his EU counterparts. Following the launch of official in and out campaigns, the CBI, which represents 190,000 businesses employing 7 million people, is keen to show that it will play a leading role in promoting the benefits of remaining in a reformed EU. \u201cThe single market has been the solid foundation of our economic success in recent decades, giving us direct access to eight times more consumers than in the UK alone and ensuring we can go toe-to-toe with larger economies on major trade deals, creating jobs and economic growth here in the UK,\u201d said John Cridland, the CBI\u2019s outgoing director general. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, criticised the CBI earlier this year for weakening the prime minister\u2019s hand as he prepares to negotiate with Brussels, by appearing to offer unconditional support for British membership. Mindful of that criticism, Cridland said: \u201cWe should not be blind to the downsides and recognise the EU, like any big institution, has its faults and needs to do better.\u201d Throughout the new report, however, CBI member companies and trade bodies large and small laud the EU and its benefits. \u201cWe export over 60% of the music made in the UK \u2013 our biggest markets are the European Union and America. Access to customers through the EU single market has undoubtedly helped the UK music industry become a world leader,\u201d says Jo Dipple, the chief executive of UK Music, which represents the industry. Andy Wood, the chief executive of the Southwold-based brewer Adnams, says: \u201cWe are making British beer popular across Europe, selling easily through the EU single market to our largest export market, Sweden, meaning we can continue to grow our 420 strong workforce back home.\u201d Echoing a report published by the Britain Stronger in Europe group last weekend, the CBI also stresses the benefits to UK consumers of membership, which allows them to \u201cbuy cheese from France, salami from Italy, beer from Belgium and put it in a fridge from Germany as if they were buying from the UK, with no extra charges\u201d. It suggests that leaving the EU would mean having to negotiate new trade deals with longstanding European exporters, and could see tariffs and taxes slapped on foreign goods. The opening salvo in the campaign from the business community comes as Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, prepares to deliver his own verdict on the risks of a Brexit in a speech at St Peter\u2019s College, Oxford. Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Carney is expected to reveal the results of Project Bookend, a Bank investigation into the implications of a British exit from the EU for its key tasks of maintaining monetary and financial stability. Most business groups appear poised to line up behind the campaign to stay, but trade unions are divided. Some see the EU as a powerful guarantor of human rights, but others fear the prime minister will bargain away worker protections in his forthcoming negotiations. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe EU is at its best when it meets the interests of both business and workers. But the prime minister\u2019s plans for EU renegotiation will put at risk important rights that UK workers get from the EU, such as paid holidays, rest breaks and protection against working excessive hours. \u201cIf you take workers\u2019 rights away, they will be less likely to vote to stay in the EU.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays appears to be considering ways to defy the strict separation of its high street operations from its investment bank, in a move likely to inflame the debate over whether rules designed to prevent a second banking crisis are being watered down. The bank, which is poised to name ex-investment banker Jes Staley as its next boss, is considering a plan that would put its retail banking arm under the ownership of its investment bank. Although temporary, the arrangement could last years. The move would appear to fly in the face of the wishes of Sir John Vickers\u2019 Independent Commission on Banking, which in 2011 concluded the stability of the financial system would be improved if banks ringfenced their high street arms from their riskier investment banks. The separation must be completed by 2019 although the detail of the rules is still being finalised. The plan emerged hours after senior policymakers at the Bank of England were forced to deny beginning to water down the ringfencing rules. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, also acknowledged it would be a \u201cmiracle\u201d if further changes were not needed. Barclays has always been regarded as having a tough challenge in meeting the ringfencing requirements because of the size of its investment bank. John McFarlane, the bank\u2019s chairman, has reportedly told top staff in recent weeks that the bank needed a way to protect the credit rating of its investment bank following the introduction of ringfencing. The investment bank\u2019s credit rating is strengthened by its diverse structure, but that effect would disappear if it was a standalone business. A number of ideas have been discussed, and the latest would involve the high street operations sitting inside the investment bank for a number of years. It is not clear whether the plan has been submitted to the Bank of England\u2019s regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Andrew Bailey, the PRA boss, is likely to be specially mindful of criticism over watering down the ringfencing rules after a consultation document last week allowed the ringfenced bank to pay dividends to its parent provided it had enough capital. Bailey told MPs on the Treasury select committee on Tuesday that this was not a deviation from the Vickers rules. He also admitted that last week\u2019s dramatic government U-turn on making top bank bosses more accountable for their actions had been changed for fear they breach human rights rules. MPs asked him about the government\u2019s sudden removal last week of a rule placing the burden of proof on bosses to show they had done the right thing if wrongdoing emerged. Instead, the regulator will now have to prove its case against bank chiefs. Barclays said it had not yet finalised its structural reform plan. \u201cRespecting the regulatory process, we have not, and will not, publicly discuss our plan for structural reform until it is formally approved. However, we can be clear that any plan we submit for approval will be wholly consistent with both the legal requirements and objectives of ringfencing.\u201d The PRA declined to comment on the latest report about Barclays\u2019 plans.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has been urged to challenge the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, over job losses in the British steel industry following the announcement of 1,200 redundancies by the UK\u2019s largest steelmaker. Tata Steel said 900 jobs would be lost at Scunthorpe and 270 at two sites in Scotland as it blamed cheap Chinese imports, the strong pound and high electricity costs for its decision to stop production of steel plate. The announcement came one day after 1,700 jobs were put at risk when steel products firm Caparo Industries entered administration, and in the same month that 2,200 jobs were lost when the owner of the Redcar plant on Teeside went into liquidation. Workers at the Dalzell site in Motherwell, one of the affected Tata mills, said managers had referred to competition from cheap Chinese steel when they briefed staff on Tuesday. \u201cThey as good as said it was the end of the steel industry in Scotland this morning. The way they spoke about the Chinese imports, that\u2019s how it was explained to us,\u201d said Andrew Crawford, who has worked at Dalzell for nearly three decades. Imports of Chinese steel into the UK have quadrupled from 2% to 8% in the past three years, as the world\u2019s second largest economy has reacted to an economic slowdown by pouring excess capacity from its steel industry \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest \u2013 into foreign markets including Britain. Another Dalzell worker, John Clark, urged Cameron to challenge the Chinese leader Xi on the issue during his state visit to the UK. He said: \u201cDavid Cameron is putting out the red carpet for the Chinese president. He should be putting demands on the table instead.\u201d Clark, also a representative for the Community trade union at Dalzell, added: \u201cHe must see that this has been an ongoing situation and we have been trying to make the UK government aware of the situation for over two years.\u201d In Scunthorpe, Kev Simons, 30, said he struggled to understand why David Cameron was welcoming the Chinese president when most people blamed cheap Chinese steel imports at least in part for the crisis in UK steel. \u201cIt just seems a bit of a coincidence, the Chinese getting wined and dined. What\u2019s all that about?\u201d said Simons, a bricklayer in the Dawes Lane coke ovens complex, which is due to shut. However, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, indicated on Tuesday that Cameron will not press Xi hard on the steel issue. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: \u201cWe have got to get the balance right: trying to protect our steel industry in a sensible way, which we are doing, but recognising that we are operating in a global economy. We can\u2019t simply build a wall around the UK.\u201d The job losses will be triggered by the mothballing of steel plate mills in Scunthorpe, Dalzell and Clydebridge in Cambuslang, near Glasgow. One of two coke ovens at the Scunthorpe works will also be closed. Karl K\u00f6hler, chief executive of Tata Steel\u2019s European operations, which are ultimately controlled by the Indian industrial conglomerate Tata, cited competition from imports as a problem for the entire European industry. \u201cThe European commission needs to do much more to deal with unfairly traded imports \u2013 inaction threatens the future of the entire European steel industry.\u201d The management team at Tata\u2019s Scunthorpe steel mill are eyeing a buyout of the loss-making plant, according to sources. Tata has been trying to offload its Scunthorpe-based long products division since a sale to the billionaire industrialist Gary Klesch, owner of the Klesch group of global industrial commodities, fell through in August. Fears are growing for the future of the North Lincolnshire plant. One source said that Tata wanted to close the site and focus its resources on its sister operation in Port Talbot. The source said: \u201cThe market will not change. I think they [Tata] are discussing various things to see if other people buy it [Scunthorpe]. At least they are giving it a try.\u201d He said Tata was not currently in talks with any potential buyers, but noted that it has discussed the possibility of a management buyout by the team currently in charge of the Scunthorpe steel mill. \u201cThey might be talking about a management buyout. But who is going to fund them [management] when the prognosis is so bad?\u201d Tata could not be reached to comment about a possible management buyout of the Scunthorpe mill. The trade body UK Steel said the closure of Dalzell would have strategic implications for Britain\u2019s defence policy because it is the only UK site capable of producing steel that can be used in the Trident nuclear submarine programme and as armour plating for the army. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \u201cDalzell is the only site in the UK capable of rolling steel for use in the Trident replacement and for armour plating for the armed forces. Does [the defence secretary] Michael Fallon understand that if that site closes, the army and navy will have to go abroad for steel that is used for national security purposes? It\u2019s a really significant issue.\u201d Responding to UK Steel\u2019s warning, the Ministry of Defence said it was an issue for contractors rather than the MoD. A spokesman said: \u201cSteel for key defence programmes, including submarines, is sourced from a range of suppliers. It is the responsibility of prime contractors to obtain the steel required to complete MoD programmes at a competitive cost, within time constraints and to the required quality.\u201d A spokeswoman for BAE Systems, the defence group expected to build a new nuclear submarine fleet, said: \u201cWe do not forsee any impact from today\u2019s announcement by Tata related to their Dalzell facility on the submarine programmes BAE Systems is currently delivering for the UK government.\u201d The business secretary, Sajid Javid, was called to the House of Commons to defend the government\u2019s reaction to the industry\u2019s woes. He said the government would not stand by while workers lost their jobs but announced no new measures to support the industry. Javid also played down the role of cheap imports from China in forcing down prices. \u201cNo government can change the price of steel in the global market. No government can dictate foreign exchange rates\u201d or break European rules on state aid, Javid said. \u201cChina is one of those countries \u2013 the main one in terms of overcapacity in the market. There is a recession in Brazil, there is also Russia \u2026 It\u2019s a wider problem than just China.\u201d Kevin Brennan, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThey seem content to let Britain\u2019s steel industry disappear in the face of Chinese dumping. While the Chinese president is riding down the Mall in a gilded state coach, British workers are being laid off because our government is not standing up for them.\u201d Ian Wright, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, near Redcar, said Javid\u2019s proposed long-term plan for the steel industry would be obsolete without immediate action. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t take urgent action now, in days, there won\u2019t be a British steel industry left by the end of the year,\u201d Wright said. The steel crisis threatens severe knock-on effects, with jobs threatened throughout the supply chain for the industry. In addition, many towns with steel plants rely on the sector\u2019s skilled workers to spend money in local shops and other businesses. Tom Westley, chairman of the Westley Group foundry business, said the government needed to come up with a strategy for the steel industry. In the short run, ministers might need to intervene, despite European state aid constraints, to save the industry, he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWhen prices of products become so low ... you have to have a longer-term strategy. Perhaps we have got to give some level of subsidy to keep this industry alive and look at it as a national asset rather than [in terms of] costs. You have got to take a sensible view about whether it is sensible to drive people out of business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Outside the Tata Steel plant in Scunthorpe on Tuesday, passing drivers honked their car-horns in solidarity as workers streamed out from the morning shift, many staggered at the confirmation of 900 job losses. Kev Simons, 30, a bricklayer in the Dawes Lane coke ovens complex, which is due to shut, said his partner had been calling him frantically since the news broke. \u201cMy missus is beside herself. We have another baby on the way, due December 1st. A boy. I\u2019ve already got a four-year-old daughter. We thought we had it cushy. Six months ago the future was looking bright.\u201d He added: \u201cUntil now I have been earning enough for both of us. We didn\u2019t take any tax credits or anything like that. We\u2019ve been legit for as long as I remember. Now we will probably have to rely on state handouts.\u201d For the last few hours of his 6am-2pm shift, Simons downed tools and got on the phone to look for another job. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to wait 45 days until the place shuts down. I need to find work now,\u201d he said. He was one of many workers to complain that they heard on social media that they were soon to be unemployed. Yet outside Tata\u2019s corporate office a few hundred metres up the road, Bimlendra Jha, an executive director at Tata Steel, said he had personally told the workers the bad news. \u201cOf course they are very distressed and so are we, but they understood why we had to take this decision,\u201d he said, blaming the government for levying high business rates and energy costs that made UK steel uncompetitive with foreign rivals. \u201cThere is no silver bullet, but I think that a very significant proportion of our losses could be covered [if business rates and energy costs were lowered].\u201d Jha said the UK\u2019s whole manufacturing output was at risk, not just steel production. \u201cIn the cradle of the industrial revolution do we want to be the first ones to close the doors on manufacturing?\u201d he said. \u201cI fear not just for UK steel manufacturing but for all manufacturing in the UK.\u201d Back at the workers\u2019 gate, Simons said he struggled to understand why David Cameron was this week rolling out the red carpet for the Chinese president, Xi Jingping, when most people blamed cheap Chinese steel imports at least in part for the crisis in UK steel. \u201cIt just seems a bit of a coincidence, the Chinese getting wined and dined. What\u2019s all that about?\u201d Simons has been working at the site since he was 18, when he joined as a \u201cday gang\u201d labourer. In recent months he has been rebuilding the coke ovens. \u201cFor months and months [Tata] has been putting millions into Dawes Lane, trying to refurbish the ovens,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019ve pulled the plug.\u201d As well as the 900 projected job losses on the Tata site in Scunthorpe, many more businesses rely on the town\u2019s steel trade. Simon Crutchley, picking up a delivery of steel in his lorry, was fuming. \u201cCan I swear? He\u2019s ruining fucking everything, Cameron. This stuff is what won us wars since everything began. There\u2019s nothing great left in Great Britain.\u201d Neil Dawson, 54, a member of the public who had travelled down from Hull, had made three placards chastising Cameron and George Osborne. \u201cCameron your silence is deafening. Get your act together. Scunthorpe needs urgent help\u201d read one. \u201cOsborne favours China [more] than our proud core industries\u201d read another. \u201cI think we should be looking after our own industries first and foremost,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel Mr Cameron is turning his back on our industries. They are the foundation of the UK. He is not addressing the influx of cheap Chinese steel, which creates an unlevel playing field where we can\u2019t compete.\u201d He scoffed at the government\u2019s pledge to build a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d to strengthen the north and provide a counterpoint to the might of London and the south-east. Dawson singled out James Wharton, a Tory MP from Teesside who was made Osborne\u2019s minister for the northern powerhouse in May, for particular opprobrium. \u201cMr Wharton\u2019s claim of a northern powerhouse is a sham. I think it only extends as far as Milton Keynes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is happening here and in Redcar makes a mockery of it. It makes a joke of it. These are our bread and butter industries and they\u2019re doing nothing to save them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Walking out of Motherwell\u2019s Dalzell steelworks into the sharp autumn sunshine, one man summed up the mood of the workforce concisely: \u201cScunnered.\u201d Others coming off the morning shift were similarly winded at confirmation from the steel firm Tata that it is to close its two plants in Scotland, losing 225 jobs at the Dalzell plate rolling works and another 45 at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang near Glasgow, and effectively ending Scottish steel production. Andrew Crawford, who began work at Dalzell at the age of 20, nearly three decades ago, said he was devastated by the news, which was delivered to workers on Tuesday morning. \u201cMy dad worked there. I\u2019ve had friends just retire and there are kids in there with young families.\u201d Crawford said the management had offered little hope: \u201cThey as good as said it was the end of the steel industry in Scotland this morning, the way they spoke about the Chinese imports. That\u2019s how it was explained to us.\u201d Dalzell Steel and Iron Works opened in 1872 and by the first world war had become the largest steelworks in Scotland, providing plates for the thriving shipbuilding industry on the river Clyde. Once the steel production capital of Scotland, Motherwell was nicknamed Steelopolis and its skyline was dominated by the gasholder and three cooling towers of the Ravenscraig plant, the closure of which in 1992 signalled the end of large-scale steelmaking in Scotland. John Pentland, Labour MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw, explained: \u201cThe people here are still recovering from the closure of Ravenscraig. It shattered this area and we are still picking up the pieces. \u201cSteelmaking is just as iconic as Irn Bru to Scotland. If you allow the steel industry to die you are putting all those skilled people on the scrapheap.\u201d Pentland, himself a former steelworker, added that if all else fails the Scottish steel industry should be brought back into public ownership. \u201cThe Scottish government can intervene and support strategic assets when they are threatened, as it has shown several times. It acted when Prestwick was threatened; it acted when Fergusons was threatened; it acted when Grangemouth was threatened; and it can act again, to save our steel industry.\u201d Speaking outside the plant shortly after the announcement, John Clark, the multi-union chair for Dalzell workers, offered David Cameron some advice for his meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. \u201cDavid Cameron is putting out the red carpet for the Chinese president. He should be putting demands on the table instead. He must see that this has been an ongoing situation and we have been trying to make the UK government aware of the situation for over two years.\u201d Clark said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believed there was still a future for steelmaking in Motherwell and that the priority now was to find a buyer for the plant. \u201cWe are putting our faith in the Scottish government. We think this has still got a future and with investment we can still turn the corner.\u201d But Tor Farquhar, human resources director for Tata Steel Europe, said he was pessimistic about whether either of the mothballed Scottish plants would ever reopen. First minister Nicola Sturgeon announced she would visit both sites on Thursday, as the Scottish government confirmed plans for a steel taskforce to seek alternative buyers for the works and support those facing redundancy. Sturgeon said: \u201cWe will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to keep the plants open and support the 270 staff affected by today\u2019s announcement.\u201d Entering the works for his afternoon shift, John McKenna, who worked at Ravenscraig before joining Dalzell eight years ago, was more optimistic: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed they\u2019ve decided to treat us this way, but I think there\u2019s definitely a future if someone is in their right mind to take this on. There\u2019s a good workforce here. There\u2019s a future if the government wants to make it that way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We are wrapping up for the day. Thank you for all your great comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has lauded the close ties between his country and Britain during a speech to the UK parliament. It is the first full day of his four-day state visit to Britain, aimed at boosting trade. It is fair to say that China and the UK are increasingly interdependent and are becoming a community of shared interests. I am already deeply impressed by the vitality of China-UK relations and the profound friendship between our peoples.\u201d Unsurprisingly, there was no mention of steel dumping. About half of the 1.6bn tonnes of steel made globally comes from China, and firms operating in the UK simply can\u2019t compete, says Guardian contributor Karl West. He writes: The latest grim chapter in the long, slow death of Britain\u2019s steel industry may have been decided in India, but it was scripted in Beijing. Tata Steel, owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata Group, has been hammered by a toxic cocktail of high green taxes on emissions, a strong pound, slowing demand and cheap Chinese competition. In the past 18 months, China has flooded the market with cheap, subsidised steel as its economic growth has slowed. Beijing wants to grab whatever foreign cash it can on global markets by selling its products at a knockdown rate. As Caparo becomes latest victim of crisis, pressure is on the business secretary and chancellor after last week\u2019s emergency steel summit Gareth Stace, director of the industry body UK Steel, said: \u201cChinese steelmakers are fully subsidised by the Chinese government and their regions.\u201d You can read the full story here. Just to recap, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has indicated that the government won\u2019t press the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, too hard on the \u201cdumping\u201d of steel. Hammond told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: We have got to get the balance right: trying to protect our steel industry in a sensible way, which we are doing, but recognising that we are operating in a global economy. We can\u2019t simply build a wall around the UK.\u201d You can read the full story here. Guardian contributor Karl West has sent us this: The management team at Tata Steel\u2019s Scunthorpe steel mill are eyeing a buyout of the loss-making plant, according to sources. The Indian conglomerate that owns the rump of the former British Steel has been trying to offload its Scunthorpe-based long products division since a sale to Gary Klesch, the billionaire industrialist and owner of the Klesch Group of companies, fell through in August. Tata yesterday confirmed it is cutting 1,200 jobs in the division, including 900 at Scunthorpe. The business has been hammered by cheap Chinese competition, making it uneconomical to produce steel for the rail and construction sectors in Britain. Fears are growing for the future of the North Lincolnshire plant. One source reckons Tata want to close the site and focus its resources on its sister operation in Port Talbot. The source said: \u201cThe market will not change. I think they [Tata] are discussing various things to see if other people buy it [Scunthorpe]. At least they are giving it a try.\u201d He said Tata is not currently in talks with any potential buyers, but noted it has discussed the possibility of a management buyout by the team currently in charge of the Scunthorpe steel mill. \u201cThey might be talking about a management buyout. But who is going to fund them [management] when the prognosis is so bad?\u201d Tata could not be reached to comment. More from Libby Brooks, who has been speaking to Tata workers in Motherwell: John McKenna, who worked at Ravenscraig before joining Dalzell eight years ago, said that he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 at the news. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed they\u2019ve decided to treat us this way. I think there\u2019s definitely a future if someone is in their right mind to take this on. There\u2019s a good workforce here. There\u2019s a future is the government wants to make it that way.\u201d Andrew Crawford, who had worked at the plant for 26 years since the age of 20, said that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d. \u201cMy dad worked there. I\u2019ve had friends just retire and there are young kids in there with families.\u201d \u201cThey are good as said it was the end the steel industry in Scotland this morning. The way they spoke about the Chinese imports, that\u2019s how it was explained to us.\u201d One worker hurrying away from the works summed up the mood of the workforce thus: \u201cScunnered\u201d. Another Tata executive has been speaking. After talking to workers in Scunthorpe, Bimlendra Jha, executive chairman of the Long Products Europe business, said (quotes from PA): \u201cThese are very distressing times. \u201cIt is not just a question of Tata Steel. It\u2019s a question of manufacturing industry in Britain. \u201cIt is a fight very clearly for the future of manufacturing industry in Britain. \u201cWe have to act in unison to put up a fight together.\u201d \u201cIn the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, I don\u2019t want Britain to be the first country to shut its door on manufacturing.\u201d Tor Farquhar, human resources director for Tata Steel Europe, has been taking questions outside the Motherwell plant. He says that this is a very difficult day for the company and workers: \u201cThis is the worst news you can ever give your employees.\u201d Asked whether he wanted to see more government intervention to counter the flooding of the market, in particular with Chinese steel, he replied: \u201cThis is a global issue. At a European level we have been fighting hard to have a level playing field so we don\u2019t have subsidised steel entering the market. If I had one criticism it is that Europe has been quite slow to stop subsidised steel while the US has been much quicker.\u201d Referring to the steel task force set up by the Scottish government, he said: \u201cThis is not an issue that the UK or the Scottish government on their own can address. The truth is that global oversupply puts plants like this at risk.\u201d He suggested that finding a buyer for the works in the current climate would be extremely difficult. Farquhar also said that the UK and Chinese industries needed to find a balance: \u201cThe UK has and needs to maintain a manufacturing base alongside and complimentary to China. We believe there is a future for UK steel and a future in sales to China. This is not China versus the UK.\u201d However, he said that he believed the steel works behind him had no future. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very hard for a long time to find a sustainable future for the plate base. It\u2019s a very difficult decision and one we fought against but the global macro economic picture means we can\u2019t find a viable way of production.\u201d Local Labour MSP John Pentland has also called on the Scottish government to act, writes Libby Brooks: \u201cThe Scottish Government can intervene and support strategic assets when they are threatened, as it has shown several times. It acted when Prestwick was threatened; it acted when Fergusons was threatened; it acted when Grangemouth was threatened; and it can act again, to save our steel industry.\u201d Pentland also said that it was \u201cshocking\u201d that the new Forth crossing project was being built with overseas steel, including steel manufactured in China. Despite Sajid Javid\u2019s repeated proclamations that prime minister David Cameron will raise the issue of steel dumping with Chinese president Xi Jinping, there seems some doubt as to how strong the protests will be. Our political correstpondent Rowena Mason writes: David Cameron\u2019s spokesman will not reveal how strongly he is prepared to object to China\u2019s steel-dumping in his meetings with Xi. She would only say he will \u201craise\u201d the matter and discuss how the actions of one country can impact on another. There is little sense that he plans to complain forcefully about China\u2019s behaviour. More in our live blog on the Chinese visit. Lib Dem Greg Mulholland: all concentration on Chinese visit is on banking, will issue of steel be raised Javid: there will be an announcement of \u00a320bn of business deals with China which I;m sure he will welcome. And with that, Parliament turns to other issues. Labour Ian Lucas: how big should industry be for strategic reasons, how retain capacity Javid: we\u2019ve seen a steady decline in capacity, need to supply more stability so they can plan for future. Labour Phil Wilson: problems with supply chain, how than they be helped Javid: number of good suggestions from summit. Will be working with industries using steel to see how can hard wire requirement for British steel in their products. Labour Angela Smith: inexcusable minister won\u2019t commit to a long term strategy for industry, for steel Javid: Steel summit on Friday did discuss strategy. Since then, already set up metal strategy which steel is a major part. SNP Margaret Ferrier: Must do everything we can for the workers. Welcome action by Scottish government to set up taskforce. But what will UK government do, about dumping, high energy costs? Javid: We will support Scottish task force. Must do all we can for workers and families. Labour Tristram Hunt: China needs to know, we are more than just a theme park. What talks is he having, when will he stand up for Britain Javid: there will be further announcements which will help sustain jobs. Prime minister will discuss whole issue of unfair trade. Conservative Jeremy Lefroy: Steel is vital national industry. No point in buying cheap steel which will have problems later Javid: right to raise this point. We will be looking very closely at this. Labour Tom Blenkinsop: EU partners have taken action against Chinese dumping. Javid: For first time ever, a British government supported duties by EU and will take further action when evidence is there. Conservative Peter Bone: let us put in place what we think is right and worry about what EU thinks afterwards. Javid: Understand point, but rules on unfair state aid etc exist to protect British manufacturers as well. Need to have clean hands if we complain about others violating rules. DUP Sammy Wilson: Problem partly also green energy policies which have pushed up costs. Javid: right to raise this issue, energy costs are high, some of them are imposed directly some through EU policies. Are paying compensation, want to pay more, so want EU approval as soon as possible. Labour Andy McDonald: has he pursuing anti dumping initiative Javid: we have started taking action, voted at EU, it is an EU led process, we have provided evidence where he have it. Conservative Stephen Hammond: how to make dumping not endemic? Javid: we have been taking action, voted for it, will be pushing for action to be taken more quickly. Labour Stephen Doughty: Why does secretary not go over to Brussels and sort out state aid? Javid: Not in full control of UK government. It is a priority, and it is too slow. We are doing everything we can. Conservative Martin Vickers: could we have more detail about the task force in Lincolnshire. Javid: Task force just been set up. We need to listen to task force and local leaders. First meeting will take place tomorrow. Labour\u2019s Nick Dakin said action must be taken now. Javid said some of the actions require working with our EU partners, working as quickly as possible. Javid: It\u2019s a shame he [Brennan] wants to play politics. We will do all we can, support package for Redcar. Task force in Scunthorpe, will listen to what more we can do. Clearly China is one of the main countries in terms of overcapacity. But wider than just China, Brazil is in recession. It needs an EU wide solution. Brennan: Despite the rhetoric the government seems content to let the industry disappear in the face of Chinese dumping. Will he implement the actions the industry is calling for? Brennan accuses the secretary of state of spinning, the \u00a380m package was only said to be \u00a350m just last week. Javid is ticked off by by the speaker for exceeding his allotted time. Business secretary Sajid Javid said the industry was facing unprecedented challenges, and the situation was devastating. The situation is difficult and deeply worrying for workers. The government is doing and will continue to do everything in its power to support you in the weeks and months to come. We will not abandon you now in your greatest time of need. There is no straighforward solution. The goverment has given an \u00a380m package to people who lost their jobs at SSI. We will do all we can to soften the blow. We will set up a taskforce. Taking steps to assure there is a future for the British steel industry in difficult markets But excess capacity is enormous, 570m tonnes last year. The price of steel has halved. In the three years since SSI restarted the plant, it lost \u00a3600m. There are limits to what the government can do. We can\u2019t change the price of steel, dictate exchange rates, disregard international regulations. On Friday I hosted a top level summit, created a framework for action to suppor steelworks. We will drive up the number of public procument contracts won by UK steelmakers. UK steel should play a central role. Secondly we will see what lessons we can learn from other countries in the EU and beyond. Also what the government can do to boost productions, reduce costs, including energy. training. A review of business rates is underway. On top of \u00a350m paid out to energy intensive users. But the process for further support [for energy users] needs EU approval which is taking longer than we would like. I will meet the European Commission next week to discuss unfair trade. And now the urgent parliamentary question in Parliament from Kevin Brennan, shadow minister for trade and investment. Brennan said: Will the business secretary make a statement about what action government taking to secure future of steel industry? Describing the announcement as a crushing blow for the workforce, Grahame Smith, Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) General Secretary welcomed the decision to mothball the plants, and said that it was essential that the UK and Scottish Governments responded quickly to the crisis. \u201cThe UK Government must work with the industry to prevent the unfair dumping of Chinese steel on the UK market and provide a package of support similar to those routinely provided by other European nations to their energy intensive manufacturing sectors. Smith, who became the first union leader to be invited to speak at the SNP\u2019s conference in Aberdeen last weekend, added: \u201cThe Scottish Government must work with the Tata and the trade unions to provide a package of assistance to sustain jobs and the skills base whilst a strategy for the sector\u2019s future development is agreed and implemented. Simply relying on the usual interventions to help find jobs for redundant workers will be unacceptable at this stage\u201d. Angela Eagle, shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThis latest announcement from Tata Steel is devastating for the workers and their local communities. \u201cWith each passing day there is a new blow to the industry which is now on its knees, however this Government is only prepared to offer warm words. \u201cRather than setting up more talking shops the Government should be taking action including working with the European Commission and the Chinese government to relieve the pressure on the industry. \u201cWe also need action from the Scottish Government. When Grangemouth, Fergusons and Prestwick Airport were at risk, the Scottish Government stepped in to provide support and to secure jobs. They need to do the same now - anything less will not be acceptable.\u201d UK Steel also points to the potential loss of vital national assets, including the ability to process the steel used in Trident submarines: The Dalzell plant in Scotland has an array of processes which make it a very special facility which few, if any, in Europe can match. It is the only plant in UK capable of rolling and processing the steel used in Trident submarines and the MoD special Armour plate. If the plant is lost the UK faces the prospect of building the next Trident fleet using imported steel. It is also the only UK facility with the capability to supply the exotic specifications demanded by the offshore oil and gas industry for drilling platforms and oil and gas pipelines. UK Steel, the trade association for the industry, has added to the calls for prime minister David Cameron to press the Chinese president on steel dumping during this week\u2019s state visit. Director Gareth Stace said: \u201cOur fears about further job losses have now been confirmed. If we are to stem this tide then the Business Secretary must now deliver as a matter of urgency the commitments he made at last week\u2019s summit, on energy costs, Business Rates costs and tackling unfair trade. In addition, we must also see a commitment from all parts of government at the highest level to ensure the sector\u2019s survival in the UK. \u201cThe Prime Minister can demonstrate that he is prepared to lead this commitment by stepping in this week and pressing the Chinese Premier about the dumping of under-priced steel which is one of the major factors killing our industry.\u201d Here\u2019s more detail from Libby Brooks in Motherwell on the comments from John Clark, Community rep for Dalzell. He says that workers are still be briefed inside. \u201cObviously it\u2019s devastating for a community that has been here since 1872. It\u2019s a particularly bad time for the guys in there coming up for Christmas. We\u2019re seen Ravenscraig come and go and if you talk to anyone in the street in Motherwell town centre they have all got some involvement.\u201d Clark said that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believed that there was still a future for steel making in Motherwell and that the priority now was to find a buyer for the plant. \u201cNicola Sturgeon has said that she will leave no stone unturned to help the industry and we are putting our faith in the Scottish government. We think this has still got a future and with investment we can still turn the corner.\u201d He also criticised David Cameron who is today meeting the Chinese president Xi Jinping. Tata blamed cheap Chinese imports in part for the job cuts. \u201cDavid Cameron is putting out the red carpet for the Chinese president. He be putting demands on the table instead. \u201cHe must see that this has been an ongoing situation and we have been trying to make the UK government aware of the situation for over two years.\u201d In Scunthorpe, the Community union\u2019s McBean told PA: \u201cIf we all worked for nothing here we could not compete with the prices they\u2019re (the Chinese) are dumping it on our shores for. \u201cLet us compete with the rest of the world. \u201cGive us a level playing field and these guys here will compete with the rest of the world. We just need some help. \u201cWe have profitable parts of this business and we will keep going.\u201d Asked how his members took the news when they watched the web-cast, he said: \u201cThey just sat there in shock.\u201d Martin Foster, from Unite, said outside the plant: \u201cAcross Scunthorpe there\u2019s three assets affected but the knock-on effect through the site is probably 800 to 900 people.\u201d He said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be devastating news for all them. I\u2019ve just come from the plate mill. I\u2019ve seen some of the guys down there. A lot of them were expecting something like this, they all know the plates business has been struggling, But, as I say that doesn\u2019t soften the blow, even though you were expecting it. It still comes pretty hard.\u201d In Scunthorpe, workers also said they were devastated by the Tata announcement, even though the news did not exactly come as a surprise. PA reports: Paul McBean, from the Community union, said: \u201cThey are just devastated and I\u2019m devastated too. We knew it was coming but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here for 40 years and I don\u2019t know my future. It\u2019s the same for a lot of people in there.\u201d Mr McBean said: \u201cI just can\u2019t believe the numbers involved. I\u2019m still in shock, to be honest, even though the rumours were leaked.\u201d One man leaving by car said to reporters: \u201cI\u2019m bothered about myself, of course, but it\u2019s my sons, both of my sons work here. It\u2019s their future. \u201cBut you\u2019ve just got to keep your chin up and keep going.\u201d Staff leaving the works said they would not know who would be affected until after the 90-day consultation period was over. One said: \u201cWe\u2019ll try and enjoy Christmas and see what happens in January.\u201d They said they were told the news by video conference in a series of meetings. Union representatives at Motherwell described the job cuts as devastating, says Libby Brooks: Here\u2019s the response to the Tata news from the Unite union, courtesy PA: Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke said: \u201cThis is a dark day for the UK steel industry, for the workers and the communities who livelihoods depend on steel. We will be working closely with Tata to find alternatives and to save as many jobs as possible. \u201cThe knock on effects of today\u2019s news combined with Caparo and the closure of Redcar through the supply chain will be devastating. Trade unions, the industry and business groups are all united on the need for the UK Government to support the steel industry. \u201cSajid Javid (Business Secretary) is becoming increasingly isolated by his failure to act swiftly to support the steel industry. He and the UK Government know what needs to be done and they need to do it quickly. A failure to act and tackle the dumping of cheap Chinese steel will spell the end of steel in the UK.\u201d Unite\u2019s Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty added: \u201cToday\u2019s news effectively brings an end to a proud tradition of steelmaking in Scotland. The impact on the Scottish economy which is also being hammered by job losses in North Sea oil will be severe unless there is urgent support. \u201cWe will be pressing the Scottish Government to live up to its promise to do everything it can to support the steel industry in Scotland and save jobs. The UK Government should take note of the Scottish Government\u2019s more proactive response and act to save our steel across the UK.\u201d PA is reporting comments from Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB. He said: \u201cOnly the UK Government acting with the EU can deal with dumping of steel and green taxes on energy prices. There has been no action. \u201cLook at the dismal record: :: 16th July Tata Steel announce 720 jobs losses in Rotherham, Stocksbridge and Wednesbury. No action from Government. :: 25th August Tata announce 250 redundancies in strip steel at Llanwern. No action from Government. :: 18th September 2015 SSI announce 2,200 jobs at Redcar under threat. No action from Government. :: 19th October steel firm Caparo in administration. No action from Government. :: 20 October Tata announce 1,200 jobs to go in Scunthorpe and Lanarkshire. No action from Government. \u201cParliament has to insist on immediate action on steel.\u201d More from Libby Brooks in Scotland on the steel crisis: Dalzell Steel and Iron Works opened in Motherwell in 1872 and by the first World War had become the largest steel works in Scotland, providing plates for the thriving ship-building industry on the River Clyde. Once the steel production capital of Scotland, Motherwell was nicknamed Steelopolis and its skyline was once dominated by the gas holder and three cooling towers of the Ravenscraig steel plant. But the closure of Ravenscraig in 1992 signalled the end of large scale steel making in Scotland. John Pentland, Labour MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw called on the SNP to take decisive action to save the industry: \u201cSteel-making is just as iconic as Irn Bru to Scotland. If you allow the steel industry to die you are putting all those skilled people on the scrapheap.\u201d \u201cThe people here are still recovering from the closure of Ravenscraig. It shattered this area and we are still picking up the pieces.\u201d As Bank of England governor Mark Carney and deputy governor Andrew Bailey appear at a Treasury select committe, another member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee has been speaking on interest rates. Heather Stewart reports: In a speech at Bloomberg this morning, Ian McCafferty, the one member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee who has voted for an immediate increase in interest rates at recent meetings, warns his colleagues not to delay tightening policy for too long. \u201cIf we on the MPC are to achieve our ambition of raising rates only gradually, so as to minimise the disruption to households and businesses of a normalisation of policy after a long period in which interest rates have been at historic lows, we need to avoid getting \u2018behind the curve\u2019\u201d McCafferty has carried out some research about how easy it is for firms to borrow, and finds that it has become increasingly easy, relieving the credit crunch that followed the financial crisis, and removing one \u201cheadwind\u201d to economic growth. McCafferty says companies have been helped by a \u201cthaw in conditions\u201d for bank lending, alongside the arrival of new sources of finance, such as peer-to-peer lenders. \u201cTogether, these are bringing about a gradual normalisation of the corporate credit markets, such that this headwind, at least, may be starting to blow itself out\u201d, he says. Here\u2019s more detail from Libby: A Tata Steel representative speaking outside the Motherwell plant confirmed that 270 jobs would be lost in Scotland, 225 from Dalzell and 45 from the Clydebridge works in Cambuslang. First minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans to visit both sites on Thursday, as the Scottish government confirmed plans for a steel task force to seek alternative buyers for the works and support those facing redundancy. Sturgeon said: \u201cThis is a very anxious time for Tata Steel employees and their families and is deeply concerning for everyone involved. \u201cMy government is determined to fight for a future for our steel industry. \u201cThat is why I have established a Scottish Steel Task Force \u2013 to be chaired by my Business Minister, Fergus Ewing - that will bring together all the key representatives to work to keep the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants open. \u201cWe will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to keep the plants open and support the 270 staff affected by today\u2019s announcement.\u201d Our Scotland correpondent Libby Brooks is at Motherwell: Hmm... The company said it would begin consultations with employees and their trade union representatives today. It added: \u201cTata Steel\u2019s subsidiary UK Steel Enterprise will look at how it can provide more support to the local communities affected by today\u2019s announcement and help stimulate new job creation in those areas. Over the last four decades the company has helped to regenerate local economies with \u00a388 million of support and created more than 75,000 new jobs across the UK.\u201d The full statement is here: Restructure announced at Tata Steel\u2019s Long Products Europe business Tata said in response to the problems it face, it would be concentrating on \u201chigher-value markets with a focus on developing stronger and lighter products for its customers.\u201d Bimlendra Jha, Executive Chairman of the stand-alone Long Products Europe business, said: \u201cToday\u2019s proposals mark the next step in reshaping our business to give it the best chance of survival in this fiercely-competitive global marketplace. We are looking closely at the performance of all parts of Long Products Europe as part of a focus on returning to profitability.\u201d Tata said the cut came \u201cin response to a shift in market conditions caused by a flood of cheap imports, particularly from China, a strong pound and high electricity costs.\u201d It said plate mills in Scunthorpe, Dalzell and Clydebridge would be mothballed while one of the two coke ovens at the Scunthorpe steelworks would be closed. Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel\u2019s European operations, said: \u201cI realise how distressing this news will be for all those affected. We have looked at all other options before proposing these changes. \u201cWe will work closely with affected employees and their trade union representatives. We will look to redeploy employees, wherever possible, and minimise employee hardship. \u201cThe UK steel industry is struggling for survival in the face of extremely challenging market conditions. This industry has a crucial role to play in rebalancing the UK economy, but we need a fairer system to encourage growth. The European Commission needs to do much more to deal with unfairly traded imports \u2013 inaction threatens the future of the entire European steel industry.\u201d BREAKING NEWS: Tata Steel has confrmed that nearly 1,200 jobs will go in Scunthorpe and Scotland, the company said. It said 900 jobs will go at Scunthorpe and 270 in Scotland, \u201cas well as a small number at other Long Products Europe sites.\u201d The Long Products division will stop production of steel plate. David Fagan of North Lanarkshire Council, told BBC Scotland: We do need to at least ask Tata to slow down the process, work in partnership with all of the agencies that might be able to support this and look at any options that are there. If that\u2019s not successful, North Lanarkshire Council will work along with key agencies including local colleges, the NHS, to provide support for workers moving into other forms of employment and we\u2019ve a good track record in doing that. Workers at Tata\u2019s steel plants in Scunthorpe and Scotland are expected to hear their fates shortly. If Indian-owned Tata cuts its plants at Dalzell in Motherwell and Clydebridge in Cambuslang, that would effectively end 143 years of steelmaking in Scotland. Eurozone bank lending continued at a steady pace in the third quarter, according to the latest survey from the European Central Bank. Demand for mortgages remained high with a net 33% of eurozone banks reporting increased demand, albeit this was down from the record 49% in the second quarter. Demand for business loans was a modest 16%, not much better than the 13% seen in the previous three months. Teunis Brosens at ING Bank said: Especially disappointing is the fact that there is no sign of an investment pickup: The net percentage of banks reporting higher loan demand due to increasing investment activity was little changed at 11%. Indeed, net lending growth to non-financial businesses amounted to only 0.4% year on year in August. The survey results suggest we need not expect a strong pickup in September or beyond, for that matter. While the ECB claims that QE continues to support bank lending, the low rate-effect appears to be wearing off. The availability of low rates has become less important for households: a net 35% of banks report low rates as reason for households to take out (or refinance) a mortgage, down from 45% in the second quarter. For business clients, a net 19% of banks reported low rates as a motivating factor to borrow, down from 21% in the second quarter. All in all, today\u2019s Bank Lending Survey gives us \u201cmore of the same\u201d: the credit recovery is continuing, showing that the eurozone recovery is keeping pace. But is that good enough? We would really have liked to see an acceleration of business lending as a signal of business confidence translating into higher investment activity. More verbal sabre rattling by ECB-president Draghi on Thursday is likely, but will it convince Eurozone businesses to start investing? China of course is very much bound up in the current steel crisis in the UK, accused of dumping cheap steel on the market. So it is timely that Chinese president Xi Jinping is visiting the UK at the moment, with David Cameron and foreign secretary Philip Hammond both saying the issue of steel production will be raised. We are live blogging the president\u2019s visit here: Here\u2019s a graphic which shows one of the problems facing the steel industry: Other MPs are wading into the steel crisis. Scunthorpe Labour MP Nic Dakin told Radio 5 Live: Nobody\u2019s asking for subsidies here. What they\u2019re asking for is a level playing field. A level playing field on business rates, a level playing field on energy taxes compared with our european neighbours. John Pentland, Labour MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw said: It\u2019s going to be very, very devastating. There is no way that we should be thrown on the scrap heap. These are well experienced, skilled workers. These people should be retained. There could very well be intervention from the Scottish government. Meanwhile Labour\u2019s Chuka Umunna has taken the opportunity to attack the Conservative government: Foreign secretary Philip Hammond told Sky News that the issue of steel dumping will be raised with Chinese president Xi Jinping during his UK visit. Hammond said: It\u2019s certainly one of the subjects that will be on the agenda, the steel industry. China is a very big producer of steel, as you would expect. But there\u2019s a global over-capacity in the steel industry and that\u2019s caused prices to fall very precipitately over the last 12 months or so, and that\u2019s causing a problem around the world. The EU has imposed tariffs on Chinese steel to ensure that the price of Chinese steel reaching consumers here is fair, but there is a problem in this industry. Shares are struggling to make much ground in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up just 5.4 points, with commodity companies once more weighing on the index on worries about demand in China, the world\u2019s second biggest economy. But InterContinental Hotels is higher after the company reported a 4.8% rise in revenue per available room - a key industry measure - for the third quarter. Investors had been nervous about growth in China, but the company said it was confident in its outlook for the year. Shares in Premier Inn and Costa Coffee group Whitbread have climbed 2% after the company said first half pretax profit rose 13.8%. But Asos is down 2% after full year profits for the online fashion group rose just 1% and despite a confident outlook statement. The shares have been a reasonably strong performer in the run-up to the results. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are also marginally higher. The UK needs a long term strategic plan for the steel industry, but the challenge for government is what it can realistically do, says economist Gerard Lyons. https://twitter.com/DrGerardLyons/status/656365990968733696 A more positive sign for Caparo Industries, which went into adminstration on Monday. PwC, the administrators of the business, said they had already received several expressions of interest. Matthew Hammond of PwC told BBC Radio 5 Live that the approaches had come from the UK so far, with interest in buying all of the business as well as individual parts. Hammond said staff would continue to be paid. He believes PwC will need two weeks to fully assess the situation, while the whole administration process should take a couple of months. Here\u2019s the Bloomberg story on the problems at China\u2019s Sinosteel: A Chinese state-owned steel trader is set to default on a bond payment even after the government was said to have stepped in to help, highlighting worsening corporate finances as an economic slowdown deepens. Sinosteel Co. will delay an interest payment due Tuesday on 2 billion yuan ($314.5 million) of 5.3 percent notes that mature in 2017, according to a statement on Chinabond\u2019s website Monday. The firm delayed payment as it plans to back the securities with stock of its unit Sinosteel Engineering &amp; Technology Co., and that may affect issues related to interest payment, it said without elaborating. The failure to pay interest on time constitutes a default, according to Industrial Securities Co., Haitong Securities Co. and China Merchants Securities Co. \u201cInvestors have fully expected Sinosteel\u2019s default,\u201d said Sun Binbin, a bond analyst at China Merchants Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s possible it will pay the interest later, which would be better than the market expectation.\u201d More Chinese firms are struggling to repay obligations, and government-backed companies aren\u2019t immune, as defaults this year had already included two state-owned enterprises, according to China International Capital Corp. The National Development and Reform Commission planned to meet Sinosteel investors, people familiar with the matter said last week. The yuan\u2019s fall, a stock rout and speculation that bubbles are forming in the debt market have fanned concern. More here. Meanwhile in Germany, producer prices fell 0.4% in September compared to the previous month, a bigger decline than the 0.1% expected by economists. The year on year fall was 2.1%, again higher than the forecst 1.8%. Stock markets are expected to open virtually unchanged as investors weigh up the problems with the Chinese economy, and look ahead to this week\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank: Tallying up the potential job losses in the steel industry in just this month - 2,200 at Redcar, 1,700 at Caparo Industries and now 1,200 at Tata - means that of a total UK workforce of 30,000, one in six workers face the axe. Here is our analysis of the problems facing the industry: Good morning and welcome to our our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. It will be another grim day for the UK steel industry - what\u2019s left of it - with Tata expected to announce up to 1,200 job losses in Scunthorpe and Scotland. Workers are due to be told their fate at 10 o\u2019clock (BST) this morning, with an official statement an hour later. The move follows Monday\u2019s news that steel products group Caparo Industries had gone into administration and the recent liquidation of the Thai owned Redcar steelworks on Teesside with the loss of 2,200 jobs. Here\u2019s our latest story: One of the reasons for the crisis in UK steel is the dumping of cheap imports from China. UK prime minister David Cameron has promised to raise the issue during the four day visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping. Selling cheap steel has also caused problems for Chinese companies. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: While the weakness of commodity prices has its upsides, in the form of low inflation, we are now starting to see the downsides with job losses across the board in global manufacturing, not only in the UK, but in the US as well, while China has bailed out one of its own state owned commodity miners, in the form of Sinosteel, which has been haemorrhaging cash hand over fist, as it sells steel below market prices. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid said: The story on the Chinese SOE Sinosteel... is gathering steam with a Bloomberg article noting moments ago that the company delayed an interest payment on its Yuan dominated bonds due today. The same story suggests that the Chinese regulator and State Council are working with all related parties in order to try to prevent a default. Certainly a noteworthy story testing China\u2019s commitment to allowing market reform. With the UK government reluctant to bail out the industry, perhaps China\u2019s perceived willingness to act could be something else for Cameron and Xi Jinping to discuss. Elsewhere today we have results from Asos, InterContinental Hotels and Whitbread, while Bank of England governor is up before the Treasury Select Committee this morning.",

Teunis Brosens at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Especially disappointing is the fact that there is no sign of an investment pickup: The net percentage of banks reporting higher loan demand due to increasing investment activity was little changed at 11%. Indeed, net lending growth to non-financial businesses amounted to only 0.4% year on year in August. The survey results suggest we need not expect a strong pickup in September or beyond, for that matter.</p> <p>While the ECB claims that QE continues to support bank lending, the low rate-effect appears to be wearing off. The availability of low rates has become less important for households: a net 35% of banks report low rates as reason for households to take out (or refinance) a mortgage, down from 45% in the second quarter. For business clients, a net 19% of banks reported low rates as a motivating factor to borrow, down from 21% in the second quarter.<br></p> <p>All in all, today\u2019s Bank Lending Survey gives us \u201cmore of the same\u201d: the credit recovery is continuing, showing that the eurozone recovery is keeping pace. But is that good enough? We would really have liked to see an acceleration of business lending as a signal of business confidence translating into higher investment activity. More verbal sabre rattling by ECB-president Draghi on Thursday is likely, but will it convince Eurozone businesses to start investing?<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T08:55:28.470Z\">at 9.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5625fc2ae4b001aeab371bb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T08:34:55.583Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>China of course is very much bound up in the current steel crisis in the UK, accused of dumping cheap steel on the market.</p> <p>So it is timely that Chinese president Xi Jinping is visiting the UK at the moment, with David Cameron and foreign secretary Philip Hammond both saying the issue of steel production will be raised.</p> <p>We are live blogging the president\u2019s visit here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/oct/20/xi-jinping-visit-uk-royal-banquet-prepared-as-mps-set-to-greet-chinese-president-live\">Xi Jinping visit: UK royal banquet prepared as MPs set to greet Chinese president - live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5625f636e4b0c066531aceaf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T08:07:49.094Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a graphic which shows one of the problems facing the steel industry:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/steel_price-zip/giv-31114z5wb4XzN5NcE/\" data-alt=\"Steel prices.\"> <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/steel_price-zip/giv-31114z5wb4XzN5NcE/\">Steel prices.</a> <figcaption>Steel prices.</figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5625f2e1e4b0c19d83256d83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T07:56:57.521Z\">8.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other MPs are wading into the steel crisis.</p> <p>Scunthorpe Labour MP Nic Dakin told Radio 5 Live:</p> <blockquote> <p>Nobody\u2019s asking for subsidies here.

UK prime minister David Cameron has promised to raise the issue during the four day visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping.</p> <p>Selling cheap steel has also caused problems for Chinese companies. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote> <p>While the weakness of commodity prices has its upsides, in the form of low inflation, we are now starting to see the downsides with job losses across the board in global manufacturing, not only in the UK, but in the US as well, while China has bailed out one of its own state owned commodity miners, in the form of Sinosteel, which has been haemorrhaging cash hand over fist, as it sells steel below market prices. </p> </blockquote> <p>Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The story on the Chinese SOE Sinosteel... is gathering steam with a Bloomberg article noting moments ago that the company delayed an interest payment on its Yuan dominated bonds due today. The same story suggests that the Chinese regulator and State Council are working with all related parties in order to try to prevent a default. Certainly a noteworthy story testing China\u2019s commitment to allowing market reform.</p> </blockquote> <p>With the UK government reluctant to bail out the industry, perhaps China\u2019s perceived willingness to act could be something else for Cameron and Xi Jinping to discuss. <br></p> <p>Elsewhere today we have results from Asos, InterContinental Hotels and Whitbread, while Bank of England governor is up before the Treasury Select Committee this morning.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T06:45:26.935Z\">at 7.45am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The outlet, branded as the Starbucks Reserve bar, is to be the first of the US retailer\u2019s UK outlets to serve fresh food such as pastries, salads and sharing platters of cheeses, meats and flatbread. An evening menu will offer beer and wine. Customers at the new coffee bar, on Upper St Martin\u2019s Lane, will take a seat \u2013 rather than stand in a queue \u2013 from where they will be able to order from a handheld device. Rhys Iley, vice-president of operations for Starbucks in the UK and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions (EMEA), said the inspiration for the store was the success of a new roastery that had opened this year in the company\u2019s home town, Seattle, in America. \u201cLondon is the most competitive coffee market \u2013 bar none,\u201d Iley said. Starbucks said its five brewing systems included machines such as the Clover, which uses vacuum press technology, a hand-crafted manual espresso machine called the Black Eagle, as well as the Syphon, Chemex and Pour Over. Iley said the beers sold were from London breweries, in Hackney and Battersea, and the wines were from vineyards in Washington state in the US. Ad De Hond, vice-president of the store design for Starbucks for EMEA regions, said of the new store opening in the West End of London: \u201cWe wanted to create a buzz with the design that focuses on a sensorial experience and reflects our commitment to creating and presenting the highest quality and innovation.\u201d The Reserve coffees, which are limited and in small batches from small farms, includes the Brazil Santa Ines with notes of plantain and milk chocolate, as well as the Uganda Sipi Falls, an arabica bean with a lemony, caramel flavour. Starbucks said customers at the new store would be able to use the latest technology such as mobile order and pay, Powermat wireless charging for mobiles and tablets and 100MB per second Wi-Fi.",

      "bodyText": "The latest grim chapter in the long, slow death of Britain\u2019s steel industry may have been decided in India, but it was scripted in Beijing. Tata Steel, owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata Group, has been hammered by a toxic cocktail of high green taxes on emissions, a strong pound, slowing demand and cheap Chinese competition. About half of the 1.6bn tonnes of steel made globally each year comes from China, giving it huge pricing power. In the past 18 months, China has flooded the market with cheap, subsidised steel as its economic growth has slowed. Beijing wants to grab whatever foreign cash it can on global markets by selling its products at a knockdown rate. Gareth Stace, director of the industry body UK Steel, said: \u201cChinese steelmakers are fully subsidised by the Chinese government and their regions.\u201d With the might of the state underwriting the industry, Chinese producers can afford to turn the taps on and sell below cost price. Consequently, exports of steel from China nearly doubled to 88.6m tonnes in the year to the end of 2014 \u2013 more than the combined annual production of Mexico and Canada. The pace at which China has pumped steel into export markets has accelerated again this year: September was a record month in which it exported 11.5m tonnes, almost as much as Britain\u2019s total annual steel production. It puts China on course to report steel exports of about 110m tonnes by the end of this year. There is also evidence that this lower quality Chinese steel is being snapped up by bargain-hunting British users, as imports of Chinese steel into the UK have quadrupled from 2% to 8% in the past three years. The glut of discounted metal has virtually halved the steel price in the past 12 months. Ministers insist they are powerless to hold back the rising tide of Chinese metal, noting that the government is bound by EU rules which prevent the state intervening in such matters. Despite this, Stace says ministers could, and should, do more to ensure high-profile British infrastructure projects, such as the High Speed 2 rail line, are encouraged to use homegrown steel. \u201cWe have been warning the government about this for years. In any public procurement, there should be greater weighting given to the local economic benefits created,\u201d Stace said. \u201cThese factors need to be able to be taken into account under procurement rules. To let Scunthorpe wither on the vine would be extremely short-sighted. We need quality steel made in the UK for the UK market.\u201d This wave of cheap steel crashing on to the world market has sent shockwaves through higher-cost western producers. Some, such as Caparo Industries, which collapsed this week, and SSI UK, which owned the doomed Redcar plant on Teesside, have already succumbed to Chinese pressure; others, like Tata\u2019s Scunthorpe-based long products operation, are on life support. Tata confirmed on Tuesday that it is cutting almost 1,200 jobs as part of a radical shakeup of its long products division, which makes steel for the rail and construction sectors. The company\u2019s Scunthorpe steel mill will bear the brunt, as 900 jobs will be axed there, while two satellite operations in Scotland will be effectively shut. The latest round of blood-letting means almost 15% of the British steel industry\u2019s 30,000-strong workforce has been axed this year. The North Lincolnshire plant has fallen victim because it is no longer cost-effective to keep churning out such basic products in Britain. Tata\u2019s other big UK plant, at Port Talbot in south Wales, makes higher grade, speciality steel for use in the booming automotive and aerospace sectors and for high-value consumer packaging. The Indian conglomerate has long signalled its intentions for its UK operations \u2013 Scunthorpe has received little investment, while it has pumped \u00a3300m into Port Talbot in the past three years to make it one of the most efficient steel mills in Europe. One industry source said: \u201cTata want to protect Port Talbot. They have spent a lot of money there and they want to keep that.\u201d The omens are not good for Scunthorpe, as sources continued to suggest that Tata could ultimately close down the site unless it finds a white knight to rescue the steel mill. A happy ending for British steel appears unlikely.",

They have spent a lot of money there and they want to keep that.\u201d</p> <p>The omens are not good for Scunthorpe, as sources continued to suggest that Tata could ultimately close down the site unless it finds a white knight to rescue the steel mill. A happy ending for British steel appears unlikely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two-thirds of Germans say they still trust Volkswagen despite the emissions rigging scandal that has engulfed the carmaker, according to a survey. Sixty-five percent of respondents in a poll conducted earlier this month thought the scandal had been exaggerated and that VW still built excellent cars, according to the management consultancy Prophet, which carried out the research. Three quarters said they would still buy a VW car if they liked the vehicle and the price, and 63% expected the affair to be largely forgotten within a year. Volkswagen admitted in September that it has been cheating in diesel emissions tests by using a software defeat device that made 11m cars worldwide appear less polluting under lab conditions than they were on the road. The admission followed the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s finding that VW diesel cars in the US emitted up to 40 times the permitted level of nitrogen oxides than allowed. Research has linked high levels of the gases to 9,500 premature deaths a year in London. The online survey of 1,000 people, which took place two weeks after news of the scandal broke, found 91% of respondents believed other carmakers were also probably manipulating emissions tests and that VW was just the first to be found out. Sixty percent did not expect any long-term damage to the \u201cmade in Germany\u201d brand. A Prophet spokesman said the company had not expected the response to be so positive for VW. \u201cThe quality of the cars is not questioned,\u201d said Felix St\u00f6ckle. \u201cThe long-term damage to the brand could be much smaller than many observers predict today.\u201d After the scandal broke some predicted a severe decline in the value of the VW brand, which tends to be one of the most trusted in Germany. UK-based Brand Finance estimated that losses could reach 30%, making it worth $21bn (\u00a313.6bn). Swiss-based Interbrand, which measures brand value differently, suggested the loss was likely to be much smaller, down 9% to $12.5bn. Volkswagen sold more than 594,000 cars in Germany in the first six months of this year, making it the company\u2019s second-biggest market after China, where it sold 1.74m vehicles.",

    "webTitle": "Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler's tax avoidance deals to be ruled illegal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler are expected to be billed for tens of millions of euros in additional taxes as the European commission prepares to rule that they had unlawful deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Starbucks has for years made the Netherlands its European hub while Fiat has based a lucrative internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg. In both cases, the multinationals approached the local tax authorities to seek assurances that their controversial tax structures in these countries would not be challenged. These assurances \u2013 often known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d \u2013 are expected to be torn up on Wednesday when Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, confirms the commission has concluded that the two tax rulings constitute illegal state aid. The decision into the sweetheart tax deals follows a 15-month investigation. At the heart of the dispute over Starbucks\u2019s tax rulings is the amount of taxable profits the US group attributes to a bean-roasting subsidiary in Amsterdam. Because of favourable tax treatments available in the Netherlands, the coffee group\u2019s tax planners have been keen to ensure as much of its income as possible is channelled through the country. But the commission is expected to say Starbucks artificially inflated the internal price at which its Dutch roastery bought beans from another Starbucks company in Switzerland. The Financial Times, citing sources close to the investigation, estimated the group\u2019s likely additional tax bill could be about \u20ac30m (\u00a322m). The decision against Fiat\u2019s sweetheart tax deal is expected to be more costly. In both cases, additional tax would be payable to the authorities in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Tax campaigners say this is inappropriate because these countries have effectively allowed the multinationals to avoid tax that should have arisen elsewhere. Fiat and Starbucks are believed to have been paying a fraction of the headline tax rates in Luxembourg and the Netherlands for many years. Both nations are among the most successful at persuading multinationals to relocate their European hub operations within their borders. Under European state aid regulations, investigations into tax rulings have no powers to tackle tax avoidance directly. They can only intervene if it can be demonstrated that any such avoidance was part of a sweetheart deal and therefore not available to competitor firms. Many senior European politicians have called for stronger powers to tackle prolific tax ruling programmes in several member states. Luxembourg became the focus of criticism after the LuxLeaks scandal exposed the industrial scale on which such rulings were being granted there. The Grand Duchy felt it had been unfairly singled out, arguing it used generous tax policies to attract inward investment just as other countries did. The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was previously prime minister of Luxembourg, responded to the LuxLeaks scandal by pressing for greater coordination on taxation between member states, ultimately allowing multinationals to file a single European tax return. Such plans are fiercely resisted by several countries, including Britain and Ireland, and are unlikely to receive the required unanimity among member states to be adopted. The action on tax rulings awarded to Starbucks and Fiat is not expected to be the last word from Brussels\u2019 state aid investigators. These will soon be followed by decisions on more controversial cases involving Amazon\u2019s tax affairs in Luxembourg and Apple\u2019s arrangements in Ireland. Starbucks, which has shifted its European corporate headquarters in the UK, said it \u201ccontinues to cooperate with the commission\u2019s state aid investigation in the Netherlands\u201d. Fiat Chrysler said an agreement it reached with the government of Luxembourg was aimed only at clarifying pricing rules and \u201cdid not result in any state aid.\u201d",

Luxembourg became the focus of criticism after the LuxLeaks scandal exposed the industrial scale on which such rulings were being granted there. The Grand Duchy felt it had been unfairly singled out, arguing it used generous tax policies to attract inward investment just as other countries did.</p> <p>The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was previously prime minister of Luxembourg, responded to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">LuxLeaks scandal</a> by pressing for greater coordination on taxation between member states, ultimately allowing multinationals to file a single European tax return. Such plans are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/uk-reject-eu-plans-combat-multinational-tax-avoidance\">fiercely resisted</a> by several countries, including Britain and Ireland, and are unlikely to receive the required unanimity among member states to be adopted.</p> <p>The action on tax rulings awarded to Starbucks and Fiat is not expected to be the last word from Brussels\u2019 state aid investigators. These will soon be followed by decisions on more controversial cases involving <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1105_en.htm\">Amazon\u2019s tax affairs in Luxembourg</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=3_SA_38373\">Apple\u2019s arrangements in Ireland</a>. </p> <p>Starbucks, which has shifted its European corporate headquarters in the UK, said it \u201ccontinues to cooperate with the commission\u2019s state aid investigation in the Netherlands\u201d.</p> <p>Fiat Chrysler said an agreement it reached with the government of Luxembourg was aimed only at clarifying pricing rules and \u201cdid not result in any state aid.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Top policymakers at the Bank of England have defended last week\u2019s dramatic government U-turnto water down rules intended to make top bosses of banks more accountable for their actions. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Andrew Bailey - one of his deputies who runs the Bank\u2019s regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority - also defended the implementation of rules intended to separate high street banks from riskier investment banking operations following Sir John Vickers\u2019 proposals in 2011. MPs on the Treasury select committee asked them about the sudden move by the government last week to remove a rule placing the onus on bosses to prove they had done the right thing. Instead, the regulator will now have to prove the case against bank chiefs. Bailey cited warnings that the proposed new rules could have breached European human rights regulations. This reversal of the burden of proof was only legislated for in 2013 after the government implemented the findings of the parliamentary commission on banking standards which was set up in the wake of the Libor rigging crisis. That commission was chaired by Conservatives MP Andrew Tyrie, who also chairs the Treasury select committee. The changes to burden of proof on bosses is part of the new so-called senior manager and certification regime which is a response to the face that bosses escaped action from regulators following the 2008 banking crisis. \u201cI am worried this piece of the regime might not work,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a regime which has a flaw in it which they [banks and lawyers] can exploit.\u201d In response to accusations from John Mann, a Labour MP on the committee, that he had changed his tune, Bailey said he had changed his mind \u201cin that there are signs of developments in the way people are approaching this regime which introduces unhelpful behaviour\u201d.\u201d Bailey insisted the changes being introduced would give the regulators more power than in the past. Senior mangers will be subject to a \u201cduty of responsibility\u201d clause requiring them to take steps to prevent a regulatory breach. Bailey said that in the past the regulator would have to prove a boss had signed a loan agreement, for example, which had gone wrong. The new rules are a key plank of the recommendations of the parliamentary commission on banking standards which was set up after the 2012 Libor-rigging scandal. Carney told MPs the new senior manager regime had \u201cmorphed into a legal discussion\u201d and not focused on the changes needed to reform banking culture. \u201cThere was too much noise about it. It needed to change,\u201d said Bailey. The rules will be extended from bankers \u2013 who are are subject to the regime from next March \u2013 to 60,000 firms from 2018. Bailey also denied that the ringfencing rules from the Vickers commission in 2011 had been watered down. A consultation paper was issued by the PRA last week setting how the ringfenced bank would operate when the rules come into force in 2019. It allowed the ringfenced bank to pay dividends to its parent company if it had enough capital to do so, a move which was interpreted as a relaxation. Banks had been braced for rules prohibiting the release of any such payments to the parent company. Carney admitted that it would be \u201cmiracle\u201d if all the regulatory changes introduced after the crisis had not either gone too far or missed out an important area. He pointed to the EU cap on bonuses and the leverage ratio as potential areas to revisit. He also repeated warnings about the ability of the National Audit Office to judge if the Bank was good value for money. The MPs on the select committee had called Carney and Bailey to give evidence on the banking bill currently going through parliament which will bring in changes to way the Bank is structured.",

It is the first time a woman is at the top of the annual list, which has been compiled by the networking group OUTstanding and the Financial Times. She is one of few openly bisexual business leaders and the first to top the ranking. Christopher Bailey, the chief executive of fashion house Burberry, who won the title last year, is in eighth place. Alan Joyce, chief executive of Australian airline Qantas, has made his first appearance in the power list, coming second, followed by Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, who heads up HSBC\u2019s UK bank, in third place. Martine Rothblatt, the chief executive of US biotech firm United Therapeutics, is the highest ranking transgender executive, in fourth place. The list is designed to highlight lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender role models in business to encourage more people to be open in the workplace. Research shows that 32% of transgender workers think coming out would have a negative effect on promotions, and 90% report mistreatment or harassment at work. Beale, an industry veteran who became chief executive of the insurance market in January 2014 \u2013 the first female CEO in its 327-year history \u2013 said: \u201cI am proud of the commitment of Lloyd\u2019s and the London insurance market to celebrate diversity and ensure we are an attractive, globally relevant and inclusive sector. Inclusion is the foundation of innovation, and having an open, accepting and diverse workforce will enable us to succeed in a changing and challenging world.\u201d Beale has launched a market modernisation programme at Lloyd\u2019s, opened offices in Dubai and Beijing and spearheaded the Inclusion@Lloyd\u2019s initiative. She has also been involved in the launch of Pride@Lloyds, an internal LGBT employee resource group. Sim\u00f5es said: \u201cI believe that the best performing and truly customer-focused businesses will be those who have a meritocratic culture. To achieve this, companies need to encourage different ways of thinking from people with a mix of backgrounds and beliefs that reflect today\u2019s society.\u201d The Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg topped a separate ranking, the top 30 Ally Executives list, for his work championing LGBT diversity in his organisation and globally. The UK entrepreneur Richard Branson, who won the title last year, came second. Those in the top 100 were nominated by peers and colleagues. Nominations were reviewed by OUTstanding\u2019s judging panel, which included the former BP chief executive John Browne. OUTstanding\u2019s founder and chief executive, Suki Sandhu, said: \u201cCompared to 2013, we see far more people wanting to be associated with the lists \u2013 this year we have 42 brand new additions to the top 100 alone.

In a carefully trailed lecture at St Peter\u2019s College in Oxford, Carney is expected to discuss the implications of Brexit for the Bank\u2019s key tasks of controlling inflation and protecting financial stability. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that Bank officials were secretly working on \u201cProject Bookend\u201d, an assessment of the potential implications if Britain\u2019s voters opt to leave the EU in the referendum due to be held by the end of 2017. Alonside the governor\u2019s speech on Wednesday afternoon, the Bank plans to publish a detailed report highlighting some of the findings. Any hints about the Bank\u2019s stance will shake up the highly charged political debate about Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe, in which both sides are already trading claims and counter-claims about the economic impacts of leaving the EU. Jon Cunliffe, one of Carney\u2019s deputies, will brief journalists about the details of the speech. Bank of England governors have traditionally steered well clear of politically contentious topics, but Carney has made a series of controversial pronouncements on public policy. In 2014, he warned Scottish voters about the financial consequences of independence and more recently told UK plc it had to wake up to the urgency of climate change.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Waitrose has quit the John Lewis-owned supermarket chain and is said to be lined up as the next chairman of Channel 4. John Lewis said Mark Price will leave in April after 33 years at the employee-owned retailer. Price is the managing director of Waitrose and deputy chairman of its parent company, the John Lewis Partnership. Price is the leading candidate to take over as head of Channel 4 when Lord Burns, the current chairman, steps down, Sky News reported. If appointed, Price will lead the broadcaster through a potential \u00a31bn privatisation. Price, known as the \u201cChubby Grocer\u201d, has been Channel 4\u2019s deputy chairman since July 2013. Rob Collins, Waitrose\u2019s retail director, will take over from Price. The John Lewis chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, hailed Price\u2019s \u201clong and distinguished career\u201d with the employee-owned retailer, saying his leadership of Waitrose had been an \u201coutstanding success\u201d. While Price was \u201cpursuing new opportunities\u201d, he would remain \u201ca passionate advocate of the partnership and its ownership model,\u201d Mayfield added. On Price\u2019s successor, the John Lewis chairman said Collins has been a central figure in Waitrose\u2019s management team for a number of years and has been a key part of the board\u2019s thinking on succession planning for some time. \u201cI\u2019m confident that he will make the step-up to the managing director role quickly and effectively.\u201d The deadline for applicants for the Channel 4 chairman role closes in November and Ofcom has made it clear thar it intends to appoint a successor to Burns before his tenure runs out at the end of January. Channel 4 and Ofcom had held discussions about making Price interim chairman until a successor for Burns can be found. Ofcom had recommended that Burns stay on for about a year beyond the end of his second term in the post, which is scheduled to conclude on 27 January. But this idea was rejected by ministers, who are believed to be considering a \u00a31bn privatisation of the state-owned broadcaster. Last month, a government official was photographed leaving Downing Street with a confidential document outlining plans for a potential sell-off. Burns had put together plans examining the possibility of turning Channel 4 into a mutual, keeping its public service broadcaster remit.",

    "webTitle": "Tata Steel confirms 1,200 job losses as industry crisis deepens", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than one in six workers in Britain\u2019s steel industry is facing the axe after Tata Steel confirmed it was cutting 1,200 jobs. The announcement increases pressure on the government over its handling of the crisis. Tata, which owns the remnants of the former British Steel, blamed cheap Chinese imports, the strong pound and high electricity costs for its decision to stop production of steel plate. About 900 jobs will be lost at Scunthorpe and 270 in Scotland with the rest going at other UK sites. Plate mills will be mothballed in Scunthorpe, Dalzell in Motherwell, and Clydebridge in Cambuslang, near Glasgow. One of two coke ovens at the Scunthorpe works will also be closed. Workers have been waiting for official news of the cuts as speculation mounted about Tata\u2019s plans. Karl K\u00f6hler, chief executive of Tata Steel\u2019s European operations, said: \u201cI realise how distressing this news will be for all those affected. We have looked at all other options before proposing these changes. \u201cThe UK steel industry is struggling for survival in the face of extremely challenging market conditions. This industry has a crucial role to play in rebalancing the UK economy, but we need a fairer system to encourage growth. \u201cThe European commission needs to do much more to deal with unfairly traded imports \u2013 inaction threatens the future of the entire European steel industry.\u201d John McKenna, who worked at Ravenscraig steel works before it closed in 1992 and joined Dalzell eight years ago, said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed they\u2019ve decided to treat us this way. There\u2019s a good workforce here. There\u2019s a future if the government wants to make it that way.\u201d The management team at Tata\u2019s Scunthorpe steel mill are eyeing a buyout of the loss-making plant, according to sources. The Indian conglomerate has been trying to offload its Scunthorpe-based long products division since a sale to the billionaire industrialist Gary Klesch, owner of the Klesch group of global industrial commodities, fell through in August. Fears are growing for the future of the North Lincolnshire plant. One source said that Tata wanted to close the site and focus its resources on its sister operation in Port Talbot. The source said: \u201cThe market will not change. I think they [Tata] are discussing various things to see if other people buy it [Scunthorpe]. At least they are giving it a try.\u201d He said Tata was not currently in talks with any potential buyers, but noted that it has discussed the possibility of a management buyout by the team currently in charge of the Scunthorpe steel mill. \u201cThey might be talking about a management buyout. But who is going to fund them [management] when the prognosis is so bad?\u201d Tata could not be reached to comment about a possible management buyout of the Scunthorpe mill. The trade body UK Steel said the closure of Dalzell would have strategic implications for Britain\u2019s defence policy. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \u201cDalzell is the only site in the UK capable of rolling steel for use in the Trident replacement and for armour plating for the armed forces. Does [the defence secretary] Michael Fallon understand that if that site closes, the army and navy will have to go abroad for steel that is used for national security purposes? It\u2019s a really significant issue.\u201d Andrew Crawford, who had worked at the Dalzell plant for 26 years since the age of 20, said he was devastated by the news. \u201cMy dad worked there. I\u2019ve had friends just retire and there are young kids in there with families. They as good as said it was the end of the steel industry in Scotland this morning. The way they spoke about the Chinese imports, that\u2019s how it was explained to us.\u201d The job losses at Tata, which employs 17,000 people in the UK, follow the announcement this month that SSI, the Thai owner of the Redcar steelworks on Teesside, had gone into liquidation with the loss of 2,200 jobs. On Monday, Caparo Industries went into administration, putting up to 1,700 jobs on the line. In total, about 5,100 jobs are threatened out of just under 30,000 employed in the steel industry. Tata has already said more than 1,000 job would go at Llanwern and Port Talbot in south Wales and Rotherham, South Yorkshire. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, was called to the House of Commons to defend the government\u2019s reaction to the industry\u2019s woes. Responding to an emergency question from Labour, he said the government would not stand by while workers lost their jobs but announced no new measures to support the industry. Javid also played down the role of cheap imports from China, whose president, Xi Jinping, is visiting the UK, in forcing down prices. \u201cNo government can change the price of steel in the global market. No government can dictate foreign exchange rates\u201d or break European rules on state aid, Javid said. \u201cChina is one of those countries \u2013 the main one in terms of overcapacity in the market. There is a recession in Brazil, there is also Russia \u2026 It\u2019s a wider problem than just China.\u201d Kevin Brennan, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThey seem content to let Britain\u2019s steel industry disappear in the face of Chinese dumping. While the Chinese president is riding down the Mall in a gilded state coach, British workers are being laid off because our government is not standing up for them.\u201d Ian Wright, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, near Redcar, said Javid\u2019s proposed long-term plan for the steel industry would be obsolete without immediate action. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t take urgent action now, in days, there won\u2019t be a British steel industry left by the end of the year,\u201d Wright said. Britain\u2019s steel industry has been battered by falling steel prices, high energy costs, cheap imports and the strength of the pound, which has made exports expensive. Tata said imports of steel plate into Europe had doubled in the past two years and imports from China had quadrupled. The steel crisis threatens severe knock-on effects, with jobs threatened throughout the supply chain for the industry. In addition, many towns with steel plants rely on the sector\u2019s skilled workers to spend money in local shops and other businesses. Tom Westley, chairman of the Westley Group foundry business, said the government needed to come up with a strategy for the steel industry. In the short run, ministers might need to intervene, despite European state aid constraints, to save the industry, he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWhen prices of products become so low ... you have to have a longer-term strategy. Perhaps we have got to give some level of subsidy to keep this industry alive and look at it as a national asset rather than [in terms of] costs. You have got to take a sensible view about whether it is sensible to drive people out of business.\u201d",

Tata <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/26/tata-steel-to-cut-as-many-as-250-jobs-in-south-wales\">has already said more than 1,000 job would go </a>at Llanwern and Port Talbot in south Wales and Rotherham, South Yorkshire.</p> <p>The business secretary, Sajid Javid, was called to the House of Commons to defend the government\u2019s reaction to the industry\u2019s woes. </p> <p>Responding to an emergency question from Labour, he said the government would not stand by while workers lost their jobs but announced no new measures to support the industry. Javid also played down the role of cheap imports from China, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/xi-jinping-uk-visit-pro-china-groups-blocked-drummers-protest\">whose president, Xi Jinping</a>, is visiting the UK, in forcing down prices.</p> <p>\u201cNo government can change the price of steel in the global market. No government can dictate foreign exchange rates\u201d or break European rules on state aid, Javid said. \u201cChina is one of those countries \u2013 the main one in terms of overcapacity in the market. There is a recession in Brazil, there is also Russia \u2026 It\u2019s a wider problem than just China.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Brennan, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThey seem content to let Britain\u2019s steel industry disappear in the face of Chinese dumping. While the Chinese president is riding down the Mall in a gilded state coach, British workers are being laid off because our government is not standing up for them.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Wright, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, near Redcar, said Javid\u2019s proposed long-term plan for the steel industry would be obsolete without immediate action.</p> <p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t take urgent action now, in days, there won\u2019t be a British steel industry left by the end of the year,\u201d Wright said.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s steel industry has been battered by falling steel prices, high energy costs, cheap imports and the strength of the pound, which has made exports expensive. Tata said imports of steel plate into Europe had doubled in the past two years and imports from China had quadrupled.</p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/steel_price-zip/giv-31114z5wb4XzN5NcE\" data-alt=\"Global steel prices since 2008\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/steel_price-zip/giv-31114z5wb4XzN5NcE\">Global steel prices since 2008</a> <figcaption>Global steel prices since 2008</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The steel crisis threatens severe knock-on effects, with jobs threatened throughout the supply chain for the industry.

In the short run, ministers might need to intervene, despite European state aid constraints, to save the industry, he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. </p> <p>\u201cWhen prices of products become so low ... you have to have a longer-term strategy.

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government has announced a raft of changes in response to the financial system inquiry led by former Commonwealth Bank chief David Murray, but what does it mean for you? Credit card holders Undoubtedly the measure the government wants to put up in lights is the planned law banning surcharges that are above the reasonable costs faced by merchants in accepting cards. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) would be put in charge of enforcing the ban. It would not end surcharges altogether, but would aim to increase pressure on businesses \u2013 including retailers, hotels and airlines \u2013 not to slug customers with surcharges at the point of sale that go well beyond the actual cost involved. It\u2019s not the first time action has been promised on credit card transaction fees. In March 2013, the Reserve Bank allowed card schemes such as MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Diners Club to limit surcharges to \u201cthe reasonable cost of acceptance\u201d \u2013 but consumer groups argue this has proved ineffective. Matt Levey, director of campaigns for Choice, said: \u201cWe were hopeful initially but it quickly became clear that it needed a cop on the beat.\u201d The Murray report found that the existing rules were \u201cdifficult for system providers to enforce, potentially complex for merchants to comply with and can cause frustration for consumers, as evidenced by the more than 5,000 submissions the inquiry received on the matter\u201d. The proposed legislation is yet to be developed, but the government is working to a timeframe of mid next year. People with home loans The big-picture recommendations in the Murray review included tougher capital standards for banks so that the institutions are \u201cunquestionably strong\u201d and better able to withstand the next financial crisis. There are also changes to mortgage risk weights, which are being overseen by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA). While these measures are intended to improve the resilience of the banks, people with mortgages might see an increase in their historically low interest rates. Westpac last week announced it was raising its home loan rates by 0.2 percentage points from 20 November, citing regulatory changes that would increase the amount of capital to be held against mortgages. But there are other options. Numerous banks, including Westpac, have also announced plans to raise billions of dollars of capital from investors. The government played down suggestions the changes should lead banks to increase interest rates, although the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was \u201cultimately a matter for them and of course for the market\u201d. The chief executive of the Australian Bankers\u2019 Association, Steven M\u00fcnchenberg, said the costs associated with keeping the banking system safe would be \u201cshared amongst shareholders and customers\u201d. \u201cI know people sitting around the kitchen table won\u2019t buy this but if we have a strong banking system when the next crisis hits, people won\u2019t lose their jobs and so you can see these additional costs as an investment in a more secure future,\u201d he told the ABC. Workers with superannuation accounts Workers might have to pay more attention to their superannuation accounts, with the government promising to increase \u201cchoice\u201d in the system. Specifically, the government wants to open up choices for employees by targeting the deemed choice of fund which may be specified in enterprise agreements and workplace awards. The Productivity Commission will also be asked to look at \u201ccompetitive processes\u201d for allocating default fund members to products. Industry super funds are raising concerns about the government\u2019s push. David Whiteley, the chief executive of Industry Super Australia, said the Coalition was also trying to change governance arrangements for industry super funds, whose boards typically included an equal number of employer and employee representatives. \u201cIndustry super funds look at the governance changes and the bank lobbying on default super as a concerted effort to dismantle the industry super fund model \u2013industry super funds who have achieved superior returns to their members over the long term,\u201d Whiteley said. Superannuation funds Super funds face changes mentioned above, but they will not face a clampdown on their borrowings at this stage. This is because the government rejected a recommendation that the Murray report said would \u201cprevent the unnecessary build-up of risk in the superannuation system and the financial system more broadly\u201d. The report raised concerns about the emerging trend of superannuation funds using so-called \u201climited recourse\u201d borrowing arrangements to buy assets, which increased the risk to taxpayers who underwrote adverse outcomes through the provision of the age pension. Such borrowings increased from $497m in June 2009 to $8.7bn in June 2014, the report said, arguing the global financial crisis highlighted the benefits of Australia\u2019s relatively unleveraged super system. The government said there were \u201canecdotal concerns\u201d about the borrowing but \u201cat this time the government does not consider the data sufficient to justify significant policy intervention\u201d. It pledged to continue to monitor the situation. Innovators The government is drafting legislation for crowd-sourcing funding, saying this will help start-ups secure cash to finance their business in the early stages of development. The Murray report noted the global rise of projects or businesses raising small amounts of money from the \u2018crowd\u2019 via an online platform. \u201cThe risks associated with crowd-funding investments would require some adjustments to consumer protections, including capping individuals\u2019 investments and clearly communicating the risks,\u201d the report said. The government is due to consult on the legislation by the end of the year. Labor said it had already indicated it would support urgent passage of such legislation but the Coalition kept \u201cre-announcing\u201d the plans. The government is also planning to clarify regulatory powers for new payment systems, such as the digital currency Bitcoin and others systems as they emerge. Financial planners Financial advisers will be required by law to hold a degree, pass an exam, undertake continuous professional development, subscribe to a code of ethics and undertake a professional year. The use of the term \u201cfinancial adviser\u201d and \u201cfinancial planner\u201d will be restricted to people listed on the recently established register of financial advisers. The government is also planning to provide the Australian Securities and Investments Commission with the power to intervene \u201cto modify, or if necessary, ban harmful financial products where there is a risk of significant consumer detriment\u201d. But the government stopped short of fully embracing the inquiry\u2019s recommendation for particular changes to better align the interests of financial firms and consumers. It will instead support the retail life industry\u2019s proposed reforms pending a government review in 2018, at which point it will consider further changes.",
