      "bodyText": "George Osborne, has warned that the standoff between Greece and the eurozone over the country\u2019s debt is \u201cthe greatest risk to the global economy\u201d after meeting the new Greek finance minister. The chancellor hosted a meeting at 11 Downing Street with his Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, who, just a week after being elected, is on a whistlestop tour of Europe to win support for renegotiating Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn (\u00a3181bn) bailout. \u201cWe had a constructive discussion, and it is clear that the standoff between Greece and the eurozone is the greatest risk to the global economy,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cI urge the Greek finance minister to act responsibly but it\u2019s also important that the eurozone has a better plan for jobs and growth. \u201cIt is a rising threat to the British economy. And we have got to make sure that in Europe, as in Britain, we choose competence over chaos.\u201d Varoufakis, fresh from talks in France on Sunday, was in London before meetings with the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, and the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. Varoufakis expressed optimism that a deal could be achieved within days. \u201cThere will be a deal within a very short space of time that is going to make it perfectly clear to everyone that Greece can play within the rules and in a way that puts the Greek crisis away, once and for all,\u201d he told Channel 4 News. The economist, who was appointed finance minister last week after anti-austerity party Syriza swept to power, has offered to produce proposals for a reworked debt deal within a month. He has appointed Lazard, the US investment bank, to advise on Greece\u2019s negotiations about its debt, which amounts to more than 175% of GDP. Syriza insists it will make good on its promises to halve Greece\u2019s debt obligations and scrap a range of swingeing budget measures that were imposed in exchange for the loans. It has already started to step back from some of the measures attached to the bailout by freezing the sell-off of public companies and raising the minimum wage. In an interview with the Financial Times, Varoufakis said he would create new growth-linked bonds to swap for outstanding debt, run a permanent budget surplus and target wealthy tax evaders. \u201cWhat I\u2019ll say to our partners is that we are putting together a combination of a primary budget surplus and a reform agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Help us to reform our country and give us some fiscal space to do this, otherwise we shall continue to suffocate and become a deformed rather than a reformed Greece\u2019.\u201d The current bailout programme officially expires on 28 February but it is widely hoped the deadline will be extended so the European Central Bank is allowed to continue providing funding for Greek banks. Athens wants a bridging deal to allow time for a new, more manageable debt agreement to be negotiated. But Varoufakis and his party face opposition from Germany, where leader Angela Merkel has ruled out further debt cuts from its creditor nations. A Greek government official lashed out at Britain\u2019s Economist magazine on Monday for suggesting Greece was threatening Germany with a front cover featuring the Venus de Milo statue brandishing a gun and the caption \u201cGo ahead, Angela, make my day\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s completely obnoxious and ridiculous to suggest we could blackmail Europe,\u201d the official said. Greece\u2019s new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is also touring European capitals. On his first stop in Cyprus, \u201cWe are in substantial negotiations with our partners in Europe and those that have lent to us. We have obligations towards them,\u201d Tsipras said at a news conference. He ruled out seeking aid from Russia, which had suggested it would be open to calls for help from Athens. But he welcomed the news that the EU was considering axing the deeply unpopular troika of international auditors representing the country\u2019s creditors calling it a \u201cmature and necessary development for Europe\u201d. He was backed by Nikos Anastasiades, the president of Cyprus, who said the troika\u2019s demise would be a \u201cpositive institutional step.\u201d Like Greece, the Cypriot economy is regularly monitored by troika officials since its economic meltdown two years ago. Tsipras\u2019s party Syriza won the election on a promise to ditch the strict austerity cuts tied to Greece\u2019s bailout from the troika of lenders \u2013 the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. But some commentators have warned he will not be able to align his anti-austerity vow to voters with an ambition to stay in the eurozone. They warn that Brussels officials will be loth to set any precedents by forgiving Greek debt. \u201cTsipras really is between a rock and a hard place. He has two basic choices. Either he effectively breaks his election promises and accepts the troika\u2019s conditions for continued financial support \u2026 or Greece leaves the euro,\u201d said Ruth Lea, economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group. \u201cThere is still enormous political will within the commission, France and Germany for keeping Greece within the eurozone. But not at any price \u2013 and certainly not at the price of tearing up the rule book for euro membership.\u201d Germany has been adamant that eurozone creditor nations must hold the line on Greece\u2019s debt. Merkel has said Tsipras would be a \u201cwelcome guest\u201d in Berlin. The two leaders will meet at a European summit on 12 February if not before.The US president, Barack Obama, added to the debate in a CNN interview, saying: \u201cYou cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression. At some point, there has to be a growth strategy in order to pay off their debts and eliminate some of their deficits.\u201d His comments brought relief to Greek stockmarkets where the main ATG index gained more than 4%. Yields on Greek government bonds came off their highs as signs of a more conciliatory approach from the new government eased fears in debt markets over the chances of a default or restructuring.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The loss-making Co-operative Group was poised to name the former Royal Mail boss Allan Leighton as the new chairman at Britain\u2019s biggest mutual. Leighton, who has held a string of high-profile roles, from chief executive of Asda supermarkets to chairman of housebuilder Wilson Connolly, was in advanced talks to fill the role at the embattled group. An agreement was expected on his appointment on Monday, which would mark a key stage in the overhaul of the Co-op. The group, home to a chain of supermarkets and funeral homes, has been mired in controversy since the discovery of a \u00a31.4bn hole in its banking operation in 2013. This sparked a string of scandals and led to a series of reports into what went wrong at a business that could once lay claim to a presence in every UK postcode. The scale of the problems in the bank forced the wider group to cut its ownership of the once-prized asset to just 20% and rely on hedge funds to plug the capital shortfall. Its reputation was also damaged when the bank\u2019s chairman, Paul Flowers, was exposed for buying illegal drugs. He admitted to the offences last year. As a result, the group has raced to raise funds, selling off its farming business, its pharmacy chain and its security business, to focus on its grocery chain and funeral homes. The Co-op declined to comment on the talks with Leighton, which were first reported by Sky News. The appointment of an independent chairman was a key recommendation of the reports on how to tackle the problems at the Co-op. Leighton would replace Ursula Lidbetter, who runs the Lincolnshire Co-op and was catapulted into the role during the height of the scandals. Leighton would become chairman of a new-look board, which for 15 years has comprised five members from independent co-operatives, such as Lidbetter, and 15 from the millions of members of the mutual business. The nomination process for the overhauled board is expected to begin in the coming days, ahead of the annual meeting in May. Two directors are to come from the membership and three more independent directors appointed alongside the chairman and the senior independent director, Sir Christopher Kelly, who wrote a scathing reports into the business last year. Richard Pennycook also sits on the board, after being promoted to chief executive following the sudden departure of Euan Sutherland, who resigned after details of his \u00a33.6m pay deal were leaked to the Observer. Leighton, who could not be reached for comment, came to the public eye after leading the overhaul of Asda, which was deep in debt before being revived and sold to the US retailer Walmart in 1999. He worked closely with Archie Norman, who became a Conservative MP, and left to embark on what he said was \u201cgoing plural\u201d, working full time but taking on a number of roles. His career began at the confectioner Mars where, he said, he learned key lessons such as flying economy class, hiring a car and talking to workers. He went on to take a number of senior roles, including the chairmanship of Royal Mail, joining in 2002 and leaving in 2008, and sitting on the board of Lastminute.com, BSkyB and Dyson. He is stepping down next month as chairman of the jeweller Pandora, and is chairman of Entertainment One \u2013 the business that distributes Peppa Pig. The Co-op annual meeting in May is expected to vote on whether to withdraw \u00a31m in annual funding from the Co-operative party, which is allied to the Labour party and has 32 MPs in parliament, including the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls. The Co-op is still facing a number of investigations. Inquiries into the banking business are ongoing. The Bank of England\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, are investigating, while George Osborne has said he would commission an independent review into what went wrong. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 february 2015 to clarify that Allan Leighton remains chairman of Entertainment One.",

    "webTitle": "George Osborne warns Greek debt standoff is threatening global economy \u2013 live updates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap: George Osborne has said the standoff between Greece and the eurozone is the biggest threat to the global economy, following his meeting at Number 11 with new Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Meanwhile in an interview with Channel 4, Varoufakis said he expects a deal shortly to \u201cput the Greek crisis away once and for all.\u201d To remind everyone of the weakness of the Greek economy, the country\u2019s factory sector shrank at its fastest rate in 15 months in January, according to Markit. But the Athens stock market ended 4.64% higher at 755.42, helped by some supportive comments from President Obama, who said: You cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression. At some point, there has to be a growth strategy in order to pay off their debts and eliminate some of their deficits.\u201d And on that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Meanwhile European Central Bank governing council member and Bank of France Christian Noyer has also been talking about Greece: Here\u2019s the full quote from the Channel 4 Varoufakis interview about an imminent deal: There will be a deal within a very short space of time that is going to make it perfectly clear to everyone that Greece can play within the rules and in a way that puts the Greek crisis away, once and for all. And here\u2019s a clip of the Channel 4 interview: More from the Channel 4 interview with Vanis Varoufakis, courtesy of Reuters snaps: 02-Feb-2015 17:22 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - NEED SENSE OF STABILITY TO REVERSE FLOW OF MONEY OUT OF GREEK BANKS - UK\u2019S CHANNEL 4 NEWS 02-Feb-2015 17:22 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - SENSE OF STABILITY WILL BE CREATED BY EUROPEAN PARTNERS FINDING SOLUTION QUICKLY 02-Feb-2015 17:23 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - EUROPEANS SHOULD NOT TOY WITH STABILITY OF EURO ZONE, MUST SETTLE NERVES 02-Feb-2015 17:23 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - THERE WILL BE A DEAL WITHIN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME THAT PUTS GREEK CRISIS AWAY ONCE AND FOR ALL 02-Feb-2015 17:23 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - WOULD TAKE A VERY CYNICAL DISPOSITION TO BELIEVE ECB WOULD DO ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE GREECE, MONETARY UNION 02-Feb-2015 17:24 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - GREEK BOND YIELDS REFLECT MARKET UNCERTAINTY DURING TRANSITION PERIOD 02-Feb-2015 17:26 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - WE ARE NOT FACING A WILD WEST SHOWDOWN, TRYING TO FIND SOLUTION THAT BENEFITS AVERAGE EUROPEAN 02-Feb-2015 17:26 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - URGENCY IS OF THE ESSENCE IN SOLVING GREEK DEBT PROBLEM 02-Feb-2015 17:27 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTER - WHOLE OF EUROPE WILL \u201cBIND TOGETHER\u201d IN NEXT FEW HOURS AND DAYS TO DO ITS JOB German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is getting antsy about the new Greek government\u2019s attitude to Russia. He told a Reuters summit that Berlin did not like Greece\u2019s new closeness to Russia and said aid from Moscow was not a viable alternative to European assistance. Asked how much the new closeness between Greece and Russia was a concern, he said: We don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t believe Russia can replace European solidarity. But he added: It\u2019s in our interest to co-operate closely and reasonably with Russia and for Russia to contribute to a stable global economic development. More from George Osborne after his meeting with Varoufakis: And an endorsement: More from the Channel 4 interview: Yanis Varoufakis has told Channel 4 he expects some kind of deal shortly: If you\u2019re just joining us, here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s talks at Number 11 Downing Street, by Katie Allen: Greece debt standoff: George Osborne urges Athens and Brussels to strike deal George Osborne has warned that the standoff between Greece and the eurozone poses \u201cthe greatest risk to the global economy\u201d after meeting the new Greek finance minister. The chancellor hosted a meeting at 11 Downing Street with his Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, who is on a whistlestop tour of Europe to win support for a renegotiated debt deal. After the meeting, Osborne warned that the confrontation could affect the stability of the eurozone, the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner. \u201cWe had a constructive discussion, and it is clear that the standoff between Greece and the eurozone is the greatest risk to the global economy,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cI urge the Greek finance minister to act responsibly but it\u2019s also important that the eurozone has a better plan for jobs and growth. \u201cIt is a rising threat to the British economy. And we have got to make sure that inEurope, as in Britain, we choose competence over chaos.\u201d.... (click here for the full story) Back in the markets, Greek government bonds have continued to weaken today. That has pushed up the yield on its debt, suggesting that traders see a higher chance of default or restructuring. Yanis Varoufakis was channelling the spirit of Happy Mondays/Black Grape star Shaun Ryder as he walked across Downing Street today. So argues Imogen Fox, our head of fashion: It was apparent from the photocall on Downing Street that we were witnessing a bit of a fashion moment. There was Osborne, himself riding high on his rebooted fashion skills with his Julius-Caesar haircut and properly fitting suit, shaking hands with a man wearing a Wetherspoon\u2019s-appropriate bright-blue shirt and an early-1990s madchester drug dealer\u2019s coat. The shaved head, the feet apart hands-in-pockets bouncer\u2019s stance and the easy grin serving to underline the look.... Those were the days More here: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis goes casual at number 11 Is George Osborne correct that the Greek debt standoff is the biggest risk to the global economy? Well, the market reaction since Greece\u2019s general election eight days ago is quite muted. Greek bonds have weakened, and its bank shares have slumped (before recovering some value) but there\u2019s been relatively little reaction elsewhere. Rob Wood of Berenberg bank says Greece\u2019s eurozone future is a worry, but not yet a panic: Of course a potential Grexit accident represents a tail risk that markets may be fearful of...... In any case, market moves since Syriza grabbed power in Greece show that the Eurozone\u2019s contagion controls are stronger now than back in 2012. And Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group reckons that the two sides will strike a deal: German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not want to be the Chancellor that presides over the first reversal in 50+ years of European integration. Greek Prime minister Alexis Tsipras does not want to pull Greece out of Europe. There is no way a country can leave the Euro and remain a member of the Union. Historical factors also play a role. Greece\u2019s European orientation predates the linking of the country\u2019s course with the Euro and it is unlikely this link will be broken so easily. And if Tsipras fails and calls new elections, Rahman reckons there\u2019s more chance of a new pro-bailout programme government being formed, rather than Greece leaving the eurozone. UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that the Greek debt row is \u201cfast becoming the biggest threat to the global economy.\u201d He was speaking after meeting Greece\u2019s new finance minister at Downing Street, on the latest phase of Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s tour of European capitals. During the talks, Osborne urged Varoufakis not to be rash, but also acknowledged that Europe must do more, saying: I urge the Greek finance minister to act responsibly but it\u2019s also important that the eurozone has a better plan for jobs and growth. It is a rising threat to the British economy. And we have got to make sure that in Europe as in Britain, we choose competence over chaos. Osborne\u2019s comments come hours after Barack Obama called for compromise. The president made an important contribution to the debate, telling CNN that: You cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression. At some point, there has to be a growth strategy in order to pay off their debts and eliminate some of their deficits. Obama\u2019s comments have helped the Athens stock market surge by around 4.5% today, led by banking shares. Varoufakis, the former economics professor, is due to meet City investors and banks this afternoon. Sources say he will promise to keep repaying Greek debt which they hold. Varoufakis maintained the new Greek government\u2019s policy of doing things differently \u2013 marching up Downing Street in a wide-collared, thigh-length wax/leather(I\u2019m no fashion correspondent) coat and no tie. Social media was entranced, and divided: There are also signs that the Greek political crisis is hurting its economy. Data this morning showed that its factory sector shrank at the fastest rate in 15 months in January. The wider Eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector only managed meagre growth, although Spain beat forecasts. Reuters now have the full quotes from George Osborne, on today\u2019s \u2018constructive\u2019 meeting with his Greek counterpart. And it\u2019s clear that Osborne is urging the eurozone to pick up its game: \u201cWe had a constructive discussion, and it is clear that the stand-off between Greece and the euro zone is the greatest risk to the global economy,\u201d \u201cI urge the Greek finance minister to act responsibly but it\u2019s also important that the euro zone has a better plan for jobs and growth,\u201d . \u201cIt is a rising threat to the British economy. And we have got to make sure that in Europe as in Britain, we choose competence over chaos.\u201d George Osborne has also warned that the stand-off between the eurozone and Greece is fast becoming the biggest risk to the global economy, Reuters reports. Hat-tip to Sky\u2019s Emily Purser, who\u2019s been stationed on a rather chilly Downing Street taking video and photos of the meeting: Newsflash from Downing Street; George Osborne apparently told Varoufakis that all sides must act \u201cresponsibly\u201d over the issue of Greece\u2019s debts. BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER OSBORNE SAYS TOLD GREEK FINANCE MINISTER ALL SIDES NEED TO ACT RESPONSIBLY - REUTERS The two finance ministers spoke over coffee. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis will tell major investors and bankers in the City today that Greece will be able to service its debt with no detrimental impact on private investors, Reuters reports: The source said Varoufakis planned to meet about 100 banks and financial institutions at an event later on Monday. \u201cWe will be able to service the Greek debt on terms that will have no detrimental impact on, especially private, bond holders,\u201d said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. A group from the Left Unity party gave the Greek delegation a friendly reception at the gates of Downing Street -- as flagged up earlier, they are calling for the \u2018burden of austerity\u2019 must be lifted off Greece. The meeting at Number 11 Downing Street has just finished after around 50 minutes. Disappointingly, Yanis Varoufakis only gave a quick wave to the assembled media outside, before jumping into a waiting limo: Next stop, meeting City institutions. Yanis Varoufakis is due in the City after his meeting with George Osborne. Reuters just snapped up that he\u2019ll meet around 100 institutions, and reassure them that Athens doesn\u2019t plan to default on their loans. GREEK FINANCE MINISTER TO MEET AROUND 100 BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LATER ON MONDAY - SOURCE GREEK FINANCE MINISTER TO SAY GREECE WILL BE ABLE TO SERVICE DEBT, NO DETRIMENTAL IMPACT FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS - SOURCE The Jubilee Debt Campaign hopes that George Osborne will support their call for debt relief for Greece: The director, Sarah-Jayne Clifton, argues: \u201cGreece\u2019s debt comes from loans to bail out banks and vulture funds across Europe, including in Britain. In 2012 the UK government refused to stop vulture funds that were using UK law to pillage Greece\u2019s finances. George Osborne should now show leadership and support the cancellation of Greece\u2019s debts that is urgently needed.\u201d \u201cThe costs of any cancellation should be borne by recovering money from the irresponsible lenders who really benefitted from the bailout, the banks and financial speculators.\u201d I suspect this will not be on Osborne\u2019s agenda... This could be a testy meeting, suggests Ed Conway of Sky News. After all, prime minister David Cameron\u2019s first reaction to Syriza\u2019s win was to tweet that it would increase economic uncertainty across Europe. And here\u2019s that handshake: (via Sky News) Yanis Varoufakis does cut a certain dash in the fashion stakes.... Greece\u2019s finance minister has arrived at Downing Street for talks with the UK government. Yanis Varoufakis and George Osborne had a friendly handshake, posed briefly for the cameras, exchanged a few words, and then vanished inside Number 11 Downing Street. Next stop Berlin?..... Members of Britain\u2019s \u201cLeft Unity\u201d party were planning to take a banner to the gates of Downing Street this morning, reading \u201cGreece, we support you\u201d . Left Unity, a \u201csister party\u201d of Greece\u2019s Syriza, is encouraged by its success in last Sunday\u2019s election: Andrew Burgin of Left Unity said: \u201cWe\u2019ve come to welcome Yanis Varoufakis to London \u2013 and to see him wipe that smile off George Osborne\u2019s face. \u201cThe burden of austerity must be lifted from the Greek people. We stand with them: they are fighting for us all. \u201cAfter so many years of Osborne\u2019s austerity Britain and across Europe, finally a government has taken power who will tell him \u2018no more\u2019.\u201d Yanis Varoufakis is due at 11 Downing Street in 30 minutes time.... Greece\u2019s prime minister is speaking in Cyprus now. Alexis Tsipras says that his government will use its mandate to push for \u201cstrong negotiations\u201d with its European partners. He hopes to get a result that is beneficial for all Europeans. He says the abolition of the Troika (as appears likely) would be an \u201cimportant institutional step\u201d for Europe. He also touches on Russia, saying that Cyprus and Greece can be \u201ca bridge of peace\u201d between Europe and Moscow.[last week, Greece managed to delay new sanctions against Russia]. Tsipras also warns that Europe would be \u201cdismembered on its Southern flank\u201d if it lost Cyprus and Greece. Here\u2019s a handy summary of the state of play this morning, from AFP: Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis meets his British counterpart on Monday as he seeks to build support for a renegotiation of his country\u2019s 240-billion-euro ($270-billion) bailout in the face of German opposition. The latest stop on his European charm offensive comes as US President Barack Obama warned the world that imposing tough austerity programmes on Greece could backfire on its creditors. \u201cYou cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression,\u201d Obama told CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS\u201d. \u201cAt some point, there has to be a growth strategy in order for them to pay off their debts to eliminate some of their deficits.\u201d Obama said the Greek economy was in \u201cdire need\u201d of reform but warned that drastic changes were tough to implement in a struggling economy. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to initiate those changes if peoples\u2019 standards of living are dropping by 25 percent. Over time, eventually, the political system - the society - can\u2019t sustain it,\u201d the US leader said. Varoufakis meets in London with George Osborne at 1100 GMT after a stop Sunday in Paris where he said he wanted to reach a new debt deal within months to end his country\u2019s loan \u201caddiction\u201d, which was loading ever more liabilities on its economy. Greece therefore did not want a promised loan tranche of 7.2 billion euros from its trio of creditors, the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank (ECB), he reiterated. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t need the money; we\u2019re desperate,\u201d he said at a joint press conference with his French counterpart Michel Sapin. \u201cWhat this government is all about is ending this addiction.\u201d Although not in the eurozone, Britain is in the IMF and Varoufakis is looking for as many allies as possible for any future political negotiations within the EU. Varoufakis is also expected to meet with key figures from London\u2019s key financial sector, which is home to many lenders exposed to Greek debt. Greece\u2019s new anti-austerity government has refused to work with the so-called troika of international bailout inspectors charged with overseeing its painful fiscal reforms, instead seeking direct contacts with creditors and governments. British minister Osborne welcomed Varoufakis\u2019s visit, saying the pair would discuss \u201cthe stability of the European economy and how to boost its growth.\u201d No sign of the Greek finance minister in London yet. But his boss, prime minister Alexis Tsipras, has now inspected a presidential honour guard in Cyprus, as his first official visit gets underway: Oh dear, Greece\u2019s factory sector shrank at its fastest rate in 15 months in January, data firm Markit just reported. New orders from overseas and domestic customers both fell, showing that the economy was weakening during the run-up to the general election. And input costs fell at the fastest rate for 69 months, as deflation continued to grip Greece. This dragged the Greek factory PMI down to a 15-month low of 48.3 in January (where any reading below 50= contraction). Phil Smith, Markit economist, sounds gloomy: \u201cJanuary saw a further fall in new orders lead manufacturers to reduce their output for the first time in three months. The heightened uncertainty brought about by elections was reportedly a factor behind the sector\u2019s worsening performance, though new business from abroad also fell again and this was the fifth time in a row that the PMI has posted below 50, suggesting that the causes of the sector\u2019s malaise are more deep-rooted.\u201d The overall eurozone factory sector only managed meagre growth, with a PMI of just 51.0. This chart confirms that Greek bank stocks are surging again today, driving the main Athens market up over 5%. Athens traders are crediting the rally to comments made by president Obama last night, when the US president appeared to argue for a break from austerity. Omaba told CNN that: \u201cYou cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression\u201d \u201cAt some point, there has to be a growth strategy in order to pay off their debts and eliminate some of their deficits.\u201d Obama also told CNN that all sides must compromise, to keep Greece in the eurozone. He said: When the financial crisis in Greece flared up a few years ago, we were very active in trying to arrive at some sort of accommodation. I think there\u2019s recognition on the part of Germany and others that it would be better for Greece to stay in the eurozone than be outside of it and the markets will obviously be skittish about this.\u201d More encouraging economic news, this time from Italy. The slump in its factory sector almost ended last month, with its PMI index (based on interviews with purchasing managers) rising to a four-month high of 49.9 in January from 48.4. The 50-point mark is the difference between expansion and contraction. France\u2019s downturn also eased - its factory PMI rose to 49.2 from a pretty dire 47.5 in December. Just checked with the Treasury, and I\u2019m afraid that Osborne and Varoufakis won\u2019t be holding a press conference. Hopefully we\u2019ll hear details of their meeting afterwards.... The Greek stock market has surged by over 5% in early trading, and banking stocks are leading the way. We\u2019re expecting Yanis Varoufakis to arrive at Number 11 Downing Street late this morning, for talks with chancellor George Osborne. Osborne has issued a statement this morning ahead of the talks, saying: \u201cI welcome this opportunity, so soon after the Greek election, to discuss face to face with Yanis Varoufakis the stability of the European economy and how to boost its growth.\u201d So no direct mention of the Greek bailout. Unlike most eurozone governments, Britain isn\u2019t directly exposed to Greece\u2019s bailout through Europe\u2019s share [Germany is owed the most, around \u20ac56.5bn]. But, the City does have a stake. UK banks are estimated to have lent around \u00a39bn to Greek banks, customers and businesses, exposing them to losses if the Greek economy plunges into a new crisis. Encouraging news from Spain just hit the wires - its factories grew at a faster rate in January. The Spanish manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the sector, rose to 54.7 last month from 53.8 in December. Greece\u2019s new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is making his first trip overseas today. He\u2019s just arrived in Cyprus; another country which was forced into seeking a bailout during the debt crisis: Greece\u2019s new government has apparently achieved one early goal, persuading Europe to abandon the dreaded Troika. Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt newspaper reports this morning that Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has agreed to stop the regular, highly unpopular, visits by Greece\u2019s lenders to assess its progress: \u201cWe have to find an alternative quickly.\u201d Abolishing the Troika may make good headlines, but it doesn\u2019t actually mean Greece owes any less.. That awkward press conference on Friday may have scuppered Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s chances of a second term leading Europe\u2019s finance chiefs: Some newsflashes from Paris; finance minister Michel Sapin is reiterating that European taxpayers cannot take on Greek liabilities, and urging structural reforms. Sapin is also calling for Greece to meet with Angela Merkel\u2019s government: Varoufakis set the scene for today\u2019s London visit in Paris yesterday, where he told reporters that Greece must end its \u201caddiction\u201d to bailout payments. As we wrote last night: Varoufakis \u2013 who offered to produce proposals for a reworked debt deal within a month \u2013 said Greece had no intention of asking for new loans and it was time to go \u201ccold turkey\u201d. \u201cFor the last five years, Greece has been living for the next loan tranche. We have resembled drug addicts craving the next dose. What this government is all about is ending the addiction.\u201d The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, said France was ready to help Greece find a deal, but any agreement would need to include structural reforms. Economists fear, though, that Greek banks will bleed deposits while the new government talks about a new debt deal: Theodore Pelagides, a professor of economics at Piraeus University and research fellow at Brookings Institute, warned: \u201cUnless negotiations are completed in the next few days there is a real risk that banks will be unable to respond to the growing uncertainty \u2026 The government really doesn\u2019t have the time it thinks it has to reach an agreement that would basically save the economy.\u201d Full story: Greek minister to meet George Osborne about proposed debt deal Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone, the world economy, finance and business. Has any new finance minister made *quite* as rapid a start as Yanis Varoufakis? Less than a week after being sworn in, Varoufakis is already holding a whistle-stop tour of European capitals to drum up support (he hopes!) for the new Greek government\u2019s push to renegotiate its debts. And this morning he descends on London, to meet George Osborne, the UK\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer and investors in the City. Varoufakis is determined to visit as many corridors of power as possible. Yesterday he met French finance minister Michel Sapin in Paris for talks. He\u2019s already spoken with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Saturday night, and is expected to meet Italian PM Matteo Renzi, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker this week. And, of course, he\u2019s already gone toe-to-toe with the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem in a tense home fixture. That ended as a gritty draw, followed by a rather unfriendly handshake. Greece\u2019s debt struggle is the main events dominating the markets today. But we also get a flurry of economic data, showing how factories in Europe - and across the world - fared in January. Economists predict that France and Italy continued to struggle, while Germany pulled ahead, highlighting the tensions at the heart of the eurozone. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day, as usual....",

      "bodyText": "British Airways\u2019 parent company has stepped up its pursuit of Aer Lingus by offering to make legally binding commitments to preserve the Irish carrier\u2019s brand and presence at Heathrow, hoping to assuage government fears in Dublin. IAG last week made an improved \u00a31.1bn bid for Aer Lingus but the Irish government, which owns a 25% stake, had been resisting a sale without guarantees over future connectivity. The new proposals would, according to IAG, give Dublin greater protection over the airline\u2019s future than it has now. IAG would guarantee that Aer Lingus\u2019s vaulable 23 Heathrow take-off and landing slot pairs will not be sold \u2013 including to BA \u2013 and that they will be operated on Irish routes for the next five years. IAG would also guarantee to keep Aer Lingus\u2019s brandname and to maintain its headquarters in Ireland.

      "bodyText": "The John Lewis partnership has ditched its final salary pension scheme in favour of a hybrid scheme partly based on staff contributions. The department store group and owner of Waitrose said that from April this year it would also increase the period staff must wait before they can join the replacement scheme, from three years to five. After joining, staff will be assured payments of 120th of their final salary for every year worked without having to make any contribution. The company will put in contributions worth 3% of basic pay for those on the salary-linked scheme. It will also match staff contributions of up to 4.5% for all workers, including those who have been on staff less than five years. In another money-saving move, new staff joining the pension scheme from next year will also retire at the state pension age, which is to rise to 66 in 2020, 67 in 2028 and further after that. Until now John Lewis has been one of only a handful of businesses still offering a final salary pension. Businesses are trying to reduce costs as people live longer. Last week, Morrisons said it planned to close its two defined benefit pension schemes just weeks after Tesco announced it would be closing its defined scheme to save money. Nat Wakely, director of the pensions benefit review at the company said: \u201cThe John Lewis partnership pension is a defining element of our business and this decision will ensure that it remains so in a way that is fair and affordable.\u201d He said a staff representative council had voted unanimously in favour of the new scheme after \u201ca very thorough process, involving every area of the partnership and concluding in a decision that we took together in an open and democratic way.\u201d John Lewis launched a review of its pension scheme in March 2013 after a valuation found it had a deficit of \u00a3840m. The company, which is owned by its employees, agreed to make a payment of \u00a385m into the scheme last year on top of annual contributions of \u00a344m a year under a 10-year plan to eliminate the deficit.

We acknowledge that Global Xpress is a 15-year project, so delays are not that meaningful to the programme net present value.

Over the coming weeks, Inmarsat will perform a series of manoeuvres to move the satellite into its correct orbit, to be completed by the end of March...The third satellite, which will complete the constellation, is due to be launched before the end of the first half of 2015, with the commencement of global operations set for early second half 2015. Given that there are still some satellites in the queue before the next Global Xpress launch, we believe that material risks remain...Thus an early second half 2015 start to global operations still relies on perfect execution from the Proton launcher, and based on historical precedent we would not want to bet on this. We acknowledge that Global Xpress is a 15-year project, so delays are not that meaningful to the programme net present value. However, with risks still remaining, we think there is still some threat to near-term consensus Global Xpress revenues, and we would be reluctant to argue at this stage that there is no risk of further downgrades. Given the strength of the US dollar, the sterling-priced Inmarsat shares have performed extremely well in recent weeks...Medium-term growth prospects from Global Xpress remain attractive, but current expectations are high. Even with perfect execution from Proton, we expect little evidence until end-2015 at the earliest that Inmarsat can grow into its high multiples. Upside from a LightSquared deal remains, but visibility is extremely low. We maintain our hold rating and our discounted cash flow-based price target of 800p.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers enjoyed faster growth in January, easing their costs as oil prices fell and even recording a pick-up in demand from the struggling eurozone, a survey signalled on Monday. Manufacturing activity expanded at a faster pace than City economists had forecast, with growth in exports bolstered by strong domestic orders, according to the closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI. However, with key markets showing signs of flagging, manufacturers cut their prices at the fastest pace for five years. The UK report follows news on Monday that the eurozone manufacturing sector managed to eke out some growth in January although the picture was mixed from country to country. The UK survey will provide some relief after official figures last week showed the manufacturing sector barely grew at all in the final quarter of 2014 as the wider economy also slowed. Rob Dobson, senior economist at the survey\u2019s compilers Markit, cautioned about expecting a boost from manufacturing any time soon. \u201cUK factories reported a welcome upturn in growth of output and order books at the start of the year, but producers clearly remain stuck in a low gear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this rate, the sector will provide little meaningful boost to the economy in the first quarter.\u201d UK exporters have been hit by the flagging eurozone, their biggest trading partner, amid lacklustre consumer and business confidence in the euro currency bloc. The latest manufacturing survey suggested that there had been some glimmers of light from overseas while domestic demand remained the prime driver. The main manufacturing activity index rose to 53.0 from 52.7 in December, well above the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion. The activity index for the eurozone factory sector came in at 51.0, from 50.6 the previous month. In the UK, manufacturers reported faster growth for production and new orders, in contrast to a slowdown seen through much of the latter half of 2014. Staffing levels rose for the 21st consecutive month, with the sector adding jobs at a pace of around 5,000 a month. The survey highlighted \u201cthe first meaningful improvement in new export order volumes registered for five months\u201d as companies reported increased demand from France, Germany, Japan, the Middle East, Poland and the US. Purchasing costs for manufacturers fell at the fastest pace since May 2009, while the prices charged to customers \u2013 the so-called output prices \u2013 fell at the fastest since September 2009. The survey\u2019s authors played down any pressure on margins, noting that the rate of decline for output prices \u201cwas only mild and substantially less marked than that signalled for input costs\u201d. Economists highlighted the support for manufacturing from oil prices, which have more than halved since last summer. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, said: \u201cIt seems likely that lower oil prices should continue to enable manufacturers to lower prices and so support demand. The latest survey evidence offers some hope that the manufacturing sector may have passed the worst.\u201d The surveys from the eurozone showed diverging fortunes. Ireland\u2019s manufacturers enjoyed the strongest growth for eight months; activity also accelerated in Spain and the Netherlands. Italy and France continued to see a drop in factory activity but the pace of decline slowed. In Germany, manufacturing growth slowed and in Greece, manufacturers suffered the biggest drop in activity for 15 months, Markit\u2019s surveys showed.",

      "bodyText": "Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has accused the Tories of trying to orchestrate criticism of Labour after the boss of Boots suggested that Ed Miliband as prime minister would be a catastrophe. He joined other senior Labour figures in dismissing the comments of Stefano Pessina, the acting chief executive of the pharmacy chain, saying it would \u201cstick in the craw\u201d that someone who does not pay tax in Britain was telling people in the country how to vote. Balls then suggested that the Conservatives would try to influence voters by persuading more high-profile people to speak out against Labour in the coming campaign. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cI would think in the next three months we going to have a number of people brought forward by the Conservatives, whether it\u2019s Gary Barlow or Mr Pessina, saying \u2018Don\u2019t vote Labour.\u2019 The idea that somebody who doesn\u2019t pay tax in Britain telling people how to vote will stick in the craw.\u201d Balls also pointed out that Pessina had criticised only one policy, and that was the threat of leaving the EU \u2013 something only likely under the Conservatives or Ukip. The Tories insist that they had nothing to do with Pessina\u2019s comments but George Osborne took the unusual step of providing a direct quote highlighting the businessman\u2019s stance. The party has previously been known to approach business people to speak out on sensitive political issues such as the Scottish independence referendum. Douglas Alexander, the head of Labour\u2019s election campaign, had already described Pessina\u2019s comments as \u201crubbish\u201d, while Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the electorate was unlikely to listen to someone who does not live or pay tax in the UK. Pessina lives in Monte Carlo, with a fortune estimated at \u00a37.5bn. Boots was targeted by tax campaigners when it moved its formal tax residence from Britain to Switzerland following Pessina\u2019s private equity-backed buyout in 2007. When Pessina merged Boots with US group Walgreens in 2014, there were plans to move its headquarters from the US to Switzerland for tax reasons, although the idea was abandoned after a US political row and a potential customer backlash. The weekend row started with Pessina, the 74-year-old acting chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, saying that if Labour politicians acted in the way that they spoke \u201cit would be a catastrophe\u201d. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Pessina said: \u201cThe problem is would they [Labour] act that way or not? One thing is to threaten and to shout but it is completely different to be in charge and to manage the country day-to-day ... [and if they did it would be] not helpful for business, not helpful for the country and in the end it probably won\u2019t be helpful for them.\u201d Pessina, whose company has 2,500 shops and employs 70,000 staff in Britain, declined to say which policies he particularly objected to but there has been previous criticism by business executives of Labour promises to reintroduce a 50p top rate of income tax, freeze prices in the energy sector and impose restrictions on the size of high street banks. A spokesman for Walgreens Boots Alliance attempted to clarify Pessina\u2019s comments on Sunday night. He said: \u201cThe comments made by Stefano Pessina were a small part of a much larger conversation and have been taken out of context. Stefano Pessina was expressing his personal views only and is not campaigning against Ed Miliband or the Labour party. \u201cIndeed, he previously held good relationships with the Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, as well as the current coalition government led by David Cameron and Nick Clegg.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has warned that lower oil prices will push down air fares next year and keep a lid on profit growth at the budget airline. The company said it had hedged its fuel costs at $92 (\u00a361) a barrel for next year, limiting the carrier\u2019s gains from falling oil prices that have slumped below $50 per barrel. It added that some competitors would be able to cut prices because they had held back from locking in higher fuel costs. Fuel is the biggest expense for low-cost airlines and carriers often buy it in advance at a fixed price, a practice known as hedging. Ryanair, which as an average fare of \u20ac40 (\u00a330) said it would set fares to fill its planes whenever possible \u2013 with a knock-on effect on pricing as it lowers fares in line with rivals in order to fill seats. \u201cThis may lead to downward pressure on air fares in 2015/16,\u201d Ryanair said in a trading update. \u201cAs lower oil prices kick in over the next two years, Ryanair intends to pass on much, if not all, of these savings to our rapidly growing customer base in the form of lower fares and therefore our profit growth expectations will be modest in [2016].\u201d Ryanair shares dropped 2.2% to \u20ac10.17 in early trading. Rival budget carrier easyJet was down 4%, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, and British Airways owner IAG also fell. Fuel hedging makes life more predictable but if fuel costs fall rapidly, as they have done since last summer, the company will have paid an above-market price for its fuel. Prices locked in through hedging is one of the reasons air fares have not fallen to reflect the more than halving of the oil price in the past six months. Ryanair, Europe\u2019s biggest short-haul airline, increased its annual profit forecast and said it would buy back \u20ac400m (\u00a3301m) of shares in the next six months. Net profit for the year ending in March will be between \u20ac840m and \u20ac850m \u2013 up from earlier guidance of \u20ac810m to \u20ac830m. Last year the company made a profit of \u20ac523m. In the third quarter to 31 December, passenger numbers increased 14% as it flew more routes and seat occupancy rose by 6 percentage points to 88%. Michael O\u2019Leary, the chief executive, said Ryanair had improved performance largely because of its discovery of the benefits of emphasising customer service. Ryanair has allowed more carry-on baggage, allocating seating and cut punitive charges. It has also improved its website and launched a service for business customers. O\u2019Leary said: \u201cThese strong results confirm that our \u2018always getting better\u2019 customer programme and our expanded business schedules, coupled with our substantial fare and cost advantage over competitor airlines, is drawing millions of new customers to Ryanair.\u201d Analysts expect Ryanair\u2019s profit to rise about 9% to \u20ac917m next year. Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, said the company might be trying to guide forecasts down but that it was more likely seeking to stop upgrades running away based on falling oil prices. Khoo said: \u201cManagement has flagged likely pricing pressure from lower fuel prices, has seen some pricing softness in January, and expects \u2018modest\u2019 profit growth in 2016. We suspect this is an attempt to keep a lid on fuel-driven upgrades. It has not stopped management declaring a new \u20ac400m share buyback.\u201d",

The sweetheart deal he was offered \u2013 up to $1bn in 10-year tax breaks promised by the government of then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa \u2013 was too good to be true, and too fragile to last. Last Friday Packer\u2019s Crown group abandoned the $350m development after the new government withdrew the generous tax concessions, and on Monday it declared Packer unwelcome in the country at any time. Packer needed the Rajapaksa family \u2013 Mahinda\u2019s brother Basil was the key man behind the development \u2013 and he needed their cronies, in particular Ravi Wijeratne, a man regarded as \u201calmost family\u201d to the president, and who was to be the local face of the development. It was they who could shield the project from the protests of Buddhist groups who resented a massive casino being built near a temple, and from the political opposition, who decried the special treatment being handed out to a foreign investor at the expense of the people. So when Rajapaksa was unceremoniously bundled out of office last month in an election result that shocked the world, the complex web of support for the Packer project instantly disintegrated. The new broom of Sri Lankan politics has turned its attention to the kind of insider deals the Rajapaksas were famous for. Packer\u2019s project not only had the highest profile \u2013 the lakeside land for the 36-storey building was right in the heart of Colombo, and the Australian\u2019s involvement had been proudly broadcast \u2013 it was the easiest to end. Within days of taking office, the new administration removed the extraordinary concessions offered to Packer. When he announced in response that the project was cancelled, the new (though recycled) prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, welcomed the decision, and happily vented the frustrations of the electorate on the foreigner. \u201cPacker has said he will not come. Who asked you to come? Please don\u2019t come, not in this lifetime. We need only good investors.\u201d The opprobrium directed at Packer, more than a personal attack, is a reflection of the deep dissatisfaction within the Sri Lankan polity and people, a belief that for too long the country\u2019s promise had been pillaged at the expense of the many, to the benefit of the few. Elected on a promise of governmental reform, of openness and accountability, and on eschewing the trappings of office, Sri Lanka\u2019s new president, Maithripala Sirisena, has set himself a 100-day reform program against corruption before holding parliamentary elections. He has promised to reverse Rajapaksa\u2019s constitutional changes, which gave the office of the president unprecedented powers over the judiciary and removed term limits. And the new president has already sacked hundreds of government officials and diplomats seen as Rajapaksa\u2019s \u201cpolitical\u201d appointments. He has promised jail terms for corrupt government officials, and already his government has outed a customs scam that had been running for years, at a cost of billions of rupees. The symbolic is important too in South Asia\u2019s oldest democracy, and Sirisena has sought to oblige: he has cancelled an order for a new personal aircraft from the United States, and insisted the honorific \u201chis excellency\u201d be dropped from all correspondence. He has cut his security detail by three-quarters, and mandated his family not use the military\u2019s VIP helicopters (a Rajapaksa favourite). Whether the promises of a new government can be upheld, and whether the pace of reform can be maintained, will be Sri Lanka\u2019s test for the future. But James Packer\u2019s casino deal is finished, ended by the people of Sri Lanka at the ballot box. Rajapaksa was Packer\u2019s ace, and without the president the whole house of cards came inevitably crashing down.",
