    "webTitle": "Europe and China cut interest rates while Bank of England extends QE", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Central banks around the world signalled their determination to stimulate the flagging global economy on Thursday yesterday, with the injection of \u00a350bn of electronic money into the UK and interest rate cuts in the eurozone and China. The Bank of England warned that recovery was at risk without a boost to its programme of quantitative easing after a flurry of economic surveys showed the double-dip recession could stretch into the autumn. Not since the financial crash of 2008 has the world economy appeared to be going into reverse, but a downturn in the US and key Asian economies following the euro crisis has sapped the life out of global trade. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rate policy, said that the total amount of QE would rise to \u00a3375bn, while the base interest rate would remain at 0.5%. It said the eurozone crisis was continuing to batter business confidence, despite a deal struck last weekend that calmed market fears of a euro collapse. The Bank said: \"In spite of the progress made at the latest European council, concerns remain about the indebtedness and competitiveness of several euro-area economies, and that is weighing on confidence here. \"The correspondingly weaker outlook for UK output growth means that the margin of economic slack is likely to be greater and more persistent.\" Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, summed up the view of many analysts. \"Double-dip recession, weak money supply and anaemic earnings growth suggests inflation will tumble into 2013,\" he said. \"Moreover in the current risk-averse economic environment, with consumers and companies reluctant to spend, QE has got to work harder and harder. The end result is that we could see another \u00a350bn on top of this, within a few months.\" In the eurozone, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, reacted to this week's unemployment figures, which revealed the highest number of jobless people in the eurozone's history, with a cut of 0.25% in its base rate to 0.75%. But he hinted that, despite the low level of interest rates, the Frankfurt institution had more steps it could take to prop up the 17-nation bloc. \"We still have all our artillery ready,\" he said. His downbeat assessment of the eurozone's prospects sent Spanish bond yields back to dangerous levels. The cost of Spanish government borrowing rose to near 7% \u2013 almost back to the level that prompted the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to make concessions at last weekend's euro summit. Italian borrowing costs also climbed higher. In Beijing, the government cut interest rates as it stepped up efforts to reverse its deepest economic slump since the 2008 global crisis. China cut its key lending rate for a second time in a month to prevent a further slump in manufacturing and a collapse in property values following a decade-long house price bubble. Interest on a one-year loan will be reduced by 0.31 percentage points to 6% from Friday, the central bank announced. Last month four of the Bank of England's nine-member rate-setting committee, including Sir Mervyn King, voted for more QE, but the majority voiced scepticism over economic data that showed Britain falling further into recession. The committee noted George Osborne's new Funding for Lending scheme, which it is hoped would boost lending to small businesses, but the Bank's rate-setters said this would not be enough to pull the economy around. They expressed concern about tight credit conditions, the continuing impact of austerity and the drag on the economy coming from the eurozone crisis, and said that without the extra QE stimulus there was a risk of deflation \u2013 a worrying downward spiral of prices and incomes. Some MPC members said they were concerned whether QE would have any further impact on levels of lending. They wanted new tactics to increase the amount of lending in the economy. However, a succession of negative business surveys appears to have persuaded the committee to pull the QE lever again. A report this week showed the services sector, which accounts for more than 70% of the economy, experienced one of its worst months since the recovery began three years ago. In the construction sector, much of the industry outside central London remains in recession, while manufacturing has slumped. Difficult trading conditions following the euro crisis have added to the headwinds facing British business. Exports have declined and imports grown, adding to a decline in the balance of payments. Neil Bentley, CBI deputy director general, said recent falls in inflation and slowing growth had forced the MPC to pump further funds into the economy. He said: \"This extension of QE should provide a fillip to confidence, but with gilt yields already at low levels, the direct impact may only be modest, and consideration should also be given to investing in a broader set of assets, for example bank bonds and high-grade corporate paper. \"However, when combined with the measures announced at the Mansion House, this additional QE will provide some support to business at a difficult time.\"",

      "body": "<p>Central banks around the world signalled their determination to stimulate the flagging global economy on Thursday yesterday, with the injection of \u00a350bn of electronic money into the UK and interest rate cuts in the eurozone and China.</p> <p>The Bank of England warned that recovery was at risk without a boost to its programme of quantitative easing after a flurry of economic surveys showed the double-dip recession could stretch into the autumn.</p> <p>Not since the financial crash of 2008 has the world economy appeared to be going into reverse, but a downturn in the US and key Asian economies following the euro crisis has sapped the life out of global trade.</p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rate policy, said that the total amount of QE would rise to \u00a3375bn, while the base interest rate would remain at 0.5%.</p> <p>It said the eurozone crisis was continuing to batter business confidence, despite a deal struck last weekend that calmed market fears of a euro collapse.</p> <p>The Bank said: \"In spite of the progress made at the latest European council, concerns remain about the indebtedness and competitiveness of several euro-area economies, and that is weighing on confidence here.</p> <p>\"The correspondingly weaker outlook for UK output growth means that the margin of economic slack is likely to be greater and more persistent.\"</p> <p>Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, summed up the view of many analysts. \"Double-dip recession, weak money supply and anaemic earnings growth suggests inflation will tumble into 2013,\" he said. \"Moreover in the current risk-averse economic environment, with consumers and companies reluctant to spend, QE has got to work harder and harder. The end result is that we could see another \u00a350bn on top of this, within a few months.\"</p> <p>In the eurozone, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, reacted to this week's unemployment figures, which revealed the highest number of jobless people in the eurozone's history, with a cut of 0.25% in its base rate to 0.75%. But he hinted that, despite the low level of interest rates, the Frankfurt institution had more steps it could take to prop up the 17-nation bloc. \"We still have all our artillery ready,\" he said. His downbeat assessment of the eurozone's prospects sent Spanish bond yields back to dangerous levels. The cost of Spanish government borrowing rose to near 7% \u2013 almost back to the level that prompted the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to make concessions at last weekend's euro summit. Italian borrowing costs also climbed higher.</p> <p>In Beijing, the government cut interest rates as it stepped up efforts to reverse its deepest economic slump since the 2008 global crisis. China cut its key lending rate for a second time in a month to prevent a further slump in manufacturing and a collapse in property values following a decade-long house price bubble. Interest on a one-year loan will be reduced by 0.31 percentage points to 6% from Friday, the central bank announced.</p> <p>Last month four of the Bank of England's nine-member rate-setting committee, including Sir Mervyn King, voted for more QE, but the majority voiced scepticism over economic data that showed Britain falling further into recession.</p> <p>The committee noted George Osborne's new Funding for Lending scheme, which it is hoped would boost lending to small businesses, but the Bank's rate-setters said this would not be enough to pull the economy around.</p> <p>They expressed concern about tight credit conditions, the continuing impact of austerity and the drag on the economy coming from the eurozone crisis, and said that without the extra QE stimulus there was a risk of deflation \u2013 a worrying downward spiral of prices and incomes.</p> <p>Some MPC members said they were concerned whether QE would have any further impact on levels of lending. They wanted new tactics to increase the amount of lending in the economy.</p> <p>However, a succession of negative business surveys appears to have persuaded the committee to pull the QE lever again. A report this week showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/04/bank-of-england-qe-gloomy-data\" title=\"\">the services sector</a>, which accounts for more than 70% of the economy, experienced one of its worst months since the recovery began three years ago. In the construction sector, much of the industry outside central London remains in recession, while manufacturing has slumped.</p> <p>Difficult trading conditions following the euro crisis have added to the headwinds facing British business. Exports have declined and imports grown, adding to a decline in the balance of payments.</p> <p>Neil Bentley, CBI deputy director general, said recent falls in inflation and slowing growth had forced the MPC to pump further funds into the economy.</p> <p>He said: \"This extension of QE should provide a fillip to confidence, but with gilt yields already at low levels, the direct impact may only be modest, and consideration should also be given to investing in a broader set of assets, for example bank bonds and high-grade corporate paper.</p> <p>\"However, when combined with the measures announced at the Mansion House, this additional QE will provide some support to business at a difficult time.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Negotiations began on Thursday between the government and Labour over setting up a parliamentary inquiry into the banking scandal rocking the City of London, with the promise that it could begin work in two weeks. After a bad-tempered Commons debate, MPs voted by a majority of more than 100 to set up a joint committee of MPs and peers to conduct the inquiry after earlier rejecting a Labour proposal for a judge-led public inquiry similar to the ongoing Leveson investigation into press standards. However, there was confusion over what the committee would be examining and whether the government's hope that a report could be produced before Christmas was possible.

      "bodyText": "Spain and Italy were plunged back into financial turmoil on Thursday after Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, flagged up the \"renewed weakness in economic growth\" of the last three months. Draghi said there was \"heightened uncertainty\" in the eurozone and added that the risks continued to be on the downside, with a potential spillover from financial markets to the real economy. The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds leaped 0.37 percentage points to 6.78%, the highest level since 29 June and dangerously close to the 7% interest rate that economists see as unsustainable. Italy's borrowing costs reversed declines earlier in the week, its 10-year rate climbing 20 basis points to 5.97%. The cost of insuring Spanish and Italian debt also jumped as the weakness of Europe's leading banks appeared to wreck any hopes of a sustained recovery. It came less than a week after eurozone leaders in Brussels agreed a radical bailout package for the single currency's teetering banks and made far-reaching concessions to help Spain control its debt crisis. In recent months Germany and Holland have joined the ailing economies of the south in the economic doldrums, with declining household incomes across the eurozone hitting internal trade. Draghi said there were signs that the crisis within banks was spilling over into the wider economy, with lending to non-financial corporations shrinking in May. He said this reflected \"ongoing adjustments in households and enterprises\". The ECB joined the Bank of England and the Chinese authorities in loosening monetary policy in an attempt to boost growth. It announced a quarter-point cut to the ECB's headline 1% base rate and a cut in its deposit rate to zero. Draghi said the zero rate on cash deposited by banks with the ECB would encourage them to lend to businesses. However, the experience of recent months has been that fears of financial meltdown have persuaded banks and international investors to accept zero rates of interest in return for safety. Germany recently issued a bond that offered negative returns that still proved hugely popular with investors, many of them southern European banks. Markets welcomed the actions of central banks to boost lending, but took fright at Draghi's comments and figures showing a global slowdown. JPMorgan's global all-industry output PMI fell to 50.3 in June from 52.1 in May, and showed that firms' order books across the world filled at a slower rate last month. Readings above 50 signify growth. David Hensely, an economist at JPMorgan, said: \"The PMIs suggest that the global economy downshifted into neutral gear in June.

The country's national debt agency raised \u20ac500m (\u00a3399m) in an auction of three-month securities in what was seen as a toe-in-the-water exercise to test whether Ireland could return to the sovereign debt market. Michael Noonan, Ireland's finance minister, said the sale marked an important milestone on the \"continuing path to recovery\"; \u20ac1.4bn was received in bids for the securities, an indication of healthy demand. The Treasury bills were sold at a yield of 1.8%, lower than the level achieved by the Spanish. But critics dismissed the sale, saying the offering was too small, and the debt too short-term, to be a credible test. One of Ireland's most outspoken investment commentators, the opposition senator Shane Ross, a former financial journalist, said this was \"not a return to the bond market\". He accused the National Treasury Management Agency of \"pulling a PR stunt\", with the amount auctioned mere \"peanuts\". Karl Whelan, professor of economics at University College Dublin, described the sale as a \"sideshow\", pointing out that even Greece is selling three-month Treasury bills. said: \"Ireland has funding from the EU and the IMF through until late 2013. Investors are taking minimal risk in buying these Treasury bills. Indeed, Greece and Portugal also have Treasury bill programmes. Market sentiment towards Ireland has improved since last Friday's euro summit announcement, but today's[the] T-bill sale is largely a sideshow.\" John Corrigan, the NTMA's chief executive, sounded a cautious note, saying he was \"conscious that this is only the first step towards our ultimate goal of full access to the capital markets\". He added: \"It's a significant step but there's a lot more work to do before we get back into the bond markets. There's a big difference, in fairness, between selling three-month paper and selling longer-term bonds.\" Ireland was effectively frozen out of the sovereign debt markets in September 2010 when yields on bonds became prohibitively high, but it is due to return to the markets next year to wean itself off IMF/EU money. Irish debt yields have fallen rapidly over the past year, with 10-year bonds dropping from around 14% last summer to about 6.3% now \u2013 nearer to the levels where Ireland could resume normal refinancing arrangements at affordable rates. The EU-IMF money remains far cheaper, however, with average interest costs below 3.5%.",

The leading index closed up 8 points, 0.1%, at 5693, while France's CAC was down 40 points, 1.2%, at 3228; Germany's DAX was down 33 points, 0.5%, at 6532; Spain's IBEX closed down 214 points, 3%, at 6954; and Italy's FTSE MIB shut 292 points down, 2%, at 14089. In London, the market fluttered up and down throughout the day. Opening flat, it rose on news from China that interest rates had been cut, prompting hopes among the mining stocks of greater spending, but by the end of trading the rises had fizzled out. The index dropped during the unimpressive European Central Bank press conference, following its decision to cut interest rates from 1% to 0.75%, while the Bank of England's QE decision to pump \u00a350bn extra into the markets failed to register. Across the pond, the Dow Jones was down 27 points, 0.2%, at 12917, along with the S&amp;P 500, down 3 points at 1366, and Nasdaq down 2 points at 2978. The falls were in part due to non-manufacturing figures falling slightly, along with benefit claims rising. The independence day hangovers (US markets were closed yesterday) may also have played its part. The biggest risers on the FTSE were a hodgepodge of companies, led by engineering group GKN, up 24.4p, 13%, at 306.5p, which snapped up Volvo's aerospace division, followed by Xstrata, up 25p, 3.1%, at 833.8p. The Qataris, who are key to the merger with Glencore, have been in town for the official opening of The Shard and rumours are abound that talks with bosses from both sides were positive. Barclays, despite the threat of a downgrade by Moody's, closed up 2.2p, 1.3%, at 165.9p, and Aviva had a positive response to its strategy overhaul, up 3.2p, 1.1%, at 286p. Royal Bank of Scotland propped up the biggest losers, down 7.3p, 3.4%, to 207.7p, as nervous investors worry about the potential fallout from the Libor scandal when it inevitably hits the Government-controlled bank. It pulled out of the panel which sets the Japanese version of Libor \u2013 Tibor \u2013 today.",

      "bodyText": "\"Quantitative easing\" has become such a familiar phrase over the past three years that it now seems like a standard part of the Bank of England's equipment \u2013 giving the \"one club golfer\", as Ted Heath once dubbed anyone trying to guide the economy using interest rates alone, one more club. But before the days of the financial crisis, QE was seen as a drastic emergency measure, which only Japanese policymakers had used on a large scale in recent times, to little avail, as their economy slumped into a \"lost decade\" of deflation and recession. Make no mistake: this latest \u00a350bn-worth of electronically created money being pumped into the financial system is a sign of deep desperation, not a simple chip out of the rough. As the Bank said in the statement that accompanied its decision to expand QE to an eye-popping \u00a3375bn, this is an economy that had failed to grow for the past 18 months, and has now slipped into recession \u2013 and the headwinds are getting worse. Last week's eurozone summit in Brussels may have been greeted with a great fanfare as a sign that Germany was prepared to make solid moves towards standing behind its troubled partners' debts. But as the dust has settled, there have been growing doubts about whether the deal Italy and Spain thought they had wrung from Berlin was as good as it first appeared. The Bank of England monetary policy committee certainly does not seem convinced: as it said, \"in spite of the progress made at the latest European council, concerns remain about the indebtedness and competitiveness of several euro-area economies, and that is weighing on confidence here\". Meanwhile, the recovery in the US seems to be grinding to a halt; and the anxious Chinese authorities are cutting interest rates to avoid a so-called \"hard landing\". It is not quite the global loss of nerve that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008 and early 2009; but there is no doubt that there is a deep malaise in many of the UK's major markets. Given that one of the few sources of hope for the clapped out British economy was a jump in exports, that is very bad news. At home, meanwhile, whether or not George Osborne's slash and burn approach to restoring the public finances caused the double-dip, the further belt-tightening that is due over the next couple of years certainly will not help boost growth. The collapse in construction as orders for taxpayer-funded schools and public projects have dried up, and which has been a key cause of the latest downturn in GDP, is just one example of the coalition's fiscal tightening leeching demand out of the economy. And while it is re-starting QE, the Bank is also working with the Treasury to launch a battery of other emergency measures, including the \"funding for lending\" scheme announced by George Osborne in the Mansion House speech \u2013 a clear acknowledgment that QE is reaching the limits of its effectiveness. So the real message to take from the Bank's decision on Thursday is not, \"don't panic,\" but, \"be very afraid\". King knows very well that this is an economy that's buried deep in a bunker.",

Paul Tucker's testimony will be more interesting than that of Bob Diamond, whose biggest decision in the next few weeks will be whether to accept the \u00a322m or so that the board (probably) will offer him as a payoff. Tucker, by contrast, is fighting to become the next Bank of England governor . He won't succeed if his evidence, like Diamond's, is judged to be implausible. That means giving a full account of both the Diamond memo and also why regulators apparently tolerated the open secret that theLibor numbers couldn't be trusted in 2008. 2. The Treasury select committee has form in flunking it. Remember the encounter with the private equity barons in 2007? It was even more embarrassing than Wednesday's hearing. Highly coached businessmen versus under-prepared MPs led to misunderstandings and frustration on both sides. Part of theproblem is the format \u2013 every member gets his or her 10 minutes and they all go for different angles. Better for all to agree in advance on the questions that must be posed \u2013 then insist on getting the answers. If they're incapable of doing the latter, hire a QC to do the interrogation. The MPs' timidity was astonishing. Come on, if you don't like Diamond addressing you by your first name, just tell him, don't tweet your complaint. It wouldn't happen on a US Senate committee inquiry. 3. One of Diamond's seemingly sensible remarks was that Barclays was unfairly beaten up for being the first in line in the industry-wide Libor investigation \u2013 a \"first move disadvantage\" as committee chairman Andrew Tyrie put it. But was Barclays first solely because it agreed to co-operate? We learned on Wednesday that the Financial Services Authority had had concerns about the Barclays' culture for a long time. Was this also a factor? Did the bank choose to head the queue or was it pushed there? The FSA would do well to clear up this point before the idea becomes entrenched that a chief executive who agrees to co-operate in an industry-wide investigation is most in danger of losing his job. 4. Bad deeds have been exposed at two UK companies this week. In the case of GlaxoSmithKline, fined $3bn after admitting bribing doctors and encouraging the prescription of unsuitable antidepressants to children, the wrongdoing was exposed partly by the good work of whistleblowers. Would it be helpful to offer financial inducements to would-be whistleblowers in banks' trading rooms? In Barclays' case, somebody might have been tempted to spill the beans to regulators in return for payment worth a couple of years' bonuses. Of course, such a system would rely on the regulators being awake, but bonuses for incriminating evidence sounds an interesting avenue. 5. Marcus Agius, Barclays chairman since January 2007, is due to appear before the committee next Tuesday. But let's also hear from a wide selection of the famous names who served as non-executive directors on the board in the 2005-09 period. How did they view the culture of Barclays and Barclays Capital at the time? What did they investigate? Did they get the information they requested? Did they worry that the organisation was being swamped by investment bankers? The answers of supposedly independent non-executives ought to be more revealing than Diamond's tiresome repetitions of his love for the organisation.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Germany is strong, but not strong enough to take on Europe's other major players in tandem", 
      "body": "<p>Rarely is a high-flying country brought back down to Earth in a single night, but that is precisely what happened to Germany recently. In both football and politics, the country had come to embody an unseemly mixture of arrogance and denial. It thought itself the measure of all things European, in terms of both the European Championship and the European Union. In both cases, it was deceiving itself.</p> <p>The same night that Germany were thrashed by the Italians in the semi-finals, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, ran up against the limits of her own powers at the eurozone leaders' summit in Brussels. Germany's political course since the beginning of the euro crisis two years ago had left it isolated, and she was no match for an alliance of Italy, Spain and France.</p> <p>She had no choice but to concede and agree to far-reaching changes to the EU's new fiscal compact that will ease refinancing of the crisis countries and their banks. The German dogma of \"no payments without counter-performance and control\" was thus off the table, and the bargain struck in the early hours of the morning was exactly the opposite of what she had wanted. The fiscal compact had been reduced to a shambles even before Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, approved it later that day.</p> <p>In terms of addressing the eurozone financial crisis, however, the agreement reached in Brussels was anything but a breakthrough because it never transcended the logic of narrow crisis management. It offers no strategy for overcoming the crisis in the south of Europe, which means that the threat to the eurozone has not been removed.</p> <p>Politically, however, the agreement amounts to a small revolution because it has shifted the balance of power within the eurozone: Germany is strong, but not strong enough to get away with isolating itself completely from Europe's other major players. Decisions that go against Germany are possible.</p> <p>There was patent gloating about the German defeat everywhere, only thinly disguised behind strained expressions of solidarity. The full extent of the political damage that Germany's bailout policy for the eurozone, with its austerity, mass unemployment and economic depression, has caused in southern Europe remains to be seen.</p> <p>If Merkel had wanted the agreement reached in Brussels, the outcome would have marked the beginning of a fundamental revision of the eurozone's crisis policy \u2013 and thus an expression of successful statesmanship. Instead, it is a full-blown defeat for Germany, linked to its firm denial that German policy has sharply reduced the country's influence in the EU. Yet it clearly has: German influence within the European Central Bank has declined significantly; the German finance minister will not become head of the Eurogroup; and now we have the Brussels disaster.</p> <p>But Germany's defeat, however widely celebrated, holds much cause for concern. First, not everything that Germany is arguing is wrong: the urgent need for medium-term fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to increase the crisis countries' competitiveness will not go away. Equally important, however, is the reduction of economic imbalances and European policy co-ordination to enable growth.</p> <p>Second, political paranoia is rising on the German right. Supposedly, everybody just wants Germany's money, our Anglo-Saxon partners' real aim is to weaken us and the financial markets will not rest until Germany has invested all of its wealth and thus endangered its economic success. Germany is being \"betrayed to foreigners\" by the opposition, and \"good\" productive capital is once again being opposed to \"bad\" speculative capital. In the opinion pages of some German newspapers, anti-capitalism is returning in a new form, which entails nothing less than a renunciation of Europe and even of the west.</p> <p>While the German right threatens to become more nationalistic, history will not repeat itself, because today's Germany has changed and so has its political environment. Still, an increasingly Eurosceptic Germany in the heart of the EU could, given its great economic clout, seriously endanger the European integration process. And, while that would jeopardise Germany's own interests, practical political action is not always rational, particularly in times of serious crisis.</p> <p>The same applies to France, except that the French, unlike the Germans, find it difficult to transfer political sovereignty, whereas for us it is all about the money. Both of these mental and political blocks are threatening the European project in equal measure.</p> <p>If the result of the recent summit means that France and Germany will each forge alliances against the other, while hiding behind verbal expressions of solidarity, we might just as well forget about Europe. Without a functioning Franco-German axis, the European project cannot succeed.</p> <p>Both sides will have to decide whether or not they want Europe \u2013 that is, full economic and political integration. Economically, they must choose either joint liability and a transfer union where wealthier states subsidise poorer ones, or monetary renationalisation. Politically, the choice is whether to empower a common government and parliament or return to full sovereignty. What we know for certain is that, just as one cannot be a little pregnant, the existing hybrid is not sustainable.</p> <p>Last November, Volker Kauder, the majority leader in the Bundestag, bragged: \"Suddenly Europe is speaking German.\" He was wrong.

      "bodyText": "Rarely is a high-flying country brought back down to Earth in a single night, but that is precisely what happened to Germany recently. In both football and politics, the country had come to embody an unseemly mixture of arrogance and denial. It thought itself the measure of all things European, in terms of both the European Championship and the European Union. In both cases, it was deceiving itself. The same night that Germany were thrashed by the Italians in the semi-finals, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, ran up against the limits of her own powers at the eurozone leaders' summit in Brussels. Germany's political course since the beginning of the euro crisis two years ago had left it isolated, and she was no match for an alliance of Italy, Spain and France. She had no choice but to concede and agree to far-reaching changes to the EU's new fiscal compact that will ease refinancing of the crisis countries and their banks. The German dogma of \"no payments without counter-performance and control\" was thus off the table, and the bargain struck in the early hours of the morning was exactly the opposite of what she had wanted. The fiscal compact had been reduced to a shambles even before Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, approved it later that day. In terms of addressing the eurozone financial crisis, however, the agreement reached in Brussels was anything but a breakthrough because it never transcended the logic of narrow crisis management. It offers no strategy for overcoming the crisis in the south of Europe, which means that the threat to the eurozone has not been removed. Politically, however, the agreement amounts to a small revolution because it has shifted the balance of power within the eurozone: Germany is strong, but not strong enough to get away with isolating itself completely from Europe's other major players. Decisions that go against Germany are possible. There was patent gloating about the German defeat everywhere, only thinly disguised behind strained expressions of solidarity. The full extent of the political damage that Germany's bailout policy for the eurozone, with its austerity, mass unemployment and economic depression, has caused in southern Europe remains to be seen. If Merkel had wanted the agreement reached in Brussels, the outcome would have marked the beginning of a fundamental revision of the eurozone's crisis policy \u2013 and thus an expression of successful statesmanship. Instead, it is a full-blown defeat for Germany, linked to its firm denial that German policy has sharply reduced the country's influence in the EU. Yet it clearly has: German influence within the European Central Bank has declined significantly; the German finance minister will not become head of the Eurogroup; and now we have the Brussels disaster. But Germany's defeat, however widely celebrated, holds much cause for concern. First, not everything that Germany is arguing is wrong: the urgent need for medium-term fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to increase the crisis countries' competitiveness will not go away. Equally important, however, is the reduction of economic imbalances and European policy co-ordination to enable growth. Second, political paranoia is rising on the German right. Supposedly, everybody just wants Germany's money, our Anglo-Saxon partners' real aim is to weaken us and the financial markets will not rest until Germany has invested all of its wealth and thus endangered its economic success. Germany is being \"betrayed to foreigners\" by the opposition, and \"good\" productive capital is once again being opposed to \"bad\" speculative capital. In the opinion pages of some German newspapers, anti-capitalism is returning in a new form, which entails nothing less than a renunciation of Europe and even of the west. While the German right threatens to become more nationalistic, history will not repeat itself, because today's Germany has changed and so has its political environment. Still, an increasingly Eurosceptic Germany in the heart of the EU could, given its great economic clout, seriously endanger the European integration process. And, while that would jeopardise Germany's own interests, practical political action is not always rational, particularly in times of serious crisis. The same applies to France, except that the French, unlike the Germans, find it difficult to transfer political sovereignty, whereas for us it is all about the money. Both of these mental and political blocks are threatening the European project in equal measure. If the result of the recent summit means that France and Germany will each forge alliances against the other, while hiding behind verbal expressions of solidarity, we might just as well forget about Europe. Without a functioning Franco-German axis, the European project cannot succeed. Both sides will have to decide whether or not they want Europe \u2013 that is, full economic and political integration. Economically, they must choose either joint liability and a transfer union where wealthier states subsidise poorer ones, or monetary renationalisation. Politically, the choice is whether to empower a common government and parliament or return to full sovereignty. What we know for certain is that, just as one cannot be a little pregnant, the existing hybrid is not sustainable. Last November, Volker Kauder, the majority leader in the Bundestag, bragged: \"Suddenly Europe is speaking German.\" He was wrong. Just as Spain, not Germany, remains the benchmark in European football, so Europe speaks broken English at best. From the standpoint of safeguarding the European project, that is all for the better.

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond flew out of the UK and returned to the US just hours after his controversial appearance before MPs \u2013 but the rapid departure of the former Barclays boss yesterday sparked ratings agencies to threaten to downgrade the bank. Both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's warned they might downgrade Barclays' credit rating because of the turmoil at the top of the bank following the Libor rate-rigging scandal, and the difficulty of replacing key senior staff, including Diamond. They also warned of a potential re-shaping of the bank's operations, which are currently reliant on investment banking arm Barclays Capital. The renewed pressure on the bank from the ratings agencies came as Barclays considered whether to comply with a request from Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, to provide documents from the Financial Services Authority which the MP has claimed raised concerns about the culture inside Barclays. Tyrie has summoned Marcus Agius, reinstated as Barclays' chairman after his resignation on Monday, to appear before MPs next Tuesday, when he will be asked about the issues raised by the City regulator in February when top regulator Andrew Bailey attended the bank's board meeting. During Wednesday's appearance before MPs, Diamond was caught by surprise when Tyrie asked about the FSA's visit to the boardroom \u2013 part of a more thorough approach to regulation \u2013 in February. The MP also asked Diamond about concerns raised by the FSA when his appointment was announced in the autumn of 2010. Diamond said he had no knowledge of this, prompting Tyrie to write to Agius to obtain the details, which include a letter by Lord Turner, FSA chairman, in February this year. The record \u00a3290m fine for attempting to manipulate Libor sparked outrage, forcing Agius to announce his resignation \u2013 but only 24 hours later the political pressure led Diamond to quit, along with close colleague Jerry del Missier, who was promoted to chief operating officer only last month. Fitch ratings agency warned that the entire industry was facing increased \"political, regulatory and reputation risks\" from the Libor scandal but said the impact was manageable for Barclays. But as it put the outlook for the bank's rating on a negative outlook, the Moody's agency said that the shareholder and political pressures on Barclays and the resignation of three top staff could lead the bank to shift its business model away from investment banking and reform perceived failures in its business culture. While the change in culture \"could have potentially positive implications over the longer term, the uncertainty surrounding such a change in direction is credit negative in the short term\", Moody's said. The agency, which changed the outlook on the C-/baa2 standalone bank financial strength rating rather then the more closely watched long-term rating, also said it was concerned about the difficulties of finding new top management. \"The bank could be challenged to replace the three senior staff and in particular find a new CEO who not only has a sufficient understanding of the investment banking business to run Barclays, but also has the credibility and ability to swiftly address the weaknesses that the Libor incident revealed and stakeholders' perceptions of the investment bank,\" Moody's added. S&amp;P's said the negative outlook it had put on the bank's long-term rating \"reflects our view of the current management flux and near-term strategic uncertainty arising from the revelation of what we perceive to be certain poor business practices and weak compliance in relation to the past setting of interbank offered rates\". \"We see potential for the eventual new CEO to review the current scope of Barclays' activities, particularly if that person were an external hire,\" said S&amp;P.
