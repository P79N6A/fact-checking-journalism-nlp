    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the Financial Services Authority prepares to crack down on the power of dominant shareholders, in response to abuses seen at companies such as Kazakhstan-based ENRC and Bumi, spare a thought for Goodwin plc. Never heard of it? That's understandable since the engineering firm, based in Stoke-on-Trent and worth \u00a3100m, is the polar opposite of ENRC and Bumi. Founded in 1883, Goodwin and its 960 employees get on with their business in a quiet, and extremely successful, manner. The company has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 1958, the last time it raised equity capital, and over the past two decades its share price has risen from 40p to \u00a315. Compare that to Bumi's 85% collapse during its 18-month journey from cash shell to Indonesian disaster story. Goodwin's only similarity to the likes of ENRC and Bumi is that has a dominant shareholder in the form of the Goodwin family, which owns 56% of the shares. In spirit and governance, Goodwin is essentially a family firm. John Goodwin is the chairman, his brother Richard is managing director and each has two sons in the business. Nor \u2013 and this is the critical point now that the FSA is on the warpath \u2013 does Goodwin have independent non-executive directors. It thinks they are too costly and unlikely to add value, says the annual report. Naturally, that explanation receives short shrift from the governance watchdogs. Ahead of Goodwin's annual meeting next week, the Association of British Insurers has issued one of its rare \"red top\" warnings and Pirc has expressed \"significant concern\". Goodwin is used to such complaints but, under the current \"comply or explain\" regime, life goes on. Richard Goodwin says shareholders speaking for about 0.05% of the shares tend to grumble about governance while \"the other 99.95% just tell us to get on with what we are doing\". Under the FSA's proposals, that would change. \"Comply or explain\" would be replaced with \"comply\". Goodwin would have to appoint a majority of independent non-executives to its board or see its premium listing on the London Stock Exchange cancelled. Them's the rules \u2013 or proposals, as they currently are \u2013 and the FSA wants to apply them equally to mining companies out of the former Soviet Union and family-controlled 130-year old engineers from the Potteries. Admittedly, there aren't many listed firms that fit Goodwin's category. But, in another context, you would expect officialdom to be shouting about Goodwin's success since it practises most of the virtues that almost everybody agrees represent the best route towards revival for the UK's manufacturing base. It exports its valves to oil, gas and energy producers around the world and makes long-term investment a priority. The annual report explains that after a 51% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a312.3m this year's dividend is being increased by \"only\" 10% (which doesn't sound too bad), so that new projects can be financed, including the training of 125 apprentices over the next five years. But, no, if the FSA plans are adopted, Goodwin would have to accept a lower-grade \"standard\" listing in London, or shove off to the Alternative Investment Market. It'll have to be something of that sort since Richard Goodwin thinks the firm would not be able to continue making the same returns for shareholders if it packed its board with non-executives. Maybe Goodwin is such an exceptional case that it should be ignored when it comes to setting boardroom rules. After all, the likes of ENRC clearly need more powerful non-executives to stop them being personal fiefdoms. But it's bizarre that the UK listing authority, finally understanding that it too casually embraced the rush of billionaire-backed foreign mining outfits, should cause trouble for an old and successful UK engineer that doesn't fit the standard blueprint. As for ABI and Pirc: come on, you do fine work in checking boardroom abuses at public companies, but there are better targets for your criticisms than a company whose few outside shareholders are delighted with their investment.",

Richard Goodwin says shareholders speaking for about 0.05% of the shares tend to grumble about governance while \"the other 99.95% just tell us to get on with what we are doing\".</p> <p>Under the FSA's proposals, that would change. \"Comply or explain\" would be replaced with \"comply\". Goodwin would have to appoint a majority of independent non-executives to its board or see its premium listing on the London Stock Exchange cancelled. Them's the rules \u2013 or proposals, as they currently are \u2013 and the FSA wants to apply them equally to mining companies out of the former Soviet Union and family-controlled 130-year old engineers from the Potteries.</p> <p>Admittedly, there aren't many listed firms that fit Goodwin's category. But, in another context, you would expect officialdom to be shouting about Goodwin's success since it practises most of the virtues that almost everybody agrees represent the best route towards revival for the UK's manufacturing base.</p> <p>It exports its valves to oil, gas and energy producers around the world and makes long-term investment a priority. The annual report explains that after a 51% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a312.3m this year's dividend is being increased by \"only\" 10% (which doesn't sound too bad), so that new projects can be financed, including the training of 125 apprentices over the next five years.</p> <p>But, no, if the FSA plans are adopted, Goodwin would have to accept a lower-grade \"standard\" listing in London, or shove off to the Alternative Investment Market. It'll have to be something of that sort since Richard Goodwin thinks the firm would not be able to continue making the same returns for shareholders if it packed its board with non-executives.</p> <p>Maybe Goodwin is such an exceptional case that it should be ignored when it comes to setting boardroom rules. After all, the likes of ENRC clearly need more powerful non-executives to stop them being personal fiefdoms. But it's bizarre that the UK listing authority, finally understanding that it too casually embraced the rush of billionaire-backed foreign mining outfits, should cause trouble for an old and successful UK engineer that doesn't fit the standard blueprint.</p> <p>As for ABI and Pirc: come on, you do fine work in checking boardroom abuses at public companies, but there are better targets for your criticisms than a company whose few outside shareholders are delighted with their investment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers are expected to pump another \u00a350bn of funds into the economy next month to boost growth, despite the central bank's decision on Thursday to leave base rates untouched at 0.5% and the quantitative easing (QE) total at \u00a3375bn. Analysts said the bank was likely to take its programme of QE to a new high of \u00a3425bn at its November meeting following a series of indicators that showed the economy is continuing to struggle. Halifax reported a fall in house prices in September while a big boost to car sales last month appeared to follow heavy discounting and cheap finance deals that enticed customers to part with their cash. Reports on the property market and car sales follow industry surveys earlier in the week that showed a modest bounce back after steep falls in output in the first half of the year. The construction and manufacturing industries contracted last month and the services industry grew more slowly as fears that the Olympics would provide only a short-term boost were confirmed. Threadneedle Street had been expected to maintain its current position, with all eyes on November for a further monetary stimulus. The Bank's rate-setting monetary policy committee will examine the latest industry surveys and how the market for business loans and mortgages has reacted to its \u00a380bn Funding for Lending scheme, before making a decision to expand QE. Quantitative easing involves the bank buying government bonds from a range of financial institutions in the hope they use the money to lend to businesses and households. Most economists expect another dose of stimulus ahead of the Christmas break, although the decision may not be unanimous. \"Some members \u2013 Spencer Dale, Ben Broadbent and Martin Weale, in our view \u2013 are closer to our hawkish view on inflation, and we think their lack of enthusiasm for doing more is likely to be clear again,\" said Nomura economist Philip Rush. \"However, we still doubt they will 'win the debate' and block the committee from announcing more QE in November,\" he said. Chief executive of car lobby SMMT, Paul Everitt, said car sales rose by 8.2% in September, nearly twice the annual rate seen so far this year. He said a degree of confidence had returned to car buyers, though analysts argued much of the increase could be attributed to aggressive discounting and appealing finance deals. \"Although the economic outlook remains challenging, we are starting to see a tentative return of consumer confidence,\" said Everitt. Mortgage lender Halifax said house prices fell for a third month and will probably remain little changed into 2013 amid a \"weak\" economy. Anna Leach, head of economic analysis at the CBI business lobby group, said the MPC was expected to delay a decision until the current round of QE was completed. \"Looking ahead to November's meeting, we think that the committee is likely to favour further asset purchases. While there have been a few positive signs in recent data, underlying conditions remain relatively flat. \"Meanwhile, uncertainty around the international backdrop is likely to build further through the autumn, keeping confidence in check.\" The Bank of England printed \u00a3200bn of funds to buy bonds in the wake of the Lehmans crash and has added almost the same amount again in the past two years to stop the economy falling back into another deep recession.",

    "webTitle": "Halfords buoyed by Olympic cycling glory", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The cycling gold rush at the London 2012 Olympics and Bradley Wiggins's historic triumph in the Tour de France have encouraged the nation's couch potatoes to get on their bikes. Halfords, the UK's biggest bike retailer, said like-for-like cycle sales jumped 14.7% in the three months to the end of September. Dennis Millard, Halfords' chairman, who has been running the company since the former chief executive David Wild quit in July following a profits warning, said the Olympics had driven an uptake in cycling across all members of families, with women's bikes selling \"exceptionally well\" following Victoria Pendleton's success. He said sales of new bikes designed by Pendleton \u2013 which are the chain's first range of cycles designed exclusively for women \u2013 are proving among the best sellers but refused to disclose any sales figures. However, sales of wicker baskets to fit on the front of the vintage-style Pendleton bike jumped 55% in August. Halfords said the increase was being driven by a host of celebrities, including Miranda Hart, Elle Macpherson, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, being snapped in magazines riding vintage-style bikes. When she launched the range of bikes, Pendleton said: \"I wanted to help create a bike that you could just jump on to go down to the shops or the park. I know that most women don't want to squeeze into Lycra before they get on a bike.\" Halfords said there was considerable potential for growth among women, with research by a cycling charity showing 79% of women don't regularly cycle. \"When the middle-aged man in Lycra buys his racing bike, the rest of the family join in,\" Millard said. \"From two-year-old kiddies to an old guy like me, who rides [Halfords' Chris-Boardman-designed] Boardman bike.\" The sales boost comes after a torrid few months for the chain. In May, Halfords reported a 27% fall in full-year profits to \u00a392m. Halfords shares jumped 13.5% to 301.5p in early trading on the back of the good results on Thursday. Millard reckons one in three bikes sold in the UK are from Halfords, but conceded that the company's poor reputation for customer service was still a big problem. \"We believe we have been lagging behind in training colleagues and not providing the right tools to deal with customers effectively,\" he said. \"We believe we should be training them better \u2013 the delivery of service and expertise was not consistently good. \"We will invest in training so that they can delight the customer.\" On Thursday, Halfords also announced it had appointed the former Pets at Home boss Matt Davies as chief executive. Millard said Davies's key mission would be to improve the company's poor record on customer service. Davies, 41, who started working at the chain immediately, will be paid \u00a3500,000 a year with a potential annual bonus of \u00a3750,000 and a further \u00a3750,000 in long-term incentive shares from next August. Analysts at Panmure Gordon said: \"While perhaps some of the improvement is a one-off, the new chief executive has a stronger platform than he might have expected as he starts his first day.\" Christodoulos Chaviaras, an analyst at Barclays, said: \"After seven consecutive earnings downgrades in the last 18 months it was time for Halfords to beat and it did beat strongly, with management raising full-year guidance.\" But it was \"far from the truth\" to say Halfords' challenges were over, Chaviaras added. \"The new CEO is indeed a highly qualified individual in our view and has had success in deal making [for example, selling Pets at Home to KKR]. \"However, the appointment of a good-quality CEO doesn't mean that the problems are automatically fixed. The success of Matt Davies at Pets at Home doesn't guarantee his success at Halfords, where he will have to deal with some structurally declining product categories like car enhancement rather than with a naturally growing pets/pets care industry.\" Kate Calvert, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: \"We continue to believe that Halfords suffers from maturity and a tired offer rather than structural issues.\" Sales at Halfords' Autocentres car servicing operation rose 12.4% \u2013 the strongest quarter since it acquired the business in 2010. Halfords said it expected its half-year pre-tax profits to be between \u00a340m and \u00a342m, and full-year profits to be towards the top end of its previously stated \u00a362-\u00a370m range.",

In May, Halfords reported a 27% fall in full-year profits to \u00a392m.</p> <p>Halfords shares jumped 13.5% to 301.5p in early trading on the back of the good results on Thursday.</p> <p>Millard reckons one in three bikes sold in the UK are from Halfords, but conceded that the company's poor reputation for customer service was still a big problem.</p> <p>\"We believe we have been lagging behind in training colleagues and not providing the right tools to deal with customers effectively,\" he said. \"We believe we should be training them better \u2013 the delivery of service and expertise was not consistently good.</p> <p>\"We will invest in training so that they can delight the customer.\"</p> <p>On Thursday, Halfords also announced it had appointed the former Pets at Home boss Matt Davies as chief executive. Millard said Davies's key mission would be to improve the company's poor record on customer service.</p> <p>Davies, 41, who started working at the chain immediately, will be paid \u00a3500,000 a year with a potential annual bonus of \u00a3750,000 and a further \u00a3750,000 in long-term incentive shares from next August.</p> <p>Analysts at Panmure Gordon said: \"While perhaps some of the improvement is a one-off, the new chief executive has a stronger platform than he might have expected as he starts his first day.\"</p> <p>Christodoulos Chaviaras, an analyst at Barclays, said: \"After seven consecutive earnings downgrades in the last 18 months it was time for Halfords to beat and it did beat strongly, with management raising full-year guidance.\"</p> <p>But it was \"far from the truth\" to say Halfords' challenges were over, Chaviaras added. \"The new CEO is indeed a highly qualified individual in our view and has had success in deal making [for example, selling Pets at Home to KKR].</p> <p>\"However, the appointment of a good-quality CEO doesn't mean that the problems are automatically fixed. The success of Matt Davies at Pets at Home doesn't guarantee his success at Halfords, where he will have to deal with some structurally declining product categories like car enhancement rather than with a naturally growing pets/pets care industry.\"</p> <p>Kate Calvert, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: \"We continue to believe that Halfords suffers from maturity and a tired offer rather than structural issues.\"</p> <p>Sales at Halfords' Autocentres car servicing operation rose 12.4% \u2013 the strongest quarter since it acquired the business in 2010.</p> <p>Halfords said it expected its half-year pre-tax profits to be between \u00a340m and \u00a342m, and full-year profits to be towards the top end of its previously stated \u00a362-\u00a370m range.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A merger of BAE Systems and EADS could produce an arms company so big it would operate beyond the reach of the law, the author of a report on corruption in the defence industry has warned. \"This will be a huge defence company in Europe and there will be a concern that it will be above prosecution, almost like the banks,\" said Mark Pyman, director of the defence and security programme at Transparency International UK. He said that if the planned \u00a330bn merger went ahead, the company should set up an independent board to ensure it did not indulge in bribery and corruption. The warning adds another potential obstacle to the deal, which has already run into political headwinds as governments from Berlin to Washington argue about how and where the new company would be run. The British, German and French governments all have stakes in the companies' merger and the US administration is the biggest customer of BAE. Pyman was speaking prior to the launch of an unprecedented study looking at defence companies around the world and their attitudes towards corruption. Transparency International's first anti-corruption index shows that British and US firms have responded to past scandals by adopting a much more rigorous approach towards corruption than continental European firms, including EADS. There were significant differences between BAE and EADS in their approaches to transparency and disclosure, Pyman said. BAE came up at the top of band B in the index, while EADS only made band C. Neither EADS nor any French defence company agreed to supply internal company information to the compilers of the study, even on a confidential basis. \"If the merger goes ahead it is really important that the combined companies have anti-corruption systems at least equal to BAE's, and which really should be in band A,\" Pyman said. He spoke of BAE's slush fund for secret payments to Saudi dignitaries in a contract initiated in the 1980s (which was exposed by the Guardian), the payments to foreign governments by the US company Lockheed Martin in the 1970s, and the 2003 bribery scandal involving Boeing employees over a contract for a new US air force tanker aircraft. \"It is clear that scandals have had an immense effect on changing a company's behaviour.\" The TI study concludes that two-thirds of the world's biggest defence firms do not provide enough public evidence on how they fight corruption.

EADS, which is registered in the Netherlands, scored a low band C rating, and it declined to provide internal information in confidence to the TI study team that was led by Pyman. France, which has a significant stake in EADS, fares particularly badly.

On the basis of available public information, the company Thales comes out relatively well, with a band B rating, but Dassault, manufacturer of Rafale aircraft, and which recently beat BAE's Eurofighter/Typhoon to a multibillion-pound deal with India, comes off badly, with a band E score. Only four companies \u2013 Fluor Corporation , Accenture, Hewlett-Packard and Britain's Serco Group \u2013 scored a grade A in \"risk management\", measuring how companies assess decisions to counter corrupt influences and use due diligence to curb corrupt behaviour by intermediaries. The TI report says it is surprising so few defence firms take corruption seriously since most countries must comply with international anti-corruption laws, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the recent UK Bribery Act, which have extraterritorial reach. Transparency International is a charity set up to combat corruption and promote good practice in companies in all sectors, not only defence. SFO investigates GPT The Serious Fraud Office is conducting a criminal investigation into GPT Special Project Management, a British subsidiary of EADS. The investigation concerns payments and gifts allegedly given to Saudi generals. GPT sells communications equipment to the Saudi national guard via a government-to-government programme intimately involving the Ministry of Defence. The management of the \u00a32bn project, called Sangcom, has been monitored by an MoD team headed by a British general. Saudi payments to GPT go through an MoD bank account. Ian Foxley, a former colonel in the British army who blew the whistle on the project, has given detailed evidence to the SFO. He told the Guardian that fraud investigators should not be allowed to distinguish between individuals allegedly involved in wrongdoing, and the company which employed them. It had been too easy to let either individuals or firms off the hook. Under a memoranda of understanding with the Saudi Arabian government, the MoD places contracts with British contractors. Some MoD officials appear to have expressed concern about payments made to a Cayman Islands bank account by GPT as early as 2008, the Financial Times reported.",

      "bodyText": "Carillion, the outsourcing giant, has been accused of racial discrimination by Asian-origin hospital workers who claim they were told by white managers to give gold watches, bangles and cash in exchange for favours. Forty eight staff of Goan origin said in employment tribunal papers that they were subjected to a culture of intimidation and fear by supervisors at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire. One particularly disturbing aspect of this, it is alleged, was the practice of managers to demand \"gifts\" from non-white staff including cash, jewellery, cigarettes, alcohol and, in one instance, a duvet. In return, staff would be granted holiday and overtime requests, allowing them to return to Goa to visit family members or attend religious festivals, it is claimed. When staff complained of the practice as early as 2007, they faced harassment for trade union membership and whistle-blowing, it is claimed. A spokeswoman for Carillion said that there were incidents of gift giving for favours from managers, but added that these have been investigated thoroughly and disciplinary procedures are in place. The company will vigorously defend itself against the claims. Carillion is one of the UK's leading companies in providing support services to local and central government through a variety of Public and Private Partnership projects. In a 2012 interim report, entitled 'Making Tomorrow a Better Place', the company's revenue is listed as \u00a32.2bn with underlying profit before taxation amounting to \u00a373.1m. Jose Estrocio, a claimant and GMB union representative, said that the tribunal cases follow years of intimidation and complaints. \"We are in a developed country and had to give money and gold for holidays. None of the white cleaners had to do this, it was only the Goan community.\" Shah Qureshi, a partner at the law firm Bindmans, said that those that complained were victimised with the threat of disciplinary action. \"This type of scenario is akin to the 'master and servant' relationship of Victorian Britain and should have no place in the 21st Century,\" he said. Most of the workers were recruited in Britain to work for Carillion as porters, cleaners, and members of the housekeeping staff in Swindon's biggest hospital. Supervisors maintained a system whereby they expected gifts in return for favours but their demands were only made of non-white employees, according to the writ. Paulo Fernandes, a union rep, claimed that when he applied for a porter's job, he was asked by a female manager \"What will you give me?\" before being asked for a gold chain of a certain length, saying it had to be visible and not too long or too short. Fernandes, accompanied by a friend, handed over a chain belonging to his wife at the manager's house, it is claimed. He began work as a porter, but after four weeks was told that he was not doing his job properly and would have to return to a housekeeping job, it is also claimed. \"The claimant started to cry and was in complete shock,\" the papers noted. Another claimant, Irene de Souza, wanted to travel to Goa for 10 days in January 2011. She claimed a manager asked her for a gift, and she felt compelled to hand over perfume and a watch worth \u00a325. This was particularly distressing, she claimed, because it was a gift from her children. The gift-giving system carried on for years before the claimants joined the GMB union and issued a collective grievance procedure in December 2011, court papers said. The company carried out an investigation, the papers said, and the claimant cleaners were interviewed and told that their evidence was confidential. However, in June, the company told the workers that they were going to be subject to a disciplinary hearing because they had given gifts in return for benefits, the papers alleged. Staff say that one of the managers involved in obtaining gifts has left the company. A spokeswoman for Carillion said they have investigated the allegations and concluded that gifts have been given in exchange for favours from managers. So far, 58 members of staff have filed claims with the tribunal since February, she said, and these will be \"vigorously\" defended by the company. \"In the circumstances it was appropriate that Carillion carried out disciplinary processes with employees who admitted giving or facilitating gifts for advantage. This is an ongoing process but outcomes so far have included training to those who gave gifts for advantage \u2013 not sanction. \"To be clear: Carillion will not tolerate racism or racist remarks from any of our employees, and racism goes completely against all our values as an organisation, as well as our policies. \"Claims are presently being subjected to a formal case management process by the tribunal. It is only once this process is completed at the end of this year that we will have a clear understanding of which cases the tribunal will expect Carillion to defend \u2013 and which claims the tribunal will not allow to proceed,\" she said.",
