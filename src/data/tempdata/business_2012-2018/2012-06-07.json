      "bodyText": "The toxic effects of Greece's economic crisis appear poised to engulf Cyprus, with speculation mounting that it is just a matter of time before it, too, is forced to resort to the European Union for rescue. The prospect of the nation becoming the fourth eurozone country to be thrown an economic lifeline by the EU has grown as officials have openly acknowledged the need to prop up a banking system badly hit by exposure to Greece. Over the course of the past week, Cyprus's president, finance minister and central bank governor have all admitted an urgent need to recapitalise Popular Bank, the island's second largest lender. Having been affected by non-performing loans in Greece and by the restructuring of the country's debt in March, the bank now needs a \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.5bn) lifeline by the end of June \u2013 a deadline described as \"an important crunch time\" by Panicos Demetriades, the country's central bank governor. If the bank cannot raise the funds privately, the government \u2013 itself cash-strapped by its exclusion from international capital markets \u2013 will have to step in. Speaking to the Guardian from Nicosia, George Georgiou, a senior central bank official, said: \"It is by no means a foregone conclusion that Cyprus will need a bailout.\" But another top-level central bank official conceded that Cypriot authorities were especially afraid of saying anything that might set off \"panic and uncertainty.\" \"The last thing we need is to panic depositors.

Most other listed-company executives who find themselves in the midst of a remuneration controversy attempt to absent themselves from the debate, perhaps believing \u2013 doubtless after taking extensive public relations advice \u2013 that they can disappear from view like a grinning Cheshire cat. Not so Sorrell. Facing near-certain defeat in a vote over his pay arrangements at next week's annual shareholder meeting, the WPP boss has taken to the pages of the FT to remind the swelling ranks of investor ingrates that 27 years ago it was he who had the vision to set up WPP, building it up from one room, with two people and a market value of just \u00a31m. Today the business employs 160,000 people in 108 countries and has a value of \u00a310bn. He finds objections to his pay \"deeply disturbing\", even \"wounding\". He rails: \"WPP is not a public utility.\" The role of the well-paid boss at WPP, he says, is \"to behave like an owner and entrepreneur and not a bureaucrat\". There is raw hurt and anger in his words. Not yet King Lear raging at pernicious daughters, but perhaps \u2013 in the buttoned-up language of the corporate world \u2013 veering in that direction. Last year some 42% of WPP shareholder votes were cast against the group's remuneration report \u2013 a clear signal of investor disquiet, which shareholder groups feel has, since then, gone almost entirely unheeded. All the significant governance watchdogs \u2013 the Association of British Insurers, Pirc, ISS and Manifest \u2013 have delivered swingeing criticisms of Sorrell's pay. Meanwhile, not a single institutional investor has spoken up in his defence. All the signs are that WPP will have to stomach defeat at next week's AGM and then find a way to move on. The event will break two records, becoming the third remuneration vote defeat for a FTSE 100 company in a single year and the sixth in a single year across the wider market. But what perhaps marks out the WPP spat is Sorrell's particular line of defence. Pirc notes that only once in his FT commentary does he refer to shareholders and the alignment of their interests with those of the firm's executive leadership. His emphasis, instead, is on top executives as owner-entrepreneurs. In truth, however, having built the business through a string of acquisitions into a global empire, Sorrell can no longer plausibly cast himself entrepreneur in any recognisable definition of the word. An entrepreneur, moreover, is not the kind of leader that a company of the scale and maturity of WPP needs at the helm. To argue otherwise, surely, would be a triumph of public relations beyond even the wit of Sorrell's smartest lieutenants.",

We oppose international pressure on the people of Greece to cede their sovereignty to a European Union that has, until now, increased social and economic inequalities throughout Europe by means of discriminatory economic regulations and austerity. Syriza, the coalition of the radical left, supports the right to work and to education, and opposes neoliberal economic policies that increase the precariousness of growing numbers of people \u2013 establishing unemployment as a norm, decimating social and health services, along with public education, and cutting economic production.</p> <p>We support the efforts of the Greek people to wrest power from non-elected technocrats and we oppose the reckless demonisation of the left coalition in Greece. The European press accuses the left of threatening to take Greece out of the euro, but fails to see that the left is struggling for a different Europe: one governed by and for the people, and committed to the open political participation of all in creating equal conditions for work and for a tolerable life.<br><strong>Etienne Balibar, Wendy Brown, Judith Butler, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Costas Douzinas, Jacqueline Rose, Joanna Bourke, Jacques Ranciere, Drucilla Cornell, Slavoj Zizek, Jean-Luc Nancy</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott's comparisons of the relative economic strengths in Europe (The real Euro 2012, 7 June) is entertaining, but uses a misleading metaphor. The real economic conflict is not among the different European states, but between the great mass of the people and the tiny political and financial elite. It's a very unequal conflict. The elite controls not only the decision-making process, but also the terms of debate.</p> <p>But maybe that is now changing: there is increasing public dissatisfaction with obscene inequality and a recognition that the solutions the elite has forced through have produced the opposite of the predicted result. To pursue the metaphor, the rich elite is taking the balls off the field all over Europe and demand is falling month by month.<br><strong>Keith Fletcher</strong><br><em>Caerphilly, south Wales</em></p> <p>\u2022 Mariano Rajoy's government plays the nationalist card over saving the Spanish banks from collapse (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/06/spain-euro-finished-fiscal-union\" title=\"\">Spain calls for new tax pact to save euro</a>, 7 June). Rajoy must recognise we cannot repeat the mistake of earlier bailouts of British and Irish banks, which left the existing bank structures largely intact. Equity holders were protected from meltdown of their wealth, creditors were compensated, but the public had to bear the cost of it all, without benefiting from greater lending to stimulate economic activity.</p> <p>A bailout of Spanish banks by EU taxpayers without changes in structure and management would benefit owners and executives, but it is neither in the interest of Spain's unemployed, nor the taxpayers in the rest of the EU. If these banks are to be rescued by the EU, two conditions must apply. First, the equity holders of these effectively insolvent banks must not be given public money without some return. For example, the empty housing assets of these banks could be used to increase the municipal housing stock, which would improve labour mobility. Second, EU governments must agree on measurable ways of ensuring the public receives a fair return in terms of jobs that might otherwise have been lost. Spending public money to rescue the financial sector can't be based on blind faith about the importance of this sector for the economy.<br><strong>SP Chakravarty</strong><br><em>Bangor, Gwynedd</em></p> <p>\u2022 Well done, Martin Kettle, for saying he doesn't know what the outcome of the euro crisis will be. He is right to say that muddling through \u2013 what Churchill called \"keep buggering on\" \u2013 is the most likely outcome (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/europe-muddle-disintegration\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 7 May). I surf continental papers, and the difference between the range of arguments there and the single-voice clamour that it's over and out for the euro and even the EU that we get from the UK press does not inspire confidence.

      "bodyText": "We write to support the ideals embodied by the Greek left (Report, 1 June) in the election of 17 June, which articulate the need for social and economic democracy under neoliberalism. We oppose international pressure on the people of Greece to cede their sovereignty to a European Union that has, until now, increased social and economic inequalities throughout Europe by means of discriminatory economic regulations and austerity. Syriza, the coalition of the radical left, supports the right to work and to education, and opposes neoliberal economic policies that increase the precariousness of growing numbers of people \u2013 establishing unemployment as a norm, decimating social and health services, along with public education, and cutting economic production. We support the efforts of the Greek people to wrest power from non-elected technocrats and we oppose the reckless demonisation of the left coalition in Greece. The European press accuses the left of threatening to take Greece out of the euro, but fails to see that the left is struggling for a different Europe: one governed by and for the people, and committed to the open political participation of all in creating equal conditions for work and for a tolerable life. Etienne Balibar, Wendy Brown, Judith Butler, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Costas Douzinas, Jacqueline Rose, Joanna Bourke, Jacques Ranciere, Drucilla Cornell, Slavoj Zizek, Jean-Luc Nancy \u2022 Larry Elliott's comparisons of the relative economic strengths in Europe (The real Euro 2012, 7 June) is entertaining, but uses a misleading metaphor. The real economic conflict is not among the different European states, but between the great mass of the people and the tiny political and financial elite. It's a very unequal conflict. The elite controls not only the decision-making process, but also the terms of debate. But maybe that is now changing: there is increasing public dissatisfaction with obscene inequality and a recognition that the solutions the elite has forced through have produced the opposite of the predicted result. To pursue the metaphor, the rich elite is taking the balls off the field all over Europe and demand is falling month by month. Keith Fletcher Caerphilly, south Wales \u2022 Mariano Rajoy's government plays the nationalist card over saving the Spanish banks from collapse (Spain calls for new tax pact to save euro, 7 June). Rajoy must recognise we cannot repeat the mistake of earlier bailouts of British and Irish banks, which left the existing bank structures largely intact. Equity holders were protected from meltdown of their wealth, creditors were compensated, but the public had to bear the cost of it all, without benefiting from greater lending to stimulate economic activity. A bailout of Spanish banks by EU taxpayers without changes in structure and management would benefit owners and executives, but it is neither in the interest of Spain's unemployed, nor the taxpayers in the rest of the EU. If these banks are to be rescued by the EU, two conditions must apply. First, the equity holders of these effectively insolvent banks must not be given public money without some return. For example, the empty housing assets of these banks could be used to increase the municipal housing stock, which would improve labour mobility. Second, EU governments must agree on measurable ways of ensuring the public receives a fair return in terms of jobs that might otherwise have been lost. Spending public money to rescue the financial sector can't be based on blind faith about the importance of this sector for the economy. SP Chakravarty Bangor, Gwynedd \u2022 Well done, Martin Kettle, for saying he doesn't know what the outcome of the euro crisis will be. He is right to say that muddling through \u2013 what Churchill called \"keep buggering on\" \u2013 is the most likely outcome (Comment, 7 May). I surf continental papers, and the difference between the range of arguments there and the single-voice clamour that it's over and out for the euro and even the EU that we get from the UK press does not inspire confidence. I don't know what is going to happen, but when the offshore-owned press, BBC and Sky all shout the same thing, I think I would go in other directions. Denis MacShane MP Lab, Rotherham",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the economic crisis in Europe deepens, China has unexpectedly cut its interest rates, prompting speculation that the world's second largest economy may be in worse shape than previously thought. For the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the People's Bank of China cut its one-year lending rate by a quarter of one percentage point, to 6.31%. Banks will also pay less interest on deposits, with the deposit rate dropping from 3.5% to 3.25%. Traders ignored the rumours, sending markets higher on the hope of a co-ordinated stimulus move by central banks across the globe \u2013 despite inaction from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank this week. The FTSE rallied 1.2% to close at 5448 and the Dow climbed 0.4% to close at 12,461. Across Europe, the German DAX closed 0.8% higher and the French CAC was up 0.4%. The price of oil rose on hopes that China was now focused on driving growth, and gold dropped 2% as traders dumped safe-haven assets. On top of the cuts, Beijing shocked economists by partially liberalising interest rates. In an attempt to amplify the effect of the rate cut, it relaxed rules so that banks can offer a 20% discount to the benchmark lending rate, compared with a previous level of 10%. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale economists said this was \"a game-changer for China's financial market, seemingly presenting a point of no return\". The package sent a clear signal that the government is worried about sharply slowing growth, weak exports and faltering investment. Chinese economic data has been dismal for months. Imports stalled in April despite expectations they would grow by more than 10%, suggesting that factories stopped ordering raw materials. Industrial output slowed to its lowest level since May 2009. Then, in May, China's manufacturing sector contracted for the seventh consecutive month. Investment in fixed assets also grew at its slowest pace in 11 years in the first four months of 2012. Officials hope the moves will prompt companies to borrow more and invest in their businesses, driving the Chinese to spend more and offset a slowdown in exports to Europe. Qu Hongbin, co-head of Asia economics at HSBC, said: \"This move carries a significant message. It is official: Beijing will do whatever it takes to support growth this year.\" But others said the measures presaged more bad news from China, which is set to publish a slew of economic data this weekend, including retail sales, industrial production and inflation. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange group World First, said: \"For the best part of 12 months, while the European situation has been dominating things, there have been worries about a hard landing in China. This is the first real interest rate cut since 2008 and it may just be that they know that the data coming out is going to be disappointing.\" SG economists said it may also be an attempt to bolster the economy in the face of an uncertain future. \"It is probably also a pre-emptive move ahead of the Greek election and a potential surge in global financial stress afterwards,\" they wrote. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, was later quizzed by senators at a congressional hearing about China's decision to cut interest rates. He said: \"China has slowed somewhat. So far the slowdown is pretty moderate.\" Bernanke said he was far more concerned about the impact of the continuing euro crisis on the fragile US economic recovery. \"So far I don't think changes in China's prospects on net are something for the US to be concerned about. There are much greater concerns from Europe,\" he said. In the US, Bernanke said, \"growth appears poised to continue at a moderate pace over coming quarters\". But the crisis in Europe has affected the US economy by \"acting as a drag on our exports, weighing on business and consumer confidence, and pressuring US financial markets and institutions,\" he warned. Bernanke said more action would be needed from European policymakers to \"stabilise euro-area banks, calm market fears about sovereign finances, achieve a workable fiscal framework for the euro area, and lay the foundations for long-term economic growth\". He added: \"US banks have greatly improved their financial strength in recent years, as I noted earlier. Nevertheless, the situation in Europe poses significant risks to the US financial system and economy and must be monitored closely. As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to take action as needed to protect the US financial system and economy in the event that financial stresses escalate.\"",

      "bodyText": "The chief executives of Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury's had their annual bonuses slashed last year \u2013 but still received bumper payouts \u2013 after the high-street downturn saw the retail groups miss key financial targets. M&amp;S boss Marc Bolland saw his pay package drop from \u00a34.9m in 2011 to \u00a32.5m after the retailer produced its first fall in annual profits in three years. Bolland will be able to make up some of that ground, however, because at the end of this week he is eligible for cash in shares worth \u00a31.7m that were part of the \"golden hello\" agreed when he was poached from Morrisons in 2010. He could have collected as much as \u00a33.9m, but is receiving a reduced payout after the retailer missed profit targets attached to the shares. On top of a basic salary of \u00a3975,000, pension contributions and perks such as a car and driver, Bolland received a cash and shares bonus of \u00a3663,000, which was roughly a third of his full entitlement of up to 200% of salary. He failed to hit targets tied to profitability set at the start of the year, when analysts had pencilled in profits of \u00a3718m. In the end Britain's biggest clothing retailer reported a 1% drop in underlying profits to \u00a3705.9m for the year to 31 March. The economic downturn has resulted in several years of tough trading for retailers as Britons cut back spending on clothing and food. It has also exposed poor performance, with Tesco boss Philip Clarke turning down his annual bonus after the supermarket chain issued its first profit warning in 20 years. Details of Bolland's remuneration come amid a round of high-profile shareholder revolts over executive pay at companies ranging from Barclays to Inmarsat and Prudential in a phenomenon dubbed the \"shareholder spring\". Investor resistance to big pay rises at underperforming firms have also led some executives, such as Aviva boss Andrew Moss, and Sly Bailey, head of newspaper group Trinity Mirror, to quit. WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell is currently staring down his shareholders who are angry about the 60% pay rise he received last year. At Sainsbury's, Justin King banked a pay and shares package worth \u00a33.9m, up from \u00a33.2m in 2011, after a year in which profits rose 7% to \u00a3712m. King received \u00a31.2m in salary and benefits as well as a \u00a3514,000 bonus but topped up his pay by cashing in share options worth \u00a31.3m. The boss of Britain's third largest grocer was also awarded shares worth \u00a3897,000, but they are locked away by the company for two years. The terms of King's pay package mean he can earn a cash bonus worth up to 125% of his annual salary of \u00a3920,000, but last year it was set at 56% after the remuneration committee judged that while profit came in on target, sales had been \"below threshold\". Its finance director, John Rogers, and Mike Coupe, the commercial director, were awarded cash bonuses at 42% of salary out of a maximum 90%. The company's annual report said King had received a \u00a320,000 pay rise at the start of the year, boosting his base salary to \u00a3940,000. Sainsbury's remuneration committee chairman, Bob Stack, said it had reviewed the grocer's long-term incentive schemes during the year and changed the criteria, pegging success to key measures such as return on capital, cash generation, and achieving sales growth \"more successfully than peers\". In a nod to the shareholder climate, Stack said it had also introduced a \"clawback\" provision for future long-term incentive awards, which would be invoked for misdemeanours such as material misstatement of accounts, fraud or \"serious misconduct\".",

Last month Willy Vangu, a DRC opposition politician, addressed members of the UK parliament at a conference called Secret Mining in the Congo, in which he claimed the country stands to lose more than $5.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) of natural assets and future revenues through secret sales. The country only has a gross domestic product of $13bn yet Vangu used his speech to ask Britain to withhold the \u00a3790m aid it has committed to donate to the country over four years.</p> <p>Pauline Latham MP, a member of the international development select committee, said: \"What is all the more concerning for UK taxpayers, seeking reassurances that [UK aid] is being spent wisely, is the involvement of London-listed FTSE 100 firms. It raises the need for a full investigation to get to the bottom of who is benefiting from these deals \u2013 are London-listed firms using Dan Gertler and shell companies to navigate around anti-bribery legislation?\"</p> <h2>And now for the shareholders...</h2> <p>ENRC faces becoming the latest victim of the \"shareholder spring\" when it holds its annual meeting next week.</p> <p>Investor advisory service Manifest predicts the meeting will feature a sizeable shareholder rebellion over the company's remuneration report.

If you don't judge that right, what chances have you got of getting other aspects right? I'd guess that there will be dissent of 25% to 30%\" she said.</p> <p>Manifest has warned its subscribers there are low hurdles for executives to qualify for long-term incentive plans.

Last month Willy Vangu, a DRC opposition politician, addressed members of the UK parliament at a conference called Secret Mining in the Congo, in which he claimed the country stands to lose more than $5.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) of natural assets and future revenues through secret sales. The country only has a gross domestic product of $13bn yet Vangu used his speech to ask Britain to withhold the \u00a3790m aid it has committed to donate to the country over four years. Pauline Latham MP, a member of the international development select committee, said: \"What is all the more concerning for UK taxpayers, seeking reassurances that [UK aid] is being spent wisely, is the involvement of London-listed FTSE 100 firms. It raises the need for a full investigation to get to the bottom of who is benefiting from these deals \u2013 are London-listed firms using Dan Gertler and shell companies to navigate around anti-bribery legislation?\" And now for the shareholders... ENRC faces becoming the latest victim of the \"shareholder spring\" when it holds its annual meeting next week. Investor advisory service Manifest predicts the meeting will feature a sizeable shareholder rebellion over the company's remuneration report. It also believes that investors remain angry about the corporate governance crisis at the company last year, when Sir Richard Sykes and Ken Olisa were forced from the board, raising fears that the company's Kazakh founders were trying to consolidate power. Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of Manifest, believes the detail behind the remuneration report could irk shareholders. \"The remuneration report is not complicated [to compile]. If you don't judge that right, what chances have you got of getting other aspects right? I'd guess that there will be dissent of 25% to 30%\" she said. Manifest has warned its subscribers there are low hurdles for executives to qualify for long-term incentive plans. Wilson added that shareholders often prefer to register protests on \"impersonal\" issues such as remuneration, rather than against specific people.",

      "bodyText": "The wait-and-see brigade won the day on Thursday as the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve and eurozone all decided to play it safe and do, well, nothing. The markets had been soaring on Wednesday following excitement that Fed chief Ben Bernanke, or the BoE would introduce the latest round of quantitative easing. In the end, both steered clear of any such action, but European markets still closed up for the second day in a row. The FTSE 100 closed up 64 points, 1.2%, at 5448, while the French, German, Spanish and Italian markets were also up. At one point the London market was up more than 2% around lunchtime, after the surprise announcement from China that interest rates would be cut, coinciding with New York opening, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5% and rising. The Chinese decision sent leading miners up, but the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 was Royal Bank of Scotland, which had a second successive day of increases. The bank closed up 11.2p, 5.3%, at 219.1p and was followed closely by fashion house Burberry, up 68p, 5.1%, at \u00a313.56 after a ratings upgrade from Credit Suisse. Glencore, up 13.5p, 3.9%, at 362.3p, and Xstrata, up 28.2p, 3%, at 968.8p, appeared to benefit from the Qatar sovereign wealth fund increasing its stake in the latter, again. The biggest fallers were precious metal miners Randgold, down 335p, 5.6%, at \u00a358.62 and Fresnillo, down 30p, 2%, at \u00a314.30, but it was hardly surprising for the former, after gold futures fell below $1,600 an ounce. Few companies had much to shout about, but one which managed to get shouted at was security firm G4S. The company, up 1p, 0.3%, at 277p, held its AGM in the heart of the City of London, and drew around 70 angry protesters. They wanted to raise awareness of the 773 complaints of abuse made against the company when it used to be in charge of deporting people from the UK for the Government. In particular, they had questions over the death of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan asylum seeker who died after he was restrained by G4S guards. Whether anyone inside the AGM raised similar concerns or questions may never be known, after the company decided to ban journalists from attending, despite earlier suggestions to the contrary. However, management were keen to let the waiting press know the remuneration resolution passed by 98.8% - although only 63.5% of potential votes were cast. The remaining resolution votes for the Anglo-Danish firm can't come out officially because the Denmark stock exchange had closed.",

      "bodyText": "Battersea Power Station is set to be saved in a \u00a3400m deal after a Malaysian consortium was appointed as the preferred buyer for the landmark building on London's south bank, which has lain derelict for three decades. Malaysian property developers SP Setia and Sime Darby Property outbid Chelsea Football Club, which had wanted to build a new 60,000-seater stadium south of the river. Chelsea said it was \"disappointed\" not to be chosen as the preferred bidder, adding that: \"Battersea is one of a limited number of options the club is considering.\" Beating off competition from a host of other bidders, the Malaysian duo have entered exclusive talks with administrators Ernst &amp; Young to buy the 15-hectare site for \u00a3400m. The venture is understood to want to work within the 8.3m sq ft (770,000 sq metre) outline planning consent obtained by the site's previous owner, the struggling Irish developer Treasury Holdings, for a scheme by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly that comprised 3,700 homes along with offices, shops and restaurants. In a joint statement, the Malaysian partners said they were planning a \"multi-use real estate regeneration project\" that would preserve the facade of the historical power plant with its distinctive four white chimney stacks, which featured on Pink Floyd's 1977 Animals album cover. Even though the building is Grade II*-listed, there had been growing calls for its protected status to be removed so it could be knocked down. The power station was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the creator of the red telephone box who also designed the former Bankside power station which became Tate Modern. It is Europe's largest brick building and has stood empty since being decommissioned in 1983. On top of the \u00a3400m, the Malaysian duo committed themselves to the construction of a new underground station as part of the proposed extension of the Northern Line. That contribution is thought to be worth about \u00a3250m. \"This is viewed as fundamental to the success of this regeneration project,\" the venture said. It has up to 28 days to conduct further due diligence. Wandsworth council leader Ravi Govindia said: \"There is still some way to go but this is potentially very good news. The power station is one of the biggest development opportunities in Nine Elms and key to extending the Northern line into Battersea. We're making tremendous progress towards transforming this old industrial stretch of the south bank which will provide up to 25,000 new jobs for London.\" However, Keith Garner, a local architect and member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group, was sceptical that the Malaysian duo would succeed after several other projects failed. \"It shows that no one has learned anything at all in the last 30 years,\" he told the Guardian. \"Three private developers have already failed disastrously. So what does Ernst &amp; Young decide to do? Why give it to a fourth private developer of course!\" The community group wanted the power station to be turned over to a trust with an endowment from the new owners to fund repairs. The trust would be able to raise money from the lottery and other sources not available to a commercial developer. The first plan to redevelop Battersea was led by John Broome, then chairman of Alton Towers and one of Lady Thatcher's favourite businessmen, who wanted to turn it into a theme park. He sold the site to Hong Kong developer Victor Hwang, whose architect Nicholas Grimshaw came up with grand ideas for a railway station, luxury flats, a cinema, two hotels and a home for the circus troupe Cirque du Soleil. Hwang in turn sold to Treasury, run by the Irish duo Johnny Ronan and Richard Barrett, for \u00a3400m in 2006. Despite winning planning permission in 2010, Treasury's \u00a35.5bn project collapsed amid big debts and the failure to attract an investor. The Malaysian duo's bid is \u00a370m higher than the \u00a3330m debt owed to Lloyds Banking Group and Ireland's National Asset Management Agency. The power station collapsed into administration last year after Lloyds and Nama called in their debt from Treasury, and Hwang called in a \u00a3178m vendor loan \u2013 which is still outstanding.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has a lot riding on the Bank of England getting it right. The chancellor would never dream of telling Sir Mervyn King and the other eight members of the monetary policy committee what to do but the government's economic strategy is a variation on the good cop, bad cop routine. Osborne is bad cop, piling on the austerity; King is good cop, keeping interest rates low and cranking up the electronic printing press from time to time. Thus far, the one small problem with the chancellor's growth strategy is the complete absence of growth. It might, therefore, have come as an unwelcome surprise to Osborne when Threadneedle Street followed the example of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and adopted a suck-it-and-see approach. Threadneedle Street resisted pressure from the IMF to add to its \u00a3325bn QE programme and cut Bank rate from its record low level of 0.5%, perhaps as a hint that Christine Lagarde, right, should mind her own business. Within hours, Fitch popped up with a warning that it would expect to strip the UK of its AAA status if there was a material downturn in the economy. That really would be a political nightmare for the chancellor, who is probably wishing the MPC was as quick on the trigger as the People's Bank of China, which eased policy in an attempt to boost growth. This for an economy that is still expected to expand by 8%. The UK will be lucky to grow at all. The assumption in the City is that the MPC's decision was a close call, which it probably was given the fact that Britain is in a double-dip recession, the manufacturing sector is nosediving and the euro is on the brink of meltdown. There are a number of reasons, however, why the MPC has decided to risk falling behind the curve, as it did when the economy seriously ran into trouble in 2008. The first argument \u2013 that monetary policy has ceased to be effective \u2013 can be dismissed. There are economists who believe that QE is subject to the law of diminishing returns but the Bank is not in this camp. The second reason might be lingering concern over inflation, which, at 3%, is high for a country where output is around 14% below where it would have been had the economy continued to grow at its long-term trend of 2.5% since the Great Recession began. But the fall in oil prices is feeding through into cheaper petrol, and when last year's increases in domestic energy prices cease to have an effect on the cost of living over the next few months, the inflation rate will fall. So if the Bank remains convinced that it does have the tools to get the economy moving, and it is sanguine about inflation, why the delay? It displays no complacency about the dire state of the eurozone, but has expressed a degree of scepticism about the trustworthiness of the data showing that the UK is in recession. Although the outlook for the economy has weakened in recent weeks, it has received support from three separate quarters: falling inflation has eased the pressure on household budgets; the drop in the pound's value against a basket of currencies has made exports cheaper; and the decline in gilt yields associated with the UK's safe-haven status has cut the cost of long-term borrowing. To sum up, the Bank has decided that it requires more hard evidence before taking any further steps to stimulate the economy. Despite the better-than-expected survey of the service sector, that should not be long in coming.",

It displays no complacency about the dire state of the eurozone, but has expressed a degree of scepticism about the trustworthiness of the data showing that the UK is in recession.</p> <p>Although the outlook for the economy has weakened in recent weeks, it has received support from three separate quarters: falling inflation has eased the pressure on household budgets; the drop in the pound's value against a basket of currencies has made exports cheaper; and the decline in gilt yields associated with the UK's safe-haven status has cut the cost of long-term borrowing.</p> <p>To sum up, the Bank has decided that it requires more hard evidence before taking any further steps to stimulate the economy. Despite the better-than-expected survey of the service sector, that should not be long in coming.</p>",

Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Given the dominant role of the services sector in the economy, the steady growth in May reported by the purchasing managers is welcome news and supports hopes that it can avoid further contraction in the second quarter, even though it is handicapped by the extra day's public holiday resulting from the Queen's Diamond jubilee.\" He added that the latest British Retail Consortium survey, released on Thursday morning, had also suggested that May was a better month than rain-soaked April. The Bank conceded in its last quarterly inflation report that inflation was likely to stay higher, for longer, than it had previously thought. But the PMI survey also showed that costs in the services sector were rising at the slowest pace since 2009, suggesting that inflationary pressures may be easing. The MPC will announce the results of its two-day monthly policy meeting at noon. The City consensus is for no change, but a growing number of experts had begun to forecast an expansion in the \u00a3325bn total the Bank has spent on quantitative easing, as well as a possible cut in interest rates from their record low of 0.5%, to contain the fallout from the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Following on from yesterday's impressive rally the markets continued their steady increase, albeit at a slightly more muted level. The FTSE 100 is up 25 points, 0.5%, at 5409 while across Europe, the French, German, Spanish and Italian markets were all up slightly. Eyes will be trained on the Bank of England today, as the Monetary Policy Committee announces its latest interest rate decision \u2013 expected to remain unchanged at 0.5%, despite some calls to lower in even further. Any excitement for further QE by the BoE bods will be sated after figures show Britain's service sector grew faster than expected in May. But some will hope there are no such compulsions in the US, with Fed chief Ben Bernanke addressing the US Congress this afternoon. Alternatively, it could all be a damp squib and the wait-and-see brigade will continue unabated. In company news, the biggest cheer could be heard by Johnson Matthey shareholders after the world's largest catalytic converter maker announced its first special dividend, 100p per share, on top of the full-year dividend at 55p, up 20%, following better-than-expected full year results.
