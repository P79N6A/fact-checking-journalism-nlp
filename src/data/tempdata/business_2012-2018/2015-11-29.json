      "bodyText": "China\u2019s efforts to make the yuan an international currency on a par with the US dollar are to receive a fillip with the International Monetary Fund widely expected to add it to a special basket of global currencies. Analysts say the shareholders in the Washington-based IMF will vote on Monday to include the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as the fifth member of its special drawing rights currency basket alongside the dollar, the Japanese yen, sterling and the euro. China has been lobbying for the IMF to add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies, which it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers. A vote to include the currency in the SDR basket would mark a significant milestone for Beijing, according to experts. \u201cThe direct impact won\u2019t be felt in the near term, not least because implementation of the new basket won\u2019t be until Q3 2016. However the symbolic importance cannot be overlooked,\u201d said Andrew Malcolm, Asia head of capital markets at law firm Linklaters. \u201cBy effectively endorsing the renminbi as a freely useable currency, it sends a strong signal about China\u2019s importance in the global financial markets.\u201d The vote of confidence in the yuan as a world reserve currency will come as welcome relief to Chinese authorities as they seek to allay investor fears about China\u2019s economy and turmoil in its stock markets. Beijing has long hoped the yuan would be added to the small list of currencies in which member-countries\u2019 claims on the IMF are denominated. China hopes this stamp of approval will increase the yuan\u2019s desirability as a reserve currency for investors and undermine the hegemony of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Shares in China had soared 150% in the 12 months to mid-June this year as individual investors piled into the rising market, often borrowing heavily to do so. But stocks tumbled over the summer, despite a series of measures by officials in Beijing aimed at calming market jitters. There was another slump in stock markets last week as regulators appeared to clamp down further on leveraged buying. Amid the summer turmoil, Beijing\u2019s surprise devaluation of the yuan was seen partly as a move towards allowing the market, instead of the government, to fix the the currency\u2019s value, an important precondition for inclusion in the SDR basket. The credit ratings agency Fitch was among those predicting the IMF executive board would opt to include the yuan in the basket of elite currencies. It wrote in an update on China last week that the yuan was expected to see widespread adoption as a reserve currency globally. On the expected IMF move, the ratings agency said: \u201cFitch does not expect this to lead to a material shift in demand for renminbi assets globally in the short term. Over time, the emergence of the renminbi as a global reserve currency could support the credit profile.\u201d Analysts at the Japanese bank Nomura predicted that the yuan will become one of the top three major international currencies \u2013 a peer to the US dollar and the euro \u2013 by 2030. They estimate the yuan will make up 10% of the IMF\u2019s SDR basket.",

      "bodyText": "Rising property costs in central London could lead to a wave of businesses relocating outside the capital, research has claimed. A combination of having to pay higher salaries to staff so they can afford London housing and paying increasing amounts in office rent is causing companies to consider moving. Some businesses, including banking group HSBC, have already said they will open an office in another UK city such as Birmingham. George Osborne tried to address the housing crisis facing London in the autumn statement on Wednesday by announcing a string of proposals designed to increase supply and affordability. The chancellor introduced a new help-to-buy programme for buyers in the capital, funding for housing developers and a new rate of stamp duty for buy-to-let investors, which is designed to help first-time buyers find a property. However, research from property agent Savills claims the average cost of an employee has risen to more than \u00a350,000 a year in central London, compared with an average of \u00a333,695 in the rest of the UK. This cost in London includes just over \u00a335,000 in wages, but an additional \u00a315,000 per work station in rents, rates and service charges. The property costs in London are three times what they are in the regions outside the UK capital Mat Oakley, head of European research at Savills, said: \u201cMany occupiers are already looking at smarter ways of accommodating increasing numbers of workers in the same space to minimise costs, but we are also seeing a growing number of businesses looking at relocating workers to other locations with lower property costs to minimise their overheads.\u201d Additional research from the company shows that a rise in property costs is not being matched by a rise in output. In the last five years, rents in the West End have risen faster than output in nine of the 12 key sectors, with only companies in the creative and technology industries increasing their output at a faster rate. Average office rents in the West End are \u00a3106.91 per sq ft, while in the City it is \u00a375.50 per sq ft, the highest ever. Oakley said: \u201cMost industries that we examined have seen an increase in output over the past five years, but for the majority this has been smaller than their rise in rents, implying that having a presence in central London is becoming less affordable for companies in some industries. We\u2019re unlikely to see a mass exodus from central London \u2013 many large companies accept that a City or West End presence is vital for attracting talent and raising profile.\u201d He added: \u201cNonetheless, we do expect to see more organisations exploring the opportunity to split their operations between low and high cost centres, both in terms of staff and property costs. For smaller companies and startups, the fact that central London rents now outpace growth in the majority of sectors may lead to them looking at whether they can secure a cheaper rent elsewhere in Greater London.\u201d Some companies have examined alternative solutions to relocating outside London. Deloitte, KPMG and Starbucks, for example, are helping fund the property costs of their staff. Starbucks is offering loans so staff can pay deposits for a flat, KPMG has agreed preferential mortgage rates with banks, while Deloitte has bought flats in east London that it will rent out to staff.",

      "bodyText": "The beer brands Peroni and Grolsch are to be put up for sale under plans by brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev to appease regulators in its \u00a371bn takeover of SABMiller. Budweiser owner AB InBev is considering selling the leading SABMiller brands as a pre-emptive move to satisfy EU competition regulators. The Peroni and Grolsch brands were expected to raise billions of pounds, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the planned sale. The mega-deal to combine the two largest players in the industry, agreed earlier this month, will be the eighth-largest takeover of all time and means that one company will supply nearly a third of the world\u2019s beer from next year. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, pending clearance from regulators and shareholders. The takeover will allow Belgium\u2019s AB InBev, which also makes Stella Artois, to tap into SABMiller\u2019s strength in fast-growing African and Asian markets. But it must first satisfy competition watchdogs that it will not be overly dominant in the global drinks markets. The expected sale of Grolsch and Italian lager brand Peroni follows news that SABMiller will sell its 58% stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors for \u00a38bn, to allay competition concerns in the US. London-listed SABMiller could also be forced to offload its market-leading Snow brand in China, where the country\u2019s drinkers account for a quarter of global beer consumption. Both SABMiller and AB InBev declined to comment on the Peroni and Grolsch reports.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest lenders are braced for a decision by the Bank of England on whether they are strong enough to withstand turmoil in global markets, as Threadneedle Street considers restrictions on their activities to slow down the growth in consumer lending. The results of the annual health check on six banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC, Santander UK, Standard Chartered, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 and Nationwide building society are released on Tuesday and will determine whether the institutions need to tap investors for cash or take other steps to bolster their financial strength. They are being announced alongside the Bank\u2019s twice-yearly assessment of risks to the financial system, in which it will give a verdict on whether lenders should be forced to hold capital in order to rein in risky lending. Speculation that the Bank could impose more stringent capital rules on banks was sparked by remarks last week by Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, that consumer credit, and personal loans in particular, had been \u201cpicking up at a rate of knots\u201d. His view that the Bank might want to look \u201cfairly carefully\u201d at this area had led to expectations that the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), set up to look for bubbles in financial markets, might use new powers to demand banks hold more capital against riskier lending operations. The big seven lenders have been subjected to tests of their ability to withstand a dramatic slowdown in China and a contraction in the eurozone. The scenarios are regarded as a challenge to international banks HSBC and Standard Chartered, although the UK scenario includes inflation being negative for seven consecutive quarters and the interest rate being cut to zero from its current level of 0.5%. In last year\u2019s stress tests, the bailed-out banks Lloyds and RBS hovered above the pass rate while Co-operative Bank failed. Co-op is not being tested this year because it has scaled back its operations dramatically after a series of scandals. Analysts at the investment bank Citi noted that banks had already started to take steps to bolster their capital, citing RBS and Standard Chartered, which earlier this month said it would raise \u00a33.3bn and cut 15,000 jobs. But, they said there would also be some focus on another measure of financial strength \u2013 known as the leverage ratio. Data published last week showed that Barclays has the lowest leverage ratio \u2013 and therefore has the weakest position \u2013 of the major UK banks. Analysts at Berenberg concurred that banks would not fall below the pass rate set by the Bank. But they said there was a \u201cstrong signal\u201d that the Bank may use its powers to require banks to build up more capital, through so-called countercyclical buffers, which require banks to build up more capital during a more benign economic environment. This additional capital would be held across all loans, though the FPC also has powers to demand capital is held more specifically across three broad sectors [pdf]: residential property and mortgages; commercial property; and other parts of the financial sector. The Bank has had these powers since last year but has yet to use them. Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at the stockbroker Jefferies, said: \u201cIf the purpose of employing a countercyclical buffer is to push back on the financial cycle, we would argue that the loan market in the UK is far from a cyclical peak. Thus, gross mortgage originations are annualising 41% below their 2007 peak.\u201d But analysts at Berenberg bank said the Bank might act: \u201cThe strength of recent communications [from the Bank] suggests to us that sector-wide capital actions may be imminent, most likely alongside the stress test results on 1 December.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For US entrepreneur Matt van Horn, there was one household device that has stubbornly avoided the technological transformation of domestic life. \u201cThe oven in my home today looked almost identical to the vintage ovens on shows like Mad Men \u2026 and not much had changed,\u201d he says. The result of that observation is the June Intelligent Oven, a \u201csmart\u201d device that brings computers, probes and cameras into the cornerstone of the kitchen. The creation of Van Horn and business partner Nikhil Bhogal marks another step in the progress of the internet of things \u2013 the concept that everyday devices can be connected together digitally. When they began working on their device two years ago, Van Horn and Bhogal aimed to create a oven with a touchscreen and a camera that would produce what the microwave could not: decent food. Appropriately, the oven\u2019s appearance bears a resemblance to one of the first hi-tech domestic appliances. \u201cWith the microwave, you had this promise of instant high-quality food. If you study the marketing it is fascinating \u2013 busy working parents cooking up high-quality meals quickly. But in reality it has led to unappetising soggy food,\u201d Van Horn says. The first 30 units of the computer-based oven, which will be launched in the US in the spring, arrived recently at the San Francisco headquarters of the company. The front panel features a 13cm (five-inch) touchscreen that displays instructions, timings and other information. A large knob gives the user another way to navigate through the commands for the unit. Inside the 28.3-litre (1 cubic ft) interior are a series of other features not found in conventional ovens. The unit is heated by six carbon fibre elements \u2013 usually found in incubators for babies \u2013 that can reach their full power in less than five seconds. The oven can reach 175C (347F) in just over four minutes. An HD camera provides live coverage of how the food is cooking to a mobile phone, while algorithms help identify foods inside the oven by shape, texture, colour and patterns. Among those that can be pinpointed at the moment are chicken, lamb, tilapia, salmon, bread, bagels and cookie mix, says Van Horn. When they were researching how to create the modern oven, he and Bhogal found that maintaining temperature and knowing when food was done were the main concerns of consumers. Because of the fear of illness from undercooked food, people frequently err on the safe side, says Van Horn. \u201cAnd what do they do? They overcook food and then it doesn\u2019t taste as good. They dry it out, especially with fish, which is so delicate.\u201d Using the precise heat from the elements and the machine\u2019s accumulated knowledge of the food \u2013 this is an oven that learns as it goes along \u2013 the oven can then give suggested cooking times to the user and alert them when the dish is finished. The process is also aided by weight sensors and heat probes that are inserted into meat. In this way two different steaks can be cooked side by side but one can be medium and the other medium rare, said Van Horn. The oven can bake, roast and grill so steaks and chicken can be caramelised or bread can be toasted. It can give an estimated time of when food will be cooked to optimal temperature and plot that on a graph on the screen, changing the time if necessary as the food cooks. The computer asks the user at the end of the process whether the dish has been cooked satisfactorily and that adds to the oven\u2019s learning process, says Van Horn. Roasting a chicken is one task that uses all of the oven\u2019s features. When put into the June, the camera will recognise that it is a chicken and the weight can be gauged. The computer will then recommend that it is cooked at 120C. When the heat sensor, which is inserted into the flesh, recognises that it has reached an internal temperature of 46C, four of the carbon fibre elements will turn on automatically to crisp the skin. When the internal temperature reaches 72C, a notification is sent to the user\u2019s mobile phone to say that cooking is complete. The oven, which weighs 20kg (45lb), can fit a large chicken or a 12.5-inch pizza. Instead of allowing the computer to define how the oven works, it can also be switched to manual. This combination of features results in a more precise cooker, Van Horn says. \u201cThe time will be when it is ready, not arbitrarily guessing that I will cook this for one hour and then hope that it is done and then check on it.\u201d With time, the oven will learn to recognise more foods and updates can be sent to the machine via the internet, he adds. The more hands-off approach to cooking means users can focus their attention on other tasks while waiting for the ping of the precisely cooked food, Van Horn says. But such convenience comes at a price. Preorders are being taken at just under $1,500 each (\u00a3990), which will rise to almost $3,000 (\u00a31,985) when it reaches the shops. Details of a launch outside of the US have yet to be announced. So, for now, the Sunday roast will have to be cooked the traditional way in the UK.",

The computer asks the user at the end of the process whether the dish has been cooked satisfactorily and that adds to the oven\u2019s learning process, says Van Horn. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/21/kitchen-gadgets-review-purifry-fryer-rhik-samadder\">Kitchen gadgets review: Purifry Fryer \u2013 \u2018a shonky meal cooked in a giant mechanical egg\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roasting a chicken is one task that uses all of the oven\u2019s features. When put into the June, the camera will recognise that it is a chicken and the weight can be gauged. The computer will then recommend that it is cooked at 120C. When the heat sensor, which is inserted into the flesh, recognises that it has reached an internal temperature of 46C, four of the carbon fibre elements will turn on automatically to crisp the skin. When the internal temperature reaches 72C, a notification is sent to the user\u2019s mobile phone to say that cooking is complete.<br></p> <p>The oven, which weighs 20kg (45lb), can fit a large chicken or a 12.5-inch pizza. Instead of allowing the computer to define how the oven works, it can also be switched to manual.</p> <p>This combination of features results in a more precise cooker, Van Horn says. \u201cThe time will be when it is ready, not arbitrarily guessing that I will cook this for one hour and then hope that it is done and then check on it.\u201d With time, the oven will learn to recognise more foods and updates can be sent to the machine via the internet, he adds.</p> <p>The more hands-off approach to cooking means users can focus their attention on other tasks while waiting for the ping of the precisely cooked food, Van Horn says. But such convenience comes at a price. Preorders are being taken at just under $1,500 each (\u00a3990), which will rise to almost $3,000 (\u00a31,985) when it reaches the shops.</p> <p>Details of a launch outside of the US have yet to be announced. So, for now, the Sunday roast will have to be cooked the traditional way in the UK.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s November 2001. The terrorist attacks on the United States on 9/11 are still fresh and raw. While George Bush plots revenge, a meeting of trade ministers takes place in the Gulf state of Qatar. The gathering has two purposes. At one level, it is intended as a show of global solidarity with the US, a signal that the international community can unite in its opposition to fanaticism. But trade ministers also think the time is right to break down barriers to the free movement of goods and services around the world. After all, the last successful round of trade liberalisation negotiations was completed eight years earlier in 1993. Thus the Doha development round is born, an ambitious and complex agenda that involves negotiations designed to free up trade in agriculture, services and manufactured goods. The word \u201cdevelopment\u201d in its name was there to demonstrate that the round would not be the traditional stitch up between the USand the EU but would bring benefits to poor as well as wealthy countries. Trade ministers have been talking (and, for long periods, not talking) ever since. It has taken them double the seven years it took their predecessors to complete the last set of negotiations \u2013 the Uruguay round \u2013 and they have achieved precious little in all that time. Next month, when the WTO meets for a ministerial meeting in Nairobi, there is a good chance that the Doha round will be put out of its misery. Many will take the view that 14 years is long enough. The failed attempt to put together a multilateral trade deal is significant. When the Doha round was launched, it was seen as marking the start of a new chapter in the story of globalisation. A decade-long process that had begun with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall had culminated with the birth of the euro and the admission of China into the WTO \u2013 both seen as evidence that a new borderless world was in the making. The 1990s had been a decade of rapid growth and technological change. Sure, there had been problems. There had been a succession of financial crises in the emerging economies. The tech boom had ended in the dotcom bust. And the first attempt to get a new trade round launched in Seattle had been a messy failure, with protests on the streets and negotiators at loggerheads. At the time, these were seen as temporary setbacks to an inexorable process, but that now looks like a questionable assumption. In retrospect, the high tide of globalisation had been reached in the late 1990s and the attacks on New York and Washington were a better guide to the future than the launch of the Doha round. If the 1990s were largely dominated by the good aspects of globalisation \u2013 faster growth, a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor countries, more rapid communications, cheaper goods \u2013 the 2000s have exposed a darker side: financial instability, growing inequality within countries, burgeoning corporate power and the rise of the surveillance state. The result has been that the forward march of globalisation has been checked. Take free movement of capital, which was central to the liberalisation agenda that dominated the final quarter of the 20th century. The theory was that removing the postwar curbs on finance would allow capital to move to those parts of the world where it was most needed. Things did not work out quite as planned. There were certainly big flows of capital around the globe, but they tended to go into speculative construction booms rather than into the creation of new productive capacity. Financial globalisation did not raise growth rates \u2013 or if it did it only did so through the creation of enormous bubbles \u2013 but it did lead to regular and damaging banking crises, culminating in the big crash of 2007-08. The public got the impression that the only real beneficiaries of this Frankenstein\u2019s monster was the financial industry itself. And when it became clear that the cost of failure would not be paid by the bankers but by the public, a backlash began. The IMF admitted that capital controls could sometimes be useful and both Cyprus and Greece deployed them during their sovereign debt crises. A financial transaction tax is about to be introduced by a number of European countries, including Germany and France. The benefits of trade came in the form of the cheap goods that were imported into western markets and this kept inflation and interest rates low. There was a dual boost: higher living standards and cheaper mortgages. The cost in the west was that as goods were imported, manufacturing jobs were exported. It has proved impossible to complete the Doha round. The complexity of the issues coupled with the increased influence of the leading developing countries has made for permanent deadlock, and the impasse has led to a search for alternative ways of cutting trade deals. A drift away from multilateralism has meant greater emphasis on bilateral deals such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being negotiated between the US and the EU. But TTIP has run into a storm of public opposition, particularly in Europe, mainly stemming from the fear that the interests of multinationals are being put before those of citizens. Trade has become intertwined with the broader issues of corporate power and inequality. TTIP will not be agreed any time soon. People are also on the move. Mexicans want to get into the US. Refugees want to get out of Syria and into Europe. Enlargement of Europe to the east has resulted in workers taking advantage of free movement within the EU to seek out higher paid work in wealthier member states. Those migrating to the west tend to be young and well-educated; just the sort of workers that an ageing country such as Germany needs to rejuvenate itself. But free movement of people has always been more limited than the free movement of capital or goods and is likely to remain so. Even before the atrocities in Paris raised fears about Europe\u2019s porous borders, politicians could not help but detect public disquiet about the pressure migration was putting on public services, housing and the wages of those on low incomes. This is the second age of globalisation. The first, also hastened by developments in communication, involved the free movement of capital, goods and people. That era came to an end in 1914 and the next three decades were difficult ones because mainstream politics couldn\u2019t cope with the collapse of the pre-first world war order, and an extreme form of nationalism was unleashed by economic hardship. Those who say history will not repeat itself should pause for thought. There has been a system failure. Everywhere, an extreme form of nationalism is again on the rise.",

      "bodyText": "Seven years after his landmark 2006 report on the costs of ignoring climate change, Lord Stern confessed that he\u2019d been wrong , and had underestimated the size of the task. \u201cThe planet and the atmosphere seem to be absorbing less carbon than we expected,\u201d he said in 2013, \u201cand emissions are rising pretty strongly. Some of the effects are coming through more quickly than we thought.\u201d This week, as we near the end of a year expected to have been the warmest on record, more than 130 governments and 25,000 officials will meet in Paris to discuss how the rise in temperature can be limited to 2% above pre-industrial levels. As Stern said, the risks of pushing past 2% to a roasting 4% or 5% are now that much greater and more needs to be done in the coming decades than he expected. His three sources of reform were new markets for trading carbon, thereby imposing an additional cost on polluters, developing more effective heat and power conservation, and investing in low-carbon technologies. Could it be that new technologies offer a more viable solution than either of the other two? In Paris, all eyes will be on the US and China to see what kind of commitments they are prepared to make. The most vocal demands will be for Herculean shifts to low-carbon production through government dictat, and for billions of pounds of taxpayer cash to be spent to cure the problem. In this the Chinese have a head start. The US, on the other hand, is a state gripped by a form of sclerosis that prevents almost any decisions from being enacted, especially when they touch the car industry and power generation. To some extent the US is still on the path laid out by George W Bush back in 2002, when he said that growth was needed to provide the resources for investment in clean technologies.Putting aside his reputation as a stooge for his polluting donor base, he effectively argued that consumers in the west, and in China and Japan, would refuse to limit their consumption \u2013 of meat, of energy for central heating and air conditioning, of petrol for their cars. But they would switch to equipment that was low- or zero-carbon. He said: \u201cThis new approach will harness the power of markets and the creativity of entrepreneurs, and will draw upon the best scientific research. It will make possible a new partnership with the developing world to meet our common environmental and economic goals.\u201d From this seed, it can be argued, sprang Tesla Motors, with its promise of electric cars powered by solar panels on the garage roof, or by charging points, mostly installed by Tesla, with access to wind and solar farms. To match Bush\u2019s prediction of help for the developing world, American private equity investors are sweeping across Africa, installing solar farms as they go. Closer to Bush\u2019s backyard, it is possible to see the future for Mexico City\u2019s barrios \u2013 with a solar panel on every tin roof and a battery in every kitchen fuelling the fridge, hob, lights and car. In this way, families in the developed world and those wanting to join them can make one purchase and gain a lifetime of self-sufficiency, all from technologies developed privately. There\u2019ll be no need for huge subsidies, especially in the sun-drenched belt between the tropics. Transport is a huge part of the story. Much of the UK\u2019s recent economic growth came from the increase in car sales and van journeys delivering internet sales. When Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s charismatic boss, unveils a saloon car version of his current sporty model, at a more modest price, the switch to electric cars will have real horsepower. That\u2019s not to say that governments should stand aside. There is a huge role for them to play facilitating a switch, and setting rules. But maybe taxpayer subsidies can take a back seat now that so many technologies are already affordable or coming down the conveyor belt ready to use. Essential issues for Barclays Jes Staley \u2013 gung-ho investment banker or sensible, measured professional? Barclays staff and investors will get one step nearer an answer on Tuesday when the 58-year-old American takes the helm of the bank. As soon as he walks through the door, he will be digesting the results of the Bank of England\u2019s annual health check of the UK industry, released the same day. Barclays\u2019s leverage ratio \u2013 a closely watched measure of financial strength \u2013 is the lowest of the big UK banks and an indicator to some analysts that the bank\u2019s capital position is a potential concern. Those results may be on the top of his in-tray but they are only one of the things he needs to tackle. The veteran of US bank JP Morgan will also need to navigate the new rules requiring banks\u2019 high street operations to be ringfenced from their investment banking. This is proving particularly troublesome for Barclays, which worries that its investment bank\u2019s credit rating will crumble if it has to stand alone. This will lead him to consider the future of the investment bank, which was being pruned by his predecessor, Antony Jenkins. It was once Barclays\u2019s powerhouse, generating more than a third of profits \u2013 and nearly all the controversy. Staley will face the same dilemma as many of his predecessors: do you spin off the investment bank, or find a way to safely harness its power inside the universal banking model? Then there is the thorny topic of pay. He will arrive just as decisions about bonuses are in full swing. The US banker, unaccustomed to public scrutiny of pay deals, will need to avoid wading into a full-blown row. Another thing Staley will not be able to avoid is the set of five glass blocks Jenkins installed in the bank\u2019s vast foyer emblazoned with his watchwords: Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence and Stewardship. One of the biggest gestures Staley could make would be to leave them there, as a sign that repairing Barclays\u2019s reputation is his main priority. Black Friday with hints of red Black Friday earned its name as the shopping day when the high street turns a profit for the year and moves into the black. Given the unsightly scrambles that marked last year\u2019s event in supermarkets across the UK, it could also have referred to the dark heart of retail. The sector that is Britain\u2019s largest private employer dealt itself a wholly avoidable PR blow when scenes of bargain hunters jostling over flat-screen TVs filled our, er, flat-screen TVs. So while shop visits appeared to be down this year, thanks in part to the scrapping of midnight openings, the only thing left looking cheap this time around was the merchandise \u2013 not the industry and its customers. However, this means Black Friday 2015 could be known for a different colour. Many big retailers might have slipped into the red as a result of spending on extra security, longer staff hours and unsold bargains.",

Super Tuesday, as some City analysts have decided to call it, brings together the Bank of England\u2019s annual MOT of banks\u2019 financial strength with its twice-yearly assessment of risks to the financial system. It\u2019s not to be confused with Super Thursday \u2013 the Bank\u2019s quarterly bombardment of economists with information on inflation and interest rates. Central banking used to be rather a dull business, but the dry data releases and policy pronouncements are now treated almost like the announcement of Adele\u2019s next tour.

Maybe Tuesday won\u2019t be all that super for the banks. Fed fever Central bank fever will shift to the US and eurozone on Thursday when the chiefs of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank face questions on monetary policy. Fed chair Janet Yellen will appear at the joint economic committee of Congress for her annual session on the economic outlook. Interest will be much higher than normal because Yellen will be speaking less than two weeks before the Fed\u2019s final monetary policy meeting of the year. Economists expect it to announce the first interest rate rise for almost seven years, and will inspect every syllable of Yellen\u2019s testimony for clues about policymakers\u2019 thinking. Yellen, ranked the world\u2019s second most powerful woman by Forbes, said earlier this month that a rate rise in December was a \u201clive possibility\u201d. Economists had expected rates to rise from near zero in September but the Fed held fire amid market turmoil from China\u2019s slowdown. Earlier on Thursday, that other star of the central banking firmament, \u201csuper\u201d Mario Draghi, is expected to announce further monetary easing in the eurozone to drive inflation back towards the 2% target. Aberdeen flounders What links Janet Yellen, Aberdeen and China? Aberdeen Asset Management, that\u2019s what. The Scottish investment group rose to prominence as it placed bets on fast-growing emerging markets over the past decade. That strategy appeared to pay off: China and other Asian economies were unstoppable while the dull old US and UK struggled in the financial crisis. But Aberdeen, under chief executive Martin Gilbert, has come a cropper this year as markets have been gripped by concern about China\u2019s slowdown. The company\u2019s shares have fallen by a third since hitting a peak of 507p in April, and investors have withdrawn billions of pounds of funds. The flight of capital from emerging markets caused by China\u2019s woes has been exacerbated by mounting expectations of a rate rise in the US, which is where Yellen comes in. In July, Gilbert vowed to maintain Aberdeen\u2019s investment approach, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s painful watching those outflows. Our style of investing is out of fashion.

      "bodyText": "Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, used to be director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Paul Johnson, who used to look after public services at the Treasury (among many other things) was a colleague of Sharon White, who is married to Robert Chote. Five years hence, for all I know, White may be director of the IFS, Johnson could be chairing the OBR, and Chote could be boss of Ofcom (White\u2019s current berth). Or any of them could be economics editor of the FT, where Chote made his name. This, in short, is a close-knit world of similar and similarly able economists, not some canyon of conflict between OBR and IFS. Doors revolve constantly. Forecasts are continually refined (or changed) by the same sort of independent analysts. Which leads to one observation that, gently, the assembled commentocracy of press and broadcasting failed to make last week amid the pother about U-turns, discontinued austerity and abracadabra. You can miss the story \u2013 for example, the \u00a327bn pot of beneficence produced by the chancellor at autumn statement time. You can fill days on punditry based on assumptions \u2013 statistics reached months ago by the exact same methods \u2013 which are no longer valid. You may not have noticed that, over the past six weeks, the projections surreptitiously switched course.

      "body": "<p>Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, used to be director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Paul Johnson, who used to look after public services at the Treasury (among many other things) was a colleague of Sharon White, who is married to Robert Chote. Five years hence, for all I know, White may be director of the IFS, Johnson could be chairing the OBR, and Chote could be boss of Ofcom (White\u2019s current berth). Or any of them could be economics editor of the <em>FT</em>, where Chote made his name.</p> <p>This, in short, is a close-knit world of similar and similarly able economists, not some canyon of conflict between OBR and IFS. Doors revolve constantly. Forecasts are continually refined (or changed) by the same sort of independent analysts. Which leads to one observation that, gently, the assembled commentocracy of press and broadcasting failed to make last week amid the pother about U-turns, discontinued austerity and abracadabra.</p> <p>You can miss the story \u2013 for example, the \u00a327bn pot of beneficence produced by the chancellor at autumn statement time. You can fill days on punditry based on assumptions \u2013 statistics reached months ago by the exact same methods \u2013 which are no longer valid. You may not have noticed that, over the past six weeks, the projections surreptitiously switched course. You probably went to endless Treasury briefings, carrying away the usual nuggets for publication, but failed to ask the hardest questions \u2013 or register the smirks. You let George make a fool of you.</p> <p>Chairman Mao says: \u201cIt is not hard for one to do a bit of good.
