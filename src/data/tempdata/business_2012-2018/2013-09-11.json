      "bodyText": "The government will formally begin the sale of Royal Mail on Thursday by announcing its intention to float the 497-year-old postal service on the London Stock Exchange. It is the most ambitious privatisation since the sale of the railways in the 1990s and is forcefully opposed by the unions, who are meeting Royal Mail chief executive, Moya Greene, in Birmingham on Thursday to discuss threatened strike action. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), said 96% of Royal Mail staff oppose the sell-off, which \"not even Thatcher dared do\". Margaret Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, famously refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, saying she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". Lord Heseltine and Lord Mandelson both subsequently tried but failed to sell the company, in the face of intense opposition from MPs. The sale of Royal Mail was approved by parliament in the 2011 Postal Services Act. The union opposes the potential \u00a33bn flotation despite the government promising 150,000 postmen and women a 10% stake in the company, worth up to \u00a32,000 each. It would be the largest employee share scheme since the privatisation of British Gas 26 years ago. Hayes said postal workers will not \"sell their souls\" for such a small stake in the business. \"Postal workers know that privatisation would mean the break-up of the company, more job losses, worse terms and conditions, and attacks on their pensions,\" he has said. \"It would be a wrecking ball to the industry they work in.\" The public will also be able to buy shares alongside banks and institutional investors. The government will launch an advertising campaign along the lines of the Tell Sid campaign to encourage the sale of British Gas shares in 1986. The \"intention to float\" announcement to the London Stock Exchange will kick off a sale process lasting four to six weeks. The CWU plans to disrupt the sale process by holding a strike ballot on 20 September, which could lead to a nationwide strike by 10 October. It would be the first nationwide postal strike since 2009. The union is also pushing for a better pay deal, after rejecting a 8.6% pay rise over three years. The CWU is also planning to call on Labour to renationalise Royal Mail if the party wins the next general election. Dave Ward, the union's deputy general secretary, told the Trades Union Congress (TUC) the union is tabling a denationalisation motion at the Labour conference. TUC delegates voted unanimously in favour of a motion to support the Save Our Royal Mail campaign and for the TUC to back it. The financial performance of Royal Mail has improved considerably recently, with pre-tax profits up 60% to \u00a3324m last year, but the price of stamps has risen strongly and the government has taken over direct responsibility for its pension scheme. The government has promised that privatisation will not threaten Royal Mail's pledge to deliver mail six days a week to villages as well as cities at the same prices. \"A change of ownership in Royal Mail will not mean that Royal Mail can stop delivering to rural areas,\" Michael Fallon, the business minister, has said. \"Royal Mail will remain the UK's designated universal postal service provider and must continue to provide a six-day-a-week service throughout the UK.\" Royal Mail and the Department for Business declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The value of the UK food and grocery market is to soar by a fifth to a record \u00a3206bn by 2018, according to new research, with online sales doubling and big increases in business for convenience stores and food discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. The latest findings from the food and consumer research and training charity IGD indicate that in five years time those three sales channels will account for more than \u00a33 out of every \u00a34 of growth in UK grocery. Online and convenience retailing are the main beneficiaries of consumers' growing reliance on smartphones and tablets which are now revolutionising the way we shop \u2013 even for perishable goods and those needing cold storage. While superstores and hypermarkets still generate the most sales of any type of grocery format in terms of volume, they will grow at a considerably slower rate in comparison with these three formats. Large supermarkets or superstores and hypermarkets now account for sales of \u00a374.1bn and are set to grow by a sluggish 8.2% to \u00a380.1bn by 2018. The IGD forecasts* underline why Tesco is scaling back its plans to open big new stores. The UK food, grocery and drink sector is currently worth \u00a3170bn but is set to grow in value by 21% to nearly \u00a3206bn, IGD forecasts. Online sales \u2013 currently worth only \u00a36.5bn \u2013 will more double in value (increasing by some 124%) to nearly \u00a315bn, the latest figures reveal. The second fastest growth is predicted to be in sales through food discounters \u2013 currently worth \u00a39.5bn but nearly doubling by 96.3% to \u00a318.6bn. Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive of IGD, said: \"The 'hot three' areas of online, convenience and food discounters are the ones to watch.\" She said online and convenience retailing were \"reaping the rewards of our changing lifestyles. With more of us owning smartphones and tablets, online grocery shopping is becoming more popular. Retailers are also introducing more convenient and flexible services, such as temperature controlled 'click &amp; collect' lockers for shoppers to pick up their groceries at a time and place that suits them.\" Convenience stores in the heart of towns and other communities are also benefiting from the cultural shift towards shopping \"little and often\", Denney-Finch said: \"They are increasingly providing products tailored to specific locations rather than a 'one size fits all' approach. \"With their sales set to rise by over \u00a310bn over the next five years, we're forecasting convenience to bring in the biggest cash growth of any type of grocery retailing between 2013 and 2018. \"We also expect food discounters, like Aldi and Lidl, to continue to do well and build on their recent stellar performance. They have improved shopper perceptions by effectively communicating the quality and value for money of their products while also expanding the range of items they sell to help shoppers complete more of their weekly shop there. Nearly a third (32%) of shoppers tell us they will use food discounters more in the year ahead compared to almost a quarter (24% in September 2010).\" *IGD's shopper research is from IGD Shopper Vista \u2014 a monthly analysis involving questions put to a panel of 1,000 shoppers.",

      "body": "<p>The largest ever corporate IOU was issued on Wednesday, when the American cable company Verizon Communications held a $49bn (\u00a331bn) bond sale to fund its $130bn deal with Vodafone.</p> <p>The news came as Vodafone's takeover battle for German broadband and television company Kabel Deutschland reached a nail biting finish, with fears the deal could fall at the final hurdle by failing to secure enough support from shareholders.</p> <p>In the US, Verizon attracted over 3,000 orders from more than 800 investors in a debt raising exercise that is set to eclipse the next three biggest corporate bond deals in history, including Apple's record $17bn issue this year.</p> <p>Verizon is expected to raise between $45bn to $49bn, more in debt than the gross domestic product of Tunisia, Slovenia, Lebanon and some 100 other countries. Demand was so high from dollar investors that a planned roadshow with meetings scheduled in Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam to attract sterling and euro investors was cancelled.</p> <p>The money raised will help fund Verizon's $130bn offer for Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between the two groups that has grown to become America's largest mobile phone network.</p> <p>Verizon's deal is bigger than the combined size of the next three largest corporate bond deals in history: the Apple trade and offerings from pharmaceutical groups Roche and Abbvie.</p> <p>Vodafone has said it will use the windfall from its US investment to improve the speed and coverage of its networks, investing in 4G technology, and in expanding its range of services.

      "bodyText": "The largest ever corporate IOU was issued on Wednesday, when the American cable company Verizon Communications held a $49bn (\u00a331bn) bond sale to fund its $130bn deal with Vodafone. The news came as Vodafone's takeover battle for German broadband and television company Kabel Deutschland reached a nail biting finish, with fears the deal could fall at the final hurdle by failing to secure enough support from shareholders. In the US, Verizon attracted over 3,000 orders from more than 800 investors in a debt raising exercise that is set to eclipse the next three biggest corporate bond deals in history, including Apple's record $17bn issue this year. Verizon is expected to raise between $45bn to $49bn, more in debt than the gross domestic product of Tunisia, Slovenia, Lebanon and some 100 other countries. Demand was so high from dollar investors that a planned roadshow with meetings scheduled in Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam to attract sterling and euro investors was cancelled. The money raised will help fund Verizon's $130bn offer for Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between the two groups that has grown to become America's largest mobile phone network. Verizon's deal is bigger than the combined size of the next three largest corporate bond deals in history: the Apple trade and offerings from pharmaceutical groups Roche and Abbvie. Vodafone has said it will use the windfall from its US investment to improve the speed and coverage of its networks, investing in 4G technology, and in expanding its range of services. But a key deal in Vodafone's strategy of moving from mobile phones to selling more broadband and television services hangs in the balance. Its \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.5bn) offer for Kabel Deutschland will expire at midnight Frankfurt time on Wednesday unless at least 75% of the German group's shareholders accept the deal. Including shares already tendered, Vodafone held 19.88% of Kabel Deutschland's stock by mid afternoon on Tuesday 10 September, Vodafone said in a statement on Wednesday. That compares with close to 12% last Friday. \"There is a significant risk that we can't get 75%,\" said one analyst, who asked not to be named. \"Typically you would end up with a large wodge coming in the last day, but when you see a big gap and a significant other shareholder increasing their stake it makes you think it will be tougher to get that 75% hurdle.\" The hedge fund Elliott Capital Advisors doubled its stake in the German group to 10.9% last week. Hedge funds sometimes hold on to stock until after a deal is approved, demanding a higher price in order to be squeezed out at a later date when the buyer wants to take full control. Despite pressure from activist investors and major shareholders, who support the deal but fear it may fail, Vodafone said it would not lower the threshold for acceptances, or extend the deadline, or raise the price of its \u20ac84.50 per share offer.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A record number of people work in estate agents offices and the sector is growing so fast that it amounted to the fastest growing part of the national workforce in the three months ending in June, according to official figures published on Wednesday. The Office for National Statistics said that 562,000 people are employed in real estate in the UK, the largest number since records began in 1978, with 77,000 joining the industry over the last year \u2013 data that added to fears that the country is heading for a house price bubble. \"We're no longer a nation of shopkeepers \u2013 we're becoming a nation of estate agents,\" said Danny Gabay, director of economics consultancy Fathom. \"I would certainly agree that the economy has turned a corner; my concern is about how sustainable this recovery will be, given that it is based on using government subsidies to encourage already over-extended households to take on even more debt to finance their consumption.\" Concerns about the state of the housing market were also voiced by the business secretary, Vince Cable, who called for an urgent rethink of George Osborne's flagship Help to Buy scheme, which aims to provide government guarantees for low-deposit mortgages from next January. The Lib Dem cabinet minister said there were signs of \"serious housing inflationary pressures\" developing in parts of the country. \"We should certainly think about how [Help to Buy] should come into effect; indeed whether it should come into effect, in the light of changing market conditions. We don't want a new housing bubble,\" Cable told Sky News. Shortly after, Downing Street was forced to insist the government will go ahead with the scheme, with the prime minister's spokesman adding that many would-be home-owners are facing substantial obstacles because of caps on loan to value mortgages. \"It will be launched. We are faced with a situation \u2013 because of the fall in availability of 90% to 95% loan-to-value mortgages \u2013 where many first-time buyers are faced with a real obstacle to making a home of their own. It is important we address this issue,\" the spokesman said. Growing confidence in the outlook for the housing market has been a key component of the economic upturn that led Osborne, to claim in a speech on Monday that the UK is turning a corner. But the swelling army of estate agents led some commentators to warn that the recovery was too reliant on debt-fuelled growth. \"If you wanted any clearer signal of the hollowness of the so-called economic recovery, you couldn't make it up,\" said Andrew Simms, a fellow of the New Economics Foundation thinktank. Cable's remarks also fuelled fears that the economic recovery could simply be based on a consumer boom and a housing bubble. He made his political reputation by criticising the Labour government's economic boom for being based on a bubble and has often warned the recovery must be sustained. Following pressure from the Treasury, the business secretary did, however, tone down a keynote speech, dropping a warning of the dangers of complacency over the economy. Addressing business leaders at a joint government/CBI industrial strategy conference in Warwick , he said \"The point I am trying to make is that this is a long-term haul. We have got a marathon not a sprint here.\" Help to Buy was the centrepiece of Osborne's March budget, but has drawn criticism from a broad range of groups, ranging from homelessness charity Shelter to the rightwing Adam Smith Institute, which fear it will simply drive up prices without boosting housing supply. The second, more controversial, leg of Help to Buy will offer taxpayer-backed guarantees on mortgages worth up to \u00a3600,000, for buyers with a deposit worth 20% or less of the price of their property. Mark Clare, the chief executive of housebuilder Barratt Developments, said that the housing upturn is now spreading well beyond London and the south-east, as the company reported a 74% increase in pre-tax profits. \"We are seeing some very, very strong interest on new sites that we're launching around the country, even to the point where we're starting to see queues \u2026 which is not something we have seen for many, many years,\" he said. Fears of a housing bubble have intensified since the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, introduced the policy of forward guidance, under which the Bank's monetary policy committee has sent a strong message that it expects to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% for at least the next three years. News of the healthy demand for estate agents came as part of the ONS's monthly snapshot of the labour market, which showed that the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.7%, in the first tentative step towards the 7% target that Carney says may signal an economy strong enough to withstand a rise in interest rates. Unemployment on the International Labour Organisation measure tracked by the Bank stood at 2.49 million from May to July, down by 24,000 from three months earlier. That took the unemployment rate to 7.7%, from 7.8% over the previous three-month period, driven by a larger-than-expected 80,000 increase in employment. On the more timely claimant count measure, which just includes people receiving out-of-work benefits, unemployment also fell, by 32,600 in August to 1.4m. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 12 September 2013 to correct the name of the Barratt Developments chief executive to Mark Clare",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is expected to come under fire from MPs over the central bank's policy of \"forward guidance\" following criticism that low rates are helping to fuel a house price bubble. Several MPs on the Treasury select committee are concerned that the central bank's determination to hold interest rates at historically low levels until at least 2016 have combined with government mortgage subsidies to artificially inflate the housing market. Rocketing house prices in London have set off alarm bells in parliament that the UK's housing market is in the early stages of a boom that will eventually crash, sending the economy back into recession. Labour MP Pat McFadden said: \"It is something the committee is concerned about, in terms of how we ensure this doesn't reproduce a bubble situation.\" Andy Love, the Labour MP for Edmonton, said: \"Undoubtedly the housing market will come up. It's not just that prices are rising in some parts of the country, especially London. We will want to know what the Bank of England will do if it appears that house price inflation is beginning to take off.\" MPs are also concerned that the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, will be forced to clamp down on a housing bubble by raising rates prematurely. Tory MP Mark Garnier said he wanted reassurance that a return to higher interest rates will not trigger a flood of bankruptcies and home repossessions as homeowners find they can no longer afford monthly mortgage payments. Garnier said many of his constituents were only able to afford mortgage payments while interest rates were low. \"I'm worried about the collossal level of household debt, which is still 140% of GDP and means many families are vulnerable to any rise in interest rates.\" He added that almost one in five mortgage payers had only \u00a3200 in disposable income, which could easily be wiped out by higher interest bills. \"Mark Carney has an immensely challenging time ahead because he could mismanage the situation and create a huge amount of damage,\" he said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has been ordered to help the 631-strong TSB branch network become more profitable under a series of measures set out by the Office of Fair Trading to make the offshoot a stronger high street competitor. The move will be seen as clearing the way for government to kickstart the sale of its stake in 39%-taxpayer owned Lloyds Banking Group, which was first signalled by chancellor George Osborne in his Mansion House speech in June. But the OFT's verdict is a frustration for Lloyds which just two days ago launched TSB as a new brand with much fanfare. It will now be required to bolster TSB's profitability by \u00a350m a year in its first four years while giving it another \u00a340m. But Lloyds will be relieved that is not being forced to include more branches in the spun-off TSB, which is likely to be floated on the stock market next year. The announcement by the OFT follows an analysis commissioned by Osborne in June of whether the sale of the TSB branches as well as the 315 outlets by Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 ordered by Brussels as a condition of the 2008 taxpayer bailouts \u2013 will be enough to increase competition on the high street. The OFT concludes that the RBS sell-off, codenamed Rainbow, does not need alteration. A separate analysis of splitting RBS into a good and bad bank, also commissioned by Osborne, is ongoing. Business secretary Vince Cable said: \"We must not forget the potential implications of a 'good bank/bad bank' split of RBS\". The competition body acknowledges that asking Lloyds to put more branches in to the TSB network could risk \"incurring further delay and additional sunk costs\" but wants steps to be taken to ensure that the TSB offshoot attains a 4.6% share of the current account market. As currently constructed, the OFT estimates TSB's current account market share is between 4% and 4.5%. The announcement by the OFT came as a top Bank of England official attempted to justify his claim that bad lending by the Britannia building society was the cause of the \u00a31.5bn capital hole in the Co-operative Bank, which merged with the mutual lender in 2008. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, wrote to the Treasury select committee to set out the cause of nearly \u00a31bn of losses on loans at the Co-op. Bailey provided the analysis of the Co-op's losses following evidence given to the committee last week by Neville Richardson, the former head of Britannia which merged with Co-op in 2008. Richardson, who ran the combined entity until 2011, told MPs that he had left the organisation with \"no issues\" and insisted that Britannia's loan book was well managed and in line with other lenders. In a letter obtained by the BBC, Bailey tells the committee's chairman Andrew Tyrie that some 75% of the \u00a3970m of bad loan losses at the Co-op between the beginning of January 2012 and the middle of 2013 were in the bank's non-core book, which in turn is made up of between 85% and 90% of former Britannia loans in 2013 and around 75% in 2012. Of the \u00a3970m, \u00a3288m were from the core lending book and \u00a3682m from the non-core book.",

      "bodyText": "When FTSE 100 companies hold their annual shareholder meeting they usually hire a big venue, handy for public transport and suitable for hundreds of private and institutional investors who might want to put the chief executive on the spot. For Sports Direct, the retailer founded by Newcastle United boss Mike Ashley, which has been confirmed a new member of the blue chip index, investors had to go to an auditorium above a shop at the company's vast warehouse and head office on the outskirts of Shirebrook, a small town in Derbyshire. It was unsurprising, then, that only about eight shareholders and two members of the press joined Ashley and his board of directors at the rainswept industrial parkon Wednesday. There was little opportunity for questions from the floor and, once the formal business of the meeting was concluded, Ashley dashed from the room faster than Newcastle striker Papiss Ciss\u00e9 with an eye on goal. The handful of shareholders present were unconcerned about the firm's sometimes unusual standards of corporate governance and recent revelations that 20,000 part-time Sports Direct staff \u2013 about 90% of its workforce \u2013 are on controversial zero-hours contracts. But they were excited by the stellar performance of Sports Direct's share price in the past few years, which has leaped from 32p five years ago to 729p on Wednesday as the company revealed another strong set of sales figures. The retailer, which has turned selling cheap jogging bottoms into a business valued at more than \u00a34bn said sales leapt 18.2% in the 13 weeks to 28 July while gross profits rose at an even faster rate, 23.2%, to \u00a3260m for the quarter.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The production line for London black cabs resumed on Wednesday, six months after the company behind the famous vehicles was rescued by the Chinese Geely Group. The business secretary, Vince Cable, who was in Coventry to officially restart production of the TX4 black cab said: \"After a period of worry and uncertainty for the workforce, Geely Group's investment has secured the future of the iconic black cabs company, protecting highly skilled jobs in the Midlands and ensuring that London cabs continue to be made here in Britain,\" he said. \"It is also a clear demonstration of the success of the British car industry, which has gone from strength to strength even during tough economic times.\" Geely bought Manganese Bronze, which had been making black cabs since 1948, out of administration for just \u00a311m in February. Production of black cabs was halted last autumn when Manganese Bronze was forced to launch an emergency recall after discovering a steering fault that left some drivers \"struggling to steer the vehicles correctly\". It was not the first time Manganese had been forced to launch an emergency recall of the TX4 model. In 2008 it called back 5,000 of the early TX4 after some of them caught fire. But less than two weeks after last year's recall the company went into administration. Li Shufu, the chairman of Geely, which also owns Volvo, said restarting production had created 66 new jobs. However, 156 workers - including 99 of the 176 employees at the Holyhead Road plant - lost their jobs when Manganese called in administrators. \"Today is a milestone in the history of the London Taxi Company (LTC), but it marks just the beginning of what we believe will be a strong and prosperous future,\" he said. \"We are pleased to have created dozens of new jobs and have already begun work on the planning and design of the next generation of this iconic vehicle. Thanks to the work of everyone here and everyone that has supported us, LTC has an exciting future ahead of it.\" Once fully up and running, the production line will complete about 10 new taxis a day, five days a week. The company expects to export about half of the 2,000 vehicles it will produce in the first year, after winning contracts to supply Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan. Only 900 cabs were produced last year before the production line was shutdown. Geely has pledged to invest \u00a3150m in the London Taxi Company's Coventry factory and developing a new TX5 model over five years. It is also considering expanding production in Coventry and other sites in the UK. More than 130,000 black taxis have been made at the Coventry over the past 60 years. The company said it is also considering the possibility of transferring the production of some Geely cars from China to the UK in the future.

      "body": "<p>The production line for London black cabs resumed on Wednesday, six months after the company behind the famous vehicles was rescued by the Chinese Geely Group.</p> <p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, who was in Coventry to officially restart production of the TX4 black cab said:</p> <p>\"After a period of worry and uncertainty for the workforce, Geely Group's investment has secured the future of the iconic black cabs company, protecting highly skilled jobs in the Midlands and ensuring that London cabs continue to be made here in Britain,\" he said. \"It is also a clear demonstration of the success of the British car industry, which has gone from strength to strength even during tough economic times.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/01/london-taxi-maker-rescued-deal\" title=\"\">Geely bought Manganese Bronze, which had been making black cabs since 1948, out of administration for just \u00a311m in February</a>.</p> <p>Production of black cabs was halted last autumn when Manganese Bronze was forced to launch an emergency recall after discovering a steering fault that left some drivers \"struggling to steer the vehicles correctly\".</p> <p>It was not the first time Manganese had been forced to launch an emergency recall of the TX4 model. In 2008 it called back 5,000 of the early TX4 after some of them caught fire.</p> <p>But less than two weeks after last year's recall the company went into administration.</p> <p>Li Shufu, the chairman of Geely, which also owns Volvo, said restarting production had created 66 new jobs. However, 156 workers - including 99 of the 176 employees at the Holyhead Road plant - lost their jobs when Manganese called in administrators.</p> <p>\"Today is a milestone in the history of the London Taxi Company (LTC), but it marks just the beginning of what we believe will be a strong and prosperous future,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are pleased to have created dozens of new jobs and have already begun work on the planning and design of the next generation of this iconic vehicle. Thanks to the work of everyone here and everyone that has supported us, LTC has an exciting future ahead of it.\"</p> <p>Once fully up and running, the production line will complete about 10 new taxis a day, five days a week. The company expects to export about half of the 2,000 vehicles it will produce in the first year, after winning contracts to supply Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan. Only 900 cabs were produced last year before the production line was shutdown.</p> <p>Geely has pledged to invest \u00a3150m in the London Taxi Company's Coventry factory and developing a new TX5 model over five years. It is also considering expanding production in Coventry and other sites in the UK. More than 130,000 black taxis have been made at the Coventry over the past 60 years.</p> <p>The company said it is also considering the possibility of transferring the production of some Geely cars from China to the UK in the future.</p> <p>Peter Johansen, vice president of UK operations for LTC, said: \"The financial strength and commitment of Geely provides us opportunities to continue to improve our TX4 taxi and, at the same time, develop the next generation of taxis to take us forward into the 21st century.\"</p> <p>A former British success story, Manganese had failed to turn a profit since 2007.

      "bodyText": "Slightly early finish today. My colleagues will reopen the liveblog if any big news breaks. Otherwise I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Financial firms BGC Partners and Cantor Fitzgerald are holding their annual Charity Day to remember the 658 employees who lost their lives in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York 12 years ago today. The two firms (BGC was spun out of Cantor in 2004), have an impressive roster of people working the phones at their offices around the world, raising money for good causes, including Royals and actors. Some quotes from eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem are hitting the wires. Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister, is predicting that Greece will need more assistance once its bailout programme ends in 2014, and that Ireland may need assistance to exit its own programme (points he also made to an EC committee a few days ago). He also suggested that Lisbon faces a tougher challenge than Dublin: Here's a video clip of the UK prime minister, David Cameron, answering a question on today's unemployment data (which showed a drop in the jobless rate to 7.7%, but with wages still lagging inflation): After a pretty dull trading session in Europe, Wall Street has opened slightly higher after president Obama backed away from immediate military action in Syria last night (our Middle East liveblog has the latest). The Dow Jones industrial average is up 37 points, or 0.25%, in early trading. Europe's markets are mixed this afternoon -- Italy is the biggest riser, on relief that the question of whether to expel Berlusconi from the Senate has been hoofed into the long grass (see 7.56am). Earlier, gold has dropped to a three-week low of $1,356 per ounce after America backed away from immediate military action in Syria last night (our Middle East liveblog has the latest) Meanwhile over in Greece, protesting teachers have cast a pall over the government\u2019s hopes for a strike-free autumn this year. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: After taking to the streets last night with a dynamic protest outside parliament, Greek teachers ensured that the school year got off with a bang today promising that all classes will stop as of Monday. Indicative of the mood, pupils greeted main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras with placards proclaiming \u201cwe are people, not numbers\u201d when the leftist leader turned up to attend the opening of one school in Athens this morning. Tsipras said it sounded ironic to wish schoolchildren \u201ca good year\u201d when teaching staff had decided to stage indefinite five-day rolling strikes in a massive display of opposition over EU-IMF mandated job losses and cuts. The walk-outs, the first major industrial action this autumn, has put Antonis Samaras\u2019 conservative dominated coalition on the defensive just as teams of inspectors representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditors prepare to fly in. Teachers, who last night took to the streets promising to \u201cpull a punch,\u201d appear in no mood for compromise... In an explosive letter, addressed to parents and pupils, they appealed for understanding saying government austerity policies had pushed the educational system to the brink. \u201cCan schools function with 16,000 fewer teachers? Can schools function with professors who don\u2019t know in which, or how many, schools they will teach, in what region of the country they will work or, if, they will even have work in the immediate future?\u201d the missive, released by OLME, the union representing secondary school teachers, asked. \u201cCan schools work with operational costs that have been reduced by 60 percent, without money for electricity, water or heat?\u201d With tensions running high, the education minister Kostas Arvanitopoulos hit back this morning accusing the union of skewing the numbers and resorting to emotional blackmail by addressing the letter to schoolchildren. City economists broadly share Jose Manuel Barroso's belief that the worst of Europe's financial crisis woes are behind it, a new poll found. Twenty three analysts polled by Reuters this week said they were confident that the recovery was \"durable\", while 12 did not. Only only economist (alas, not identified) reckoned the euro area would fall back into recession before the end of 2014. The French government has underlined the weak nature of the European recovery, by warning that it will miss its growth and deficit targets . Finance minister Pierre Moscovici told a press conference on the 2014 Budget earlier today that France's 2013 public deficit will probably be 4.1% of GDP, above the 3.9% agreed with the European Union (and much higher than the 3% which countries are meant to keep below). Paris also sees weaker growth in 2014, cutting its forecast to just 0.9% growth in 2014, down from 1.2%. It is maintaining a prediction of 0.1% growth this year. Nigel Farage's response to Barroso has been uploaded to YouTube: I mentioned at 11.07am that Barroso had criticised the UK Conservative Party for their increased euroscepticism, warning that they would lose out to UKIP next year -- well, the Financial Times now has the full details: Peter Speigel writes: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso lashed out at the leader of the British conservatives in the European Parliament on Wednesday, saying his party was sounding increasingly like the eurosceptic Ukip group and warning the Tories would lose the next EU parliament elections if they continued on the same path. Speaking during a parliamentary debate on his annual state of the EU speech, the European Commission president said Martin Callanan, a Tory from northeast England, could never be chosen for a senior EU job \u2013 because the Tories were moving out of the European mainstream. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that happily, because I think increasingly your party and your group is looking like Ukip and the eurosceptic, anti-European group,\u201d Mr Barroso said, pointing repeatedly at Mr Callanan. \u201cI start to have some doubts that you are going to be elected yourself in Britain, if it\u2019s not going to be Ukip as the first force in British elections. More here: Barroso lashes out at UK conservative leader in EU Parliament Barroso's call for action on banking union is an \"implicit challenge\" to the German government, Reuters reports: What we can and must do first and foremost is deliver the banking union. It is the first and most urgent way to complete our union,\" Barroso told lawmakers in Strasbourg. His comments were an implicit challenge to Germany, the EU's leading power, which has worked to limit the scope of a single banking supervisor and slow the drive for a single bank resolution authority and fund,citing legal constraints and the wish to spare its taxpayers from liabilities for others' banks. The goal of creating a single framework and backstop for around 8,000 European banks, with mechanisms to wind down failed lenders and protect savers' deposits, is one of the EU's most ambitious and challenging projects. More here: EU's Barroso urges Europe to complete banking union Here's some more reaction to the State of the Union speech: Our eagle-eyed Europe editor, Ian Traynor, identifies a key part of Barroso's speech which I didn't get into the blog earlier: And here's the relevant section: In last year's State of the Union speech, at a moment of challenges to the rule of law in our own member states, I addressed the need to make a bridge between political persuasion and targeted infringement procedures on the one hand, and what I call the nuclear option of Article 7 of the Treaty, namely suspension of a member states' rights. Experience has confirmed the usefulness of the Commission role as an independent and objective referee. We should consolidate this experience through a more general framework. It should be based on the principle of equality between member states, activated only in situations where there is a serious, systemic risk to the rule of law, and triggered by pre-defined benchmarks. The Commission will come forward with a communication on this. I believe it is a debate that is key to our idea of Europe. This does not mean that national sovereignty or democracy are constrained. But we do need a robust European mechanism to influence the equation when basic common principles are at stake. There are certain non-negotiable values that the EU and its member states must and shall always defend. \u2022 Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso must have been delighted last month when the eurozone recession ended. It let him put a more polished gloss in today's speech, and talk about a Europe that is recovering, not still shrinking. But as a succession of MEPs warned, 0.3% growth in GDP does not make up for 26 million people out of work, and rising social angst. No-one, it seemed, wanted to be seen giving Brussels much credit for the fragile recovery. \u2022 Political worries? The immediate risk of the Italian government collapsing abated last night, when Senators decided not to push for an early decision on whether to banish Silvio Berlusconi. But political risk remains the big fear for Brussels -- thus Barroso's comment about how nations must stick to their commitments. \u2022 Presidential power? The speech was a reminder of the limits of Barroso's influence. He repeatedly called for rapid progress on banking union, echoing comments from IMF chief Christine Lagarde only yesterday. But closer banking union is being held up by Europe's biggest country, Germany, which wants to see treaty changes first. And Barroso can't force its hand. \u2022 Elections looming MEPs have an eye on next year's elections, and recognise that the eurozone crisis means the game has changed. Traditional battles between conservatives and socialists are no longer on the agenda \u2013 instead, pro-European parties are preparing for a pitched battle with eurosceptics. The Farageisation of politics? \u2022 Peace in our time There was some scoffing last year when the European Union won the Nobel Peace Price. That award, though, seems to have given the EU a new sense of identity and pride. Expect to hear more about world war one over the next year, The full text of Barroso's speech is online here: Here's his conclusion: In 8 months' time, voters will decide. Now, it's up to us to make the case for Europe. We can do so by using the next 8 months to conclude as much as we can. We have a lot to do still. Adopt and implement the European budget, the MFF. This is critical for investment in our regions all over Europe. This is indispensable for the first priority we have: to fight against unemployment, notably youth unemployment. Advance and implement the banking union. This is critical to address the problem of financing for businesses and SMEs. These are our clear priorities: employment and growth. Our job is not finished. It is in its decisive phase. Because, Honourable Members, the elections will not only be about the European Parliament, nor will they be about the European Commission or about the Council or about this or that personality. They will be about Europe. We will be judged together. So let us work together - for Europe. With passion and with determination. Let us not forget: one hundred years ago \u2013Europe was sleepwalking into the catastrophe of the war of 1914. Next year, in 2014, I hope Europe will be walking out of the crisis towards a Europe that is more united, stronger and open. Meanwhile, today's UK unemployment data (see here for details) confirms that the housing market is reviving Nigel Farage again: And Jose Manuel Barroso is adamant that Greece's economic crisis was brewed in Athens, not Brussels. He insisted: Who is responsible for the problems in Europe. Is it policy, or is it mistakes in the past? It is not true that Greece is a victim of European policies. Greece is the victim of the irresponsible behaviour of the governments of Greece He concludes: Europe is not the creator of the problems. Europe is the victim of the problems, and it is part of the solution. Amnesty says the speech was a missed opportunity to push human rights up Europe's agenda: Speaking of Farage, Barroso also suggested that UK voters will support UKIP rather than the Conservative MEPs in next year's European elections -- on the grounds that people will prefer the original over a copy, he argued. \"We have a duty to our citizens to provide hope\", says Barroso, reiterating that he doesn't believe the economic crisis has ended. Barroso calls on all pro-European MEPs to work together in next year's European elections to make the case for the European project. Clearly wounded by the claims that he's living on another planet, a finger-pointing Barroso tells MEPs that he knows all about the problem of social deprivation and beggars on the streets. I know, and I'm fighting that problem. We know the reality and we're trying to do our best, he says. Barroso tells Nigel Farage that \"ninety nine percent\" of scientists believe that man-made climate change is a reality. Farage responds by waving his North Pole photos again. Back in Strasbourg, Jose Manuel Barroso is responding to the various comments made by MEPs about his State of the Union speech. And then into English..... He denies being unduly optimistic, saying that he never claimed the crisis is over. This is a major political crisis, he says, and it requires a lot of wisdom to guarantee unity and diversity. On the UK unemployment data, Heather Stewart, the Observer's economics editor, writes: Despite the improving picture, there was also evidence in the detail of the figures that conditions in the labour market remain tough for many. Average pay rose at an annual rate of just 1%, or 1.1% including bonuses \u2013 well below the 2.8% rate of inflation \u2013 suggesting that living standards are still being squeezed. The ONS also highlighted the fact that much of the increase in employment \u2013 almost all of it, for women \u2013 has been in part-time work, in many cases taken up by employees who would prefer a full-time job if they could find one. Almost a third of men, and 13.5% of women, in part-time work or self-employment would prefer to be in a full-time role, according to the ONS. Full story: UK unemployment rate falls to 7.7% Britain's households are still being squeezed, today's data shows. That 1.1% rise in weekly earnings (on an annual basis) is well below the inflation rate of 2.8%. The pound has rallied this morning, hitting new seven-month highs against the euro and dollar. But an interest rate rise may still be further off than the City thinks... A few more key points from today's UK unemployment data: Weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased 1.1% y/y in the three months to June. Weekly earnings including bonuses rose by 0.6% y/y. The employment rate rose to 71.6% in the three months to July from 71.5%, with 29.84 million people working, an increase of 80,000 over the quarter and 275,000 from a year earlier. The number of full-time workers increased by 95,000 over the three months to July to 21.79 million, accounting for 73% of all employed people. The number of part-time workers decreased by 15,000 to 8.05 million and is down by 74,000 from a year earlier. The percentage of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for more than 12 months\u2014was 36.2% in the three months to July. The unemployment rate for young people aged 16 and 17 years old was 38%; the unemployment rate for 18- to 24-year-olds was 18.9%. The number of vacancies was 531,000 in the three months to August, up 7,000 over the quarter and 53,000 from a year earlier. While MEPs were debating Europe, new data showed that Britain's jobless rate has fallen. The unemployment rate fell to 7.7% in the three months to July, from 7.8%, with the number of people out of work dropping by 24,000 to 2.49 million. The claimant count also fell, by 32,600, to 1.40 million - the lowest level since February 2009. The headline jobless rate is particularly closely watched now, as the Bank of England has said it won't consider raising interest rates until it has fallen to 7%. I'll pull together some reaction now... This tweet from MEP Guy Verhofstaft has caused quite a stir: The debate is continuing, and can be followed here or on the BBC Parliament channel. But here's a quick round-up: \u2022 Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has declared that Europe's economic crisis is easing. In hie final State of the Union speech in Strasbourg, the EC president said the panic that gripped the region over the past few years was abating. But politicians need to remain vigilant, and tackle growth and unemployment.Barroso declared: For Europe, recovery is within sight. Let's not overestimate the progress, but neither should we underestimate what has been done. \u2022 Barroso added that MEPs have a debt to the region's 26 million unemployed to make sure the fragile recovery does not falter. He cited two priorities -- hammering out a final deal on the next EU budget, and implementing banking union. \u2022 And once again, Barroso called for closer political union as a solution to Europe's problems, arguing that; Europe must focus on where it can add most value. It needs to be big on big things and smaller on smaller things. And the EC president also reminded MEPs that 99 year ago, member states were entering years of conflict. Europe must learn the lessons of world war one, he insisted. It is a project of peace. Barroso also cited fighting climate change, achieving closer trade links, and creating a single market for telecoms as priorities for the year ahead. Coverage starts at 8.12am, with Barroso's conclusion at 9.00am. \u2022 The speech did not set the Strasbourg parliament alight. A series of MEPs have criticised Barroso for taking a too-optimistic view. One reminded him that just 31 new jobs were created in Spain last month, while another pointed to beggars on the streets as a sign that social cohesion is unraveling. Reaction starts at 9.05am \u2022 And from the eurosceptic wing, Nigel Farage predicted that the euro will die \"a very slow and painful death\", and was promptly criticised for not doing enough work. See 9.50am onwards. British Liberal MEP Andrew Duff says it is important that the European Council is 'held to account' as it tries to move towards closer political union. Laurence Stassen of the Netherlands is blunter, challenging Barroso to take his message that 'things are getting better' onto the streets of Europe. What planet are you on, she asks, adding that next year's European elections will see a real change in Europe's direction. One more key line from the debate -- Spanish socialist MEP Juan Lopez Aguilar has also chided Barroso for being too confident. In Spain, people are giving up hope of ever getting a job, he says. We need to do more to stimulate economic growth, he say -- saying Europe is only achieving meagre growth at present. Aguilar also touches on the NSA scandal, saying it is completely unacceptable that the communications of European citizens have been intercepted by American intelligence. Austrian MEP Jorg Leichfried wades into Nigel Farage, much to Jose Manuel Barroso's clear amusement . You make these comments, Leichfried tells Farage, but what have you ever done? You've never drafted a single position. How can you justify that to your voters? How can you justify that you've done no work? Farage doesn't seem phased by this prospect. Farage then attacks the Brussels' green agenda, and its attempts to tackle climate change. Waving two NASA photos of the North Pole, he declares that the ice cap has grown significantly over the last couple of years. You're made a terrible mistake, he claims. Much muttering among other MEPs, with many waving their 'blue cards' in an effort to intervene. Now Nigel Farage of UKIP takes the floor. He applauds Barroso's consistent support for federalism -- \"you probably picked it up as a Maoist\" (Barroso was a communist in his youth) It's been a good time for some people, Farage says, but it's been \"a disaster\" for poor people. Farage says that Brussels' austerity push has driven unemployment in peripheral countries far higher than would otherwise be the case, adding: The euro will die a very slow and painful death, but you're all in denial about that. Cyprus's communist MEP, Takis Hadjigeorgiou, also criticises Barroso's optimism over the European economy. He can only be so upbeat because he lives in a different Europe than the rest of us, Hadjigeorgiou claims. He points to beggars on the streets of Strasbourg as proof, before reminding MEPs of the Cypriot bailout package: In my country, where the decisions taken by the troika destroyed the economy, the commission is now associated with the economic crisis. Now an alternative take. We need less Europe, not more, says Martin Callanan of the European Conservatives and Reformists (who also represents North East England). Callanan begins by taking a few merry pops at senior European politicians, saying they're swarming around hoping to replace Barroso as president of the EC. It's like a giant hustings meeting He points to Vivienne Reding, and Olli Rehn -=- although \"if he gets the job I imagine we'd all have a late lunch\". (surely an early lunch?) Anyway, Callanan's argument is that \"we need a new euro-realistic agenda\". To be proudly German, or Polish is not anti-European, he argues. Rebecca Harms cites the fate of whistle-blower Edward Snowden, as an example that Europe isn't living up to Barroso's vision of peace and social justice. What does that say about Europe, when Edward Snowden is holed up in Russia? Other MEPs are now chipping in, demanding to know Harms position on data protection and suchlike... The debate continues, with European Green's co-chair Rebecca Harms MEP warning that Europe \"keeps dwelling in public finances\", but we neglect the state of Europe's private banks. Banking union is needed to bring lurking problems to their balance sheets. Harms also takes a pop at Angela Merkel for phoning other European leaders and threatening that German industry will pull out of their countries unless they toe the German line on climate change. In a typically passionate intervention, Guy Verhofstaft is arguing for closer European political and economic union to tackle the region's economic problems. We should have a common government, a common treasury, which would mean cheaper borrowing for governments. And the European Central Bank's mandate should be changed, so that it focuses on growth rather than inflation. And in conclusion, Verhofstaft says next year's European election will not be between left and right, but between eurosceptics \"who believe you can put the world outside your borders\" and the rest. Guy Verhofstaft, who leads the European Liberals and Democrats group, also criticises Barroso for arguing that the recovery is underway., Rather, Verhofstaft argues, it proves that we merely hit the bottom. Europe risks a Japan-style lost two decades, without more decisive action. Swoboda concludes by laying into Barroso for botching the European budget (he, like many MEPs, wanted more funds for the European project). He warns that his Socialist and Democrats group won't support the budget, or MFF, unless it contains more funding to help fight youth unemployment. Hannes Swoboda also reminds Barroso of the social problems in Europe, and issues such as rising attacks on migrants. And even in Italy, he says, where C\u00e9cile Kyenge has faced a series of racist insults since joining Enrico Letta's government. We should be proud to have a black minister in one of our European governments. Swoboda agrees that Europe needs to be stronger -- how can we support foreign minister Catherine Ashton's work otherwise? The various leaders of political groupings in the European Parliament are responding to Barroso. Hannes Swoboda, head of the European Socialists and Democrats, tears into the EC president for the upbeat tone of his speech. Once again, you have presented a glass that is half full as fully full. Swoboda is unamused that Barroso spoke of recovery in Europe, pointing out that there is still 60% youth unemployment in Greece. How many jobs were created in Spain last month, he continues. 31. Just 31. It's a scandal. So what does Barroso actually want? He rounds up his speech by setting two priorities. First, getting final agreement on the next EU budget, the Multiannual Financial Framework. (this sparked furious battles last year as EU leaders such as David Cameron and Angela Merkel fought Brussels' push for another rise in funding). Second, implementing banking union in the eurozone. This progress is essential to deliver growth, and fight unemployment - especially youth unemployment. That is our priority, say Barroso, who repeats that the crisis is not over, \"it is in its decisive phase\". And with another nod to the conflict of 1914-1918, Barroso says he hopes that next year European citizens can be walking confidently out of the crisis. And that's the end of the speech. Barroso gets a polite round of applause, but there's none of the whooping and cheering that you see when the US president delivers the State of the Union. On next year's elections... \"It is up to us to make the case for Europe\". Barroso also criticised those who nationalize success and Europeanize failure -- good, or bad, we're in this together. Some people blame Europe for the financial crisis, says Barroso .... but they're wrong. Mismanagement in the financial markets is to blame (cue scattered applause) He then makes a good point, about how Europe's citizens and companies are interconnected. There are links between one country's debt, and another country's banks, between companies and customers, between one country's workers and another country's companies. Barroso harks back to the days of WW1... The big issue for next year's European elections are whether voters are presented with a 'cartoon' Europe, or the real one. And as predicted, Barroso is calling for close political union in Europe. Do you want to improve Europe,or give it up, he asks. \"If you don't like Europe, improve it\". We need closer integration on certain issues and \"political union must be on the horizon\", Barroso declares: Europe must focus on where it can add most value. It needs to be big on big things and smaller on smaller things. Barroso offers the hand of friendship to the Ukraine, saying Europe won't turn its back on Kiev. Barroso touches on the ongoing crisis in Syria. Europe has sent \u20ac1.5bn of aid to the country, and will do everything possible to help refugees fleeing the civil war. The use of chemical weapons is an act that deserves clear condemnation and a strong reaction. The proposal to put Syria's chemical weapons behind use is a potentially posiotive development, and the Assad regime should respond swiftly, he says. Brussels continues to believe that only a political resolution can end the crisis. Barroso reminds the Strasbourg parliament that next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the first world war. It is because of Europe that former enemies sit around the same table. Last year's Nobel Peace Prize reminded us of that achievement. Europe is a project of peace. We should not be arrogent, but we should be proud. \"Does anyone believe that we would have any credibility left in the international community if the eurozone had collapsed,\" asks Barroso. As suspected, Barroso's solution to today's problems is more Europe, rather than less. He's admitting that the eurozone crisis has rattled the region, saying We have had a real stress test for the EU. There is no more business as usual, no going back to the old normal. And citizens won't be convinced by rhetoric and promises.... At the moment, with markets not fully convinced by the situation in Europe, political risk is the biggest threat, he adds: Europe isn't the problem, says Barroso, it's part of the solution. Discuss.... Redefine's Sony Kapoor isn't convinced... One single year EU budget represents more money ... than the Marshall plan of old times, says Barroso. A few more points.... Barroso says a single market for telecoms that will benefit consumers, and that the EU must crack on with closer trade links with faster-growing markets overseas. On the environment he promises progress: Europe alone cannot fight climate change, but we must lead the effort. Europe needs to avoid a jobless recovery, declares Barroso (skating over the point that the eurozone's relentless austerity programmes are blamed by many for causing the unemployment crisis). The EC president declares: The current level of unemployment is economically unsustainable, politically untenable and socially unacceptable. Onto some proposals... Barroso says that European countries need to implement banking reform, starting with the 'single supervisory mechanism' that has been on the table for months. These rules will mean that taxpayers are longer in the front line for paying for banks when they fail, he explains. Barroso rattles through some financial facts....Bond spreads are coming down, stock markets are up, Greece is regaining competitiveness and close to achieving a primary budget surplus. And here's the key line: For Europe, recovery is within sight. Let's not overestimate the progress, but neither should we underestimate what has been done. Europe has fought back over the last five years, says Barroso. So the question facing Europe now, is \"do we talk it up, or talk it down\", asks Barroso. But he also concedes that the EU is only starting to persuade citizens that things are getting better. Barroso says that EU officials received appreciation from other world leaders at the G20 meeting. Not because the crisis is resolved, though, because it isn't, Barroso says. But it will be fixed unless Europe now becomes complacent. But Europe is fighting back, Barroso says. He says that when he met senior economists a year ago, many of them feared a break-up of the eurozone. But today, he points out: No-one has left, or been forced to leave the eurozone. Barroso reminds MEPs that the financial crisis began five years ago with the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This triggered a financial crisis, and an unprecendented social crisis in Europe. This crisis is still \"holding back out households and companies\". Barroso begins... saying that European voters will give their verdict on the way Europe is performing in just eight months time (at the next European Elections). Recently, he says, Europe has been discussed in homes and coffee houses, more than ever before (and we know exactly why that is) Schulz tells MEPs he is hoping for a wide-ranging, lively debate after Barroso's speech. He's also banging on about the 'transparency' of the European parliament, in contrast the the European Council. Is he pitching to replace Barroso as head of the EC?! The Head of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, is introducing President Barroso now... This is the scene as MEPs waiting for the Speech to start.... (it's also being broadcast on BBC Parliament, I note) A heads-up... UK business secretary Vince Cable is set to warn today that Britain's economic recovery isn't has robust as some, including the chancellor George Osborne, are claiming. Our chief political correspondent, Nick Watt, reports: Coalition divisions over the government's central economic policy will be highlighted on Wednesday when Vince Cable criticises George Osbornefor showing complacency over Britain's recovery. In a sign of his continuing concerns over the chancellor's handling of the economy, the business secretary will say that this attitude represents one of a series of dangers to the economy. Cable will also challenge Osborne, who used a speech on Monday to hail the government's help for the housing market, when he warns of an uncontrollable housing boom. Labour said the speech, to be made at a joint government/CBI industrial strategy conference, was \"an embarrassing slapdown to George Osborne's deeply complacent and out-of-touch speech\". More here: Vince Cable warns against George Osborne's complacency over recovery Reuters has the details of how Italian politicians backed away from an early decision on Silvio Berlusconi's possible expulsion following last month's tax fraud conviction: Italian lawmakers on Tuesday pulled back from a showdown over the political future of Silvio Berlusconi after allies of the billionaire media tycoon threatened to bring down Prime Minister Enrico Letta's unstable ruling coalition. A meeting of a cross-party Senate committee charged with deciding whether Berlusconi should be barred from the Senate following a conviction for tax fraud ended without holding a vote, easing political tensions at least for the time being. The centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which has the largest presence on the 23-member committee, accepted centre-right demands to slow down hearings on the case, but it maintains its position that Berlusconi must lose his seat. The meeting ended at around midnight (2200 GMT). Hearings will resume on Thursday at 1300 GMT, Senator Benedetto Della Vedova of Mario Monti's Civic Choice said. \"The discussion will start again in the next few days and it will take a long time,\" the Senate group of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is most hostile to Berlusconi, said in a tweet as the meeting neared its end. More here: Italian lawmakers delay showdown over Berlusconi Frederik Ducrozet, economist at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, isn't amused: The press pack are assembling... The State of the Union speech will be streamed live, here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Europe isn't America. But just like the US president, the head of the European Commission gives an annual State of the Nation speech to outline his vision for the EU, and explain where the Union is heading. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso will deliver the speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, from 9am CET (8am BST). With the eurozone crisis having been calmed over the last year, Barroso is likely to renew his call for tighter political and economic links to bind Europe together. This is the final State of the Union speech before Barroso's term as EC president expires. But a tub-thumping call for closer union could also remind us of the tensions between member states, over issues from banking union to austerity bailout packages -- and encourage those who want Britain to have a looser link with Europe. Barroso will also be taking questions on twitter tomorrow -- using the #askbarroso hashtag. The other key event this morning is the latest UK unemployment data, due at 9.30am. It could show that the headline unemployment rate has fallen, but also confirm that real wages continue to lag inflation. Both are important issues. Living standards is rising up the political agenda, while Bank of England is committed to keeping interest rates at record lows until the unemployment rate drops from 7.8% to 7%. I'll be tracking Barroso's speech, and the jobs data, in the blog, along with other events through the day. That will include political developments in Italy, where last night a committee decided not to take an immediate decision in Silvio Berluconi's possible expulsion from the Senate....",

But as a succession of MEPs warned, 0.3% growth in GDP does not make up for 26 million people out of work, and rising social angst. No-one, it seemed, wanted to be seen giving Brussels much credit for the fragile recovery.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Political worries?</strong></p> <p>The immediate risk of the Italian government collapsing abated last night, when Senators decided not to push for an early decision on whether to banish Silvio Berlusconi. But political risk remains the big fear for Brussels -- thus Barroso's comment about how nations must stick to their commitments.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Presidential power?</strong></p> <p>The speech was a reminder of the limits of Barroso's influence. He repeatedly called for rapid progress on banking union, echoing comments from <a href=\"But%20Germany,%20the%20biggest%20economy%20in%20the%20eurozone,%20has%20voiced%20its%20objections%20to%20the%20creation%20of%20a%20single%20authority,%20arguing%20that%20it%20would%20require%20a%20new%20European%20treaty%20that%20may%20take%20years%20to%20agree.\">IMF chief Christine Lagarde only yesterday</a>.

The number of people employed in \"real estate activities\" increased by 9.9% between March and June (the latest month for which data are available), according to the Office for National Statistics. That was the fastest percentage increase in any sector of the economy; and a rise of 77,000 in the number of estate agents over the past year has taken the total number of people employed in the sector to 562,000, the largest number since records began in 1978. Growing confidence in the outlook for the housing market has been a key component of the economic upturn that led the chancellor, George Osborne, to claim in a speech on Monday that the UK is \"turning a corner\". Prices across the country rose by 3.5% in the year to August, according to the Nationwide, with much sharper increases in London and the south east.

Barratt Homes reported a 73% surge in pre-tax profits to \u00a3192m for the year to the end of June, compared with \u00a3111m last year, in the latest sign that the improvement in the housing market is gaining momentum. A survey on Tuesday showed that house prices are rising at their fastest rate for almost seven years, as accessible finance encourages more people to put their homes on the market. Barratt said its average selling price had increased 8% to \u00a3194,800, up from the previous year's \u00a3180,500. But the company warned that not enough new homes are being built \u2013 citing government figures, it said only 135,000 houses a year are going up, compared with a conservative estimate of 260,000 a year that are needed. Barratt has increased its completion rates by more than 20% in the past two years and expects to finish around 45,000 homes in the next three years. The housebuilder also said there had been a \"step change\" in demand for new homes since the government introduced its Help to Buy programme, a mortgage guarantee scheme that critics fear will stoke a new housing bubble. Mark Clare, the chief executive of Barratt, said: \"These are significantly improved results and we have had a very strong start to the new financial year. We are seeing the housing market recovery starting to spread beyond London and the south east.\"",

Unemployment on the broad International Labour Organisation measure tracked by the Bank stood at 2.49 million from May to July, down by 24,000 from three months earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International is on course to join the FTSE 100, six years after its badly received stock market flotation. The retailer is expected to be confirmed as the latest addition to the leading index on Wednesday, the same day its annual meeting takes place at its Derbyshire headquarters. Sports Direct's elevation to the UK's blue-chip index of leading companies comes just weeks after the Guardian revealed that more than 20,000 of the retailer's staff \u2013 some 90% of the workforce \u2013 are employed on controversial zero-hours contracts. The company has consistently refused to comment on its employment practices. Joining the FTSE 100 means investment fund managers who track the index will now be forced to buy shares. Sports Direct joined the stock market in 2007 at 300p a share, with the Newcastle United-owner Ashley cashing in nearly \u00a31bn in the process. The shares headed downwards almost immediately, and at one point hit a low of 32p. City critics hit out at Ashley's management style and the lack of conventional communication from the company. But the pile-em-high, sell-em-cheap strategy, together with the demise of rival JJB Sports meant the business continued to grow. Last year profits climbed 22% to \u00a3268m. The company was forced to scrap a lucrative share scheme for Ashley which could have paid him up to \u00a360m after shareholder protests, and recent praise for its payment of bonuses of up to \u00a3100,000 to 2,000 staff lasted only until the firm's use of zero-hours contracts was revealed. Sports Direct is now facing new competition in the form of Matalan, which has hired former JJB boss Tom Knight and a Sports Direct executive to run a new sports retailer called Intersport Sporting Pro. Matalan has identified six initial sites and has plans for 100 stores across the UK. On Tuesday Sports Direct closed up 2.5p at 715.5p, valuing the business at more than \u00a34bn. Also joining the FTSE 100 in the quarterly reshuffle \u2013 pending final confirmation on Wednesday by FTSE Group \u2013 are Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling, the Greek group which moved its main market listing to London in April, and South African packaging group Mondi. They replace troubled outsourcing group Serco, oil services business Wood Group and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, which is currently in the middle of a takeover attempt by its oligarch founders. ENRC's demotion would mean there were no former Soviet mining companies in the leading index following the departure of Polymetal, Evraz and Kazakhmys. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw one of its infrequent changes. Hewlett-Packard, Bank of America and Alcoa will all be removed from the 30-strong index, to be replaced by Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike. The index has only been revised 53 times since its creation in 1907, and the last time there were three changes at once was in April 2004. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said the changes were prompted by the low share price of the three ejected companies and a desire to diversify the sectors and industries represented in the index.",
