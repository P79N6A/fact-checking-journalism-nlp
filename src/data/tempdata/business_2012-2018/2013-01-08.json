      "bodyText": "The Obama administration ordered a sweeping review of Shell's plans to drill in the Arctic on Tuesday, after a series of mishaps ending with the New Year grounding of the company's Kulluk rig. The review \u2013 and a separate investigation of the grounding of the Kulluk \u2013 raises the possibility that Shell, after investing six years and $5bn trying to extract oil in harsh and remote conditions, may be forced to re-evaluate entirely its plans to drill in the Arctic. The high-level review will home in on some of the most difficult moments for Shell since it began exploring for oil beneath the Beaufort and Chukchi seas last summer: a series of equipment breakdowns and safety and environmental violations. The department of interior, in announcing the review, said it would help determine whether the company is prepared to operate in the Arctic. \"Our review will look at Shell's management and operations in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas,\" said Tommy Beaudreau, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy and Management, who will be heading the 60-day review. \"We will assess Shell's performance in the Arctic's challenging environment.\" The review will pay special attention to the series of mishaps that culminated in the grounding of the Kulluk, including the botched test of its made-to-order oil spill containment dome, and equipment breakdowns and safety and environmental violations aboard the Arctic Challenger barge and the Noble Discoverer and Kulluk drilling rig. Shell's safety and environment practices will come under additional scrutiny with a separate US Coast Guard investigation announced on Tuesday into the grounding of its drill rig. Tuesday's moves come at a time when the Obama administration has been under growing pressure from Arctic scientists and campaign groups to reconsider its decision to open up the Arctic to oil companies. The Arctic is believed to be one of the last great unexplored deposits of oil and natural gas remaining beneath the Beaufort and Chukchi, but conditions are far more difficult than anywhere else \u2013 and so are the risks to a pristine environment and wildlife including endangered polar bear. \"The unique challenges posed by the Arctic environment demand an even higher level of scrutiny,\" the interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said. The company said it welcomed the review. \"While we completed our drilling operations off the North Slope safely and in accordance with robust permitting and regulatory standards, we nevertheless experienced challenges in supporting the program,\" Curtis Smith, a company spokesman, said in an email. \"A high-level review will help strengthen our Alaska exploration program going forward.\" Campaign groups said the review was a step in the right direction, but renewed their call on Obama to ban drilling in Alaskan waters outright. \"Again and again we are learning the hard way that Shell is not prepared to operate in Alaskan waters,\" said Michael Levine, a senior attorney for the Oceana conservation group. \"There is no way Shell should be allowed to drill into hydro-carbon bearing zones in 2013 or in the foreseeable future.\" The review could clear the way for further restrictions on Shell.

      "body": "<p>Of all the genres of US television advertising, we admit that our favorite is the post-bailout thank you \u2013 the PBTY, if you will. Just ask Chrysler, GM and AIG: no bailout seems to be really complete without a schmoopy, tear-jerking TV ad to thank American taxpayers for their support, noting, proudly, that the company has paid back every blessed dollar. This genre requires stirring music, lots of pictures of noble municipal statuary in big cities, and weighty reminders of the ineffable beauty of the American embrace of progress. It also helps if there is a kind of \"bring it on\" tone, befitting a Rocky film.</p> <p>AIG, for instance, put out a very nice post-bailout thank-you ad this month.

Both of these would be classics of the post-bailout thank-you form of advertising in a perfect world. There's only one catch, unfortunately: to do a post-bailout thank-you ad, you have to be really thankful.</p> <h2>We're on the hunt for more bailout apology ads. Have you spotted any? <a href=\"#callout\">Tell us here</a></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/rescued-by-a-bailout-a-i-g-may-sue-its-savior/\">New York Times reported Tuesday</a> that the newly svelte insurer is considering joining a lawsuit against the US government. The complaint? That Uncle Sam imposed harsh terms on AIG for its bailout, thus depriving its shareholders of their proper profits.</p> <p>The chutzpah of this is indisputable; it's like demanding royalties from your doctor because you got sick and thus gave him business. A Comedy Central Twitter feed sardonically noted, \"Watching this ad is like receiving a thank you note from a guy who 'borrowed' your credit card information.\" It followed up with an incredulous blog post that started: \"AIG may be a corporate behemoth that needed billions of taxpayer dollars to pay off its toxic debts (and to sponsor an English soccer team and pay huge executive bonuses), but darn it, it's a polite corporate behemoth.\"</p> <p>It escapes no one's notice that, during the throes of the financial crisis, when money was hard to come by, AIG wrenched $182bn from the federal government because of two factors: its enormous importance to the financial system, and its repetitive tendency to shoot itself in the foot with over-reaching investments. This is in keeping with AIG's history of being dragged, kicking and screaming, to every bit of financial discipline that saved the company. There are many who would say that the four years that the company spent in the finely manicured hands of treasury secretary Tim Geithner were the only thing that saved AIG from its own past of self-destructive investing impulses.</p> <p>But then, the post-bailout thank-you genre is not one that is focused on humility. It benefits from a little pugilism, a punchy, snub-nosed spirit of challenge. The PBTY is not only an emotional act of gratitude to taxpayers; it's the \"what are <em>you</em> looking at?\" of corporate dignity. It is a company, recently down on its luck, declaring to America, \"we may have once needed your money, but we don't need your pity.\"</p> <p>To get a better understanding, witness the excellent work on the subject done by GM and Chrysler. A troupe of football coaches could not be more inspiring. After you watch a batch of post-bailout thank-you ads from GM and Chrysler, it seems that the only patriotic thing to do is storm the White House, asking why we aren't bailing out more companies. It's our duty as Americans.</p> <p>Let's revisit them now.</p> <p>GM kicked off the post-bailout thank-you genre in 2009, with a pre-bailout thank you. It ran just after it was shoved into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by an exasperated federal government that wanted the company to restructure itself in a hurry. GM displayed one of the key features of the post-bailout thank-you: talkiness. There need to be a lot of words in these ads. The tone, in this case, was direct, folksy and midwestern. \"Let's be completely honest. No company wants to go through this,\" an authoritative narrator declares. After a few seconds of explanation, he concludes: \"This is not about going out of business. This is about getting down to business. Because the only chapter we're focused on is chapter one.\"</p> <p>It was roughly a year later, after the bailout seemed to work, that GM ran two ads. To connoisseurs, these are among the finest of the post-bailout thank-you form. The first, called Thank You (We All Fall Down), opens with a boxer taking a hard hit in the boxing ring, followed by some unexpected images of great American resilience: Popeye, John Belushi as Bluto in Animal House, and Evel Knievel. Each of them gets back up after a setback. The ad, accompanied by spindly, thoughtful piano music, closes with white letters on a black screen: \"We all fall down. Thank you for helping us get back up.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbXpV0aqEM4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-jbXpV0aqEM4\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbXpV0aqEM4?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"259\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>After that, GM got serious with its ad, named Trust. This one tackled the bailout head-on. \"A lot of Americans didn't agree with giving GM a second chance,\" says GM CEO Ed Whitacre, striding through a factory. \"That's why we are proud to announce we have repaid our government loans in full with interest, five years before it was expected of us.\" The ad concludes with Whitacre standing before an army of employees and cars, declaring, \"we invite you to take a look at the new GM.\" </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJ0YHyDVrj4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-dJ0YHyDVrj4\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJ0YHyDVrj4?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"283\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>The finest of the form, however, is done by Chrysler, which pulled out all the stops in its ad campaigns: the stirring music, the blazing images, the celebrities \u2013 Eminem, Clint Eastwood and John Varvatos \u2013 inspirational poetry, and even Latin. Latin! What makes the Chrysler ads the best of the post-bailout thank you form is that they're not really full of gratitude. They're full of fight. They want to tell you a little something you might not know about real life. <br> The best Chrysler ad is really a defense of Detroit itself against big-city interlopers from New York, Chicago, and presumably, Washington. \"What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?\" asks a narrator who sounds suspiciously like the one in the GM ads. \"Well, I'll tell you: more than most. You see, it's the hottest fires that make the hardest steel.\" </p> <p>To make absolutely clear that people outside Detroit will never understand Detroit, the narrator dismisses big-city journalists: \"That's not the story you've been reading in papers by the folks who have never been here and don't even know what we're capable of. We're from America.\" That last is a reference to the fact that Italy's Fiat owns Chrysler, which the defiant \"imported from Detroit\" tagline refers to. Then there's Eminem and a choir wearing full scarlet-and-black robes in an empty auditorium. </p> <p>Chrysler, in fact, embedded bailouts as the subtext in nearly all of its wildly successful comeback ad campaign. One Chrysler 200 ad opened, confusingly, with that authoritative voice speaking in Latin. It turns out that he was declaiming Detroit's motto, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnhI00dqF-M\">something about rising from the ashes</a>. Another ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1mZMZV2rRk\">named Voices</a>, featured a Detroit tabernacle community choir, talking about healing. An ad for the Chrysler 300 is an extended quotation from a poem that ends, \"When you're up against a trouble, meet it squarely, face to face. You may fail, but fall still fighting. Don't give up. Eyes front, head high to the finish. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXFEK3N2qxc\">See it through</a>.\" </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvvAgoDsVfE\">rather sardonic Chrysler ad</a>, about \"advice,\" starts: \"On the way to the top, everyone 's got advice for ya \u2013 what you're doing wrong, and how to do things they've never done themselves.\" Then the narrator describes Chrysler's sound-reducing technology: \"So on your way to the top, you can keep the sound of doubt outside.\" Sure, it's aspirational \u2013 \"on the way to the top\" \u2013 but as Damon Runyon's gangsters might enjoy the concept. </p> <p>But Chrysler did veer into the somewhat more emo form last year, with a Clint Eastwood ad that read more like \"are you there, God? It's us, Chrysler.\" </p> <p>The company's Super Bowl ad connected Detroit's struggle to get back to its former glory with America's struggles in the depths of the Great Recession. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PE5V4Uzobc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-_PE5V4Uzobc\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PE5V4Uzobc?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"283\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"It's halftime in America,\" Eastwood opens, in his trademark velvet croak. \"People are out of work, and they're hurting, and they're wondering what they can do to make it come back. And they're scared, because this isn't a game.\" But wait, there is optimism: \"We all rallied around what was right, and acted as one \u2026 This country can't be knocked out with one punch. We get back up again, and when we do, the world will hear the roar of our engines.\" </p> <p>Yes, \"what was right,\" in that ad, refers to the auto bailouts. It makes quasi-nationalization of struggling auto manufacturers not just an act of desperation, but a proud civic duty. The founding fathers might have vomited at the idea, but there's no argument that it made for a great ad. </p> <p>It is probably the hope of most Americans that the post-bailout thank-you ad genre will end here, if only because we don't want to be dragged through the drama of any more bailouts. But if you have to be bailed out, it doesn't hurt to have a stylish ad to commemorate your victory.</p> <p><a name=\"callout\">#</a></p> <h2>What have we missed: Have you spotted other bailout apology ads?

The first, called Thank You (We All Fall Down), opens with a boxer taking a hard hit in the boxing ring, followed by some unexpected images of great American resilience: Popeye, John Belushi as Bluto in Animal House, and Evel Knievel. Each of them gets back up after a setback. The ad, accompanied by spindly, thoughtful piano music, closes with white letters on a black screen: \"We all fall down. Thank you for helping us get back up.\" After that, GM got serious with its ad, named Trust. This one tackled the bailout head-on. \"A lot of Americans didn't agree with giving GM a second chance,\" says GM CEO Ed Whitacre, striding through a factory. \"That's why we are proud to announce we have repaid our government loans in full with interest, five years before it was expected of us.\" The ad concludes with Whitacre standing before an army of employees and cars, declaring, \"we invite you to take a look at the new GM.\" The finest of the form, however, is done by Chrysler, which pulled out all the stops in its ad campaigns: the stirring music, the blazing images, the celebrities \u2013 Eminem, Clint Eastwood and John Varvatos \u2013 inspirational poetry, and even Latin. Latin! What makes the Chrysler ads the best of the post-bailout thank you form is that they're not really full of gratitude. They're full of fight. They want to tell you a little something you might not know about real life. The best Chrysler ad is really a defense of Detroit itself against big-city interlopers from New York, Chicago, and presumably, Washington. \"What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?\" asks a narrator who sounds suspiciously like the one in the GM ads. \"Well, I'll tell you: more than most. You see, it's the hottest fires that make the hardest steel.\" To make absolutely clear that people outside Detroit will never understand Detroit, the narrator dismisses big-city journalists: \"That's not the story you've been reading in papers by the folks who have never been here and don't even know what we're capable of. We're from America.\" That last is a reference to the fact that Italy's Fiat owns Chrysler, which the defiant \"imported from Detroit\" tagline refers to. Then there's Eminem and a choir wearing full scarlet-and-black robes in an empty auditorium. Chrysler, in fact, embedded bailouts as the subtext in nearly all of its wildly successful comeback ad campaign. One Chrysler 200 ad opened, confusingly, with that authoritative voice speaking in Latin. It turns out that he was declaiming Detroit's motto, something about rising from the ashes. Another ad, named Voices, featured a Detroit tabernacle community choir, talking about healing. An ad for the Chrysler 300 is an extended quotation from a poem that ends, \"When you're up against a trouble, meet it squarely, face to face. You may fail, but fall still fighting. Don't give up. Eyes front, head high to the finish. See it through.\" A rather sardonic Chrysler ad, about \"advice,\" starts: \"On the way to the top, everyone 's got advice for ya \u2013 what you're doing wrong, and how to do things they've never done themselves.\" Then the narrator describes Chrysler's sound-reducing technology: \"So on your way to the top, you can keep the sound of doubt outside.\" Sure, it's aspirational \u2013 \"on the way to the top\" \u2013 but as Damon Runyon's gangsters might enjoy the concept. But Chrysler did veer into the somewhat more emo form last year, with a Clint Eastwood ad that read more like \"are you there, God? It's us, Chrysler.\" The company's Super Bowl ad connected Detroit's struggle to get back to its former glory with America's struggles in the depths of the Great Recession. \"It's halftime in America,\" Eastwood opens, in his trademark velvet croak. \"People are out of work, and they're hurting, and they're wondering what they can do to make it come back. And they're scared, because this isn't a game.\" But wait, there is optimism: \"We all rallied around what was right, and acted as one \u2026 This country can't be knocked out with one punch. We get back up again, and when we do, the world will hear the roar of our engines.\" Yes, \"what was right,\" in that ad, refers to the auto bailouts. It makes quasi-nationalization of struggling auto manufacturers not just an act of desperation, but a proud civic duty. The founding fathers might have vomited at the idea, but there's no argument that it made for a great ad. It is probably the hope of most Americans that the post-bailout thank-you ad genre will end here, if only because we don't want to be dragged through the drama of any more bailouts. But if you have to be bailed out, it doesn't hurt to have a stylish ad to commemorate your victory. # What have we missed: Have you spotted other bailout apology ads? Tell us!

Speaking at an event to mark the start of Ireland's presidency of the European Union, Gilmore said: \"This is not going to work if we have 27 different categories of membership.\" He added that Britain leaving the EU, a scenario dubbed \"brexit\", had replaced Greece leaving the euro as the continent's biggest potential challenge.",

The headline figures spell bad news, but that is compounded by the political and human impact of terrifying levels of youth unemployment in Spain, Greece and Italy.</p> <p>This saga is far from over, whatever President Barroso may believe, and it seems it is set to get worse in 2013.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the proximity of the unemployment rate to previous results going back more than a decade, we can see that the overall level isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s the widening gulf between core and periphery. Diverging government bonds yields show different economic trajectories and put strain on monetary union. The labour market also exposes just how far the Eurozone has moved away from the founding ideal of synchronised economic cycles. Unemployment in Greece (26.0% in September) and Spain (26.6% in November) now lies more than 20 percentage points above the level of Austria (4.5% in November) \u2013 picture a line of Greeks where one in four is without a job, compared with one in twenty Austrians.</p> <p>&#xa0;The policy response is limited to structural reforms. Governments have embarked on cost cutting and revenue raising to plug fiscal deficits. The European Central Bank supports the deficit reduction and reform agenda, standing ready to rescue nations from rising bond yields if necessary. But otherwise it remains idle, leaving interest rates untouched and holding off from further monetary injections.</p> <p>In other words, the Eurozone is trundling further into recession, but neither states nor the central bank are taking action. Reform will have to be undertaken the long and painful way: falling wages in the periphery amid widespread unemployment, rising wages in the core thanks to a weak euro and loose monetary policy. In the absence of mitigating economic policies, such as transfers from core to periphery, the current divergence of the common currency area is a prerequisite for future convergence. But too wide a gulf is also unsustainable due to increasingly adversarial political pressures. The Eurozone faces a long and hard trek, it remains unclear if it can reach the summit intact.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the Eurozone likely having suffered a third successive quarter of modest GDP contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012 and facing a difficult looking 2013, and with Eurozone business confidence still relatively low - the likelihood is that Eurozone unemployment is headed significantly higher.</p> <p>Indeed, it looks highly probable that the Eurozone unemployment rate will move clearly above 12.0% during 2013.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8f459f5c-9268-4f49-8bf0-18cd3df4bd6f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/8/1357657889785/efebe1f3-f9ce-414f-a6bc-7ccc18c95aad-460.jpeg\" alt=\"European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso delivers a speech during the opening of a Portuguese diplomatic meeting at Lisbon's Champalimaud Foundation centre, Thursday, Jan. 3, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, speaking last week.

Why is it self-evidently a positive public good for the peoples of Europe?</p> <p>Why sacrifice the lifeblood of parliaments for an economic experiment that is not even offering a `Chinese' trade-off of prosperity in exchange for abridged liberties. Why sacrifice democracy for a Barroso Model that has generated a youth jobless rate of 56.5pc in Spain?</p> <p>These are the questions that Mr Barroso and his successor will have to answer over the next three years as the Club Med slump grinds on. We are no longer in the frothy \u2013 dare I say trivial \u2013 phase of financial crisis.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap things up for the day. Here's a closing summary: \u2022 Europe's jobless crisis has deepened, with the news that the unemployment rate across the eurozone has risen to a new record high of 11.8% (details from 10.05am) Youth unemployment has also risen again (see 10.18am and also 10.40am), hitting 24.4% across the eurozone. In Spain, 56.5% of young people are out of work. Economists warned that the data shows that Europe is still stuck in a severe economic mess, despite the progress made in 2012 to hold the eurozone together (see 3.13pm). \u2022 Antonis Samaras and Angela Merkel have held talks in Berlin. The two leaders looked on friendly terms, and said Europe must make more progress (see 12.10pm) \u2022 Ireland has warned that Britain cannot simply rewrite its relationship with the rest of Europe. Deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore added that Britain's possible exit from the EU was now a bigger threat than the possibility of Greece leaving the euro (see 4.26pm). \u2022 Japan has promised to support Europe by buying bonds issued to fund its bailouts. The announcement (see 8.29am onwards), is meant to help stabilise the world economy. \u2022 Jeroen Dijsselbloem looks to be on track to add eurogroup president to his CV, alongside Dutch finance minister. (see 11.46am) So you'd better practice the pronunciation (see 4.39pm). Thanks for reading and commenting -- I\"ll be back for more tomorrow. Goodnight! European stock markets have closed, and it's a mixed picture: FTSE 100: down 10 points at 6053, -0.18% German DAX: down 36 points at 7695, -0.48% French CAC: up 1 points at 3708, +0.03% Spanish IBEX: up 34 points at 8453, +0.4% Italian FTSE MIB: up 55 points at 16951, +0.33% Alex Young, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, said investors had been torn between negative news (record eurozone unemployment, poor German industrial orders, weak retail sales), and more positive signs (rising business confidence, Japan's backing for eurozone bailout bonds). Either way as investors look at the latest company earnings reports it seems that sitting on ones hands for now is the preferred option until companies start to give a clearer idea of what their forward guidance is likely to be. Seems I'm not the only person wondering how to pronounce the (likely) next Eurogroup president's surname, so here's the answer: All together now... Ireland's deputy prime minister has warned this afternoon that Britain's possible exit from the EU is now a bigger threat than Greece quitting the eurozone. Eamon Gilmore made the comments in Dublin at an event to mark the start of Ireland's presidency of the European Union. Gilmore criticised David Cameron's idea of renegotiating the UK's relationship with Brussels, arguing that the central principles of EU membership must be the same for all members, adding: This is not going to work if we have 27 different categories of membership Gilmore did say that Ireland had a \"very strong interest\" in Britain remaining at the heart of the EU, but his comments could be a blow to Cameron's plans for a looser relationship with Brussels. (hat-tip to the Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield for the quotes) During the press conference, Irish ministers also reiterated that they still want to be able to tap the eurozone's new bailout structures (having agreed to rather more painful conditions when they sought help) And they also expressed support for Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the next eurogroup-president-in-waiting (and current Netherlands finance minister). Europe's record unemployment levels (see 10.05am onwards) have alarmed analysts, economists and journalists. Several have warned that EU leaders are too complacent about the situation -- following Jose Manuel Barroso's claim yesterday that the threat to the euro has been repelled. Here's a round-up: Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors The new Eurozone unemployment figures are shockingly bad. The Draghi plan may have bought time, but that is all it has done \u2013 it is clear that the economic implosion of several member states continues at a troubling pace. The headline figures spell bad news, but that is compounded by the political and human impact of terrifying levels of youth unemployment in Spain, Greece and Italy. This saga is far from over, whatever President Barroso may believe, and it seems it is set to get worse in 2013. Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research Given the proximity of the unemployment rate to previous results going back more than a decade, we can see that the overall level isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s the widening gulf between core and periphery. Diverging government bonds yields show different economic trajectories and put strain on monetary union. The labour market also exposes just how far the Eurozone has moved away from the founding ideal of synchronised economic cycles. Unemployment in Greece (26.0% in September) and Spain (26.6% in November) now lies more than 20 percentage points above the level of Austria (4.5% in November) \u2013 picture a line of Greeks where one in four is without a job, compared with one in twenty Austrians. The policy response is limited to structural reforms. Governments have embarked on cost cutting and revenue raising to plug fiscal deficits. The European Central Bank supports the deficit reduction and reform agenda, standing ready to rescue nations from rising bond yields if necessary. But otherwise it remains idle, leaving interest rates untouched and holding off from further monetary injections. In other words, the Eurozone is trundling further into recession, but neither states nor the central bank are taking action. Reform will have to be undertaken the long and painful way: falling wages in the periphery amid widespread unemployment, rising wages in the core thanks to a weak euro and loose monetary policy. In the absence of mitigating economic policies, such as transfers from core to periphery, the current divergence of the common currency area is a prerequisite for future convergence. But too wide a gulf is also unsustainable due to increasingly adversarial political pressures. The Eurozone faces a long and hard trek, it remains unclear if it can reach the summit intact. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight With the Eurozone likely having suffered a third successive quarter of modest GDP contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012 and facing a difficult looking 2013, and with Eurozone business confidence still relatively low - the likelihood is that Eurozone unemployment is headed significantly higher. Indeed, it looks highly probable that the Eurozone unemployment rate will move clearly above 12.0% during 2013. And Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the Daily Telegraph has laid into Barroso, rebuking the former student activist for tolerating the ravages of unemployment: So one has to ask, what is the euro for? Why is it self-evidently a positive public good for the peoples of Europe? Why sacrifice the lifeblood of parliaments for an economic experiment that is not even offering a `Chinese' trade-off of prosperity in exchange for abridged liberties. Why sacrifice democracy for a Barroso Model that has generated a youth jobless rate of 56.5pc in Spain? These are the questions that Mr Barroso and his successor will have to answer over the next three years as the Club Med slump grinds on. We are no longer in the frothy \u2013 dare I say trivial \u2013 phase of financial crisis. We are by now in the deadly serious phase of economic and political crisis. Mr Barroso was once a Maoist and a student activist in Portugal's Carnation Revolution against the reactionaries. Good for him. Which side would he be on now if he were 40 years younger? In Barroso's defence, the EC president is playing a leading role in Europe's push to deliver economic stability and growth (for example). Problem is - it ain't delivering (yet?). The French finance minister has squashed speculation that the country's credit rating is being cut. The rumour began rattling around the City about half an hour ago, but wasn't being taken terribly seriously. After all, Fitch only reaffirmed its AAA rating in December, and it's a little early for S&amp;P or Moody's to cut again (they both rate France AA+). The Paris government (which would have been given a day's warning) has now dismissed the idea: Barclays Capital put out an interesting research note today, predicting a lively year for the European banking sector. With the Eurozone crisis in remission, for now at least, we see scope for much greater differentiation between banks \u2013 strategically, operationally, in valuation and in share price performance terms. One reason is that banks could start repaying some of the huge liquidity boost they received from the European Central Bank in December 2011 and February 2012, called the Long Term Refinancing Operations. Those three-year LTROs helped to protect the eurozone from another credit crunch, and banks don't have to repay them for the full 36 months. But stronger banks could move earlier (perhaps to recover collateral from the ECB to use in more lucrative ways). Weak banks are more likely to hang on, though, so it will be interesting to see who moves [a rush of early LTRO redemptions could also show renewed confidence]. This handy graph shows which banks took the most 'free money' from the ECB: There's a certain clustering of Southern European banks on the left, and Northern ones on the right. Europe's new permanent bailout fund successfully held its first debt auction today, with investors paying for the chance to lend to it. The European Stability Mechanism raised \u20ac1.927bn of three-month bonds at an average yield (or interest rate) of -0.0324%. The Bid-to-cover ratio was 3.2, which means the ESM received orders for more than three times as much debt as was on offer. The news today (see 8.29am) that Japan will take part in ESM auctions probably encouraged potential buyers to take part. The real test of the ESM will come, though, when it auctions long-term debt. My colleague Ami Sedghi has gathered all today's unemployment statistics into a new Datablog post: Unemployment in Europe: get the figures for every country Over in Berlin, Antonis Samaras and Angela Merkel have held a brief press conference before starting their meeting today. The two leaders appeared cordial \u2013 and both told the assembled journalists that the eurozone was on the right course, but that more work was needed. Greek prime minister Samaras said: I would like to make clear up front that our country is undertaking great efforts that are linked with great sacrifices to get things back on track. We are trying to win back credibility, on the part of the people of Europe and on the part of the markets. Chancellor Merkel, though, warned that 2013 will be difficult. We must agree on stronger economic policy cooperation by June this year, and there is plenty of work ahead of us. Regarding Greece, Merkel said she would \"of course be interested in what progress the implementation of the Greek reform programme is making\". The Greek parliament approved that austerity package late last year (thus triggering new aid payments), but many of the measures have not been implemented. We're not expecting any further official comments from Merkel or Samaras today. Speculation is growing that Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the not-particularly-internationally-well-known Dutch finance minister, will be named as the next president of the Eurogroup. The prestigious role (chairing the regular meetings of eurozone finance ministers) is up for grabs following Jean-Claude Juncker's decision to step down. Dijsselbloem's name has been 'in the mix' for weeks, and Reuters is now reporting that the 46-year old fin. min. is conducting a European mini-tour, and very likely to get the job. On Monday he met European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, as well as his colleagues from Belgium and Luxembourg. He is expected in Rome on Tuesday and Paris on Wednesday. \"It looks like it is moving in the direction of the Dutch,\" one senior euro zone policymaker said. Dijsselbloem only became Dutch finance minister in November, but has apparently impressed his counterparts. The Wall Street Journal writes today that Dijsselbloem would be the latest low-profile official or politician to take a senior job in Europe, and also has nationality on his side: The Netherlands, which is an important player in the euro-zone debate as one of the bloc\u2019s most credit-worthy governments, hasn\u2019t landed a top European job for one of its own recently. The Italians have Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank. The French had Jean-Claude Trichet there for eight years, and they got Christine Lagarde as head of the International Monetary Fund. The Germans got Klaus Regling to lead the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u2019s new bailout fund. The Finnish have Olli Rehn, the EU\u2019s economics commissioner, and the Austrians have Thomas Wieser as head of the Eurogroup Working Group, the body of senior bureaucrats that crafts the euro zone\u2019s response to the crisis and does much of the legwork for the finance ministers. German industrial orders dropped by 1.8% in November, according to data just released. The drop was driven by a 4.1% slump in business from overseas, which more than cancelled out a 1.3% rise in domestic orders. Capital goods orders (ie, for large machinery) fell by 3.1%. Another sign that the eurozone crisis has hit the region's manufacturing core? Or just a blip - after all, orders were up 3.8% in October. The German economy ministry isn't panicking, saying there are signs that demand appears to be 'stabilising'. Eurozone retail sales, meanwhile, disappointed analysts. They inched 0.1% higher in November, but were 2.6% lower than a year earlier. On a brighter note, though, economic sentiment in the eurozone has improved. The EC's monthly test of business morale rose in December for the second month running - beating analyst forecasts (it hit 87, up from 85.7 the previous month). That suggests firms may be growing more optimistic about Europe's prospects. Today's unemployment data rather takes the shine off recent claims that the eurozone crisis is over. The immediate threat to the single currency has receded, but politicians and policymakers still face an ailing economy. Initiatives such as a banking union or the ECB's bond-buying programme may hold the eurozone together, but they don't deliver the hope of immediate growth. The early reaction to the statistics focuses on the grim youth unemployment levels: You can see the new jobless data on Eurostat's website (pdf). Europe's youth jobless crisis has also worsened. Today's data shows that the youth unemployment rate for November was 23.7% in the European Union, up from 23.4% in October 2012. The youth unemployment rate in the eurozone is now 24.4%, up from 23.9% the previous month. And as usual, there are very sharp differences between northern and southern Europe. The lowest youth jobless rates were recorded in Germany (8.1%), Austria (9.0%) and the Netherlands (9.7%). The highest are in Greece (57.6% in September 2012) and Spain (56.5%). Just in: the eurozone unemployment rate has hit a new record high of 11.8% in November, up from October's 11.7%. Eurostat reported that there are now 18.820 million people out of work in the euro area. The wider EU unemployment rate remained at 10.7%,with 26.061m million men and women out of work. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.5%), Luxembourg (5.1%), Germany (5.4%) and the Netherlands (5.6%). Again, the highest rates were seen in Spain (26.6%). (In Greece, the most recent data shows a 26.0% rate in September 2012). More to follow. The World Economic Forum has just warned that persistent economic weakness is sapping the ability to tackle the mounting threat from climate change. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has the story: Two weeks ahead of its annual meeting in Davos, the WEF said widening wealth gaps and unsustainable government debt were the two biggest risks cited by a panel of over 1000 experts and industry leaders. Rising greenhouse gas emissions was the third most likely risk. \"Continued stress on the global economic system is positioned to absorb the attention of leaders for the forseeable future. Meanwhile the Earth's environmental system is simultaneously coming under increasing stress,\" the Global Risks 2013 report said. \"Future simultaneous shocks to both systems could trigger the 'perfect global storm' with potentially insurmountable consequences\". You can see the full report here, on the WEF's website. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has just told reporters in Berlin that his country is meeting its pledges on economic reforms. Speaking at a conference organised by German newspaper Die Welt, Samaras said: The glass is half-full. We are delivering and Europe is helping. Samaras and Angela Merkel are still expected to hold a joint press conference later this morning. Back in Europe, and youth unemployment in Italy has hit a new record high. In November, 37.1% of young people across Italy were out of work - the highest since records began in 1992. The wider jobless rate in Italy was stable, though, at 11.1%. I mentioned earlier that the yen had weakened against the dollar as Japan made its move around 2.20am GMT. Well, the effect didn't last long, as this graph of the yen against the dollar shows: That may be because traders have digested the fact that Japan will be using its existing currency reserves to buy bonds from the European Stability Mechanism, as Financial Times currency correspondent Alice Ross explains Japan's commitment to buying European bailout bonds is another sign that the crisis has abated, argues Takumi Nomura, a senior dealer at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Nomura said: Japan has been playing a positive role in helping Europe ease the region's debt crisis, so Mr. Aso's comment made investors think European conditions will improve further. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says the move adds \"spice\" to the speculation that was already swirling around the Japanese stimulus package expected soon. Aso and Abe are now painted so deep into a corner on the currency that they have no choice but to deliver on promises to act aggressively.... All this talk of Japanese buying of ESM bonds helps support the Euro. Eurozone exporters, though, might rather see a weaker euro. Although, as KhakiSuit points out below, the current fashion for a weak currency has its limits -- as the Economist explains here: The weak shall inherit the earth, while there's a robust critique here: The Currency Debasement Fallacy Japan's promise to buy eurozone bailout bonds comes as the country's new government strives to create economic growth, combat deflation, and weaken its currency. The yen did fall against the dollar as Taro made his pledge, but quickly reversed the move [updated]. Here's how Taro's announcement is being reported: \u2022 Bloomberg: Japan to Buy ESM Bonds as Abe Steps Up Bid to Weaken Yen \u2022 Reuters: Japan finmin says will buy ESM bonds to help euro zone \u2022 MNI: Japan's Aso Comments Spark Wild Moves in Euro, Yen Japan has announced that it will help Europe through its debt crisis by purchasing bonds issued by the eurozone bailout fund. Speaking in Tokyo this morning the new Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, announced that Japan plans to \"continuously\" take part in debt auctions conducted by the European Stability Mechanism, possibly starting today. Aso refused to say how much Japan would buy, but insisted the plan would support Europe -- and also benefit Japan by helping to weaken the yen. Aso said: Stability in Europe's financial situation helps stabilise currencies including the yen. From this standpoint and based on Europe's further efforts on financial stability, Japan will purchase a portion of ESM bonds continuously by utilising foreign reserves. Aso's commitment will be welcomed in the eurozone, as the ESM is holding its first debt auction later today, selling three-month notes worth about \u20ac2bn. The money raised from ESM bond sales is used to fund eurozone bailout programmes. Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at JPMorgan Securities, told Bloomberg that Aso's pledge would go down well in Europe: The Europeans would be happy to see Japan buy ESM bonds, so Japan can avoid criticism from abroad and at the same time achieve its objective. Japan already owns around \u20ac7bn of bonds issued by the eurozone's temporary rescue fund, the EFSF. Good morning, and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. There's a busy morning ahead of us \u2013 at 10am GMT, fresh unemployment data for November 2012 will be released. Economists fear that the jobless rate across the eurozone could hit a new record high, up from November's 11.7%. With eurozone retail sales and economic confidence data also due at 10am GMT, and German factory orders an hour later, we should get a decent health check on Europe. And on the political front, Angela Merkel and Antonis Samaras are meeting in Berlin today. The German chancellor and Greek PM are expected to hold a brief press conference this morning. I'll also be watching Italy, where the general election campaign is well under way following Silvio Berlusconi's new alliance with the Northern League party (see yesterday's blog...).",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Trading this Christmas was the toughest in almost 40 years, according to Debenhams' chief executive, Michael Sharp, as retailers battled to lure customers in to stores by slashing prices. Debenhams ran sales for two extra days last year \u2013 cutting prices by 25% across the store and by 50% on some knitwear, lingerie and beauty lines \u2013 helping the department store chain to record December sales. Like-for-like sales in the five weeks to 5 January jumped 5%, but at the cost of some profit. Sharp contradicted a claim by Next's boss, Simon Wolfson, this week that discounting had been lower this year, saying that was \"factually incorrect\". \"Next need to get out a bit more,\" he said. \"I know that the high street was more promotional because I was out every day in all of my competitors' shops. It was quite plain the market was more promotional than last year.\" As a result, Debenhams halved its target for annual margin growth from 0.2% to 0.1%. The company also announced and clarified some one-off costs, prompting analysts to hastily adjust their forecasts. Debenhams said the move to its new central London headquarters would cost \u00a32m and the revamp of the flagship Oxford Street store might result in \u00a32m to \u00a33m of lost profits in the second half. The company added that growth in online sales would result in higher costs of warehousing and distribution. Investors responded by selling shares, sending them down 6.5% before lunch, to 109p. Debenhams shares almost doubled during 2012, driven by strong online sales, so traders were quick to take profits. Online sales continued to grow at the end of the year \u2013 up by almost 40% in the 18 weeks to 5 January \u2013 driving the group like-for-like sales 2.9% higher over the same period. Online sales now account for almost 13% of Debenhams' turnover. More customers are using mobile devices to access the website, accounting for 36% of traffic, but Sharp said customers browsing on a computer were more likely to end up buying products than those using mobile devices. The group saw strong sales of party dresses and lingerie over the period. Many of its top-sellers were part of its Christmas advertising campaign, such as the Jonathan Saunders/Edition red coat, which sold out on the back of the advertisement. Sharp said customers had become acclimatised to the new economic reality and were \"extremely canny\" about how they spent their money in the festive season. \"They shop around and do their research before they decide where to buy.\" He expects that to continue into 2013. \"Customers will continue to search for value for money; they will continue to be very careful and cautious with where they spend their money,\" he said. Debenhams plans to keep promotional activity this year at a similar level to 2012, but Sharp said that could change. \"The reality of life is that we will react to market conditions as we see them at the time,\" he said. Despite the challenging environment, with little growth in retail sales across the sector, he said he was confident Debenhams' momentum in like-for-like sales growth would continue this year. \"The market isn't growing, it's about stealing market share if we're going to grow. I'm optimistic.\"",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers looking for goose, venison and fine wines might usually be found in the aisles of Waitrose, but this year the discount chain Aldi offered all of the above at its trademark rock-bottom prices. The strategy was a success and Aldi watched sales shoot up by more than 30% in the 12 weeks up to Christmas, driving its share of the groceries market to an all-time high of 3.2%. Figures from the market researchers Kantar Worldpanel revealed the extent of Britain's polarised groceries market this Christmas, with the high-end supermarket Waitrose and discount chains, such as Aldi, Lidl and Iceland, all enjoying strong growth. Discount stores usually suffer at Christmas as shoppers treat themselves and trade up, but 2012 was an exception, which Kantar said was a \"sign of the times\". Sales at Lidl grew by 11%, while Iceland enjoyed growth of 10%. Kantar's Fraser McKevitt said: \"Discounters have had a good long run with the prevailing economic winds over the last four or five years. They've tended to grow by adding shoppers but we're now seeing the average basket size grow. People are seeing them as a viable alternative to a full-trolley shop.\" At the same time, sales at Waitrose jumped by 5.4%. McKevitt said: \"There's always a space for premium at Christmas. Premium is typified by Waitrose.\" He said the chain had been boosted by opening new stores. \"When they build the stores, there are always people willing to shop at Waitrose.\" The figures highlighted growing divisions in Britain between the rich and the poor. Kantar said the country was divided down the middle, with 47% of shoppers tightening their belts in the run-up to Christmas, while 48% increased spending by 4.5%, in line with inflation. McKevitt said: \"Although the economy is very hard for some people, there are a substantial group of people, particularly in the south of England where Waitrose is strong, who are not suffering to the same degree and are able to continue spending on grocery.\" Of the big four supermarkets, only Morrisons saw a decline in sales, which the company blamed on its lack of an online store. As a result, Morrisons watched its share of spending in the 12 weeks leading up to Christmas fall from 12.4% in 2011 to just 12% last year. Sainsbury's was the only big player that managed to boost market share compared with the previous year, inching up by 0.1% to 17.1%. It is, however, still trailing Asda and Tesco, which dominates the field, with 30.5% of the market. Kantar Worldpanel said: \"Tesco's share has dipped slightly, however this is an improvement on the performance seen throughout 2012, suggesting that festive shoppers gave the retailer a welcome boost in the run-up to Christmas.\"",

      "bodyText": "Persistent economic weakness is sapping the ability of governments to tackle the growing threat of climate change and risks a global \"perfect storm\" of intertwined financial and ecological collapse, the World Economic Forum has warned. In the runup to its annual meeting in Davos this month, the WEF used its annual Global Risks report to urge policy leaders to step up efforts to tackle the three big dangers cited by a panel of 1,000 experts: severe income disparities, the indebted state of governments and rising greenhouse gas emissions. \"These global risks are essentially a health warning regarding our most critical systems,\" said Lee Howell, the report's editor. \"National resilience to global risks needs to be a priority so that critical systems continue to function despite a major disturbance.\" The report showed that for the second year running, the widening income gap, chronic fiscal imbalances and greenhouse gas emissions were seen as the three most likely threats to emerge over the coming decade. Of those risks considered likely to have the biggest impact on the global community, a major systemic financial failure and a water supply crisis were again deemed to be the most serious, followed by chronic fiscal imbalances, food shortages and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Howell said the fact that the key risks in 2013 were the same as they had been in 2012 reflected a sense that policymakers were failing to get to grips with the threats. \"There is a feeling that we are not making progress\", he said at the launch of the report in London. \"We are not seeing the state leadership necessary to tackle these risks.\" While praising the attempts by countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and China to improve their resilience, the WEF said the immediate challenge of coping with economic problems was making governments reluctant to address the long-term threat of climate change. \"Continued stress on the global economic system is positioned to absorb the attention of leaders for the foreseeable future,\" the report said. \"Meanwhile, the Earth's environmental system is simultaneously coming under increasing stress. Future simultaneous shocks to both systems could trigger the 'perfect global storm' with potentially insurmountable consequences. \"On the economic front, global resilience is being tested by bold monetary and austere fiscal policies. On the environmental front, the Earth's resilience is being tested by rising global temperatures and extreme weather events that are likely to become more frequent and severe. A sudden and massive collapse on one front is certain to doom the other's chances of developing an effective, long-term solution.\" Each year, the WEF asks its panel of experts to compile a list of the 50 key risks. The 2013 study showed how views had changed since the start of the global financial crisis in mid 2007. At the start of that year, the five risks most frequently cited were a breakdown of critical information infrastructure, chronic disease in developed countries, an oil price shock, a hard landing in China and an asset price collapse. The five risks deemed likely to have the biggest impact were an asset price collapse, retrenchment from globalisation, interstate and civil wars, pandemics and an oil price shock. Social media threat The report cited two other causes for global concern: a false sense of security over health and digital wildfires. \"Huge strides forward in health have left the world dangerously complacent. Rising resistance to antibiotics could push overburdened health systems to the brink, while a hyperconnected world allows pandemics to spread,\" the WEF said. It added that the internet could be the source of global panic. \"Social media allows information to spread around the world at breakneck speed in an open system where norms and rules are starting to emerge but have not yet been defined. While the benefits of our hyperconnected communication systems are undisputed, they could potentially enable the viral spread of information that is intentionally or unintentionally misleading or provocative.\"",

In what was described by retail analysts as \"a flat end to a flat year\", industry figures reveal that sales in the key trading month edged up only 0.3% on a like-for-like basis from December 2011, when they had risen 2.2% on the preceding year despite the challenges of the snowy weather. Total sales across food and non-food rose by 1.5%, against a 4.1% rise in December 2011. But in-store sales \"turned negative\" and fell once online sales were stripped out, the British Retail Consortium said. Online sales shot up by 17.8% \u2013 the fastest rate for a year \u2013 as shoppers with smartphones and tablets took advantage of more sophisticated websites and increasingly popular \"click-and-collect\" services. The closely scrutinised figures are being published by the industry on Tuesday in the British Retail Consortium-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor for December 2012, based on core data supplied by BRC members, which comprise some 80% of the UK retail sector.

Despite mild, albeit wet, weather for the whole of the last quarter and an extra full weekend immediately prior to Christmas, the final quarter saw total sales rise only 1.5% on the previous year and like-for-likes rise by only 0.2% \u2013 both rises lower than inflation. \"January will be a tough month for retailers as consumers face up to their credit card bills after Christmas, and it's likely 2013 will bring more of the same challenges. There will be no boom and it is likely more than a few will go bust.\" Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive of IGD, said: \"The focus on eating and drinking over the festive period helped retain the week leading up to Christmas as the biggest of the year, in terms of food and grocery sales. But taken as a whole, December's performance was relatively flat. Yet again shoppers left it even later than the previous year to do their Christmas grocery shopping, with a strong final two weeks offsetting a slow start to the month.\" The challenging conditions would continue into this year, she added: \"Our ShopperVista research shows that over half of shoppers (51%) are aiming to save money on their grocery shopping over the next six months. This figures rises to 67% of families with teenagers.\" Dickinson added: \"Retailers will be hoping that a continuing boost from post-Christmas sales events strengthens January's figures but, unfortunately, there are few signs that their sense of 'running fast to stand still' is likely to ease off any time soon.\"",

      "bodyText": "The managing director of British Gas is set to leave the business with a pension pot, shares and basic salary worth more than \u00a310m, amid public and political disquiet over soaring household bills. Phil Bentley, who oversaw a 6% increase in bills this winter, is expected to confirm that he is stepping down this year. He is believed to harbour ambitions to become a company chief executive in his own right. According to the annual report of Centrica, the parent of British Gas, Bentley has an interest in just under 2m Centrica shares, worth \u00a36.65m at closing share price. The 53-year-old executive is also expected to depart with a year's basic salary, which came to \u00a3635,000 in 2011, along with his \u00a33.6m pension pot. Bentley's imminent departure comes amid mounting political pressure on the government to tackle rising household bills. A poll of 2,000 people by Onepoll for Ovo Energy last month revealed that more than one third of homes are rationing power. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to force energy companies to offer the lowest possible tariff to customers, a vow that triggered confusion among political colleagues at first but will now see energy companies limited to four tariffs each for electricity and gas. British Gas is a lightning rod for criticism over rising household bills, as the provider of energy to 15.8 million customers. According to estimates, every 1% increase in energy prices pushes about 40,000 households into fuel poverty \u2013 defined as when consumers spend more than 10% of their income on heating. According to one estimate, there are 2.7m fuel-poor homes in England alone. Centrica and its peers in the \"big six\" group of energy companies argue that bills are being pushed up by the cost of upgrading the UK's gas and electricity grids, rising wholesale gas costs and levies imposed on energy companies to pay for low-carbon alternatives. The energy bill, published last month, promises further increases in fuel charges throughout the rest of the decade. It will allow energy companies to charge households an extra \u00a37.6bn to pay for low-carbon electricity infrastructure. The committee on climate change, which advises the government on reaching emissions targets, estimates that the new charges will add \u00a3110 to the average household bill by 2020. Bentley joined Centrica as finance director in 2000 and was handed his British Gas role in 2007. Centrica declined to comment on Bentley's imminent departure. Centrica, which also owns power stations and has a significant presence in North Sea oil and gas production, is due to announce the outcome of a strategic review alongside annual results next month. Those figures are expected to see Centrica declare after-tax profits of about \u00a31.4bn, with British Gas forecast to produce a profit of \u00a3575m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain is sliding into a triple-dip recession have been rejected by a leading business group as it reported a pickup in jobs, investment and activity in both the manufacturing and services sectors. The quarterly report from the British Chambers of Commerce found that economic conditions were more favourable in the final three months of 2012 than in the previous three months, and said the next two years would show modest growth. Despite remaining weak, business confidence had shown a marked improvement towards the end of 2012, the BCC said, although the poll of nearly 8,000 firms revealed a cautious approach to major investment spending. David Kern, the BCC's chief economist, said: \"These results show welcome progress compared with the third quarter, but many balances are still weak by historical standards. For both manufacturing and services, almost all the key balances are stronger than in the third quarter, but domestic balances remain well below their pre-recession levels in 2007. \"The marked increase in confidence in both sectors reinforces our view that the economy will record modest positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2012. Fears that the economy returned to negative growth in the fourth quarter are not supported by our survey. Plans to raise prices are higher, notably in manufacturing, but it is questionable whether price hikes can be carried out in the face of weak demand.\" The Bank of England expects the economy to contract in the fourth quarter of 2012 following its Olympic-boosted 0.9% expansion between July and September. Gloomy surveys of the construction and services sectors last week by the CIPS and Markit heightened concerns that a fresh period of decline is in store for the UK. But the BCC said its study showed the resilience of business, with all the key balances showing an improvement in the fourth quarter. Activity in the service sector was at its strongest for two and a half years, while service sector exports were back to pre-recession levels last seen in the autumn of 2007. Bigger companies with workforces of more than 500 people performed more strongly than small and medium-sized companies. Commenting on the results, John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: \"Our survey results show the economy is making progress, despite the numerous challenges it has faced. Although the improvements we have seen are slight, it is progress nonetheless, and highlights the determination and ability of the businesses we have here in the UK. Despite rising business confidence that the outlook will improve, it is clear that economic growth remains weak and nurturing it must be a top priority. \"The UK economy will continue to face major obstacles as we head into 2013, and every effort must be made to kickstart growth. Politicians can make a difference to our economic success, as they have the power to deliver bold and imaginative measures that will drive growth. The question is whether they have the guts to do it.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Supermarket chain Morrisons said it is considering the launch of an online grocery store, after it was left behind at Christmas as shoppers abandoned the weekly trek to its stores in favour of home delivery from its rivals. The Bradford-based grocer said like-for-like sales dropped 2.5% in the six weeks to 30 December. It is likely to be the worst performance of the large supermarket groups and analysts said Morrisons only managed to avoid a profits warning by heavily trailing its weak sales. Its results come against a backdrop of stagnant growth in retail sales across the UK. The British Retail Consortium and KPMG said like-for-like sales inched up by just 0.3% in December, compared with the same month the previous year. Store sales actually fell once healthier online sales were stripped out - the first Christmas since 2008 that this has happened. In December 2011 sales were ahead 2.2%, even given the challenges of snowy weather. Online sales shot up by 17.8% - the fastest rate for a year - as shoppers with smartphones and tablets took advantage of more sophisticated websites and increasingly popular 'click and collect' services. Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC, said: \"Against the relentlessly tough economic backdrop and low expectations, these results are not a cause for celebration, but not a disaster either. This rather underwhelming result brings a year of minimal sales growth to a close.\" Morrisons has been hit by a combination of hard-up shoppers being tempted away by discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, while its more affluent customers are shopping online. The grocer is also behind its rivals opening convenience stores, which are proving increasingly popular. Its chief executive, Dalton Philips, said the weak trading over Christmas underlined the need to improve its online offering, convenience stores and promotional activity. He said the company was seriously considering the launch of an online grocery store and that he would provide further details at the full-year results in March. \"We are looking very closely at it; we like what we have seen so far.\" Philips insisted Morrisons had not missed the boat. \"This is a market where for 12 years people haven't made any money. We're not too late to the party. It's still only 5% of the market, but it is growing very quickly. In some cases, there are last-mover advantages.\" He noted that online shopping grew by 20% last year, while sales at small, local stores was 6% higher. Morrisons is expanding into convenience stores and has opened 12 \"M Local\" shops. The company is also pinning hopes on an advertising tie-up with TV duo Ant &amp; Dec to revive its fortunes, after admitting its promotional activity failed to win customers. Shoppers have seen their budgets squeezed this year as pay has failed to keep up with inflation, and Philips said they continued to tighten their belts over the festive period. \"People were mindful of what was going in the basket. You've got the emergence of this very savvy shopper, always looking around for the lowest-priced items. If that means discount stores, they will go there.\" Even within this challenging market, however, Morrisons said trading was \"disappointing\" and Philips admitted sales were lower than anticipated. The company did not, however, issue a profits warning \u2013 which some analysts had predicted \u2013 saying it expects full-year performance to stay in line with forecasts. Analysts are targeting underlying profits of \u00a3913m for the year to February. Philip Dorgan of Panmure Gordon said: \"This trading statement is grim, but there is no direct profit warning, in part because consensus (the profits expected by City analysts) continues to fall.\" He expects analysts to slash profit forecasts for 2014 and 2015 \u2013 by 15% and 20% respectively \u2013 as sales decline and Morrisons is forced to invest in online and convenience stores. \"We would have preferred this issue to have been addressed today, which would then allow management to focus on fixing its business, rather than defending an unsustainable level of profit.\" Philips said market conditions were likely to remain difficult throughout 2013. That echoed the view of the BRC and KPMG, which forecast another challenging year for the sector.",

Analysts are targeting underlying profits of \u00a3913m for the year to February.</p> <p>Philip Dorgan of Panmure Gordon said: \"This trading statement is grim, but there is no direct profit warning, in part because consensus (the profits expected by City analysts) continues to fall.\" He expects analysts to slash profit forecasts for 2014 and 2015 \u2013 by 15% and 20% respectively \u2013 as sales decline and Morrisons is forced to invest in online and convenience stores. \"We would have preferred this issue to have been addressed today, which would then allow management to focus on fixing its business, rather than defending an unsustainable level of profit.\"</p> <p>Philips said market conditions were likely to remain difficult throughout 2013. That echoed the view of the BRC and KPMG, which forecast another challenging year for the sector.</p>",
