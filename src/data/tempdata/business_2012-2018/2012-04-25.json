Amtico is a manufacturing business that continues to benefit from retailers, despite the sector's ongoing UK woes. The Coventry-based flooring manufacturer counts shops from Germany to the US among its biggest clients and its home market remains strong. \"It is looking fine,\" says Jonathan Duck, Amtico's chief executive. While construction has suffered in the UK over the past three months, Amtico has benefited from refurbishment orders from retailers, offices and hospitals. \"Most of it is remodelling and refurbishment. If you are largely in the new-build sector things might look a little different, because that has been depressed.\"</p> <p>Amtico's floor tiles can last 25 years in a well-trodden environment, underlining the company's appeal at a time when capital expenditure has to endure and the path to recovery grows ever longer.

It has also repatriated some manufacturing from China after whittling down costs.</p> <p>Duck says there are many more companies that have outperformed the wider economy. \"There are lots of people like us out there who are succeeding.But the issue is that when you have government spending accounting for 50% of the economy, and that is being reduced, you are going to hear squeals.\"</p> <p>He admits, however, that doom and gloom will have an impact. \"It is a confidence game.

Analysts said that Sports Direct was gradually shedding its image as a pile-it-high-sell-it-cheap retailer thanks to the introduction of premium brands and a focus on gaining a foothold in specialist categories such as running. \"The predominant driver of Sports Direct's performance of the last couple years has been its ability to foster a dynamic and emotionally engaged workforce,\" said Joseph Robinson, retail analyst at Conlumino, who added that although the Ashley scheme \"runs contrary to current corporate sentiment\" it required the retailer to hit ambitious targets. Ashley floated the firm at 300p in 2007 but the shares have never broken through the original float price. They have climbed more than 40% in the last year and closed up more than 2% at 291p yesterday. If they break through 300p, City analysts believe that will spur Ashley to reduce his holding to around 52%.",

      "bodyText": "Manufacturers recovered their poise in the first three months of the year after a panicky period before Christmas when the euro crisis hit exports and paralysed much of industy, according to a CBI survey. Figures showing modest growth amid a general recovery in optimism for the rest of the year boosted hopes that the recession will prove short-lived. But the CBI said there was still the potential for further shocks that could knock confidence and growth. Ian McCafferty, the business lobby group's chief economic adviser, said sentiment had risen for only the first time in a year and remained fragile. \"Given Europe is still our biggest export market, the outlook for UK manufacturing will remain uncertain until the eurozone crisis is resolved.\" A further rise in oil prices could also dent the sector's new found confidence, he said. The CBI backs the government's austerity programme and is one of the key groups supporting the Treasury's refusal to change course. McCafferty said the international money markets were only prepared to lend UK businesses at historically low interest rates while the government maintained its commitment to cut public spending. He expressed surprise that official figures put Britain back in recession after evidence from its own survey and the monthly surveys of purchasing managers painted a more positive picture. He said the CBI survey pointed to a 0.1% rise in output compared with the 0.1% contraction in manufacturing in the ONS's preliminary figures. A balance of 8% of manufacturers said orders rose in the three months to April, up from minus 15 when they were last asked in January, the CBI said. Levels of optimism rose for the first time in a year and were at their highest for two years, while the reading reflecting intentions to invest in plant and machinery was at its strongest since 1997. The more optimistic tone in the CBI survey contrasted with official figures that revealed manufacturing failed to return to growth in the first quarter of 2012 and contributed to the UK's slide back into recession. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, was upbeat, saying the sector appeared \"healthy overall, with orders at a decent level compared to long-term trends and near-term production expectations upbeat\". He said: \"The survey also contained a number of encouraging elements with a substantial pick up in optimism over the general business situation and markedly high investment intentions in plant and machinery.\" But he also added a note of caution. \"The sector clearly still faces significant challenges.

      "bodyText": "Calling David Cameron a moron is a talking point. And I suppose that is what Business Insider, the US news website, wanted when it reported the prime minister's comments at Question Time as representing \"the height of idiocy\". Staff writer Joe Weisenthal, choking on his morning muesli, accused Cameron of sounding like a moron when he said Britain's low interest rates demonstrate it has credibility. \"OMG! Your economy is going into a double-dip recession! That's why your government borrowing rates are plunging. It's got nothing to do with 'credibility'. It's the fact that when your economy is going down the tubes, there's nothing appealing to invest in, and so they just park their cash in risk-free government debt,\" he wrote on Wednesday afternoon after Cameron was mauled by opposition MPs over the economy and the Leveson inquiry. \"Low rates in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, are the surest signals of long-term decline. What on earth are you bragging about?,\" he added. Weisenthal's point is that repeating the austerity mantra has \"rotted the minds of leaders\" across the eurozone and rightwingers in the US. Investors would prefer to put their money into the private sector where the potential for growth is higher. But in a mixed portfolio of investments, better to put that money into Indonesian logging companies and keep rainy day cash in the European Central Bank, or its satellite ministries across the eurozone. Of course, everyone talks up the need for a growth strategy these days when in 2010 it was just austerity. But the talk is just that. There is no action.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You might have assumed that Royal Bank of Scotland's management had bigger things to worry about than the volatility of the bank's share price \u2013 like how to get the price permanently higher, as opposed to less frisky when viewed on a day-by-day basis. A 1-for-10 share consolidation is proposed and the rationale is set out in the shareholder circular ahead of next month's annual meeting: \"The company currently has a very large number of issued ordinary shares and at the current level small absolute movements in the share price result in large percentage movements resulting in considerable volatility. The board believes that the share sub-division and consolidation will result in a share price and nominal value more appropriate for a company of RBS's size in the UK market and may assist in reducing volatility, thereby enabling a more consistent valuation of the company.\" The thinking here seems hopeful at best. If RBS shares were reduced in number so a 23.5p market price became 235p, it's impossible to know whether they would jump around less. There are too many other forces at play. Indeed, the main reasons for the daily volatility in RBS's shares are probably these. First, all bank stocks are volatile, especially those with big, leveraged balance sheets at a time of strain in the European banking system. Second, 82% of RBS is owned by the government, making the \"free float\" of shares available for daily trading relatively small.

But, come on, there are far bigger hurdles to leap before RBS can be described as vaguely normal. It has to make a profit again; it has to exit the government-sponsored asset protection scheme; and it has to pay a dividend.

The board believes that the share sub-division and consolidation will result in a share price and nominal value more appropriate for a company of RBS's size in the UK market and may assist in reducing volatility, thereby enabling a more consistent valuation of the company.\" </blockquote> <p>The thinking here seems hopeful at best.

First, all bank stocks are volatile, especially those with big, leveraged balance sheets at a time of strain in the European banking system.

Wednesday morning's latest figures for BAA's main assets \u2013 Heathrow and Stansted \u2013 contained one interesting admission: group net debt rose by 3.6% from \u00a310.4bn to \u00a310.8bn. </p> <p>As well as reflecting an ongoing capital expenditure programme at Heathrow \u2013 including a makeover for Terminal 2 \u2013 BAA says the increase is caused by \"restricted payments\" which include a \u00a360m dividend payment to BAA's shareholders, led by Spain's Ferrovial. BAA has not made a quarterly profit since it was acquired in 2006.</p> <p>Jose Leo, BAA's chief financial officer, admits that to the untrained eye it could look like BAA, which has not paid corporation tax in years, has borrowed even more to pay investors who leveraged up to the hilt when they bought the business in the first place. \"You can take the conclusion that we are paying dividends by leveraging the business. That is not exactly the case,\" says Leo. He adds that BAA is like many regulated businesses, such as utilities, in that it has positive cash flow (net cash flow of \u00a3250m in the quarter) but a demanding capital expenditure programme that runs at \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p>It means that in slow periods, such as the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year, it needs to turn to alternative sources of funding when the cash flow is not as vibrant as it is during peak spells. So, the quarterly dividend payment, part of a commitment to pay shareholders \u00a3240m a year, comes out of a revolving credit facility \u2013 a big overdraft \u2013 that allows BAA to borrow up to \u00a32.7bn.</p> <p>Does paying a sizeable dividend appear wise when you owe \u00a310bn and you haven't made a profit in years? As one analyst said this morning: \"Debt makes you vulnerable to events.\" Leo says things will change: \"We are making an underlying profit [ie adjusted Ebitda of \u00a3231.2m] and at some point in time that will become a headline profit.\" In the meantime, that dividend will jar many Heathrow passengers and airlines.</p>",

Jose Leo, BAA's chief financial officer, admits that to the untrained eye it could look like BAA, which has not paid corporation tax in years, has borrowed even more to pay investors who leveraged up to the hilt when they bought the business in the first place. \"You can take the conclusion that we are paying dividends by leveraging the business. That is not exactly the case,\" says Leo. He adds that BAA is like many regulated businesses, such as utilities, in that it has positive cash flow (net cash flow of \u00a3250m in the quarter) but a demanding capital expenditure programme that runs at \u00a31bn a year. It means that in slow periods, such as the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year, it needs to turn to alternative sources of funding when the cash flow is not as vibrant as it is during peak spells. So, the quarterly dividend payment, part of a commitment to pay shareholders \u00a3240m a year, comes out of a revolving credit facility \u2013 a big overdraft \u2013 that allows BAA to borrow up to \u00a32.7bn. Does paying a sizeable dividend appear wise when you owe \u00a310bn and you haven't made a profit in years? As one analyst said this morning: \"Debt makes you vulnerable to events.\" Leo says things will change: \"We are making an underlying profit [ie adjusted Ebitda of \u00a3231.2m] and at some point in time that will become a headline profit.\" In the meantime, that dividend will jar many Heathrow passengers and airlines.",

A similar situation occurred in late 2009, when the PMI surveys indicated that the recession ended in the third quarter. The good news was soon shattered by the initial release GDP data for that period, which indicated a 0.4% contraction and ongoing recession. However, the ONS have since revised that figure and now estimate that GDP rose 0.2%, confirming the PMI's upbeat message of green shoots of recovery.</p> <p>As was the case three years ago, there is therefore a worry is that by heralding a double-dip recession, misleading, gloomy official data shatter the revival of consumer and business confidence seen so far this year, and could even drive the economy back into a real recession.</p> <h2>David Miller, partner at Cheviot Asset Management<br></h2> <p>Investors have been looking to the GDP figures coming up this week as their fear is that should numbers be poor, we could be in for a repeat of July and August last year when the markets sold off.

The MPC's room for manoeuvre has temporarily been curtailed by higher than expected inflation so investors are on their own for the moment.</p> <p>Overall, the next couple of months will be tricky for investors. Central banks around the world have adopted a more hawkish stance at least until mid-year so we can't expect help in the form of QE. But we must remember that despite the bad growth figures today, they are nowhere near as bad as those in the eurozone. The UK has benefitted from a weaker pound and control of monetary policy (QE).</p> <h2>James Knightley, UK economist at ING<br></h2> <p>We had been hoping that the service sector numbers would be better, but in the end they grew by only 0.1%. The one consolation we would make is that the official activity numbers for January and February were poor, but there had been better figures for March.</p> <p>Furthermore, business surveys have indicated that the UK has experienced something of a revival after contracting in the fourth quarter of 2011. Indeed, the British Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey suggested the economy grew by around 0.3% in the first quarter of 2012 while purchasing managers' indices are at levels historically consistent with GDP growth coming in close to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter.

He indicated that looking at the business surveys may provide a truer picture of the state of the UK economy than the official measure of GDP, which suggests he will not be overly concerned by a disappointing GDP reading. The fact Adam Posen has become far less negative on the UK's prospects suggests he takes a similar view to Tucker.

But the one saviour for the UK right now is that the markets back it.</p> <p>If the markets moved against us as they have Spain and Italy, we would be in a whole lot more trouble. Paradoxically, being technically back in recession could be a good thing as it will force policymakers and government to address the fundamental issues affecting the economy with more urgency. Something needs to be done, and it needs to be done quickly.</p> <h2>Vicky Redwood, senior UK economist at Capital Economics<br></h2> <p>The UK's back in recession. The 0.2% contraction in GDP in Q1 contrasted with expectations for a small gain and meant that output dropped by 0.5% over Q4 and Q1 together. Admittedly, the fall was driven by a sharp fall in construction output and there are question marks over the reliability of these numbers. That said, the drop in construction was smaller than anticipated and even without this, output would have done no better than stagnate. The main disappointment was the meagre 0.1% rise in services output in Q1 \u2013 the surveys had pointed to services growth of 0.5% or more. Admittedly, the MPC indicated at its recent meeting that it will be putting greater weight on the more upbeat business surveys. But we would not dismiss today's figures so readily. And even if the underlying picture is stronger than the official GDP figures show, there is no guarantee that the recent pickup will continue. Indeed, we remain comfortable with our view that GDP will contract by about 0.5% this year.</p>",

Output is more than 4% below its peak in early 2008, living standards are falling and there is no sign whatsoever of the much-heralded rebalancing of the economy. City analysts, once again caught on the hop by the dismal growth figures, will no doubt make the point that the main reason behind the 0.2% contraction in the first quarter was the performance of the construction sector, where the figures are notoriously prone to revision. It could well be that fresh data over the coming months will see growth revised up and no double-dip recession after all. But this GDP announcement will be big news; any positive changes later will not be. The damage has been done.",
