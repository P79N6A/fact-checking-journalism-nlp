      "bodyText": "Almost all of Britain\u2019s homes and businesses would be powered by wind, solar and nuclear power by 2030, under bold new green energy plans being outlined by Labour. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, will declare on Tuesday that the party is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century. The UK\u2019s current goal is an 80% cut by 2050. Such a move would put the UK ahead of the EU and signal that it intends to be a strong international climate leader post-Brexit. It would also leapfrog Labour ahead of the Conservatives on climate-change action. The government is shortly expected to instruct its climate advisers to explore what a tougher global-warming goal means for the UK\u2019s domestic carbon targets but has not yet pledged to hit zero emissions. Long-Bailey, who is seen by some as a potential future leader, will also outline a series of new proposals on energy to meet the long-term carbon goal. Experts said they were far more ambitious than the party\u2019s current policy. The plan envisages 85% of electricity coming from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030, a dramatic increase on the 50% they provide today. That would involve a sevenfold increase in offshore windfarms and a tripling of solar power, enabling nearly 20m homes to be powered by wind and solar. The party would also \u201cremove the barriers\u201d the Conservatives put in place for onshore windfarms. Labour would like to see doubling of onshore windfarms by 2030. Long-Bailey said: \u201cThe potential benefits of transitioning to a sustainable economy are enormous and we want to make sure these are shared by everyone \u2026 the Tories are not up to the job of dealing with the existential threat posed by climate change.\u201d Beyond electricity, the party is also grappling with how to keep the UK warm without burning fossil fuels. Around 85% of the country uses gas for heating, with most of the rest coming from oil and a tiny proportion from renewable sources such as heat pumps and biomass. Labour is mulling a goal of providing 44% of heat from renewable sources by 2030 and reducing heat demand from buildings by almost a quarter. The party is expected to officially adopt the energy goals later this year. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: \u201cThese proposals are envisaging a much more ambitious approach than current policy. With respect to renewable electricity, particularly wind, the ambitions look achievable by 2030.\u201d Industry sources told the Guardian that the proposals for more green electricity were ambitious but could be met provided there was a rethink on onshore windfarms, which are currently ineligible for subsidies. However, Watson said that meeting the targets on low-carbon heat would be more difficult and \u201ca tall order\u201d. Greenpeace said the adoption of a net-zero emissions goal for 2050 was \u201ctruly transformative\u201d. Friends of the Earth said the energy proposals could help the UK seize the potential of \u201chuge innovations happening in renewable energy technology.\u201d Labour said it had created a working group with unions to \u201censure workers are protected\u201d as the energy industry shifts from fossil-fuel power stations to a renewable future.",

      "bodyText": "Big business has predictably grumbled about John McDonnell\u2019s plan that every company with 250 or more employees should create an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d that will eventually own 10% of the firm\u2019s equity. But workers themselves may also have a few questions. One can understand the bald arithmetic that allows the shadow chancellor to say almost 11 million workers \u201ccould be \u00a3500 a year better off\u201d but, come on, his model is not employee share ownership as the rest of the world understands the term. First, why cap dividends per employee at \u00a3500 a year? Last year Lloyds Banking Group paid \u00a32.2bn to shareholders (ignoring the \u00a31bn share buy-back), which would have meant \u00a3220m for workers if their ownership fund had been at full size. Lloyds had 68,000 full-time equivalent employees on the last day of 2017, implying a shade over \u00a33,200 per head for staff in dividends. But, under McDonnell\u2019s plan, the annual maximum would be \u00a3500 per employee. The bulk \u2013 slightly more than \u00a32,700 per employee, or about \u00a3185m \u2013 would go to Treasury coffers. That looks more like a dividend tax than a gain for lower-paid Lloyds staff. Second, what\u2019s to stop employers trying to suppress wages to compensate for the cost of the new shares? From companies\u2019 point of view, issuing equity is not free. The more shares that are issued, the more earnings per share are diluted. If, say, Marks &amp; Spencer, a company worth \u00a34.6bn, is obliged to issue 1% of its equity to its staff every year for a decade, that\u2019s an annual \u00a346m extra cost at current share prices. Why wouldn\u2019t management attempt to make payroll or pension savings? M&amp;S might argue it is in a life-or-death struggle with Amazon, a US titan beyond McDonnell\u2019s influence. Third, what happens to share-owning employees at companies Labour wants to nationalise? Royal Mail gave free shares to staff at privatisation in 2013 and a full-time postal worker who has continued to hold the stake now owns 913 shares, worth \u00a34,410 at current prices, and has received \u00a3850 in dividend income before tax, according to the company\u2019s calculations. Would that all be swept away under 100% public ownership? One assumes so. The final point is more basic. In what sense do you \u201cown\u201d a share if you\u2019re not allowed to sell it? \u201cThe shares will be held and managed collectively by the workers,\u201d McDonnell said. So, unlike at Royal Mail currently, workers could not liquidate their slice and spend the proceeds as they wish. And all rights to dividends would end at retirement, presumably. So it\u2019s a really a time-limited and capped entitlement to a share of distributions. That\u2019s better than nothing \u2013 but it\u2019s not true share ownership. The shame is that McDonnell starts from the correct analysis that workers deserve more of the wealth created by companies. And, yes, there is evidence to suggest employee ownership is good for productivity. The cause is excellent. It\u2019s just that his model, with arbitrary caps on dividends and no rights to sell, is too complicated. What\u2019s wrong with giving tax breaks to companies to run improved individual share ownership schemes? And it would be a double shame if McDonnell ends up undermining the more important push to get workers on boards. That battle is worth fighting on its own merits, not least to start to address gross inequalities in pay. A poorly-designed dividend-participation scheme risks confusing two separate issues. Sky tale a useful reminder for boards Before Sky disappears into the US group Comcast at \u00a317.28 a share, let\u2019s recall the days when the UK broadcaster\u2019s independent directors judged that outside shareholders should be grateful the Murdochs had showed up with an offer of \u00a310.75 a pop. That was December 2016. A lot has happened since then, admittedly, but the independents\u2019 assessment of value has not stood the test of time. In mitigation, one could say the stock market was gloomy on Sky at the end of 2016, which was why the share price had sunk to 769p. Nor had Sky at the time won the next collection of Premier League rights. Nor, obviously, had Comcast injected competitive tension into proceedings \u2013 tension that was only resolved with last weekend\u2019s shootout. But even in 2016, the Murdochs\u2019 advance looked opportunistic since the share price had been \u00a311 in April of that year and nothing had fundamentally changed in day-to-day operations. The tale is a useful reminder that boards should not always be dazzled by the superficial attraction of a bid at 40% above the market price. Sometimes you can say no, even to the biggest shareholder. Sometimes it\u2019s better to wait for more \u2013 a lot more, a 125% premium, in this case.",

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s financial watchdog has ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money-laundering and \u201cterrorist financing,\u201d and has appointed an independent auditor to assess progress. The regulator, BaFin, said on Monday that this was the first time it had made such an appointment related to money-laundering. The move comes as European regulators step up their scrutiny of banks\u2019 dealings with their customers following a series of scandals. The head of Danske Bank, Denmark\u2019s biggest, resigned last week after an investigation showed that many of the \u20ac200bn (\u00a3180bn) of payments through its small Estonian branch were suspicious. Last year, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 (\u00a3530m) for allowing money-laundering. Germany\u2019s biggest bank said in a statement that it agreed with BaFin it needed to improve its processes to properly identify clients. \u201cWe have the strong commitment to operate within regulatory-compliant practices for the identification of our clients,\u201d Deutsche Bank said. Neither BaFin nor Deutsche Bank gave details of the new measures the bank would adopt. No new scandal or case triggered BaFin\u2019s move, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. In August, Reuters reported that Deutsche Bank had uncovered further shortcomings in its ability to fully identify clients and the source of their wealth. BaFin said it had appointed KPMG as its special representative for a three-year period to assess Deutsche Bank\u2019s progress. The intervention is another blow to the reputation of one of Europe\u2019s biggest banking names. Deutsche Bank has made management changes and announced a strategic overhaul that includes thousands of job cuts and scaling back its global investment bank as it battles to recover from three consecutive years of losses. In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay US and British regulators $630m in fines over artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that authorities said were used to launder $10bn out of Russia. The US Federal Reserve fined the bank an additional $41m in May 2017 for failing to ensure its systems would detect money-laundering.",

      "bodyText": "How quickly it all turns. Gone are the housing-boom articles; barely even countenanced are the housing slowdown pieces; now we\u2019re in full get ready for a housing crash hot takes. With banks raising interest rates and housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne falling, is it time to worry about a crash? Or should we all just take a deep breath? The news from the ABS last week on residential housing prices only served to confirm what everyone knew \u2013 the Sydney market has turned very cold and Melbourne is also slowing quickly. The latest residential property price index data showed house price in Sydney in the June quarter fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. Sydney prices were down 1.2% in the quarter, while Melbourne prices were down 0.8% \u2013 its second consecutive quarterly fall: The annual growth figures were just as stark for Sydney. Over the 12 months to June, Sydney residential prices were down 3.9% \u2013 the sharpest fall since the GFC days in 2009. The other capital cities except Perth and Darwin are all still in positive territory, but Darwin is a small and unique market, and Perth is actually getting better (or more accurately, not getting worse as fast): It\u2019s a reminder that when we talk about the housing boom and possible burst, we\u2019re really talking about Sydney and Melbourne. Yes, it could infect other markets, but since the RBA began cutting rates at the end of 2010, Sydney and then Melbourne have been the two cities that really took off: Now none of this is all that big of a surprise. For some time now I (and most other commentators and the RBA) have been predicting the end of the boom. The housing finance data has been pretty clear about the way in which the market is headed. Given that housing prices generally follow the path of housing finance, it would be very surprising to see any improvement in the national average of house prices anytime in the next six months: But does that mean the crash cometh? Clearly no one wants to be the one who laughs with derision at calls of a housing crash \u2013 such hubris means you might as well start casting who will play you in the role of \u201cdumb housing analyst\u201d in the 2020 sequel to The Big Short (I pick Ralph Fiennes to play me). But talk of a 40% fall in prices is, shall we say, fairly extreme. Put it this way, the Sydney housing market peaked in the middle of last year. Since then the most recent commercial data has the fall about 15% at most (and the ABS data which is three months old has it at just 4%). We have a way to go to get to 40%. The Perth market is one which gives us a very good example of bubbles bursting due to an economy hitting a wall. Perth is very much a boom-bust market. This century it has had three boom periods, and three busts. During the GFC in 2009 prices fell 8% from their peak. In 2011 they fell 7% (although in between there had been a 15% rise). And since the mining boom ended in 2014, prices have fallen by just under 10%: But remember, this last period of the Perth housing bust was also during a period where the unemployment rate in Western Australia went from 4.5% to 6.2% \u2013 completely out of step with the rest of the nation. So are Sydney and Melbourne immune? Obviously not, but something would need to very much go wrong in the broader economy of those states (and Australia itself) for a crash to occur. But you can understand why people are worried when you compare the median house price of Sydney and Melbourne to Perth. So great was the boom in Perth in the early years of the century that it was almost as expensive to buy a house there as in Sydney; now the median Sydney house price is almost double that of one in Perth: So there is a long way to fall. And the worry is that as interest rates go back to normal, things will get tight for borrowers. Certainly rising interest rates always bring with them tougher times for those paying a mortgage, but let us have some perspective. While banks are moving ahead of the RBA, the central bank itself is not looking like raising rates any time soon. The market, which just three months ago predicted a rate rise sometime towards the end of next year, now sees no move until well in 2020: And while housing prices have certainly increased since 2010, the average mortgage rate is now around 2.6% pts lower than it was in December of that year. If you had taken out an average size mortgage in New South Wales at that time your monthly repayments would be 24% lower than they were then \u2013 a drop from $2,443 a month to $1,863. But on the other side of the coin is that those who are looking to get into the market now are taking out a mortgage that is around 30% larger. That means even with lower interest rates your repayments are sizeable \u2013 in fact at $2,418 a month they are higher than were for those taking out a mortgage back in 2010 when interest rates were averaging 7.8% rather than the current 5.2%: But remember that over that time, even with weak wages growth the average male full-time earnings have risen 25%. So mortgage repayments as a percentage of male full-time earnings are lower now than in 2010: But even still they are at historically high levels and so it won\u2019t take much of an interest rate rise to start causing trouble. Should that be the case however, there is nothing stopping the RBA from cutting rather to counter any moves by the banks. And that is what we need to remember \u2013 the RBA and APRA are not unaware of the concerns, lending standards have been improved and despite record low rates, the RBA actually does have room to move \u2013 and so too does the government, given the rather nice recent boost in tax revenue. A crash is always possible, but right now it would require a confluence of events \u2013 both local and international for it to occur, rather than just banks increasing interest rates. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "How would Labour plan to give workers 10% stake in  big firms work?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour has proposed giving workers a stake of 10% in large companies. Each member of staff in those firms would receive as much as \u00a3500 per year in the form of dividends from employee ownership schemes. This policy would be one of the most radical shake-ups for British business in living memory. Here is a guide to the proposal and its ramifications. How would the policy work? Every company with more than 250 employees in Britain would be required to transfer shares into an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d that would be controlled by its workers. Firms would transfer at least 1% of ownership into the fund each year, up to a maximum 10%. The funds would cover 40% of the private-sector workforce, or 10.7 million people. Foreign-owned companies would not be included. The shares would be collectively controlled by the workers, who would have the same voting rights as other investors. Dividend payments up to \u00a3500 a year would go to staff, while any returns eligible for the fund above that level would go to the government. Labour estimates that total payments from these funds would reach \u00a34bn a year by the fifth year of the policy, with \u00a32.1bn going to the state and the rest shared among workers. Why is it needed? A fifth of workers earn less than \u00a315,000 and the average pay packet is still worth less today than in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. Like many advanced economies, there has been a long-term decline in the share of national income paid to workers in Britain. The flipside of the story is an increase in the share taken by asset owners (such as investors). This means that while wage growth has been slow, the money generated from owning something has increased. Labour\u2019s proposal attempts to restore the balance by giving workers a chance to tap some of the greater returns usually reserved for asset owners. Are there precedents? The Labour plan is radical and there are few international precedents. Sweden in the 1980s is one exception, when the socialist government taxed company profits and put the proceeds into funds controlled by trade unions. The funds were used to buy company shares, with the aim of gradually moving towards collective ownership. The scheme was dropped in the early 1990s. Many countries do, however, have higher levels of employee representation and ownership than the UK. Germany has a cooperative sector four times the size of Britain\u2019s, while there are rules forcing firms with more than 500 employees to have workers represented on their supervisory boards. France, Norway and Sweden all have similar rules around board-level employee representation. Some firms such as John Lewis and the Co-operative already operate forms of staff ownership and representation in Britain. Many large firms also already offer \u201csave as you earn\u201d schemes to staff wanting shares in the company they work for. What do British businesses think? Business lobby groups have branded the Labour proposal \u201cdraconian\u201d and warned of lost investment in the country. Because the policy would not work for foreign-owned firms, they warn it could encourage major British firms to move their stock exchange listing overseas. They also warn the complicated nature of the policy would encourage firms to seek loopholes in any employee ownership regime. Tom Ironside of the British Retail Consortium warned the policy could act as an indirect tax on companies, given that the proposed model would result in excess funds flowing to the Treasury.",

      "body": "<p>Labour has proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/labour-private-sector-employee-ownership-plan-john-mcdonnell\">giving workers a stake of 10% in large companies</a>. Each member of staff in those firms would receive as much as \u00a3500 per year in the form of dividends from employee ownership schemes. This policy would be one of the most radical shake-ups for British business in living memory. Here is a guide to the proposal and its ramifications.</p> <h2><strong>How would the policy work?</strong></h2> <p>Every company with more than 250 employees in Britain would be required to transfer shares into an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d that would be controlled by its workers. Firms would transfer at least 1% of ownership into the fund each year, up to a maximum 10%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/sep/24/john-mcdonnell-is-not-offering-workers-real-share-ownership\">John McDonnell is not offering workers real share ownership | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The funds would cover 40% of the private-sector workforce, or 10.7 million people. Foreign-owned companies would not be included. The shares would be collectively controlled by the workers, who would have the same voting rights as other investors.</p> <p>Dividend payments up to \u00a3500 a year would go to staff, while any returns eligible for the fund above that level would go to the government. Labour estimates that total payments from these funds would reach \u00a34bn a year by the fifth year of the policy, with \u00a32.1bn going to the state and the rest shared among workers.</p> <h2><strong>Why is it needed?</strong></h2> <p>A fifth of workers earn less than \u00a315,000 and the average pay packet is still worth less today than in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago.</p> <p>Like many advanced economies, there has been a long-term decline in the share of national income paid to workers in Britain. The flipside of the story is an increase in the share taken by asset owners (such as investors). This means that while wage growth has been slow, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/thomas-piketty-capital-surprise-bestseller\">the money generated from owning something has increased</a>.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s proposal attempts to restore the balance by giving workers a chance to tap some of the greater returns usually reserved for asset owners.</p> <h2><strong>Are there precedents?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0abf1df39ae9f6976b6aa3bca9ce386f642ac7a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0abf1df39ae9f6976b6aa3bca9ce386f642ac7a7/22_161_4327_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Lewis department store in Oxford  Street, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lewis department store in Oxford Street, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Labour plan is radical and there are few international precedents.

    "webTitle": "Pound bounces back as Raab talks up chances of Brexit deal  \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "So stock markets are down today amid heightened trade tensions between the US and China, as new tariffs kicked in. It\u2019s been a better day for the pound, which has risen 0.6% against the dollar to $1.3148 after Brexit secretary Dominic Raab expressed confidence that a deal with the EU could eventually be reached \u2013 although investors remain wary. Sterling tumbled two cents against the dollar on Friday, its biggest daily drop this year to a low of $1.3053, after Theresa May admitted talks had reached an impasse after the EU summit in Salzburg. This has put her leadership under mounting pressure ahead of the Tories\u2019 annual conference, which starts on Sunday in Birmingham. Oil prices have jumped today, after the Opec oil cartel resisted calls from Donald Trump to increase output to get prices down at the weekend. Looming US sanctions against Iran in November will restrict supply further. Brent crude is up 2.4% at $80.70 a barrel. Good-bye \u2013 we will be back tomorrow. Kate Swaine, partner at international law firm Gowling WLG says about the deal: It is interesting to witness the marriage of such distinct brands in order to create another multinational luxury goods conglomerate. Although Michael Kors already owns Jimmy Choo, the addition of Versace is a major expansion for the group. They are not yet on the scale of LVMH or Kering but clearly have ambitions to expand their reach in the luxury goods sector. As reported earlier, Versace, the Italian fashion house founded by Gianni Versace 40 years ago, has been sold to US handbag and clothing brand Michael Kors for $2bn (\u00a31.5bn), according to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. Donatella Versace, the brand\u2019s vice-president and artistic director, has called an all-staff meeting for Tuesday to announce the deal. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, says: That Michael Kors should court Versace is no great surprise. The American company has long desired to transform itself into a house of luxury brands, a process it started with last year\u2019s acquisition of Jimmy Choo. Versace comes with a much bigger price tag of $2.35 billion, almost double the $1.2bn price that Michael Kors paid for Jimmy Choo. However, it would also put a big-hitting brand with true global status into Michael Kors\u2019 stable. Other than the desire to become a bigger conglomerate, the rationale for buying another luxury label is perhaps less sound. In our view, while progress has been made, Michael Kors has not rebuilt its core brand to the same extent as other players like Coach: its offer is still confused and is nowhere near as rounded nor polished as many other luxury players. This shows up in the company\u2019s sales figures where growth has been driven by an upswing in US consumer sentiment and spending, rather than because the brand is generating much better traction. The choice of Versace is interesting. If the deal goes through it would certainly push the group into the big league in terms of its profile in the luxury space. It also means that the company would be a player in many different categories from fragrance to home to pets, thereby giving the group a true lifestyle position. However, it is also the case that despite its profile, Versace has struggled to grow sales. As such, Michael Kors is not buying a perfectly performing brand, it is buying a brand that needs work and some repositioning. As much as we believe Michael Kors past experience with its own brand will help it make the changes required, these shifts will cause short-term disruption and might mean that the true benefits from the acquisition will take a number of years to deliver through. We also believe that some of the work required on Versace, which includes toning down some of the brasher elements of the brand which are now out of step with the more subtle tone preferred by modern consumers, are precisely the issues with which Michael Kors has struggled and is yet to satisfactorily resolve. Wall Street has just opened. The Nasdaq is down 0.6% and the Dow Jones is 0.3% lower. Back to the US-China trade dispute, which has moved closer to becoming a global trade war with the implementation of the latest tariffs today. Geoffrey Yu, head of UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said: Today marks the latest step in the simmering US-China trade spat, as we see the Trump administration\u2019s new tariffs on an additional $200bn of Chinese exports take effect. This clearly represents a further escalation of the threat to China and its economy, and, especially considering that China has scrapped plans for further trade talks, we expect things will get worse before it gets better. As we inch further towards the precipice of a fully-fledged global trade war, financial markets will no doubt react swiftly, looking for further downside. However, the narrow focus on Sino-US relations is obscuring consideration of how an emerging trade tariff war could stimulate a fiscal drive from China. With a reasoned domestic response, what currently seems a damning situation could actually spark a re-orientation of China\u2019s economic model. Granted, the leadership will have to accept short-term sufferance, but over the medium- to long-term, we see the potential for positive surprises. Sterling has risen as much as 0.9% against the dollar to $1.3161, and 0.4% against the euro to 89.42p. Sterling has bounced 0.6% against the dollar today after Friday\u2019s sell-off, lifted by upbeat comments from Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. It\u2019s trading at $1.3158 at the moment, and is up 0.4% at 89.42 pence against the euro. Raab expressed confidence that a Brexit deal could be struck \u2013 but analysts said the comments were unlikely to support the pound for long. On Friday, sterling posted its biggest daily drop this year, falling as low as $1.3053, after Theresa May admitted that Brexit talks had reached an impasse, after a humiliating EU summit in Salzburg. Back to the CBI survey. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it suggests that the \u201cmodest stimulus to growth in production from sterling\u2019s depreciation is fading\u201d. The drop in the total orders balance was driven partly by a decline in the export orders balance to an 11-month low of +5, from +9 in July. Admittedly, growth in total orders is weakening from a high rate; the overall balance still is consistent with year-over-year growth in manufacturing output of about 2%. But the official manufacturing data has been much weaker than the surveys this year, with output falling by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q1 and by a further 0.9% in Q2. In addition, growth in export orders usually lags movements in sterling by about one year; the exchange rate\u2019s relative stability over the last year, therefore, has started to take the edge off growth in exports. Past form suggests that the export orders balance will fall to about -5 by the end of this year. Meanwhile, the chance that overseas customers re-jig their supply chains increases with every day that passes without a Brexit deal. As a result, we doubt that the manufacturing sector\u2019s recovery is about to get back on track. The Italian fashion house Versace could be sold \u201cwithin hours\u201d to Michael Kors, the US fashion group, according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The deal is expected to value Versace at $2bn. Blackstone, which owns a 20% stake, is selling its entire holding while the Versace family, which owns the rest of the company, will stay involved, Reuters reported. The fashion house was founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. In Germany, manufacturers have also become more gloomy, worrying over the US-Chinese trade tensions and the impasse in the Brexit negotiations. The Ifo survey, also out this morning, showed that business sentiment improved in all sectors apart from manufacturing. You can read the survey here. Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said: Despite the good mood, uncertainty is gradually growing among companies. The CBI industrial trends survey, of 409 firms, revealed that output growth slowed in the three months to September, but remained above the long-term average. Output expanded in 10 out of 17 sub-sectors, with growth driven mainly by the mechanical engineering, food, drink &amp; tobacco, plastic products, and metal products sectors. Despite the fall in orders, manufacturers expect output growth to pick up over the next three months. Leach added: Efforts on all sides must be geared towards securing the Withdrawal Agreement and - crucially - the transition period. This will provide temporary but essential relief for businesses of all sizes and sectors. Looking ahead to the Autumn Budget, business rate reform, coupled with movement on capital allowances, could help encourage productive investment against this uncertain backdrop. After the smaller-than-expected dip in German business morale, which analysts say points to solid economic growth in the third quarter, here in the UK factory orders weakened in September, according to an industry survey. The CBI\u2019s monthly factory orders balance fell to a four-month low of -1 from +7 in August, and its gauge of export orders hit its lowest level since last October. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, says: While manufacturing order books remain strong and output is still growing, Brexit uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook. Heightened fears of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit scenario have prompted some firms to move publicly from contingency planning to action. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, is also not impressed with the deal, describing it as an \u201codd move with a potential culture clash and a poor outcome for UK investors who don\u2019t want to hold overseas-listed shares\u201d. Randgold is an entrepreneurial business with a highly-respected boss in Mark Bristow. It has a track record of being able to succeed in difficult parts of the world and generating value for shareholders. The miner has never rushed into making acquisitions until they could clearly add value; it has always tried to generate additional value through exploration and has maintained a tight focus on cost control. Barrick is the exact opposite \u2013 it is a big corporate machine which has paid the price for making bold moves at the top of the commodities cycle, resulting in significant impairment charges on acquisitions and large debt levels. It has previously come under fire for excessive executive pay and shareholders have seen their value of their investment slowly dwindle away as the company failed to deliver strong returns from its asset base. UK shareholders are arguably being dealt a poor hand with the merger. It\u2019s also bad news for the London stock market, Mould argues. The London stock market listing is being cancelled and Barrick isn\u2019t paying any premium to combine the two companies. The London market overall is also being punished as it will lose its largest gold miner, leaving only one company of scale on the exchange, being silver and gold producer Fresnillo. Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s Barrick Gold has agreed to buy FTSE 100-listed Randgold Resources in a $18.3bn deal to create the world\u2019s largest gold company. Shares in Randgold are up 6% on the news to \u00a352.15, making it the second-biggest riser on the FTSE 100 after broadcaster Sky. The new company will be listed in New York and Toronto and will be run by Randgold boss Mark Bristow, while Barrick chairman John Thornton will chair the merged business. He said: Randgold has the agility and swift-footedness of a younger and smaller company, much like Barrick in its early years, While Barrick has the infrastructure and global reach of a large corporate company. However, some analysts were sceptical. Kieron Hodgson at Panmure said: Our opinion is that the proposed merger, instead of being based on merit, strength and strategic integration, is more akin to the proverbial \u2018two drunks supporting each other at closing time\u2019. The all-share deal values Randgold at \u00a34.58bn or \u00a348.5 a share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management says the 2% plus rise in oil prices is good news for smaller UK oil and gas companies. Should Brent crude continue to trade in a range between $70/barrel and $80/barrel the outcome looks good for smaller UK oil and gas companies. It will prove a boon for cash flows and forecasts as every extra dollar at that point goes straight through to cash flow. As well as taking the pressure off highly-geared companies, this would boost the value of reserves making it easier to obtain finance for exploration and development. However, even if Brent crude falls below this ideal and into the $60/barrel, many of these smaller companies will still remain quite profitable. The situation in the sector is very different to what it was during the last oil spike; companies have worked hard to get operational costs way down, and many have taken advantage of the sustained high price to lock-in a price for the immediate future. Whereas these companies were previously trading on razor margins and vulnerable to small falls, they are now far more resilient and can comfortably stomach falls all the way down to $60/barrel. Should Brent crude go south of $60/barrel, then we start to enter trouble and worry territory (although many will still remain profitable down to $50barrel). Conversely, should the price continue to rise above $80/barrel could be counterproductive in that it could cause an overcorrection, triggering volatility. All in all, however, so long as we are able to keep the price above $70/barrel, the outlook is very rosy. The trade tensions between the US and China are weighing on European stock markets. The Chinese, south Korean and Japanese markets are all closed for public holidays today, so Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index and the Australian stock market were the biggest losers in Asia. These are the latest moves in Europe: UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.2% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.4% France\u2019s CAC down 0.2% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.6% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.4% Oil prices have hit a four-year high after Opec declined to boost production at the weekend, despite Donald Trump\u2019s call for action. Brent crude, the global benchmark, hit their highest level since November 2014 this morning, rising more than $2, or 2.7%, to $80.94 a barrel. It is still up 2.4% at $80.70 a barrel. This has prompted some to forecast a spike to $90 or even $100 around the turn of the year. Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics, has taken a closer look at the German Ifo business confidence numbers. He noted that while the index dipped slightly in September, it remained well above its recent lows, although it is still some way off last year\u2019s highs. It is especially encouraging that firms\u2019 expectations only edged down to 101.0 from 101.2 after surging in August as we had worried that it might have been a one off. But it looks like the 6-month outlook has indeed brightened somewhat. At the same time, the assessment of the current situation was stable at 106.4, somewhat above the Q2 average meaning that the economy may have picked up a little as we head into Q4. The sector breakdown shows the diverging fortunes of the external and domestic economy. The manufacturing ifo fell moderately but stayed above its recent lows. That may be connected to Trump ratcheting up his trade skirmish with China and supports our view that slowing global trade will be a headwind in H2, but manufacturer\u2019s expectations rising may indicate that the headwind from last year\u2019s euro appreciation may begin to fade. Moreover, services and construction sentiment rose further, which is a sign of rising wages finding their way into increased consumer spending. Moreover, builders continue to benefit from an ultra-tight supply-side, that may curtail their growth pace, but it will pro-long their long-running boom. Overall, it really shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the German manufacturing ifo falls on the day that new US tariffs on China take effect. However, a robust domestic economy is reflected in increased services confidence. That continues to support our (and the ECB\u2019s) optimism regarding the resilience of domestic demand. So, even if growth won\u2019t be as buoyant as 2017, it should remain strong enough to keep the ECB on track to normalise its monetary policy. Sterling is still trading above $1.31, lifted by comments from Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. Brushing off the prime minister\u2019s humiliating experience at last week\u2019s EU summit in Salzburg, he told Talk Radio: We keep on negotiating in good faith, we try and get the best deal we can, but we are ready for all eventualities. We\u2019ll keep negotiating in good faith. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get there. Theresa May\u2019s Chequers deal was rejected by EU leaders in Salzburg, but Raab said: These blips in the road, they\u2019re blown a little bit out of proportion, but we double down, we don\u2019t throw our toys out of the pram, hold our nerve, keep our cool. But at the same time, we need to be ready for the possibility... that the ambitions that we are bringing to these negotiations to try and get a win-win deal isn\u2019t matched by the other side and it does take two to tango. The German Ifo survey was better than expected. The closely watched business climate index dipped to 103.7 in September from a revised 103.9 in August \u2013 but better than the 103.2 expected by economists. It suggests that German businesses are not overly worried about the deepening trade conflict between the US and China. The latest tariffs kicked in today. Oil prices are up 2% as the market tightens. Brent crude has gained $1.6 to $80.42 a barrel. Earlier, it hit $80.47 a barrel, its highest level since May. US light crude is 1.75% higher at $72.02 a barrel. Looming US sanctions will restrict Iran\u2019s oil exports, leading to less global supply. Despite this, the Opec oil cartel kept oil output limits in place a meeting in Algiers on Sunday \u2013 defying Donald Trump\u2019s call for action. He tweeted last week that Opec \u201cmust get prices down now!\u201d Some traders are forecasting that crude could spike to $100 a barrel next year. US commercial oil inventories are at their lowest level since early 2015, although US oiil production is near a record high of 11m barrels a day. Commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria reckon Brent crude could rise to $90 a barrel by Christmas and break through $100 early next year, with US sanctions against Iran due to be fully implemented in November. JPMorgan said in its latest market outlook that a \u201cspike to $90 per barrel is likely\u201d in light of the sanctions. The FTSE 100 index has opened lower, trading down 0.26% (nearly 20 points) at 7470.16. Shares in broadcaster Sky have jumped 9% to \u00a317.22. US cable-TV giant Comcast won the auction for Europe\u2019s biggest pay-TV group at the weekend, outbidding Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox with a \u00a317.28 a share offer. Our media editor Jim Waterson writes: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s dream of taking full control of Sky dissolved on Saturday night as he was outbid by the US firm Comcast. But anyone celebrating a setback for the mogul should be warned. The most divisive figure in Britain\u2019s media may still have the last laugh. However, for now the pound is up, trading above $1.31 (up nearly 0.3%) after Brexit secretary Dominic Raab expressed confidence that the government will get to a Brexit deal in the end, although he also said it was ready and prepared to deal with the risks of a no-deal outcome. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at online broker FXTM, has sent us his thoughts on trade and sterling: Politics and trade tensions are expected to be the key market drivers this week. While [the tariffs] seem to be already priced in, investors are becoming increasingly worried that the trade war may enter phase III. With Beijing cancelling planned trade talks on Saturday and the US State Department imposing sanctions against China\u2019s defence agency, relations between the two largest economies in the world may further deteriorate. While markets in mainland China, Japan, and South Korea are shut for a public holiday, investor skepticism was reflected in Hong Kong stocks and commodity currencies which fell in early Monday trade. Whether the pain will begin reflecting in Wall Street depends on what happens next. If President Trump follows through on his promises to impose further tariffs on the remaining $267 billion of Chinese imports, investors may consider it as a signal to move out of US equities. Sterling has recovered a bit this morning, trading up 0.2% at $1.3106 against the dollar. Sayed says: Markets thought that we might finally be seeing a Brexit breakthrough at the Salzburg Summit on Friday. Instead, the summit increased the chance of a no-deal Brexit as EU leaders slammed Theresa May\u2019s Chequers Brexit proposal with the Irish border remaining a key barrier to a deal. With no tier one economic data on the calendar, expect GBPUSD to weaken further this week with a possible test below $1.3. It feels quite autumnal this morning, but Thomas Cook is still suffering the effects of the heatwave across northern Europe. The travel giant has issued a profit warning, cutting its 2018 profit outlook by 13%. It has blamed the heatwave for more discounting and tougher competition. The company\u2019s shares crashed 18% when the stock market opened. The long run of hot weather (Britain\u2019s joint-longest heatwave on record) encouraged more people in Britain, Germany and Scandinavia to stay at home or holiday in their own country, rather than head to warmer countries in southern Europe. The warm weather is also affecting bookings for winter holidays. Thomas Cook said: The slowdown in customer bookings during June and July extended into August, leading to higher than normal levels of promotional activity. The tour operator now expects underlying operating profits to come in at \u00a3280m rather than the previously estimated \u00a3323m to \u00a3355m in the 12 months to 30 September. Rival Tui has stuck to its forecasts. While the Labour party is meeting in Liverpool, Theresa May faces a tense meeting in Downing Street today, amid intense pressure from leading Brexiters in her party to change course and seek a simpler, less ambitious deal. Key elements of the prime minister\u2019s Chequers deal were rejected by EU leaders at last week\u2019s humiliating summit in Salzburg. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new tariffs imposed by the US and China on each other\u2019s goods went into effect on Monday, as the bitter trade dispute deepened. Soon after, Beijing accused Washington of engaging in \u201ctrade bullyism,\u201d the official Xinhua news agency reported. But Beijing also said it was willing to restart trade negotiations with Washington if the talks are \u201cbased on mutual respect and equality\u201d. The US tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods and China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of US imports took effect at midday in Asia (5am BST), although the level was not as high as feared earlier. The US opted for 10% tariffs (initially - they go up to 25% by the end of the year) while China\u2019s duties vary between 5% and 10%. The trade dispute started in the early summer when trade talks broke down and the world\u2019s two biggest economies slapped duties on $50bn of each other\u2019s goods in July. Economists have been warning about the impact on growth not just in the US and China, but the wider global economy. The US tariffs spare some gadgets such as smartwatches and speakers, while home modems, routers and internet gateways are included. Reuters reports: The move will effectively create a two-tiered tariff structure for consumer internet, with many products, such as Fitbit fitness trackers, Apple\u2019s watch and Amazon.com\u2019s Echo smart speaker being favored over routers and internet gateways from Arris International, Netgear, D-Link and others. \u201cWe\u2019re operating under the assumption that the tens of millions of devices that deliver high-speed internet into consumers\u2019 homes will be impacted by these tariffs,\u201d said Jim Brennan, Arris\u2019 senior vice president of supply chain, quality and operations. \u201cIt feels anti-consumer because our devices are what enables the core of consumer tech,\u201d Brennan told Reuters. The pound also remains in focus, with the party conference season in full swing. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The pound had a dreadful week last week despite hitting a two-month high against the US dollar. The breakdown in relations between the UK and EU leaders in Salzburg last week, and Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s punchy statement on Friday could well be described as the usual political theatre that we\u2019ve all become accustomed to in the past couple of years, however markets appear to be deciding that with the March 2019 deadline looming, the room for political manoeuvre appears to be getting smaller. This has led to the not unreasonable conclusion that the risks of a political, as well economic dislocation have increased, particularly since both the UK government, and so-called opposition parties appear to be more concerned about their own internal squabbles, than actually doing what is best for the people they claim to represent. With party conference season now in full swing there is likely to be little of consequence that is likely to be construed as positive for sterling, as both Labour this week, and the Conservative\u2019s next week look to shore up their base support, with equally economically incoherent policies.

Although Michael Kors already owns Jimmy Choo, the addition of Versace is a major expansion for the group. They are not yet on the scale of LVMH or Kering but clearly have ambitions to expand their reach in the luxury goods sector.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ba8ea53e4b0a71b5946ba6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T13:47:50.983Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As reported earlier, Versace, the Italian fashion house founded by Gianni <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/versace\">Versace</a> 40 years ago, has been sold to US handbag and clothing brand Michael Kors for $2bn (\u00a31.5bn), according to the Italian newspaper<a href=\"https://www.corriere.it/moda/news/18_settembre_23/svolta-versace-in-vendita-un-gruppo-usa-2-miliardi-dollari-dd9ebd38-bf61-11e8-87df-bb2b7cf6f481.shtml\"> Corriere della Sera</a>.</p> <p>Donatella Versace, the brand\u2019s vice-president and artistic director, has called an all-staff meeting for Tuesday to announce the deal.</p> <p>Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That Michael Kors should court Versace is no great surprise. The American company has long desired to transform itself into a house of luxury brands, a process it started with last year\u2019s acquisition of Jimmy Choo. Versace comes with a much bigger price tag of $2.35 billion, almost double the $1.2bn price that Michael Kors paid for Jimmy Choo. However, it would also put a big-hitting brand with true global status into Michael Kors\u2019 stable.</p> <p>Other than the desire to become a bigger conglomerate, the rationale for buying another luxury label is perhaps less sound. In our view, while progress has been made, Michael Kors has not rebuilt its core brand to the same extent as other players like Coach: its offer is still confused and is nowhere near as rounded nor polished as many other luxury players. This shows up in the company\u2019s sales figures where growth has been driven by an upswing in US consumer sentiment and spending, rather than because the brand is generating much better traction.</p> <p>The choice of Versace is interesting. If the deal goes through it would certainly push the group into the big league in terms of its profile in the luxury space. It also means that the company would be a player in many different categories from fragrance to home to pets, thereby giving the group a true lifestyle position. However, it is also the case that despite its profile, Versace has struggled to grow sales. As such, Michael Kors is not buying a perfectly performing brand, it is buying a brand that needs work and some repositioning. </p> <p>As much as we believe Michael Kors past experience with its own brand will help it make the changes required, these shifts will cause short-term disruption and might mean that the true benefits from the acquisition will take a number of years to deliver through. We also believe that some of the work required on Versace, which includes toning down some of the brasher elements of the brand which are now out of step with the more subtle tone preferred by modern consumers, are precisely the issues with which Michael Kors has struggled and is yet to satisfactorily resolve.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/24/versace-to-be-sold-to-us-label-michael-kors-for-2bn-sources-say\">Versace to be sold to US label Michael Kors for $2bn, reports say</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ba8e71ee4b0a71b5946ba49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T13:32:02.402Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street has just opened.

This clearly represents a further escalation of the threat to China and its economy, and, especially considering that China has scrapped plans for further trade talks, we expect things will get worse before it gets better. As we inch further towards the precipice of a fully-fledged global trade war, financial markets will no doubt react swiftly, looking for further downside. </p> <p>However, the narrow focus on Sino-US relations is obscuring consideration of how an emerging trade tariff war could stimulate a fiscal drive from China. With a reasoned domestic response, what currently seems a damning situation could actually spark a re-orientation of China\u2019s economic model. Granted, the leadership will have to accept short-term sufferance, but over the medium- to long-term, we see the potential for positive surprises.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ba8dbd5e4b072dfb217baa9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T12:43:59.000Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling has risen as much as 0.9% against the dollar to $1.3161, and 0.4% against the euro to 89.42p.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ba8d4eee4b072dfb217ba63\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T12:18:59.845Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sterling rises 0.6% on Brexit deal hopes</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling has bounced 0.6% against the dollar today after Friday\u2019s sell-off, lifted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/sep/24/china-accuses-us-of-trade-bullyism-as-tariffs-kick-in-business-live?page=with:block-5ba8a329e4b0a71b5946b746#block-5ba8a329e4b0a71b5946b746\">upbeat comments from Brexit secretary Dominic Raab</a>.

Admittedly, growth in total orders is weakening from a high rate; the overall balance still is consistent with year-over-year growth in manufacturing output of about 2%. </p> <p>But the official manufacturing data has been much weaker than the surveys this year, with output falling by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q1 and by a further 0.9% in Q2. In addition, growth in export orders usually lags movements in sterling by about one year; the exchange rate\u2019s relative stability over the last year, therefore, has started to take the edge off growth in exports. </p> <p>Past form suggests that the export orders balance will fall to about -5 by the end of this year. Meanwhile, the chance that overseas customers re-jig their supply chains increases with every day that passes without a Brexit deal.

It will prove a boon for cash flows and forecasts as every extra dollar at that point goes straight through to cash flow. As well as taking the pressure off highly-geared companies, this would boost the value of reserves making it easier to obtain finance for exploration and development.</p> <p>However, even if Brent crude falls below this ideal and into the $60/barrel, many of these smaller companies will still remain quite profitable. The situation in the sector is very different to what it was during the last oil spike; companies have worked hard to get operational costs way down, and many have taken advantage of the sustained high price to lock-in a price for the immediate future. Whereas these companies were previously trading on razor margins and vulnerable to small falls, they are now far more resilient and can comfortably stomach falls all the way down to $60/barrel.</p> <p>Should Brent crude go south of $60/barrel, then we start to enter trouble and worry territory (although many will still remain profitable down to $50barrel). Conversely, should the price continue to rise above $80/barrel could be counterproductive in that it could cause an overcorrection, triggering volatility. All in all, however, so long as we are able to keep the price above $70/barrel, the outlook is very rosy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T09:57:14.846Z\">at 10.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ba8afe3e4b0a9b9706786af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T09:38:33.583Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The trade tensions between the US and China are weighing on European stock markets.

He noted that while the index dipped slightly in September, it remained well above its recent lows, although it is still some way off last year\u2019s highs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is especially encouraging that firms\u2019 expectations only edged down to 101.0 from 101.2 after surging in August as we had worried that it might have been a one off. But it looks like the 6-month outlook has indeed brightened somewhat. At the same time, the assessment of the current situation was stable at 106.4, somewhat above the Q2 average meaning that the economy may have picked up a little as we head into Q4. </p> <p>The sector breakdown shows the diverging fortunes of the external and domestic economy. The manufacturing ifo fell moderately but stayed above its recent lows. That may be connected to Trump ratcheting up his trade skirmish with China and supports our view that slowing global trade will be a headwind in H2, but manufacturer\u2019s expectations rising may indicate that the headwind from last year\u2019s euro appreciation may begin to fade. </p> <p>Moreover, services and construction sentiment rose further, which is a sign of rising wages finding their way into increased consumer spending. Moreover, builders continue to benefit from an ultra-tight supply-side, that may curtail their growth pace, but it will pro-long their long-running boom.</p> <p>Overall, it really shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the German manufacturing ifo falls on the day that new US tariffs on China take effect. However, a robust domestic economy is reflected in increased services confidence. That continues to support our (and the ECB\u2019s) optimism regarding the resilience of domestic demand. So, even if growth won\u2019t be as buoyant as 2017, it should remain strong enough to keep the ECB on track to normalise its monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ba8a329e4b0a71b5946b746\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T08:49:16.255Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling is still trading above $1.31, lifted by comments from Brexit secretary Dominic Raab.

The breakdown in relations between the UK and EU leaders in Salzburg last week, and Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s punchy statement on Friday could well be described as the usual political theatre that we\u2019ve all become accustomed to in the past couple of years, however markets appear to be deciding that with the March 2019 deadline looming, the room for political manoeuvre appears to be getting smaller.</p> <p>This has led to the not unreasonable conclusion that the risks of a political, as well economic dislocation have increased, particularly since both the UK government, and so-called opposition parties appear to be more concerned about their own internal squabbles, than actually doing what is best for the people they claim to represent.</p> <p>With party conference season now in full swing there is likely to be little of consequence that is likely to be construed as positive for sterling, as both Labour this week, and the Conservative\u2019s next week look to shore up their base support, with equally economically incoherent policies.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/1044115528233684993\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pound under a bit of pressure this morning but GBPUSD still holding for now above Friday&#39;s low around 1.3050, set after the plunge: <a href=\"https://t.co/SoSIkb3Ta1\">pic.twitter.com/SoSIkb3Ta1</a></p>&mdash; David Jones (@JonesTheMarkets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/1044115528233684993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 24, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>The Agenda</strong></h2> <ul> <li>9am BST German Ifo business climate survey<br></li> <li>11am BST CBI Industrial Trends survey</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-24T07:10:14.021Z\">at 8.10am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers have warned of the mounting risk of a no-deal Brexit as export orders dropped to the lowest level in almost a year. The CBI industrial trends survey, which gauges manufacturing activity across the UK, revealed slowing economic output for the three months to September, with company export orders the lowest since October 2017. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said that factory order books remained strong and output was still growing, but that \u201cBrexit uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook\u201d. \u201cHeightened fears of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit scenario have prompted some firms to move publicly from contingency planning to action,\u201d she said. Companies were put on notice last week that Britain could crash out of the EU in little more than six months, after Theresa May failed to win support for her Brexit plan from EU leaders in the latest round of talks. Failure to reach a deal with Brussels could force the UK and EU to resort to trading on World Trade Organization rules after Brexit, with the potential introduction of import tariffs and other barriers to trade from the end of March. The price of buying components from overseas could increase, while exports would also become more expensive for foreign buyers. The latest snapshot from the CBI showed 20% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 20% said they were below normal. When both figures are rounded they give a balance of -1%. The survey of 409 manufacturers showed a balance of only 5% said that export orders were above normal, which is the lowest balance since October last year. British manufacturers have found support for their products overseas from a weaker pound since the EU referendum, alongside robust global economic conditions lifting demand for merchandise around the world. Sterling has dropped further against the dollar in recent months amid growing fears over no-deal Brexit. Despite the risks to the economy, the CBI found output expanded in 10 out of 17 manufacturing sectors, with growth driven by the mechanical engineering, food, drink and tobacco, plastic products, and metal products sectors. Manufacturers said they also expect output growth to pick up over the next three months, while warning of the risk from Brexit. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest reading from the CBI survey suggests the manufacturing sector could grow by 2% this year compared to 2017. However, he warned overseas customers were likely to move away from UK suppliers \u201cwith every day that passes without a Brexit deal\u201d. \u201cAs a result, we doubt that the manufacturing sector\u2019s recovery is about to get back on track,\u201d he said. Economists argue that Britain has been unable to take full advantage of the tailwinds that should support manufacturing activity because of the lack of clarity over the future trading relationship with the EU. The Bank of England also warned businesses have put investment decisions on hold or diverted activity to other nations. The CBI said it expected UK manufacturers would continue benefiting from overseas demand and the lower sterling exchange rate in the near future, but that overall economic growth would remain subdued, reflecting weak household income growth across the country and the drag on investment from Brexit uncertainty. Tom Crotty, chair of the CBI manufacturing council and group director of Ineos, the UK chemicals firm led by Brexit supporter Jim Ratcliffe, said the government needed to prioritise the protection of frictionless trade with the EU. \u201cRobust output volumes and order books are good news for British manufacturers, who have benefited from a healthy global economy and lower sterling exchange rate. \u201cHowever, the continued uncertainty surrounding the final six months of Brexit negotiations presents a real risk to the continuation of this strong momentum,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nearly a year since the Harvey Weinstein scandal first convulsed the world, a California state senator is addressing one of the questions that linger in the wake of the Hollywood titan\u2019s downfall: would a culture of sexual harassment have flourished at the top of businesses like the Weinstein Company if women had sat on its board of directors? Almost certainly not, says Hannah-Beth Jackson, a Democrat senator from Santa Barbara who has co-authored a bill mandating greater gender equality in the boardroom. The California governor, Jerry Brown, must decide whether to sign the bill into law before the end of the month. \u201cIt\u2019s my firm belief that with more women on these corporate boards this behaviour will stop, and will not be allowed,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cBoards now understand the impact of this behaviour, how negative it is to the workforce, and how it impedes female workers and executives from doing the best job they can do.\u201d The California bill, which is known as SB826, mandates that public companies headquartered in the state must place at least one woman on their board by the end of 2019. It also demands that two women must sit on publicly listed boards with five members, and three on boards of six or more by 2021. As of June 2017, more than a quarter of the 445 publicly traded companies in California still had no women on their boards. In drafting the legislation Jackson cited numerous studies showing that companies with female board members are more profitable and productive, including one by financial analysis firm MSCI showing that US companies with at least three female directors financially outperformed those with none over a five-year period. The legislation would not have affected the Weinstein Company, Jackson points out, because it was privately owned \u2013 and based in New York. But the scandal nonetheless offered powerful lessons. The Weinstein Company board was entirely male and it was \u201cvery well aware of Weinstein\u2019s outrageous behaviour\u201d, she believes. Jackson adds that she thinks the board knew because it had \u201cput money into funds to pay off claims arising from emotional distress and careers that had been destroyed because they wouldn\u2019t engage in sexual behaviour with him\u201d. A number of Weinstein Company board members have denied knowledge of the allegations before the scandal blew up last year. The California Chamber of Commerce argues that the SB826 quota system does not address a lack of boardroom diversity along racial and ethnic lines. Others say legislating to address gender equality would create \u201ctoken\u201d measures that ultimately harm rather than help. \u201cAs a woman, I find this not only condescending but absolutely ridiculous,\u201d says the Fox News commentator Tomi Lahren. \u201cOne law doesn\u2019t change the world. But when we step forward and make it clear through a variety of laws that gender discrimination, sexual assault and harassment will not be tolerated then we will see the culture change,\u201d says Jackson. Pointing to the MSCI data, Jackson argues that companies with women on their boards are more profitable and productive. \u201cOnce we achieve critical mass, companies will be more profitable, more transparent, and there will be more accountability for misbehaviour in the workplace at every level,\u201d Jackson asserts. But when Brown sits down to sign SB826, he will do so in the shadow of one of the largest post-Weinstein harassment scandals \u2013 the departure of the CBS chief executive Les Moonves. Concerns over board strength linger over the fate of Moonves too. Yet it took six weeks between the first allegations of sexual misconduct against Moonves to be published in the pages of the New Yorker and his exit from the company. That left many to argue that the CBS board was too slow to act and was blinded by its loyalty to Moonves until the clamour from shareholders and a fall in the value of CBS stock became impossible to ignore. Moonves denies the allegations. \u201cThe issue is not how quickly you act after allegations are made, it\u2019s how quickly you act after you determine the truth of it,\u201d says Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. \u201cInvestor pressure has made it hard for a board to look the other way. Now they\u2019re forced to act more quickly.\u201d The Californian legislation is not unique to the US \u2013 Massachusetts and Illinois have passed non-binding resolutions pushing companies to address the issue \u2013 and it is closely related to European efforts to legislate against imbalances. In 2003, Norway mandated that 40% of corporate board seats be held by women, which was followed by France and other European countries. In 2015, Germany mandated that 30% of corporate board seats be held by women. The gender diversity push is increasingly being taken up by investors. In March, the powerful New York State Common Retirement Fund announced it intends to oppose the re-election of all directors on hundreds of US corporate boards without a single woman. The share of companies with all-male boards on the Russell 3000 Index, which includes most public companies on major US stock exchanges, fell to 17% this year, down from nearly a quarter in 2016, according to the Gender Diversity Index published by Equilar, a research firm that gathers data on executives and boards. The study also found that nearly one third of new director seats went to women in the first quarter of 2018. The co-author of SB826 hopes that California, as the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, will set the pace in boardroom diversity.",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook\u2019s share price dived by more than a quarter on Monday, wiping \u00a3345m off the travel company\u2019s stockmarket valuation, after it warned profits would take a hit because the European summer heatwave led to a fall in demand for last-minute foreign trips. The firm said the \u201cunprecedented\u201d prolonged period of hot weather across the continent meant more people spent June and July enjoying the sunshine at home and put off booking foreign holidays. A slowdown in the number of customer bookings during June and July extended into August, forcing tour operators to discount more heavily in order to fill hotel beds and plane seats, putting pressure on profit margins. Approximately 25% of Thomas Cook bookings are from British customers, with 30% from Germany and 15% from Scandinavia. As a result, Thomas Cook expects to report a full-year underlying operating profit of about \u00a3280m, down from previous estimates of \u00a3323m. The travel firm also announced that its chief financial officer, Bill Scott, is leaving the business after less than 12 months in the post. Shares in the company closed down 28% at 56p, valuing the company at around \u00a3855m. Thomas Cook, which makes all of its annual profits in the summer months, also warned that the impact of the heatwave \u201cis continuing to be felt into winter trading\u201d. The chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said: \u201cOur recent trading performance is clearly disappointing. \u201cSummer 2018 has seen a return to popularity of destinations such as Turkey and Tunisia. However, it has also been marked by a prolonged period of hot weather across Europe. \u201cThis meant many customers spent June and July enjoying the sunshine at home and put off booking their holidays abroad, leading to even tougher competition and higher than usual levels of discounting in the \u2018lates\u2019 market of August and September.\u201d The company said Scott, who joined Thomas Cook in 2012 and was appointed chief financial officer last January, will be replaced on a temporary basis by Sten Daugaard, a board member at the company\u2019s German business. Thomas Cook said Scott had \u201cdecided to step down\u201d from the company and will leave in November. Soaring temperatures across the UK, Ireland and Europe over the summer have caused a headache for travel firms and airlines, with the low-cost airline easyJet also warning in July that late bookings might be hit. The weather only added to problems caused by the fall in the value of the pound against the euro, which has put a dampener on European and American sojourns for British holidaymakers by increasing the overall cost of package deals as well as food and other local spending in euros or dollars. Thomas Cook had no growth in holiday package bookings from the UK as the average selling price rose 7%, partly fuelled by cost inflation as result of the fall in value of the pound. Competition for beds in Spain, which has gained popularity as a \u201csafe\u201d destination in recent years since terrorist incidents in Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt, also drove up prices there. \u201cCurrency is almost the elephant in the room,\u201d Russ Mould, the investment director at broker AJ Bell, said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an issue for two years now. Last year people thought they would go [to Europe] anyway but then they probably thought \u2018that wasn\u2019t very cheap\u2019 and have had a rethink about their travel plans.\u201d Thomas Cook said its overall bookings, including flights, for the summer of 2018 were 12% higher, driven by a 15% jump in flight bookings as the company picked up business after the failure of competitors Monarch and Air Berlin. The return in popularity of holidays to Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and Greece helped offset a fall in bookings to Spain. However, average selling prices were 5% lower. Northern Europe bookings were up 4% in the summer but Thomas Cook said this had come at the expense of price, with average selling prices only up 2%, a fall of two percentage points since the last update. A similar pattern was seen in continental Europe, with bookings up in recent weeks, driven by lower pricing. Average selling prices were up 2%, a fall of 1% since the firm\u2019s last update. Thomas Cook said despite recent challenges \u201cwe continue to make good strategic progress, which positions us well to return to profitable growth\u201d. Thomas Cook also had to deal with negative headlines in August when it was forced to move 300 customers from a hotel in Egypt after the death of two holidaymakers but Fankhauser said the incident was not linked to the profit warning on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "US firms are taking advantage of the cheap pound to snap up some of Britain\u2019s most successful businesses at bargain prices, according to the latest mergers and acquisitions data. The value of deals involving US companies buying UK businesses more than doubled to \u00a379bn in 2017-18 from \u00a336.8bn in the previous year. The low value of sterling, which last week slumped to $1.30 in the wake of Theresa May\u2019s post-Salzburg statement, has given American buying power a boost and allowed US firms to outbid rivals. Music app Shazam, which was bought by Apple for \u00a3299m, was among the many fast-growing UK-based firms that accountancy firm Moore Stephens said were bought by US rivals or private equity firms. But interest from EU companies in acquisitions in the UK has lessened, leading to a 5% fall in the value of deals in the last 12 months to \u00a313.3bn from \u00a314.1bn. Figures for the current year are likely to show another rise in activity following the plan by Coca-Cola to spend \u00a33.9bn purchasing coffee business Costa Coffee from Whitbread and the announcement that US insurance broker Marsh &amp; McLennan will buy UK insurance company Jardine Lloyd Thompson in a \u00a34.3bn deal. Moore Stephens said US firms, unlike their European counterparts, had shrugged off Brexit concerns. \u201cThis has been in part due to the devaluation of sterling since 2014, making British businesses comparatively cheaper than many of their foreign competitors,\u201d it said. \u201cBrexit has also been perceived more negatively on the continent by politicians, business groups and the media than in the US, making European businesses more cautious about acquiring UK companies,\u201d the accountancy firm added. Many analysts had expected US firms to cut back on foreign buyouts following tax reforms brought in by the Trump administration last year. New rules encourage firms to repatriate cash they hold overseas. They also offer incentives to buy and invest in domestic firms. Previously, cash held outside the US had been used to fund overseas mergers and acquisitions. Moore Stephens said the large number of US buyers eyeing UK firms revealed that American business bosses were on the hunt for innovative and well-run businesses. It said: \u201cThe confidence that US investors have placed in the UK is indicative of the underlying strength of UK businesses and the openness of its economy.\u201d Other firms purchased last year include UK-based social business network Huddle, which was acquired by private equity firm Turn/River Capital for \u00a3284m, and trading and investment software company Fidessa, which was taken over by Temenos Group AG for \u00a31.3bn.",
