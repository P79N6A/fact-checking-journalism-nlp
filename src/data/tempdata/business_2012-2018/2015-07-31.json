      "bodyText": "More than 23,000 BT staff are to profit from a \u00a3265m employee share scheme at the company, with some employees set to make more than \u00a350,000 each. The staff saved between \u00a35 and \u00a3250 a month over a period of up to five years. They will now be able to buy shares on Monday at prices from when the schemes started. The 13,000 staff who saved in the five-year scheme will be able to buy shares at \u00a31.04 while 12,730 who saved under the three-year scheme will be able to buy at \u00a31.89. The current BT share price stands at about \u00a34.64. The shares in question can be bought for a total of \u00a377m under the scheme while their market value is \u00a3265m, representing a considerable profit for staff. BT said the average gain for staff who saved for five years would be \u00a310,236, while most of those who saved for three years would make \u00a34,400. Those who saved the maximum amount per month \u2013 \u00a3250 \u2013 in the five-year scheme would stand to make \u00a354,064 if they sold the shares at current prices. Those that saved the maximum amount in the three-year scheme would profit by more than \u00a313,000. Almost 23,000 BT staff last year received an average of \u00a342,000 as part of a share ownership scheme totalling \u00a31.1bn. Almost a third of BT\u2019s UK staff took part in the schemes which are maturing on Monday, said the company. BT\u2019s chief executive Gavin Patterson credited the staff with gains in the share price. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that so many BT colleagues are sharing in the company\u2019s success through our Saveshare plans,\u201d he said. BT announced this week that it is on track to meet full-year expectations after a growth in revenues at its TV and broadband services. The company will launch a new sports channel featuring Uefa Champions League and Europa League games this weekend, a feature which has been credited for the boost in sales at its TV division. In 2013, BT finalised a deal with Uefa to exclusively broadcast Champions League matches from this year, beating BSkyB and ITV in the process. The company\u2019s former chief executive, Ian Livingston, who left in 2013, is credited with successfully reviving BT. When he became boss in June 2008, the former state-owned monopoly was burdened with huge debts and growing costs. He led a change, which involved cutting overheads and bringing the company\u2019s pension deficit under control.",

    "webTitle": "Is SoulCycle too snobby for America? Cycling experts weigh in", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Cycling is coming to Wall Street. SoulCycle, the high-end indoor cycling chain, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday in hopes of raising as much as $100m. The New York-based company, which has 38 studios across the US, didn\u2019t specify how many shares it plans to offer or at what price. As the IPO approached, the main question potential investors will be asking is: how many Americans are willing to pay $35 to ride a bike in a dimly lit room for 45 minutes while being yelled at? Will the cult that is SoulCycle grow beyond Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York? \u201cWe do not have a target demographic because at SoulCycle, ANYONE can be an Athlete, a Legend, a Warrior, a Renegade or a Rockstar,\u201d the company wrote in its filing with the SEC. \u201cIt is the place people come, regardless of their age, athletic ability, size, shape, profession or personality, to connect with their best selves.\u201d Even as SoulCycle might try to reassure potential investors that the \u201cjourney\u201d that is a SoulCycle class is for everyone, that is not exactly true. For the most part, customers are professional and aged 25 to 50, according to Ellen Yates, 53, who has been a fitness instructor for more than 30 years and has owned studios for over 20 years. Currently, she is a president of N2Shape and owns a cycling studio in Tyson\u2019s Corner, Virginia. \u201cYou have to convince people that they can do it and that is is not too difficult,\u201d she said about cycling. \u201cOtherwise they feel that it is only for athletes. This is not true. It is for all shapes, sizes and ages. I even have a spinning class for seniors.\u201d Yates got into cycling in the early 2000s when it first became popular. Then the interest died down, but now it is back \u2013 mainly thanks to SoulCycle. \u201cThey helped create the resurgence of spinning. It helps the entire industry,\u201d she explained. This is especially true for independent studios that have been able to open in areas where SoulCycle has yet to expand. Boutique fitness studios offering cycling, yoga and other classes are the fastest-growing part of the gym industry, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, and they made up 21% of the fitness industry in 2013. Independent studios can also adjust their classes and prices to the needs of their clientele and appeal to particular demographics. Appealing to older users might be more difficult for SoulCycle, which has been described as \u201cnightclub with bikes\u201d with its curated playlists and candle-lit studios. Additionally, its classes cost about $34 a pop \u2013 the first ride is $20 \u2013 which might make it difficult to appeal to consumers in lower-income brackets. \u201cThey\u2019ll attract someone that\u2019s more affluent because they have set their prices at $34,\u201d explained Yates, adding that SoulCycle is better suited for urban areas where demand for cycling studios is high and potential members might be willing to pay more to join. To figure out just how affluent some of the SoulCycle\u2019s members are, consider this: 50 Hamptons SuperSoul classes cost $4,000. That\u2019s about $80 a class, which includes priority on waitlist and concierge service. The price tag of the classes automatically narrows down the pool of potential SoulCycle users. In 2014, the average cost of US gym membership was about $41 a month. Certain gyms also offer cycling classes at no cost to their members. \u201cThe truth is, they\u2019re really not that expensive,\u201d Julie Rice, one of the founders, told the Wall Street Journal in 2013. \u201cA cocktail in New York can cost $16 or $17, so we always tell people that it\u2019s the same as inexpensive personal training or the price of two cocktails.\u201d The problem? These kind of price comparisons only hold up in cities where cocktails do cost $16. SoulCycle, which plans to open as many as 250 studios across the US, is not unaware of the challenges it faces. In its filing for an IPO, the company admitted that failure to expand into other markets is one of its biggest risks. \u201c[O]ur studios in the New York metropolitan area and in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco generated approximately 95% of our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 97% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014,\u201d the filing said. SoulCycle earned $25.3m in 2014, up 42% from 2013. Its revenue was $112m in 2014, up 49% from the previous year. SoulCycle can also claim almost one million rides in the first quarter of 2015. During the first three months of the year, the company held 25,641 classes and about 10,378 people attended a class on daily basis. In 2014, studio fees accounted for 83% of its revenues. The rest came from the $54 T-shirts, $78 sweat pants and $58 tote bags sold within the studio, all stamped with the SoulCycle logo. Bill Pryor, owner of CycleBar, a 10-year-old cycling studio near Boston, plans to capitalize on the increased interest in cycling. Pryor, who also runs Spynergy Consulting that works with studio startups, got together a group of partners earlier this year and turned CycleBar into a franchise. Business Insider described CycleBar as SoulCycle\u2019s biggest threat. According to Pryor, SoulCycle brand \u201coozes with exclusivity\u201d and there is market demand for a more affordable cycling option. \u201cOne of the reasons we launched CycleBar Franchising is because we believe an affordable model that is well executed can work in many markets. We have sold over 100 franchise units to date in 22 states, the first ones will start opening in the fall of this year,\u201d Pryor said, pointing out that SoulCycle had only 38 locations as of March. \u2018Pack. Tribe. Community\u2019 The rapid growth and rise in popularity have led to an overload of customers \u2013 a problem each company wants to have \u2013 and the creation of waitlists and premium memberships for those willing to pay. As SoulCycle has entered the spotlight, so has its culture and the devotion among its loyal fans, which has been described as cult-like. The company\u2019s IPO filing played into that portrayal by disclosing details like the fact that aspiring cycling instructors attend training known as \u201cSoul University\u201d and lines like: \u201cWe are a \u2018culture of yes\u2019.\u201d \u201cOur mission is to bring Soul to the people.\u201d \u201cThe experience is tribal. It is primal.\u201d If there is any doubt about the cultish popularity of cycling, just look to how it has permeated through to popular culture. Earlier this year, an entire episode of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt focused on cycling culture. \u201cSpiritCycle is a cult. It\u2019s just another cult,\u201d Kimmy declares while trapped under a stationary cycling bike in her living room. Kimmy, the main character of the Netflix series, had just emerged from an underground bunker where she was kept for 15 years. \u201cWhy does this keep happening? What\u2019s wrong with me?!\u201d There is nothing wrong with Kimmy. Americans have long been looking for exercise regimens that would make them happy, less stressed and thin. As for the cult-like devotion within SoulCycle, there is no need for a real-life Kimmy Schmidt \u201cspintervention\u201d. \u201cEventually, just like CrossFit, it will die down,\u201d said Yates. According to her, other group exercises, such as zumba, have had similar surges in popularity. This is exactly why Yates is unlikely to invest in SoulCycle once it goes public. Cycling \u2013 as the new American organized group exercise \u2013 could just be a fad. That is not to say that there won\u2019t be a small, dedicated customer base for this type of exercise. It just means that growing \u2013 something that public companies have to do \u2013 could be much harder to do.",

      "body": "<p>Cycling is coming to Wall Street. </p> <p>SoulCycle, the high-end indoor cycling chain, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday in hopes of raising as much as $100m. The New York-based company, which has 38 studios across the US, didn\u2019t specify how many shares it plans to offer or at what price.</p> <p>As the IPO approached, the main question potential investors will be asking is: how many Americans are willing to pay $35 to ride a bike in a dimly lit room for 45 minutes while being yelled at? Will the cult that is SoulCycle grow beyond Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York? </p> <p>\u201cWe do not have a target demographic because at SoulCycle, ANYONE can be an Athlete, a Legend, a Warrior, a Renegade or a Rockstar,\u201d the company wrote in its filing with the SEC. \u201cIt is the place people come, regardless of their age, athletic ability, size, shape, profession or personality, to connect with their best selves.\u201d</p> <p>Even as SoulCycle might try to reassure potential investors that the \u201cjourney\u201d that is a SoulCycle class is for everyone, that is not exactly true. </p> <p>For the most part, customers are professional and aged 25 to 50, according to Ellen Yates, 53, who has been a fitness instructor for more than 30 years and has owned studios for over 20 years. Currently, she is a president of <a href=\"http://n2shape.com/locations/\">N2Shape</a> and owns a cycling studio in Tyson\u2019s Corner, Virginia.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to convince people that they can do it and that is is not too difficult,\u201d she said about cycling. \u201cOtherwise they feel that it is only for athletes. This is not true. It is for all shapes, sizes and ages. I even have a spinning class for seniors.\u201d</p> <p>Yates got into cycling in the early 2000s when it first became popular. Then the interest died down, but now it is back \u2013 mainly thanks to SoulCycle.</p> <p>\u201cThey helped create the resurgence of spinning. It helps the entire industry,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>This is especially true for independent studios that have been able to open in areas where SoulCycle has yet to expand. Boutique fitness studios offering cycling, yoga and other classes are the fastest-growing part of the gym industry, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, and they made up 21% of the fitness industry in 2013.<strong> </strong>Independent studios can also adjust their classes and prices to the needs of their clientele and appeal to particular demographics.</p> <p>Appealing to older users might be more difficult for SoulCycle, which has been described as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2014/01/25/big-spinning-chains-roll-into-boston-part-trend-toward-boutique-workouts-big-classes/bAF3caZ6z6X4abjao5fgoL/story.html\">nightclub with bikes</a>\u201d with its curated playlists and candle-lit studios.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of a break-up of Rolls-Royce, one of Britain\u2019s biggest manufacturers, is back on the agenda after a US activist hedge fund revealed it has built a 5.5% stake in the company. ValueAct Capital, which is based in San Francisco, is renowned for pushing companies for radical change but prefers to operate behind the scenes rather than make its case through public announcements. In the past it has targeted Microsoft and mobile phone maker Motorola, often looking for the company to sell itself or hive off assets. The hedge fund is thought to have been building a stake in Rolls-Royce since last summer and is now the aerospace and defence group\u2019s biggest investor ahead of Aberdeen Asset Management, BlackRock and Invesco. Shares in Rolls-Royce rose 44.5p, or 6%, to 794.5p after ValueAct\u2019s investment was revealed in a stock market filing. ValueAct\u2019s stake-building comes at a vital moment for the Derby-based group. On Thursday, the company reported that profits have slumped by more than half on the back of falling demand for its jet engines. Warren East, Rolls\u2019 new chief executive, is also leading a review of the engineer, pledging to make it a faster-moving and less complex business. Rolls has issued four profit warnings in the last 18 months and is under pressure on a number of fronts. Demand for its best-selling Trent 700 engine is waning as airliners wait for the launch of the new Airbus A330neo long-haul jet, while falling oil prices have exposed its marine business, which makes parts for offshore oil and gas platforms, leading to a 90% fall in profits at the unit in the first half of 2015. Rolls has five divisions: civil aerospace; defence; marine; power systems and nuclear. However, earlier this year Sequoia Fund, another US hedge fund, accused Rolls of being \u201cwilling to destroy shareholder value\u201d by branching out from manufacturing jet engines. In an open letter it said a \u201ctough-minded activist\u201d investor was needed to drive change in the face of \u201cstubborn and entrenched\u201d management. Since then John Rishton has stood down as chief executive and replaced by East, the former boss of Arm Holdings, which makes microchips for Apple. In a statement, Rolls-Royce said: \u201cWe welcome any investor who recognises the long-term value of our business. We have frequent communication with all of our shareholders and meet with major investors on a regular basis. We look forward to engaging with ValueAct, just as we do with all investors.\u201d East has said he will unveil the findings of his operational review of the group by the end of 2015. This review will focus on adding \u201cpace and simplicity\u201d to the company. East said that the recent profit warnings showed Rolls-Royce \u201cisn\u2019t as resilient as everyone thought\u201d and is facing a period of significant transition as the business moves from a reliance on profitable engines such as the Trent 700, which it produces for the Airbus A330, towards new, more fuel-efficient engines such as the Trent 7000. However, he pointed to a \u00a32.8bn rise in the company\u2019s order book to \u00a376.5bn as evidence that Rolls remains in robust health. \u201cI am doing what any new CEO would do and getting my head around the operations,\u201d East said. \u201cI am looking at whether what we are doing is necessary, and could we do it faster and better. I am not ruling anything in or anything out at this stage. But Rolls is a sound business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A hedge fund manager appointed to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) has succumbed to pressure about potential conflicts of interest by severing financial links with his former employer. The appointment of Gertjan Vlieghe, a former partner and senior economist at hedge fund Brevan Howard, to the rate-setting committee was announced on Tuesday but prompted concern about his remaining ties to the investment firm. He was to have retained a financial interest in Brevan Howard, which is a partnership. This would have allowed him to receive long-term incentive payments based on the hedge fund\u2019s size, according to a report by Reuters. However, after the Treasury select committee said it would scrutinise his appointment, Vlieghe announced he would be bought out of his partnership at one of Europe\u2019s largest hedge funds. However, he did not disclose the value of his stake. \u201cDespite the fact that there would be no conflict of interest between my future role and any continued passive stake in Brevan Howard, we have now come to an agreement whereby I shall be bought out of my remaining interest in the partnership before taking up my position on the MPC. As of 31 August I will have severed all financial and other ties with Brevan Howard. I have taken this step to avoid any mistaken impression of a conflict of interest,\u201d said Vlieghe. He is to take up his position on the MPC in September, replacing David Miles for a three-year term. Vlieghe, a dual British-Belgian national, joined Brevan Howard after stints at Deutsche Bank and the Bank of England, where he had been economic assistant to the previous governor, Lord Mervyn King. He will be one of four external members on the nine-strong MPC, which next week will give its latest decision on interest rates alongside its view on the state of the economy. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told borrowers to start preparing for a rise and hinted it could happen around the turn of the year. The Treasury had insisted that Vlieghe, who has a PhD from the London School of Economics, did not face a conflict of interest. It had said on Thursday: \u201cAll MPC members are bound by the MPC\u2019s code of conduct. As is usual practice when making external appointments of this nature, potential conflicts of interest are considered by the Treasury and the Bank of England, and the MPC code of conduct is applied rigorously at all times.\u201d Matthew Oakeshott, chairman of the pension fund manager Olim and a former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman in the Lords, said: \u201cAnyone with an ounce of common sense would have spotted that conflict at once.\u201d",

Thirteen activists hung from the St John\u2019s bridge, while another 13 monitored their ropes from above. Then, on Thursday night in Portland, just when the Greenpeacers thought the Shell ship had turned away and they could fend off $2,500-an-hour fines, the authorities came in. The \u201ckayaktivists\u201d were forced aside by the police. The rope monitors were detained, and eventually released. Two rappelling activists willingly lowered themselves, apparently at the urging of the Portland fire bureau, to a \u201crescue\u201d vessel in the water. A third mid-air protester was removed unwillingly. With only 10 bridge-hangers remaining, Shell\u2019s Fennica vessel snuck through and passed on to the Arctic, where its arrival will start the company\u2019s drilling for oil. Despite the immediate heartbreak, to watch the event unfold \u2013 live in Portland or on social media, however many rivers away from the Willamette \u2013 was indeed to watch a victory, according to the innovative protesters. \u201cThis was a historic achievement not just because it blocked Shell\u2019s icebreaker from reaching the Arctic, but because it helped spark an even bigger movement of people to raise their voices for something they believe in,\u201d Greenpeace USA\u2019s executive director, Annie Leonard, said. One of the danglers, Razz Gormley, told Oregon Live: \u201cIt was tough to see the boat go through there, but every second counts. I consider this a victory.\u201d Sergeant Pete Simpson said safety was the main priority while confronting the climax of the two-day effort. But some Twitter users voiced concerns over how the authorities handled a peaceful \u2013 if persistent \u2013 protest. The activists, who had been in place since Wednesday at approximately 3am PT, delayed the departure of the oil company\u2019s 380ft icebreaker Fennica. The vessel, originally scheduled to leave on Wednesday afternoon, approached the protesters early Thursday morning before turning back and returning to its dock. \u201cWe are incredibly proud of these climbers and truly humbled by what they have achieved here in Portland,\u201d Leonard said. Those hanging from the bridge were prepared to stay for several days, according to Greenpeace US. They even remained in place after a federal judge in Alaska ordered Greenpeace USA pay a fine of $2,500 for every hour that protesters continued to block the icebreaker from leaving for the Arctic. US district court judge Sharon Gleason ruled in Anchorage that Greenpeace was in civil contempt because of the protesters\u2019 impeding of the vessel. \u201cThe last two days have been a very emotional experience for all of us at Greenpeace, as well as all those who supported this action around the country and the world,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cBetween the kayativists, the streamers, and the blue sky we have seen something new emerge, a sign that we can stand up to one of the most powerful companies in the world if we work together.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Supermarkets could stop hiring over-25s to avoid national living wage, say analysts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Supermarkets could close stores and try to avoid employing over-25s to cover the cost of implementing a new \u201cnational living wage\u201d, the influential credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned. Its research will raise concerns about the countermeasures big businesses could take to pay the national living wage, which was announced by George Osborne in the summer budget. The minimum wage for over-25s, rebranded by the chancellor as the national living wage, will increase from \u00a36.50 an hour at present to \u00a37.20 in 2017, before rising to at least \u00a39 by 2020 under the chancellor\u2019s plan. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces independent forecasts for the government, has estimated that the national living wage will lead to 60,000 job losses and reduce GDP by 0.1% by the end of the decade. But it also warned that the response of businesses was \u201csubject to significant uncertainty\u201d. In its new report, Moody\u2019s claims 6m workers will get a pay rise as a result of the move. It said reaching \u00a37.20 an hour by 2016 would \u201cnot be overly taxing\u201d for retailers, but the impact of increasing pay to at least \u00a39 by 2020 will have a material impact. Tesco profits will be 7% lower in 2017 and profits at Morrisons will fall 10% if the companies do not take mitigating action, Moody\u2019s added. It said Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, which employ 750,000 people between them, could respond by closing stores, employing fewer staff in existing stores and hiring more under-25s, who are not eligible for the national living wage. Supermarkets could also accelerate plans to expand their online operations, which require fewer employees. Sven Reinke, a vice-president and senior analyst at Moody\u2019s, said the national living wage could encourage Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s to \u201crethink their strategy of putting more people on shop floors to improve service and customer experience as a way to differentiate themselves from the discounters\u201d. The established grocers cut head office jobs in response to a slide in profits, but have increased staff on shop floors to boost customer service. Reinke said supermarkets could, in future, look to install more self-checkouts and automated systems to lower staff levels. He said: \u201cWe also think rising wage pressures could accelerate the closure of unprofitable stores. For example, new super and hypermarket openings by the big four grocery retailers have come to an abrupt halt, but there have been very few closures so far.\u201d Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, said the company is supportive of the national living wage. A spokesman said in a statement: \u201cAt Tesco, we know it is important to reward colleagues well, and that\u2019s why we pay one of the highest hourly rates in retail. \u201cBut we firmly believe in offering colleagues a total reward package and our benefits include a 10% colleague discount, shares scheme and pension, which we know they really value. \u201cThat said, in line with our approach of offering sector-leading pay and a generous benefit package to all colleagues, we are supportive of the introduction of the national living wage.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mis-selling scandals cost Lloyds Banking Group a further \u00a31.8bn in the first half of the year, the bank has revealed, as it pledged to return more cash to shareholders in the future. There was a \u00a31.4bn provision for compensation for payment- protection insurance during the period, which Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, boss of the bailed-out bank, described as disappointing. This takes the total cost for PPI for Lloyds to \u00a313.4bn, and the industry\u2019s bill to more than \u00a326bn. Lloyds, which employs 7,000 people just to handle PPI, admitted that if customer complaints did not tail off as quickly as it expected it could face further hefty charges in the months ahead. The PPI bill for Lloyds could rise by a further \u00a310bn, according to one City estimate published on Friday. The bank also took a \u00a3117m charge to cover the fine earlier this year from the Financial Conduct Authority for mishandling PPI complaints, a \u00a3175m charge for packaged bank accounts \u2013 where products such as insurance are sold with a current account \u2013 and additional sums for other compensation payouts. \u201cRebuilding customer trust remains a key imperative for the business. Regrettably, the UK banking sector is still being impacted by conduct issues, including litigation and PPI,\u201d said Horta-Os\u00f3rio. Despite the slew of scandals knocking the bank\u2019s profits, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said it had made strong progress and focused on the prospects for returns to shareholders in the future. The bank paid an interim dividend of 0.75p a share \u2013 some \u00a3535m \u2013 and intends to conduct share buybacks and hand out special dividends. The aim is to make the shares more attractive to prospective shareholders, particularly retail investors whom the government intends to target for share sale in the future. The government\u2019s stake now stands at below 15% \u2013 down from the 43% holding it built in the wake of Lloyds\u2019s rescue of HBOS during the 2008 crisis \u2013 and Horta-Os\u00f3rio said the remaining stake would be disposed of in the next 12 months. There has been speculation he will leave once the taxpayer stake is sold off, but he said: \u201cI like it here, I like the management team \u2026 I like the bank. So unless the board or shareholders want to boot me out, I\u2019m quite happy here.\u201d Profits for the first half rose 38% to \u00a31.2bn. This includes the PPI charge and the \u00a3660m cost of selling off TSB, the branch network which it had to create as result of its \u00a320bn taxpayer rescue in 2008. TSB was floated and then sold to Spain\u2019s Sabadell. The bank also revealed the impact of changes to the bank tax regime, introduced by George Osborne in his July budget, to water down the bank levy and introduce an 8% surcharge, which will increase its effective tax rate to 30% from the low 20s now. Lloyds shares fell 2.8% to 83p. The PPI scandal has hit Lloyds harder than other banks and could still escalate. It sold 16m PPI policies since 2000 and has now contacted, settled or taken provisions for more than 45% of these. The current provision assumes a significant decrease in complaint volumes over the next 18 month. But it could be increased by \u00a33bn over 18 months if the scale of complaints does not fall, the bank estimated. However, stockbroker Cenkos warned the cost could more than treble to a further \u00a310bn. Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer body Which?, said: \u201cThis scandal will rumble on for years unless the banks pull their socks up and start making it much quicker and easier for people to get back the money they\u2019re rightfully owed. If any bank fails to do this, the regulator must step in.\u201d Lloyds said two-thirds of complaints come from more than 200 claims-management companies, which are thought to have received around \u00a31.7bn in fees from the bank as a result of bringing claims. A court ruling last year over the way commission was paid over PPI sales \u2013 known as Plevin v Paragon \u2013 could also push up the compensation bill for Lloyds and other banks. The City regulator is reviewing the implications for the industry. George Culmer, finance director at Lloyds, said the costs of compensation for packaged bank accounts would not be huge: \u201cIt will not be another PPI,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Poundland puzzles over how to keep it cheap and in reach", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If you gave Poundland\u2019s chief executive a quid every time he says \u201camazing value\u201d while accompanying him to a store, your outlay would be considerably more than the \u00a34.72 that shoppers spend on an average visit. Checking out the bargain chain\u2019s Fulham outlet in west London, Jim McCarthy is gobsmacked by a sudden run on goldfish bowls \u2013 apparently being snapped up by students across the UK as makeshift cocktail glasses that can be shared by multiple tipplers dunking in straws. He marvels at other oddball bestsellers for the chain, such as two-for-a-pound Aloe Vera drinks which are selling more than some top drinks brands. And he is gutted that the company has sold out of selfie-sticks despite buying in tens of thousands of the gadgets. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more in,\u201d he says firmly. Given his background, it is no surprise the amiable 59-year-old knows how to talk a good sales pitch. Starting work, age 12, as a paper boy at newsagents Dillons in his home town of Nuneaton in the Midlands, he worked his way up through the business. He survived various takeovers to become chief executive of what was T&amp;S Stores by the time it was sold to Tesco in 2003. After an an attempt at retirement at just 47 when the T&amp;S deal made him a multi-millionaire, McCarthy moved on to run Sainsbury\u2019s convenience store business for two years before returning home to the Midlands to run Poundland in 2006, investing a \u201csix-figure sum\u201d in the business. All that experience will come in handy given the challenges he faces now. McCarthy has kicked off consolidation in the discount retail sector with Poundland\u2019s \u00a355m purchase of rival 99p Stores and, if the deal goes through, the company will consolidate its position as the UK\u2019s leading single-price retailer. The buy-out of 99p would add 250 extra stores to Poundland\u2019s estate of nearly 600 UK outlets, helping make a big stride forward to its target of 1,000 stores here. The company, which topped sales of \u00a31bn this year, also has more than 40 Irish stores and nine in Spain under the Dealz brand. But the deal requires the approval of the Competition and Markets Authority, which is mulling whether Poundland should have to sell up to 80 shops in areas where it shares customers with 99p Stores. If McCarthy gets his way, 99p Stores\u2019 shoppers will certainly see 1% inflation as the sites are rebranded, meaning they will have to pay at least a penny more per item. The competition regulator is examining whether gobbling up one of Poundland\u2019s few single-price rivals will give the retailer more freedom to reduce the offers shoppers get for their \u00a31 \u2013 like those two-for-a-pound Aloe Vera drinks. \u201cPlainly, the thought of changing pricing is not going to pay \u2013 that\u2019s not how the model works. We all know the public, even more so now than ever before, are aware of price, quality and overall value. To change the Poundland formula by doing something different is not understandable,\u201d says McCarthy. He believes that discounters and low-price retailers may have to close stores or merge, as the plethora of chains \u2013 which include Aldi, Lidl, B&amp;M, Wilko, Savers and Home Bargains \u2013 cannot all achieve their rampant expansion plans, he says. He wants to kick off that consolidation with the 99p stores buyout. \u201cAs a consequence of a market that is fairly immature, consolidation in the market is inevitable. There is a race for space and too many stores,\u201d says McCarthy. \u201cThere will be winners and losers but we believe Poundland will be a winner.\u201d He says Poundland, which started life as a market stall in the 1990s, could not vary prices from region to region because its deals are dependent on simplicity, efficiency and high sales volume on a national scale. As McCarthy battles to persuade the CMA to clear the 99p Stores deal, he must convince the regulator he is facing relentless competition from across the market, without scaring off investors who fear shoppers will fall out of love with discounters once they have more money in their pockets. No doubt with one eye on the CMA inquiry, which will conclude in October, McCarthy says that Poundland faces more competition from the major supermarkets, along with Aldi and Lidl, than it does from the likes of 99p Stores. He says that competition, particularly on food, has got tougher over the past year as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 the big four grocers \u2013 have cut prices on basics such as bread and milk. Poundland has been forced to stop selling some items where it can no longer offer a better deal than the supermarkets, such as certain loaves of bread. On others \u2013 including a six pack of Golden Wonder Crisps or a packet of McVities Rich Tea biscuits \u2013 one or more of the supermarkets are matching the \u00a31 price tag. \u201cEvery inch of space has to work for us. If sales drop on a particular line \u2013 we do our research on pricing comparisons with the supermarkets and the others \u2013 and if value isn\u2019t there and we can\u2019t do a bigger pack size then we have to delist.\u201d Such talk is likely to soothe the regulator, but McCarthy must also reassure the market. Poundland last month revealed figures that indicated a fall in sales at established stores this spring, fuelling fears that the fashion for cut-price shopping was fading. If so, the company\u2019s plans for nearly 400 more stores in the UK might look over-ambitious, not least since rival B&amp;M wants to almost double its size to 850 outlets while Aldi and Lidl are each opening 50 to 60 new stores a year. There are also new players. Former Asda boss Andy Bond recently launched his Pep &amp; Co discounter clothing chain, while Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is experimenting beyond clothing with the launch of his Mega Value chain. \u201cThe market is there with enough growth in it that clever people are still investing,\u201d says McCarthy, adding that, while average disposable income is on the rise, the government\u2019s ongoing benefit cuts mean plenty of people will have reason to continue to seek out the best deals. McCarthy puts Poundland\u2019s recent lacklustre sales figures down to a comparison against a bumper spring last year when \u00a310m worth of loom bands flew off the shelves. \u201cPeople love value. They have had several years of getting used to the fact that they don\u2019t have to pay top dollar for things. \u201cThere is a tipping point for all customers unless they are daft. If you can buy a bottle of Perrier for \u00a31 in my shop or down the road in a nice-looking shop for \u00a31.50, then why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Poundland online? Jim McCarthy admits he\u2019s not a user of social media, but he insists Poundland still plans to launch an online store. The company has been developing a site for three years and had hoped to launch ahead of last Christmas, until the boss slammed on the brakes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right, yet. I wasn\u2019t happy it was developed enough, sufficiently attractive and easy for people. When we do launch, I want them tweeting about it and sharing it with their friends,\u201d he says. All retailers are keen to get into the online market, which is experiencing growth far ahead of the high street. But the economics are tricky for \u201cvalue\u201d stores. Poundshop.com, an online store started by Poundland founder Steve Smith, faced early difficulties while Primark experimented with selling on Asos before concluding that it could not trade profitably online.",

      "body": "<p>If you gave Poundland\u2019s chief executive a quid every time he says \u201camazing value\u201d while accompanying him to a store, your outlay would be considerably more than the \u00a34.72 that shoppers spend on an average visit.</p> <p>Checking out the bargain chain\u2019s Fulham outlet in west London, Jim McCarthy is gobsmacked by a sudden run on goldfish bowls \u2013 apparently being snapped up by students across the UK as makeshift cocktail glasses that can be shared by multiple tipplers dunking in straws. He marvels at other oddball bestsellers for the chain, such as two-for-a-pound Aloe Vera drinks which are selling more than some top drinks brands. And he is gutted that the company has sold out of selfie-sticks despite buying in tens of thousands of the gadgets. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more in,\u201d he says firmly.</p> <p>Given his background, it is no surprise the amiable 59-year-old knows how to talk a good sales pitch. Starting work, age 12, as a paper boy at newsagents Dillons in his home town of Nuneaton in the Midlands, he worked his way up through the business. He survived various takeovers to become chief executive of what was T&amp;S Stores by the time it was sold to Tesco in 2003. After an an attempt at retirement at just 47 when the T&amp;S deal made him a multi-millionaire, McCarthy moved on to run Sainsbury\u2019s convenience store business for two years before returning home to the Midlands to run Poundland in 2006, investing a \u201csix-figure sum\u201d in the business. All that experience will come in handy given the challenges he faces now.</p> <p>McCarthy has kicked off consolidation in the discount retail sector with Poundland\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/06/poundand-buys-rival-99p-stores\">\u00a355m purchase of rival 99p Stores</a> and, if the deal goes through, the company will consolidate its position as the UK\u2019s leading single-price retailer. The buy-out of 99p would add 250 extra stores to Poundland\u2019s estate of nearly 600 UK outlets, helping make a big stride forward to its target of 1,000 stores here. The company, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/14/poundland-sales-99p-stores-takeover\">topped sales of \u00a31bn this year</a>, also has more than 40 Irish stores and nine in Spain under the Dealz brand.</p> <p>But the deal requires the approval of the Competition and Markets Authority, which is mulling whether Poundland should have to sell up to 80 shops in areas where it shares customers with 99p Stores. If McCarthy gets his way, 99p Stores\u2019 shoppers will certainly see 1% inflation as the sites are rebranded, meaning they will have to pay at least a penny more per item.</p> <p>The competition regulator is examining whether gobbling up one of Poundland\u2019s few single-price rivals will give the retailer more freedom to reduce the offers shoppers get for their \u00a31 \u2013 like those two-for-a-pound Aloe Vera drinks.</p> <p>\u201cPlainly, the thought of changing pricing is not going to pay \u2013 that\u2019s not how the model works. We all know the public, even more so now than ever before, are aware of price, quality and overall value. To change the Poundland formula by doing something different is not understandable,\u201d says McCarthy.</p> <p>He believes that discounters and low-price retailers may have to close stores or merge, as the plethora of chains \u2013 which include Aldi, Lidl, B&amp;M, Wilko, Savers and Home Bargains \u2013 cannot all achieve their rampant expansion plans, he says. He wants to kick off that consolidation with the 99p stores buyout. </p> <p>\u201cAs a consequence of a market that is fairly immature, consolidation in the market is inevitable. There is a race for space and too many stores,\u201d says McCarthy. \u201cThere will be winners and losers but we believe Poundland will be a winner.\u201d He says Poundland, which started life as a market stall in the 1990s, could not vary prices from region to region because its deals are dependent on simplicity, efficiency and high sales volume on a national scale. <br></p> <p> </p> <p>As McCarthy battles to persuade the CMA to clear the 99p Stores deal, he must convince the regulator he is facing relentless competition from across the market, without scaring off investors who fear shoppers will fall out of love with discounters once they have more money in their pockets.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/18/poundland-breaks-1bn-barrier-consumer-appetite-for-bargain\">Poundland shares hit on fears discount sector may have peaked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No doubt with one eye on the CMA inquiry, which will conclude in October, McCarthy says that Poundland faces more competition from the major supermarkets, along with Aldi and Lidl, than it does from the likes of 99p Stores.</p> <p></p> <p>He says that competition, particularly on food, has got tougher over the past year as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 the big four grocers \u2013 have cut prices on basics such as bread and milk. <br></p> <p>Poundland has been forced to stop selling some items where it can no longer offer a better deal than the supermarkets, such as certain loaves of bread. On others \u2013 including a six pack of Golden Wonder Crisps or a packet of McVities Rich Tea biscuits \u2013 one or more of the supermarkets are matching the \u00a31 price tag.</p> <p>\u201cEvery inch of space has to work for us. If sales drop on a particular line \u2013 we do our research on pricing comparisons with the supermarkets and the others \u2013 and if value isn\u2019t there and we can\u2019t do a bigger pack size then we have to delist.\u201d</p> <p>Such talk is likely to soothe the regulator, but McCarthy must also reassure the market. <br></p> <p>Poundland last month revealed figures that indicated a fall in sales at established stores this spring, fuelling fears that the fashion for cut-price shopping was fading.</p> <p>If so, the company\u2019s plans for nearly 400 more stores in the UK might look over-ambitious, not least since rival B&amp;M wants to almost double its size to 850 outlets while Aldi and Lidl are each opening 50 to 60 new stores a year.

      "bodyText": "Authorities have forced protesters in kayaks from a river in Portland, Oregon, where they were trying to stop a Royal Dutch Shell icebreaker from leaving dry dock and joining an Arctic oil drilling operation. Police also tried to lower protesters who were dangling from a bridge into the water below. Sergeant Pete Simpson said safety was the main priority, and police and coast guard officers were joined by firefighters and a rope-rescue team. A federal judge in Alaska had earlier ordered Greenpeace USA to pay a fine of $2,500 for every hour that protesters continued to block the icebreaker from leaving for the Arctic. US district court judge Sharon Gleason ruled on Thursday in Anchorage that Greenpeace was in civil contempt because of protesters dangling off the bridge and impeding the vessel. Greenpeace USA executive director Annie Leonard said: \u201cShell is still trying to circumvent the growing global call to preserve the Arctic, and has turned to the courts for help.\u201d The activists hung themselves from the bridge on Wednesday at approximately 3am PT, delaying the departure of the oil company\u2019s 380ft Fennica icebreaker. The vessel was originally scheduled to leave that afternoon. The ship set out early Thursday morning local time with police escorts but stopped short of the bridge and remained idle. The US coastguard told protesters to leave but they continued to block its path. The ship then turned around and returned to dock. Other protesters, nicknamed \u201ckayaktivists\u201d, also joined Greenpeace by taking to the water below in kayaks. Gleason in May granted Shell\u2019s request that activists protesting Shell\u2019s Arctic drilling plans be ordered to stay away from Shell vessels and beyond buffer zones.
