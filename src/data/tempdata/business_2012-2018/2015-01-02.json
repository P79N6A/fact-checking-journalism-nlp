      "bodyText": "Before the blog closes, it is worth flagging up that Eurostat will publish the flash estimate of eurozone inflation for December on Wednesday next week (7 Jan). This could be a crucial moment for the currency bloc, and for Mario Draghi and his fellow policymakers at the European Central Bank. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting the eurozone will sink into deflation, with annual inflation falling to -0.1% from 0.3% in November. If economists are correct, speculation that the ECB will announce quantitative easing at its January meeting to stave off a dangerous deflationary spiral will mount. For now, here is a closing summary for today. Mario Draghi signalled the likelihood of QE in the eurozone is growing. He told German newspaper Handelsblatt the risk of the ECB not fulfilling its mandate of price stability was now higher than six months ago. Markets rose and the euro fell on the back of his comments. Markit published a snapshot of the manufacturing sector across the eurozone in December with its monthly PMIs. The surveys showed mixed fortunes but were generally overwhelming and weighed on investor sentiment. The equivalent PMI survey for the UK showed growth in the manufacturing sector slowed unexpectedly in December. Sales at John Lewis dipped 1.4% in Christmas week, compared with a year earlier. The fall was partly explained by Black Friday, as some customers brought forward purchases of electrical goods. Mortgage approvals fell in November according to the Bank of England, in the latest sign that the UK housing market is cooling... ...but lending to consumers rose at its fastest rate in almost a decade in the three months to November. Europe\u2019s major markets are now trading up again, apart from the FTSE 100 which is down by 0.1% at 6560.77. That\u2019s it for today. Thank you for reading and commenting, and please join us again next week. Have a great weekend. George Papandreou, the former Greek Prime Minister, is making a return to politics with the launch of a new party in time for the country\u2019s general election on 25 January. Papandreou, has stressed the new party will reflect the values of democracy, socialism and sustainable growth. It could shift the dynamic of the election, with the former PM potentially pulling votes from the left-wing and anti-austerity Syriza party, currently leading the polls. Gold is on course for its third weekly fall as the dollar strengthens and oil prices fall. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currencies. Spot gold fell to its lowest since 26 December at $1,172.95 an ounce. Prices were heading for a 1.6% weekly decline according to Reuters. Ole Hansen of Saxo Bank: An almost unchanged gold price in 2014 was quite impressive considering that we had a 12% rise in the dollar during the same time. But as long as we continue to see expectations for a rising dollar, investors will not start to suddenly look at gold as an investment opportunity. Brent crude oil prices have hit a fresh post-2009 low, below $56 a barrel. Oil prices have been falling partly because of a supply glut as OPEC refuses to cut production despite the sharp drop in price since the summer of 2014. Brent crude touched a low of $55.48 a barrel. Rusty Braziel, RBN Energy analyst, believes low oil prices are here to stay over the medium term. With no production cuts in the offing and a significant demand response years away, oversupply looks to be with us for a while. $100 a barrel crude oil prices are in the rear view mirror, at least for a couple of years. Low oil prices have helped to drive UK inflation lower. Currently at just 1% - half the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target - the consumer prices index is expected to fall further in early 2015. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said in December the drop in oil prices was a \u201cnet positive\u201d for the UK economy. European markets are mixed, after opening higher. Investor optimism, boosted initially by Mario Draghi\u2019s comments, has faded following an underwhelming set off manufacturing PMI reports for the eurozone and UK. FTSE 100: -0.1% at 6,560.72 France\u2019s CAC 40: -0.4% at 4,257.41 Germany\u2019s DAX 30: -0.7% at 9,737.39 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 10,350.8 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.9% at 19,176.30 While mortgage approvals fell in November, lending to British consumers rose at its fastest rate in almost a decade in the three months to November according to the Bank of England report. Consumer lending rose at annual rate of 8.3% over the period, the fastest since October 2005. It suggests consumers still have a major role to play in the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Net lending to business dropped by \u00a3149m, the smallest fall since August. Bank of England lending data this morning showed mortgage approvals for house purchase (excluding remortgaging) fell to 59,029 in November from 59,011 in October. It was the lowest since June 2013, but a smaller-than-expected fall. City economists forecast a drop to 58,000. The drop in approvals is the latest sign of a cooling housing market in the UK. Earlier this week Nationwide said the pace of UK house price growth slowed sharply in the last three months of 2014. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said November\u2019s fall in mortgage approvals amounted to \u201cmore soft news\u201d on the housing market. The pound has fallen to a 16-month low against the dollar after the weaker-than-expected UK manufacturing PMI. Sterling fell almost 1% to $1.5447. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said the pound is likely to fall further. What we have in the Bank of England is a central bank that will not look to even think about raising interest rates until it has very good reasons to do so. I think sterling\u2019s going lower for 2015. Mellor said the general election in May was also a major risk for sterling, because it could potentially leave the door open to a British exit from the European Union. That would be a \u201chuge negative\u201d for the pound, he said. In case you missed it, it is well worth reading how the collapse of courier company City Link affected one of its drivers, Mick Ward (in his words). An extract here: Christmas dinner wasn\u2019t very pleasant. It was me and my daughter and my son, my wife and my daughter\u2019s partner. We were trying to make the most of it. Obviously our minds were full of other things. You do the things you do. You have the turkey dinner and exchange presents, but it was very sombre. I just went to my bed on Christmas night about 10pm. I wasn\u2019t really in the mood. I found out [about City Link going into administration] on Christmas Eve, just about lunchtime. I got a call from the RMT [Ward is the local representative for the RMT trade union]. I was down in Ayr delivering parcels to my customers as I do every day. I then called my depot manager and it was denied. They were going around the office telling everybody: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, this is a load of nonsense.\u201d I had kiddies\u2019 Christmas presents in the van so for the sake of them I carried on. I had medical goods in the van, we deliver a lot of medical supplies to people who have quite serious illnesses. And you can\u2019t just say you are not getting them. I had bikes in the back of the van and other toys. There is no point in spoiling Christmas for other people. Read the full piece here. Our full story on the John Lewis sales dip in Christmas week is here. The figures were partly hit by the Black Friday promotional weekend at the end of November, which prompted people to bring forward purchases of electrical goods. Here are the winners and losers from this morning\u2019s eurozone manufacturing PMI\u2019s. Anything above 50 signals growth, anything below signals contraction: Ireland: 56.9 (4-month high) Spain: 53.8 (2-month low) Netherlands: 53.5 (2-month low) Germany: 51.2 (2-month high) Greece: 49.4 (4-month high) Austria: 49.2 (4-month high) Italy: 48.4 (19-month low) France: 47.5 (4-month low) Some reaction now to the UK manufacturing PMI, which showed a surprise drop in the sector\u2019s rate of growth in December. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight: This is a modestly weaker survey than expected showing that manufacturing activity eased back in December after picking up in November and October from a 17-month low in September. Nevertheless, the survey evidence still clearly points to manufacturing expansion and there are grounds to hope that the sector can enjoy a decent 2015. The weaker-than-expected December manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 survey will likely sustain strong belief that the Bank of England will not be raising interest rates before the latter months of 2015, especially as it also shows very weak price pressures. There can be no doubt that the Bank of England will kick off 2015 by keeping interest rates unchanged at 0.5% at the conclusion of the January MPC meeting next Thursday. James Knightley, economist at ING: This morning\u2019s UK\u2019s data releases show that the long hoped for economic rebalancing story is not playing out as envisaged. The manufacturing recovery remains disappointing with the December purchasing managers\u2019 index falling to 52.5 from 53.3 versus expectations of a rise to 53.6. This suggests that the manufacturing sector\u2019s growth rate will slow further, with manufacturing continuing to shrink as an overall proportion of the UK economy given the relative strength in the service sector. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays: 2014 finished on an encouraging note for the manufacturing sector, with growth still moving in the right direction despite broadly benign UK macroeconomic conditions impacting on levels of new investment. As we enter a new year, the hope is that manufacturers come flying out of the blocks with their focus firmly fixed on new export markets and investment in new product development, innovation and machinery. Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI started growing again in December. The headline index was back above the crucial 50 mark at 51.2, up from November\u2019s 17-month low of 49.5. Factories in Europe\u2019s largest economy scaled up production as new orders rose. Markit\u2019s economist, Oliver Kolodseike: Some relief was offered by December\u2019s survey results, as the PMI edged back into expansion territory and new orders returned to growth. Moreover, companies scaled up their production levels and hired additional workers in order to meet higher business requirements. However, it is too early to say whether or not the manufacturing economy has entered the fast lane again or whether the uptick in the data is just a temporary bright spot. The dip in December\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI was unexpected. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the pace of growth to pick up slightly, forecasting 53.7 for the headline index. Manufacturers remained reliant on domestic orders last month, with new export orders flat. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, gives some context to the figures: The latest survey provides further evidence of the ongoing slowdown in the UK manufacturing sector, with output and new order growth easing to their second-weakest rates during the past year-and-a- half. Despite this end of year tapering, the sector still performed well over 2014 as a whole, with growth averaging at its highest since 2010. The positives to come out of the December readings are the continued growth, further solid increases to workforce numbers, a supportive domestic market that is driving new contract wins and the broad-base of the upturn across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries. The main weak spot remains exports, with overseas new order inflows stagnating amid weaker economic growth in key markets and the ongoing lethargy of the euro area. Breaking: The UK manufacturing PMI index has slipped to a three-month low of 52.5 in December from 53.3 in November. Output, new orders and employment all grew at a slower pace. More to follow. Over the final quarter of 2014, the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector grew at the slowest rate since the current recovery started in third quarter of 2013. The manufacturing PMI, combined with the equivalent survey for the services sector, suggests the eurozone economy grew by just 0.1% in the fourth quarter according to the Markit\u2019s calculations. That would be a slowdown compared with third-quarter growth of 0.1%. There was a mild improvement in new order books in December, which rose for the first time in four months, driven by new export business. Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist: Eurozone factory activity more or less stagnated again in December, rounding off a year which saw an initial, promising-looking upturn fade away and stall in the second half of the year. The crisis in Ukraine and a renewed lack of confidence in the ability of euro area policymakers to revive the region\u2019s economy appear to have been the main catalysts to fuel increased economic uncertainty, causing companies to grow more risk averse and pull back on expansion plans. Expectations have risen that the ECB will also announce more aggressive policy stimulus in the New Year once it has had time to assess current policy initiatives. The overall weakness of the eurozone PMI supports the case for more stimulus. Perhaps Mario Draghi should get those money printing presses rolling now... Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI for the eurozone as a whole shows activity was flat at the end of the year. The headline index remained in growth territory - just - at 50.6 compared with 50.1 in November. The manufacturing PMI\u2019s keep on coming. The French survey paints a negative picture of the sector. The headline index fell to 47.5 in December from 48.4 in November. Output fell for a seventh month, reflecting a drop in new orders. Jobs were lost at the fastest rate since August. Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector shrank at the fastest rate in more than a year-and-a-half according to the Markit PMI. The headline index of activity fell to 48.4 last month from 49 in December, where anything below 50 signals contractions. It was the lowest in 19 months and the third successive month of contraction. Manufacturers shed staff at the fastest rate in more than a year-and-a-half. The one bright spot to the report was a continued growth of orders from abroad. Phil Smith, economist at Markit:\uf0a7 The manufacturing sector\u2019s performance has deteriorated throughout the final quarter, with the PMI posting its worst reading for 19 months in December. Factories have cut back production amid falling intakes of new orders, particularly among domestic clients, and this trend looks set continue as new business fell to the greatest extent for over a year-and-half in December and backlogs were depleted sharply. Without the support from export sales, the situation would be worse still. The department store chain John Lewis has reported a 1.4% sales decline in the week to 27 December, compared with the same week in 2013. However, sales increased by 19% on Christmas Day itself, as customers put the crackers and turkey down to do a spot of online shopping. Mark Lewis, online director at John Lewis, said the dip in sales over Christmas week probably had something to do with the fact that the figures included one less day of clearance sales. \u201cThe fall of the calendar is such that we would expect to see some of this clearance demand fall into next weeks numbers,\u201d he said. On the first day of trading in 2015, European markets have opened slightly up, boosted by Mario Draghi\u2019s hints that the ECB will be pumping more stimulus into the eurozone soon. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,572.81 France\u2019s CAC 40: +0.5% at 4,292.78 Germany\u2019s DAX 30: +0.3% at 9,832.82 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1% at 10,378.5 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.7% at 19,145.24 So Spain\u2019s manufacturing sector was still growing in December according to the Markit PMI but at a slower pace than November (which was an 89-month high). Output and new orders grew at weaker rates but job creation at Spanish factories was the strongest since mid-2007, and companies raised their prices for the first time in five months. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the report: December\u2019s PMI results provide further welcome news for the Spanish manufacturing sector. Output continued to expand at a solid pace and manufacturers were able to further obtain new contracts despite raising their charges marginally. Furthermore, workers are increasingly feeling the benefit of growth with many companies continuing to expand their staff levels. The combination of increased new business, work in the pipeline and rising employment suggest that production growth should continue in the New Year. BREAKING: Spain\u2019s manufacturing PMI has dropped to 53.8 in December from 54.7 in November (where anything above 50 indicates growth). The euro has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in four and a half years. The ECB\u2019s Mario Draghi has fanned expectations that the ECB will announce more stimulus (potentially QE) measures at its January meeting, helping to drive the euro to $1.2035, the lowest since June 2010. Draghi also said in his interview with German paper Handelsblatt that there would be no eurozone break-up. A break-up of the eurozone? That will not happen. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no plan B. Happy New Year! Welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. For those of you commuters back at work this morning, read our story on today\u2019s rail fare increases here. Passengers and unions will be protesting outside stations across the UK this morning. It was always going to be a big year for Mario Draghi, the eloquent president of the European Central Bank, and he has started 2015 with another signal that the ECB is ready to push the button on quantitative easing. Draghi said the risk of the ECB not fulfilling its mandate of price stability - achieving inflation of close to but below 2% - was now higher than six months ago. In an interview with Handelsblatt, the German financial newspaper, Draghi said: The risk that we do not fulfil our mandate of price stability is higher than six months ago. We are in technical preparations to adjust the size , speed and compositions of our measures in early 2015, should it become necessary to react to a too long period of low inflation. There is unanimity with the governing council on this. Eurozone inflation is just 0.3% and with low oil prices and fragile growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter, inflationary pressures remain weak. The big question on investor minds is whether the ECB will opt for full-blown QE - purchasing government bonds - this year in a bid to avoid a nasty deflationary trap. Spain and Greece are already in deflation. We will get the latest data from the eurozone later this morning when Markit publishes its manufacturing PMI surveys for December.",

I wasn\u2019t really in the mood.<br></p> <p>I found out [about City Link going into administration] on Christmas Eve, just about lunchtime. I got a call from the RMT [Ward is the local representative for the RMT trade union]. I was down in Ayr delivering parcels to my customers as I do every day. I then called my depot manager and it was denied. They were going around the office telling everybody: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, this is a load of nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>I had kiddies\u2019 Christmas presents in the van so for the sake of them I carried on. I had medical goods in the van, we deliver a lot of medical supplies to people who have quite serious illnesses. And you can\u2019t just say you are not getting them. I had bikes in the back of the van and other toys. There is no point in spoiling Christmas for other people.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/01/redundant-city-link-worker\">Read the full piece here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a672cde4b048dfa4053c53\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-02T10:31:20.897Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/02/john-lewis-christmas-week-sales-black-friday\">Our full story on the John Lewis sales dip in Christmas week is here</a>. </p> <p>The figures were partly hit by the Black Friday promotional weekend at the end of November, which prompted people to bring forward purchases of electrical goods.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a66c64e4b0fa04a20dc09e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-02T10:25:47.233Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the winners and losers from this morning\u2019s eurozone manufacturing PMI\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "Sales at John Lewis fell back 1.4% in Christmas week as purchases of electrical goods were pulled forward by the Black Friday promotional weekend. While fashion and home furnishing sales rose strongly in the week to 27 December, sales of electrical goods fell back 14.7% compared with the same week the previous year, with the overall total falling 1.4%. Sales were hit after shoppers splashed out during the Black Friday promotional weekend in late November, which proved the peak week for John Lewis in 2014. The figures were also depressed because Christmas week in 2014 included one fewer day of clearance sales than a year ago. \u201cThe fall of the calendar is such that we would expect to see some of this clearance demand fall into next week\u2019s numbers,\u201d said Mark Lewis, online director at John Lewis. The weak performance came despite a 19% increase in sales on Christmas Day itself and a 30% rise in click-and-collect online orders being picked up from stores by shoppers. John Lewis said Christmas Day sales had peaked at 9pm \u201cas customers shopped from their mobile devices while also watching Downton Abbey in the background.\u201d The department store\u2019s performance will raise fears that profit margins for electricals retailers will have taken a hit over Christmas as shoppers spent their budget on early Black Friday deals rather than full-price gifts. Neil Saunders, at retail consultancy Conlumino, said: \u201cThe distortion of Black Friday is clearly not as helpful as retailers would have wished. In essence, it has been an exercise of selling the same volumes but doing so at a discounted margin. We expect there to be a negative impact on profitability at a number of players as further Christmas results filter through.\u201d John Lewis\u2019s sister chain Waitrose enjoyed a strong end to the year as sales of sparkling wines, whisky and turkey crowns helped the upmarket grocer outperform its bigger rivals, with sales up 6.5% in the two weeks to 27 December. Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said the chain had enjoyed better than anticipated sales in the run up to New Year\u2019s Eve after a steady Christmas fortnight. \u201cWe had some good strong figures and like-for-like growth,\u201d he said. Price added that a problem with the retailer\u2019s online systems which delayed orders on the Sunday before Christmas by a few hours was a \u201cminor blip\u201d and that shoppers\u2019 hunger for fine wines, pre-prepared and luxury foods had all helped lift sales. Sales of sparkling wine rose 20% in the two weeks to 27 December compared with last year while sales of frozen lobster were up 51% and \u201ctop-tier\u201d luxury cheeses were up 35.7%. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over the last few years people are moving towards added-value,\u201d said Price, adding that Waitrose was likely to have outperformed its bigger rivals. The grocery market is struggling amid price deflation of between 1% and 2%. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see that growth would be strong,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if people are selling the same volumes their sales will be down.\u201d The UK\u2019s three stock-market listed grocers \u2013 Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 are all scheduled to release their trading figures next week in what is thought to have been a tough festive season for the major supermarkets. The big four, which also includes Asda, are being squeezed as shoppers increasingly turn to upmarket chains Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer as well as discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco boss Dave Lewis will also be updating the market on his plans to fight back against falling sales and profits, and it is hoped he will confirm an improvement in trading which has already been indicated by market share data from analysts at Kantar Worldpanel.",

      "bodyText": "Growth in the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed at the end of 2014, raising further doubts about the government\u2019s success in rebalancing the economy away from property, services and shopping. Manufacturing activity, which accounts for around 10% of economic output, fell to a three-month low in December, according to the widely watched CIPS/Markit survey of purchasing managers. The headline index fell to 52.5 in December, down from 53.3 in October and November. Anything over 50 is counted as expansion. Although manufacturing activity has now increased for 22 straight months in a row, the slowdown is a blow to government hopes of boosting British exports, a key plank of a rebalancing drive that is supported by the three mainstream political parties. Manufacturing businesses continued to win new orders, but largely as a result of domestic demand, rather than export orders. Many manufacturing companies were hiring new staff to clear backlogs of orders and employment in the sector has increased for 20 months in a row. Companies told CIPS/Markit that demand from North America and the Middle East was improving, while the picture for the eurozone was mixed, with some businesses reporting new orders and others recording a decline. A separate survey showed that manufacturing industry in the eurozone was hardly growing. The headline index was just in growth territory: it rose to 50.6 in December compared to 50.1 in November. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cThe latest survey provides further evidence of the ongoing slowdown in the UK manufacturing sector, with output and new order growth easing to their second-weakest rates during the past year and a half. Despite this end-of-year tapering, the sector still performed well over 2014 as a whole, with growth averaging at its highest since 2010. \u201cThe positives to come out of the December readings are the continued growth, further solid increases to workforce numbers, a supportive domestic market that is driving new contract wins and the broad base of the upturn across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries. The main weak spot remains exports, with overseas new order inflows stagnating amid weaker economic growth in key markets and the ongoing lethargy of the euro area.\u201d Sterling dropped against the dollar to $1.5502 from $1.5585 in the minutes following the publication of the survey. James Knightley at ING Bank described the manufacturing data as disappointing: \u201cThe long-hoped-for economic rebalancing story is not playing out as envisaged.\u201d He expects that manufacturing will continue to shrink as an overall proportion of the UK economy, given the relative strength in the service sector.",
