      "bodyText": "Vicky Pryce has just written a book in which she argues that Greece could never have lived within the euro and economic Armageddon was an inevitability. The book, niftily titled Greekonomics, is an interesting and accessible polemic. Before writing it, Pryce was a top civil servant, joint head of the UK's government economic service, and before that she had a senior job in the City. An interesting and impressive career. But none of this is half as interesting as her marriage to Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne and the extraordinary acrimony with which it ended. In June 2010, Huhne discovered that the News Of The World was about to expose the affair he had been having with his former press aide, Carina Trimingham. At the time, he was watching a World Cup football match on television. During half-time, he told Pryce he was having a relationship with Trimingham, that the tabloid was about to reveal all and that he was going to leave his wife of 26 years for his lover. Trimingham, a bisexual who had been living in a civil partnership, was regarded as a family friend and would sometimes stay at their home. Huhne then went off to write a pre-emptive statement about their separation to scoop the scoop and salvage his career, before heading off to the gym to carry on with life as normal. When he returned to the house, Pryce had dumped his clothes on the doorstep in plastic bags, and within a week had filed for divorce. And that was barely the start of it. A few months after their divorce, the Sunday Times wondered whether it was true Huhne had asked someone to accept speeding penalty points for him so he could avoid a ban. Pryce claimed it was. It was hard to know if it was a throwaway remark or a deliberate attempt to blacken his reputation. Either way, it looked as if Pryce was having a dig at her former husband, and that would be the end of it. Only it wasn't. In February, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that charges were to be brought for perverting the course of justice \u2013 not just against him, but against her, too. Huhne, who had stressed his family values in campaigning leaflets, resigned as energy secretary. By now the story had all the makings of a modern Greek tragedy, with a dollop of farce thrown in for good measure. Just when it looked as if things couldn't get any more vicious, they did. Huhne and Pryce appeared in court \u2013 while he indicated he would be trying to get the charge struck out, claiming he had no case to answer, she pleaded not guilty, using an ancient defence of marital coercion. The case is expected to be heard this autumn. Over the past two years, another astonishing thing happened. Huhne, once so visible in the media, disappeared off the radar, while Pryce, once the invisible civil servant, became omnipresent on shows such as Newsnight as the expert on Greece. To some it looked like poetic justice. Today, Pryce and I meet at the former marital home in south London. The house is old, large and beautiful \u2013 paintings hang off every wall, rooms are crammed with antique furniture, pictures of her five children parade the mantelpiece (two from her first marriage, three with Huhne). So many pictures of Pryce in happy times \u2013 receiving one of her three professorships, with the kids at the Olympics in Athens. The one notable absence in the family photos is Huhne \u2013 it is as if he's been airbrushed out of history, Trotsky-style. On tables and shelves books are piled high, many of them about power: David Lipsey's In The Corridors Of Power has pride of place on one ornate table; on another is a book about \"the power smile\". Pryce, who grew up in Greece as Vasiliki Courmouzis, is assertive, clipped, immaculately dressed and super-slim. She puts on lippy, rubs Clinique into her cheeks and readies herself for the photographer. \"Would you like some coffee?\" She says she is nervous because her daughter has just gone into labour. The phone rings: a different daughter. \"Yes, darling, yes, darling, right, darling. I'm just doing an interview, OK, darling?\" She gestures that I should head downstairs to the study while she finishes her conversation. As I sit down, I slop coffee on a wooden chair, wipe it clean with a tissue and put my cup on the desk. A couple of minutes later, Pryce walks in and says she will sit in the chair. I suggest I give it a final wipe because of the spill. \"Oh!\" she says. Her face freezes. She points to a stain on the desk. \"Did you spill a bit of the coffee here?\" She looks terrifying. \"I don't think so,\" I whimper. \"I think you did.\" \"I'm so sorry,\" I whimper some more. \"Will it stay there for ever?\" \"Yep, I assume so. It doesn't matter. Right.\" She finishes wiping, looks up, smiles and we start afresh with Greekonomics. She started writing the book only a few months ago and is rushing through the final proofs. It's all go, what with the deadline, last night's appearance on Sky News reviewing the papers, jetting off to Greece tonight, and the imminent arrival of grandchild number three. I ask if any of the children still live at home. \"I have a chap who's just gone to university, my youngest\u2026 He's at Oxford. Studying English.\" The daughter who's about to give birth also studied English and went on to work as a journalist. \"I do say to them all being a journalist really helps. You learn to put words together fast, so if you then wanted to become a proper writer, it's a really important thing to do.\" Pryce, 60, says that, despite everything, it's been an amazing time for her. Of course, family and friends knew she was Greek, but the media didn't appear to have cottoned on. Then she makes one appearance on telly talking about the Greek economy, and suddenly she's everywhere. \"I have to say it's been a good crisis for me in the sense that the Greek connection has been helpful.\" She smiles and says she has been the voice of reason \u2013 somebody who can speak up for the Greeks but who isn't blind to their failings. So she talks about the stereotypes peddled of lazy, tax-avoiding Greeks, how the austerity measures are recklessly punitive, how the Greeks don't help themselves by larging it in front of the world, and the impact the Greek crisis has had on the rest of us. Her speech is pedantic; a curious mix of bossy and diffident. She often corrects herself before a sentence is complete. \"The Greek crisis was used as an excuse, if you like, or justification rather \u2013 so cross out excuse \u2013 for the coalition government's austerity package itself, saying we don't want to be like Greece and have to go through a bailout.\" For years, she has argued against the euro. Put simply, she says, there is no corrective mechanism if a country suffers an economic shock and doesn't have its own exchange rate and monetary policy. The way she tells it, she was pretty much a lone voice raging against the fiscal lunacy of the rest of the world. \"I gave a talk in Holland that was slightly anti-euro and they thought I was completely off the mark. I sat next to this Portuguese corporate treasurer who turned to me and said, 'Interesting what you say. You know, in Portugal, there are only two academics who were against the euro and one of them is certifiably mad.' And that was it. He didn't speak to me for the rest of the evening.\" I ask her to name the dummkopfs who opposed her. \"Erm, there were loads of pro-euro people around at the time.\" One with whom she most vehemently disagreed was her former husband, but she doesn't mention him. Perhaps it's part of the airbrushing. Instead, she looks at the desk and the dreaded stain. \"You'll be pleased to know it's disappeared. It's practically gone.\" She smiles. Pryce talks convincingly about Greece, especially the need for growth and hope. And she has been doing so for the best part of an hour. But there is a huge Huhne-shaped pachyderm in the room. The more she talks, the more I think, why did this woman risk everything just to dump her former husband in it? She tells me that now she'd like to go into politics, and that life as a civil servant is the best possible preparation. Which might well be true, but it's not going to happen if she ends up with a criminal record, or even serves time in jail. Did she realise what she was getting into when she brought up the penalty points, and has it been worth it? \"I can't talk about that at all.\" \"Does it worry you that you could go to jail?\" \"I really can't comment about it, but obviously I'm looking forward to the whole thing being behind me.\" It's easy to understand why she was so bitter. As well as the betrayal, there was the fallout. Suddenly Pryce, a woman who had achieved so much in her own right, became primarily known as the victim of a louse husband. Does she resent being known as Mrs Chris Huhne? \"Well, I have to live with it, but I kept my name throughout. The funny thing is, at the time, a lot of people wrote to me saying, 'Good grief, I never knew you were married to Chris Huhne. I always knew you as Vicky Pryce.'\" She mentions how visible she was before becoming a civil servant. \"I was on practically every conference programme you could think of. I would do keynote speeches on this, that and the other.\" And, she says, she still managed to bring up five children. I tell her I'm slightly confused \u2013 I'd read that she had sacrificed her career for Huhne. \"No, that's not true at all. No, the story was that I had moved jobs to fit in with what my husband was doing.\" And that was true? \"Yes, I have at times changed jobs to fit in. For example, I was travelling hugely for a while and when my then husband became an MP, I had to stop doing that.\" Was that an easy decision? \"No, of course not.\" Did he ever change to accommodate her? \"You can look that one up, and the answer is no.\" At times, Pryce verges on the invincible, at others she seems brittle. Does she think of herself as a strong woman? \"No,\" she says instantly. Why not? \"Because I have huge moments of weakness.\" But she has managed to come through the hurt and humiliation of all this, has written a book, established herself as a media pundit\u2026 \"Well, I had to carry on for the children mainly. They depend on me. We're a very close family.\" Some people might have found themselves unable to carry on, however much they wanted to. \"Well, there are many moments when I don't feel strong at all, but I carry on. In fact, sometimes I do wonder how I do this thing, how I go from A to B, because it just has to be done, it's the only way to stay sane.\" Huhne and Pryce were known as a power couple. Every year, they held a huge post-Davos party at their home, following the annual meeting for political and business elites. It came around again soon after she and Huhne split up, and Pryce decided to go ahead with the bash anyway. Was that a tough decision? \"It's interesting you're asking that. I had the party because of popular demand.\" Because she put on such a good spread? \"No, they all wanted to make sure I carried on.\" Who are \"they\"? \"My friends. Friends in high places.\" She says it so quietly, I'm not sure if I've heard right, so I ask again. \"Friends in high places, if you like,\" she says louder. \"Lots of people thought I really had to do it. It was solidarity, actually.\" The thing I find most puzzling is that she is so determined to become a politician \u2013 in fact, she has said she'd love to be chancellor, a job Huhne would have been rather partial to himself. Would this be a reinvention of herself? \"Yes, you could call it a reinvention. As an economist, in particular, I've always said to everybody I've ever worked with that you've got to continuously reinvent yourself because nothing stays still.\" Hasn't her experience of being married to a politician put her off politics? \"I have all sorts of contradictory feelings. One becomes terribly single-minded about politics to the exclusion of everything else. Or you can be. Also, it can take away your integrity.\" How? \"Well, people lie to get whatever they want done. And they back-stab each other and all that stuff.\" She stops to clarify. \"I'm not thinking of just one person, I'm thinking of lots of people.\" Of course. \"What is really important in politics is to have more integrity. I had always thought women can change that considerably, because we have children and we worry about them. There are lots of men who are like that as well, but they are not the ones who end up in politics. We need more normal women in politics. Because a lot more matters in life \u2013 like keeping your marriage and family going.\" She talks about all the things she's currently balancing \u2013 her work, worries about her daughter in labour, tonight's flight to Greece which she's just decided not to go on. Is she saying that, in general, women are better at compromise and that's what would make them better politicians? \"Yes. Therefore they might actually make decisions that are not necessarily based on complete and utter selfish promotion of themselves.\" I tell her I have heard that the children no longer talk to Huhne. \"I'm not saying it. I haven't said it. People have been talking.\" So we return to her possible future in politics. Does she really think there would be room for both her and Huhne in the higher echelons of the Lib Dem party? \"All I can say is the party has been very kind and open to me since the whole thing happened.\" But there might be those who say her determination to rise Phoenix-like out of Huhne's ashes has about it a whiff of vengeance. How would she respond to that? \"Frankly, I wouldn't respond at all. All I would say again is that the party as a whole has been very, very kind.\" \u2022 Greekonomics, by Vicky Pryce, is published by Biteback at \u00a312.99.

      "bodyText": "Eurozone finance ministers hinted on Friday that Greece may be given more time to pay its debts, though they ruled out a third bailout, which most economists believe will be needed before Athens can get back on its feet. At a meeting of the 17-nation currency bloc in Nicosia, Cyprus, there were signs of increasing flexibility and optimism, but Spain appeared to be moving closer to making a formal request for financial assistance. The Greek finance minister said the atmosphere had eased after previously strained talks between Athens and its creditors and a deal could be signed before the end of October. \"It seems to us quite clear that Greece has already produced a huge effort but will have to continue to do so,\" said IMF boss Christine Lagarde. \"And the target when it comes to achieving debt sustainability is very high, so there are various ways to adjust: time is one, and that needs to be considered as an option.\" Stock markets rallied across the world, continuing a strong run since the ECB said it was prepared to lend unlimited amounts to distressed sovereign nations, though with strict conditions. The FTSE jumped 95 points to 5915 while the French CAC leaped 2.3% to 3581. The new Greek coalition government is seeking a two-year extension to 2016 for meeting a budget reduction programme. The threat of a general strike and violent protests over a further round of cuts that will result in 50,000 public sector job losses have strengthened the hand of Greek negotiators, along with predictions that a five-year recession will result in a total 20% fall in GDP in 2013. But the smiles among finance ministers as the meeting closed disguise huge disquiet at protests in Spain and Portugal this week. Spain, deflecting pressure to spell out whether it needs more European financial support, told eurozone finance ministers it will set clear deadlines for structural economic reforms by the end of the month. \"We will adopt a new set of reforms to boost growth \u2026 It will be in line with the recommendations of the European commission,\" economy minister Luis de Guindos said. However, Madrid is in deep financial trouble and faces calls from several of its regions for the country to break up rather than continue deep austerity cuts. More than 1 million people marched in Barcelona this week in favour of Catalan independence . There was also confusion in Spain over the stance on a proposed \u20ac300bn bailout package that is understood to be under discussion in Brussels between EU officials and Mariano Rajoy's right of centre government. Several eurozone officials have speculated that Spain may apply in time for the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers, on October 8, while Rajoy has dismissed talk of a further bailout. He is also resisting the terms of the bond buying programme announced by the ECB, which he says is draconian and would intensify the cuts imposed on welfare spending. Spain's 2013 budget and a detailed audit of the capital needs of its banking sector are both due in a fortnight.",

    "webTitle": "Sweden's Handelsbanken - the publicity-shy bank with a growing empire", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Captain Mainwaring style of banking is back. At Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which has been opening UK branches at the rate of one every 10 days for the past year or more, staff do not earn bonuses for selling customers products they do not want, and those customers can speak to their branch manager rather than going through to a call centre. The bank's 137-strong network, with 1,100 staff, already spreads from Truro in the south west of England to Aberdeen in Scotland . That is more branches than publicity-hungry Virgin Money has after buying the 74 from nationalised Northern Rock at the start of the year. Yet many Britons may will never have heard of it. There is no billboard advertising or sports sponsorship. As Anders Bouvin, chief executive of the UK business, explains it relies on word of mouth among small business and current account customers. Such rapid expansion might be cause for alarm but with the government encouraging challengers to take on the \"big four\" and get lending to small business, Handelsbanken can be ambitious. \"I can't see that there is any to reason to reduce that rate [of branch opening], if anything it would increase,\" said Bouvin. Even so, questions about a target number of branches or sales are brushed aside as Handelsbanken \u2013 which has had a presence in the UK since 1982 \u2013 does not have a marketing department or budget. It has lent more than \u00a39bn since 2008, still a tiny fraction of the amount of loans granted in the banking system each year. \"It's all about seeing opportunities when they arise,\" he said. Many of the principles that trip off Bouvin's tongue as he explains the culture of the bank \u2013 which was on its knees 40 years ago before Swedish businessman Jan Wallander stepped in and devised the ethos that survives today \u2013 sound similar to those uttered by UK bankers currently trying to repair their battered reputations. \"You've got to understand your customers' needs, their dreams,\" said Bouvin. \"It's a good business if you have satisfied customers,\" he said. There is no command and control function. The head office does not take day-to-day decisions on lending. Each of Bouvin's branch managers is in control, reporting in to its main London office \u2013 with its striking views of Tower Bridge \u2013 via three regional offices in London, Birmingham and Manchester. A fourth regional office will open in Bristol next year. He asks who is going to know the needs of customers better \u2013 \"people like me in this ivory tower or local people who are geographically closer to their customers?\" The model is built upon the one used by the Swedish parent company. After its financial meltdown in the 1970s, Wallander stepped in to unwind what he regarded as US management methods which had made it too centralised, taking two months to approve a loan. Bouvin talks about the \"church spire principle\". He says: \"Every branch has its defined market area. It shouldn't be larger than you can see if you crawl up to the top of the local church tower.\" Unlike other banks, its branches do not have signs displaying loan rates or savings products in their windows. It does not appear in best buy tables. Every product is bespoke. This lack of price transparency and cherry-picking of customers is one area of potential criticism. Bouvin sees it differently. \"Our customers are in control of their finances.\" When asked whether such a decentralised approach leaves the bank vulnerable to branch managers being lax or hiding problem loans, he is also robust. \"Our track record proves the opposite.\" Putting confidence in staff makes them careful, he said. And there are no bonuses or sales targets which might encourage risk-taking. Instead a profit-share type operation \u2013 known as Oktogonen (after the bank's octogon logo) \u2013 was set up in 1973. If the bank has achieved a better return on equity than its peers in any year then a contribution is made into Oktogonen which is then tied up, largely in Handelsbanken shares, until the recipient turns 60. Niels Kroner, in his book about the bank, wrote that it \"has the ethos of a well-functioning 19th-century civil service\". He said: \"The staff are no geniuses perhaps but talented and moderately ambitious people who are motivated to do what is right because it is right, not because it earns them a financial reward.\" Fair shares The six or so Handelsbanken staff who joined the bank's profit-sharing scheme when it was set up in 1973 and are still in employment could now be in line for a \u00a3900,000 nest egg at 60 \u2013 the age at which they can cash in the units for the first time. The system, named Oktogonen after the bank's octogon logo, lies at the heart of how the bank operates. Instead of the bonuses typical of other banks, money is allocated to the fund when the bank is more profitable than its rivals. Every employee, from the most junior to the most senior, receives the same allocation. About 90% of the funds are used to buy Handelsbanken shares and locked up until the member turns 60. However, this scheme has run into the trouble in the UK and has not been able to make allocations to staff for the last two years, when tax laws changed and exposed employees to double taxation when the units are allocated and cashed in. The bank is still looking for a solution to the problem.",

At Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which has been opening UK branches at the rate of one every 10 days for the past year or more, staff do not earn bonuses for selling customers products they do not want, and those customers can speak to their branch manager rather than going through to a call centre.</p> <p>The bank's 137-strong network, with 1,100 staff, already spreads from Truro in the south west of England to Aberdeen in Scotland . That is more branches than publicity-hungry Virgin Money has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/08/virgin-money-takes-over-northern-rock\" title=\"\">after buying the 74 from nationalised Northern Rock at the start of the year</a>.</p> <p>Yet many Britons may will never have heard of it.

As Anders Bouvin, chief executive of the UK business, explains it relies on word of mouth among small business and current account customers.</p> <p>Such rapid expansion might be cause for alarm but with the government encouraging challengers to take on the \"big four\" and get lending to small business, Handelsbanken can be ambitious. \"I can't see that there is any to reason to reduce that rate [of branch opening], if anything it would increase,\" said Bouvin.</p> <p>Even so, questions about a target number of branches or sales are brushed aside as Handelsbanken \u2013 which has had a presence in the UK since 1982 \u2013 does not have a marketing department or budget. It has lent more than \u00a39bn since 2008, still a tiny fraction of the amount of loans granted in the banking system each year. \"It's all about seeing opportunities when they arise,\" he said.</p> <p>Many of the principles that trip off Bouvin's tongue as he explains the culture of the bank \u2013 which was on its knees 40 years ago before Swedish businessman Jan Wallander stepped in and devised the ethos that survives today \u2013 sound similar to those uttered by UK bankers currently trying to repair their battered reputations. \"You've got to understand your customers' needs, their dreams,\" said Bouvin.</p> <p>\"It's a good business if you have satisfied customers,\" he said.</p> <p>There is no command and control function. The head office does not take day-to-day decisions on lending.

It doesn't work. We need sound money, low tax rates, fiscal discipline, regulatory certainty and we need to stop this notion of a government-driven economy.\"</p> <p>On 23 August he <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlows-money-politics/314897/one-one-paul-ryan#\">made the same case</a> to CNBC's Larry Kudlow: \"We want to pursue a sound money strategy so that we can get back the king dollar, as you say it, Larry. Number two, I'm not a fan of more stimulus or more easing. I think the benefits are clearly outweighed by the long-term costs of this. There \u2013 it's not working, and all this loose money from the Fed is basically bailing out the fact President Obama has failed on fiscal policy. The Fed can't keep bailing out bad fiscal policy. We need to get our fiscal policy right.\"</p> <p>So where is Ryan now? His would-be boss Mitt Romney sort of discussed the Fed's move on ABC's Good Morning America on Friday: \"What Bernanke's doing is saying that what the president's saying is wrong. The president's saying the economy's making progress, coming back. Bernanke's saying, 'No, it's not. I've got to print more money.\"</p> <p>But so far there has been no real critique of QE3.</p> <p>All very strange really, especially as Ryan appears to have picked in part for his hardline financial philosophy and not just his puppy dog eyes. The Dow is soaring Friday and hit highs unseen since 2007 on Thursday. Perhaps Ryan has been muzzled while the Republicans wait to see if and when the rally will subside.</p> <p>He did mention America's debts .

      "bodyText": "Almost 24 hours after the Federal Reserve announced another blockbuster programme to prop up the US's lackluster economy, one of its biggest critics remains strangely silent. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, has yet to comment on Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's plan to inject $40bn into the US economy every month for the foreseeable future. Spotted by CBS reporter Sarah Boxer on his way to House speaker John Boehner's office yesterday, all he had to say was: \"Oh, I'm just here to see some of my friends.\" Ahead of the announcement Ryan was far more outspoken, specifically coming out against a third round of quantitative easing (QE3) from the Fed in an interview with financial news channel CNBC on 7 September. \"I think QE3 \u2013 I think QE \u2013 the costs outweigh the benefits in my personal opinion,\" said Ryan. \"If borrowing and spending and regulating and taxing was the secret to economic success, we would be entering a golden age along with Greece,\" Ryan said. \"It's not. It doesn't work. We need sound money, low tax rates, fiscal discipline, regulatory certainty and we need to stop this notion of a government-driven economy.\" On 23 August he made the same case to CNBC's Larry Kudlow: \"We want to pursue a sound money strategy so that we can get back the king dollar, as you say it, Larry. Number two, I'm not a fan of more stimulus or more easing. I think the benefits are clearly outweighed by the long-term costs of this. There \u2013 it's not working, and all this loose money from the Fed is basically bailing out the fact President Obama has failed on fiscal policy. The Fed can't keep bailing out bad fiscal policy. We need to get our fiscal policy right.\" So where is Ryan now? His would-be boss Mitt Romney sort of discussed the Fed's move on ABC's Good Morning America on Friday: \"What Bernanke's doing is saying that what the president's saying is wrong. The president's saying the economy's making progress, coming back. Bernanke's saying, 'No, it's not. I've got to print more money.\" But so far there has been no real critique of QE3. All very strange really, especially as Ryan appears to have picked in part for his hardline financial philosophy and not just his puppy dog eyes. The Dow is soaring Friday and hit highs unseen since 2007 on Thursday. Perhaps Ryan has been muzzled while the Republicans wait to see if and when the rally will subside. He did mention America's debts . But still nothing on Ben. And then he was off to the safety of sports. Whatever happened to: no Ben no?",
