      "bodyText": "Water firms have been criticised by the industry watchdog after it found the amount of water lost to leakages had increased for the second consecutive year. Nine of the private companies that supply water in England and Wales failed to meet their targets on cutting leakage in the year to April, according to the report by the Consumer Council for Water (CCWater). It found that leakages increased by 1.5% in 2017-18 on the previous year, to 3,170m litres per day. \u201cWe know that consumers are more likely to use water wisely if they can see their water company is doing the same by tackling leaks,\u201d said Karen Gibbs, the consumer group\u2019s senior policy manager. \u201cWater companies must take action to reduce leakage and improve the resilience of their networks if they want to encourage consumers to commit to using water wisely themselves. \u201cAlthough companies do have plans to reduce leakage in 2020-25, their customers will expect to see this happening now.\u201d She said the greatest increases in leakage were the responsibility of Portsmouth Water, whose losses rose by 8.2%. CCWater said Thames lost the most through leakage on a per property, per day basis \u2013 181.6 litres. In June, the firm was ordered to pay back \u00a365m to customers over its failure to tackle the leaks. It was also hit with \u00a355m in automatic penalties for failing to fulfil its promise to do so. The best performers were Southern and Essex &amp; Suffolk, which reported losing 79.6 and 81.2 litres per property, per day in 2017-18. CCWater is an independent statutory body that is sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and represents consumers in England and Wales. A spokesman for the regulator, Ofwat, said: \u201cThese figures are further evidence that we need a game change across the water sector. \u201cWe\u2019ve thrown down the gauntlet for water companies to cut leakage by 170bn litres a year \u2013 enough to meet the needs of everyone in Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and Cardiff combined \u2013 3.1 million people. \u201cAs we have demonstrated recently, any company which isn\u2019t getting to grips with leakages will face consequences.\u201d A spokesperson for Water UK, which represents the firms, said: \u201cLeakage is a big priority for the industry. We know how important it is for customers, and since the mid-1990s companies have successfully managed to reduce leakage levels by a third. But we also know there is more to do, which is why water companies are currently developing ambitious plans to cut leakage even further.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ministers will ban the sale of Red Bull, Monster Energy and other energy drinks to children in England amid growing concern about the impact that the high-caffeine, high-sugar drinks are having on young people\u2019s health. A consultation on how to implement the proposed ban will be unveiled on Thursday, with Downing Street indicating that the principal question to be determined is whether the purchasing restrictions will apply at the age of 16 or 18. Theresa May said the consultation was linked to the government\u2019s childhood obesity strategy and said it was necessary to examine the consumption of energy drinks \u201coften because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks\u201d. The principal justification for the ban is the high level of caffeine in the energy drinks, which has been linked to a string of health problems for children, including head and stomach aches, as well as hyperactivity and sleep problems. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains about 80mg of caffeine, roughly the same as a similarly sized cup of coffee, but three times the level of Coca-Cola. Monster Energy, which is often sold in larger cans of 500ml, contains 160mg of caffeine. Energy drinks often also have higher levels of sugar than soft drinks. According to government figures, sugared energy drinks have 60% more calories and 65% more sugar than normal soft drinks and sugar is one of the largest causes of obesity. Jamie Oliver, the celebrity chef and food health campaigner, said he welcomed the prospect of a ban on energy drink sales because \u201ctoo many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast\u201d and \u201cteachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted because of these drinks, packed with stimulants\u201d. Some major retailers already ban sales of energy drinks to youngsters, but cheap prices in other outlets mean that consumption by children in the UK is estimated by ministers to be 50% ahead of other countries in Europe. Two-thirds of children aged 10 to 17 and a quarter of six to nine-year-olds consume energy drinks, according to the government announcement. Steve Brine, the public health minister, complained that \u201cin some outlets it is possible to buy four 250ml cans of energy drink for \u00a31\u201d. The 12-week consultation proposes that a ban would apply to drinks that contain more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. A Downing Street source added that introducing a ban was all but certain, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a question not of whether we do it, but how.\u201d The move is the latest step in an increasingly interventionist approach being pursued by the Conservatives in relation to childhood obesity and health. When he was the chancellor, George Osborne introduced a tax on sugary drinks. Drink brands such as Red Bull, Relentless, Monster Energy and Rockstar have become increasingly popular. Children and teenagers drink them more than adults, even though industry labelling guidelines state that any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about its content and state that it is not recommended for children. The compulsory health warnings read: \u201cHigh caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breastfeeding women or persons sensitive to caffeine.\u201d Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: \u201cThere is no evidence that energy drinks have any nutritional value or place in the diet of children and young people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re pleased to see the government take action on this and other measures to tackle childhood obesity and improve children\u2019s health.\u201d The proposed ban only applies to England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can all follow suit if their administrations wish. In March, several major supermarket chains announced that they would ban the sale of energy drinks to children under 16. The teachers\u2019 union NASUWT called last year for the sale of the drinks to under-16s to be banned by all retailers. Its national official for education, Darren Northcott, described the beverages as \u201clegal highs\u201d that helped to fuel bad behaviour in schools. Mintel consumer data starts at the age of 16, with the biggest official UK market for energy drinks being boys aged 16 to 24, with 63% consuming them compared with 58% of girls. But, according to European Food Safety Authority research, two-thirds of 10 to 16-year-olds regularly consume energy drinks, along with 18% of three to 10-years-olds. \u2022 A graphic on this article was removed on 30 August 2018 because it contained out of date information for Rockstar energy drinks.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is quite obvious that the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, wants us all to know he cares about drought-affected farmers. It was mentioned prominently in his first press conference as PM and was the purpose of his first trip the next day. But if he is heading out to the bush and not mentioning climate change he is failing to actually listen \u2013 not just to those who know from their own experience that the climate is changing but from those advising on how governments should respond. There is perhaps more romance with agriculture as an industry than any other. There is the nostalgia of the nation riding on the sheep\u2019s back and Clancy of the Overflow seeing the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended. The reality, however, is that agriculture (including forestry and fishing) is a small industry. In the latest GDP figures, its output accounted for just 2.3% of GDP \u2013 smaller than all other industries except for arts and recreation. By comparison, mining and manufacturing each were worth 5.9% of GDP, health care and social assistance was 7.4%, construction was 7.5%, and financial and insurance services was the biggest with 8.9%. There was a time agriculture was bigger than mining, but that time is long past: Similarly, the importance of agricultural exports has shrunk. Whereas in the early 1970s almost half of our non-service exports were from the rural sector, now they are worth just 15%: That\u2019s not so much because the agricultural exports have declined but because mining exports have exploded off the chart: It is also not a huge employer. Only five industries employ fewer workers than the 325,000 employed in agriculture. Back in the 1980s it employed 6% of all employees, now it is just over 2.5% \u2013 only manufacturing has seen a bigger fall in the share of employed: And in terms of contributions to economic growth it also is rather small potatoes. Over the past 20 years only manufacturing, other services, electricity and gas, and arts and recreation have contributed less to the increase in the size of our economy. Of the 60% increase in GDP since 1998, agriculture contributed just 1 percentage point. But that is not to say it is unimportant. The impact of the drought has already flowed through to the GDP figures, with it being the only industry to detract from GDP in the past year: And we can see that droughts have a significant impact on how agriculture contributes to economic growth. In the drought periods of the mid-1990s and early-2000s, agriculture at times detracted almost 0.8% points from annual growth: To put that another way, had for example, the output of agriculture kept level in real terms during 2003, our economy would have grown by almost a third faster than it did. But these things do have a way of levelling out. Every financial year the ABS calculates both annual GDP and annual \u201cnon-farm GDP\u201d. Over the 20 years to 2016-17, non-farm GDP grew by less than 1% more than total GDP: So why does the industry get so much attention? The clear reason is geography and intensity. While across the nation the industry may not rate highly, in some states it is more important than in others: Tasmania, South Australia and Queensland for example are much more reliant upon agriculture than the rest of the nation. Over the past decade agriculture has provided nearly 17% of the growth of the state economies of Tasmania and South Australia. When things go bad for agriculture there, things go bad for the state. And the thing about agriculture is because \u2013 unlike say health and education and retail, which is spread rather evenly cross city and rural areas \u2013 agriculture is greatly important in the rural areas. It may employ under 3% of people nationally, but in rural areas it is the major industry. In South Australia, for example, in the regions it can employ up to 18% of all workers, while Adelaide, not surprisingly, sees very few agricultural workers: In the Shepparton area of Victoria, 20% of employees are in agriculture while around Warrnambool nearly a third of people work in the industry. Needless to say, when a drought hits and the industry suffers, it hits these areas much harder than when a factory or retail centre closes in the much more diversified city areas. So while on a national level our economy will cope with a drought, it has the potential to smash certain rural areas. But is continual drought assistance the way to keep the industry going? As Ross Gittins has noted, a report by the Productivity Commission in 2009 on drought assistance found that it was not actually as all pervasive as we might imagine. The report found that \u201cduring 2007-08, nearly half of Australia\u2019s dairy and broadacre farms in drought-declared areas did manage without EC [exceptional circumstances] assistance. Over the six years to 2007-08, on average nearly 70 per cent of these farms managed without EC assistance.\u201d So those 70% of farms must be doing something right. Possibly they are preparing for such droughts better than the other 30% \u2013 a smart thing to do especially given the frequency with which they occur. But more crucial is the commission\u2019s major recommendation. It argues that \u201cgovernments need to commit to a long term reform path that recognises that the primary responsibility for managing risks, including from climate variability and change, rests with farmers.\u201d If you are a prime minister going out to the rural areas and you\u2019re not talking about climate change, and you\u2019re not suggesting that droughts are more likely to occur and thus farmers need to take greater responsibility, then you are failing in your job. You might get some nice vision of you standing next to a farmer looking like you care and, as Morrison did, you can hold up a photo saying how green it all can once again be, but without considering the long-term impacts you are just screaming into the wind. When deriding renewable energy, government ministers love to note that the sun doesn\u2019t always shine and the wind doesn\u2019t always blow; perhaps they should also note that for farmers the rain doesn\u2019t always fall, and that climate change will make such times worse. It is about time the government starts recognising that fact. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>It is quite obvious that the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, wants us all to know he cares about drought-affected farmers. It was mentioned prominently in his first press conference as PM and was the purpose of his first trip the next day. But if he is heading out to the bush and not mentioning climate change he is failing to actually listen \u2013 not just to those who know from their own experience that the climate is changing but from those advising on how governments should respond.</p> \n<p>There is perhaps more romance with agriculture as an industry than any other. There is the nostalgia of the nation riding on the sheep\u2019s back and Clancy of the Overflow seeing the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/29/climate-change-making-drought-worse-says-farmers-federation-chief\">Climate change making drought worse, says farmers federation chief</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The reality, however, is that agriculture (including forestry and fishing) is a small industry. In the latest GDP figures, its output accounted for just 2.3% of GDP \u2013 smaller than all other industries except for arts and recreation.</p> \n<p>By comparison, mining and manufacturing each were worth 5.9% of GDP, health care and social assistance was 7.4%, construction was 7.5%, and financial and insurance services was the biggest with 8.9%.</p> \n<p>There was a time agriculture was bigger than mining, but that time is long past:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Size of industries as a percent of GDP\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eAdYb/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Similarly, the importance of agricultural exports has shrunk. Whereas in the early 1970s almost half of our non-service exports were from the rural sector, now they are worth just 15%:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of Australian goods exports\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EVRPc/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>That\u2019s not so much because the agricultural exports have declined but because mining exports have exploded off the chart:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of Australian annual exports - current dollars\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JDQtZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It is also not a huge employer. Only five industries employ fewer workers than the 325,000 employed in agriculture. Back in the 1980s it employed 6% of all employees, now it is just over 2.5% \u2013 only manufacturing has seen a bigger fall in the share of employed:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in the makeup of Australia's employed by industry\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8tH5V/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>And in terms of contributions to economic growth it also is rather small potatoes. Over the past 20 years only manufacturing, other services, electricity and gas, and arts and recreation have contributed less to the increase in the size of our economy.</p> \n<p>Of the 60% increase in GDP since 1998, agriculture contributed just 1 percentage point.</p> \n<p>But that is not to say it is unimportant. The impact of the drought has already flowed through to the GDP figures, with it being the only industry to detract from GDP in the past year:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions of industries to GDP growth\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/X1kyy/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>And we can see that droughts have a significant impact on how agriculture contributes to economic growth. In the drought periods of the mid-1990s and early-2000s, agriculture at times detracted almost 0.8% points from annual growth:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of agriculture to annual GDP growth\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KMWia/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>To put that another way, had for example, the output of agriculture kept level in real terms during 2003, our economy would have grown by almost a third faster than it did.</p> \n<p>But these things do have a way of levelling out. Every financial year the ABS calculates both annual GDP and annual \u201cnon-farm GDP\u201d. Over the 20 years to 2016-17, non-farm GDP grew by less than 1% more than total GDP:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of GDP and non-farm GDP\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nYPeu/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>So why does the industry get so much attention? The clear reason is geography and intensity. While across the nation the industry may not rate highly, in some states it is more important than in others:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Importance of agriculture to state economies\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JVpF4/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Tasmania, South Australia and Queensland for example are much more reliant upon agriculture than the rest of the nation. Over the past decade agriculture has provided nearly 17% of the growth of the state economies of Tasmania and South Australia. When things go bad for agriculture there, things go bad for the state.</p> \n<p>And the thing about agriculture is because \u2013 unlike say health and education and retail, which is spread rather evenly cross city and rural areas \u2013 agriculture is greatly important in the rural areas. It may employ under 3% of people nationally, but in rural areas it is the major industry.</p> \n<p>In South Australia, for example, in the regions it can employ up to 18% of all workers, while Adelaide, not surprisingly, sees very few agricultural workers:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percent of South Australians employed in agriculture by region\"> \n <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HAPAF/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In the Shepparton area of Victoria, 20% of employees are in agriculture while around Warrnambool nearly a third of people work in the industry. Needless to say, when a drought hits and the industry suffers, it hits these areas much harder than when a factory or retail centre closes in the much more diversified city areas.</p> \n<p>So while on a national level our economy will cope with a drought, it has the potential to smash certain rural areas.</p> \n<p>But is continual drought assistance the way to keep the industry going? As <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/our-concern-about-the-drought-isn-t-fair-dinkum-20180821-p4zypf.html\">Ross Gittins has noted</a>, a report by the Productivity Commission in 2009 on drought assistance found that it was not actually as all pervasive as we might imagine.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/drought/report/drought-support.pdf?clicksource=inartcilelink\">report</a> found that \u201cduring 2007-08, nearly half of Australia\u2019s dairy and broadacre farms in drought-declared areas did manage without EC [exceptional circumstances] assistance. Over the six years to 2007-08, on average nearly 70 per cent of these farms managed without EC assistance.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/28/drought-policy-must-reflect-climate-change-says-former-farmers-chief\">'No real appetite': former farmers chief lashes ministers over climate link to drought</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So those 70% of farms must be doing something right.

The added warning of a possible full-blown crash in the capital if Britain leaves the European Union without striking a deal will only turn the smile into a beaming grin. For some it is enough to persuade them that a no-deal Brexit is the best thing that could happen to the country. And it\u2019s a seductive position to adopt. A crash would make homes more affordable to those on lower incomes and the young. Profit-hungry housebuilders would see their revenues collapse and the much-reviled estate agency industry would shrink. A one in three chance of a \u201csignificant correction\u201d in London prices, which is the considered position of 30 property experts, is good odds for anyone who wants prices to fall. So let\u2019s press on with a hard Brexit. There is much to gain. Except that such thoughts are the indulgence of better-off radicals and intemperate curmudgeons: those who will be largely immune to the cost of Brexit by virtue of their job or age (or retirement) and who have huge equity in their home. They care little about the after-effects of a house price crash because while it may reduce their wealth somewhat, it won\u2019t materially affect their bank balance. Unfortunately, damaging the economy, as Brexit surely will, to reduce house prices will leave many others in a position of putting in an offer on a cheaper home only to lose their job. Supporters of a crash also fail to ask the question: why have property prices risen in London and the south-east? If it is Russian oligarch money being squirrelled away from Vladimir Putin\u2019s grasp, then tackle money laundering with greater vigilance. If it is the growth of the population, and this must be the heart of the problem, then spend a few extra billions attracting employers to the regions. As the Centre for Cities thinktank is tired of telling ministers, the health of a town or city depends on the state of its jobs market. Almost everything else flows from it; from the mental health of the local population to the state of the high street. It is a given that good jobs lie at the heart of an economy and the ones we have need to be spread around. But that would involve planning. Something that is an anathema to this government. The kind of planning that needs cross-party support and the backing of the new metro mayors. When cities lie at the heart of every country\u2019s economic future, Britain needs more than one that can boast the full gamut of jobs, including that of a FTSE 100 boss. Aston Martin benefits from taking the upmarket route Aston Martin has always had a fan in Jeremy Clarkson, the former Top Gear and now Grand Tour presenter. Even when the West Midlands carmaker was trying to persuade potential customers that two V6 Ford engines bolted together under the bonnet, which were slower and less responsive than a Ferrari or McLaren equivalent was a good buy (this was only in 2016), Clarkson raved about the indefinable romantic qualities on display. Those were the days of make-do and mend and underinvestment. It made for a niche carmaker that sold to enthusiasts who could afford the almost constant repair bills. The transformation from a \u00a3500m car company when Ford sold it in 2007 to a \u00a35bn business today comes after years of painstaking investment that now mean Aston makes its own combustion engines in Warwickshire and is poised to begin making its own electric engines in Wales. New boss David Richards, and his Kuwaiti backers, promised to take James Bond\u2019s favourite ride \u201cto even greater heights\u201d and it seems they have done just that. As potential shareholders size up the company before a stock market listing, they will admire the way Richards has lured the wealthiest car buyers from China to the US and Russia to Dubai with a combination of romance and horsepower. It\u2019s a lesson not lost on most of Britain\u2019s engineering firms, which have spent much of the last 30 years going upmarket.

      "bodyText": "A dramatic rise in land values pushed Britain\u2019s wealth to a fresh high of more than \u00a310tn last year, highlighting the huge gains made by developers in property hotspots across the UK. From London and the home counties to Cambridge and popular parts of Devon and Cornwall, land values have become the single largest element of wealth, dwarfing household wealth locked up in property and financial savings. Official figures showed that the UK\u2019s net worth rose by \u00a3492bn between 2016 and 2017 to \u00a310.2tn, with the lion\u2019s share of the increase accounted for by a \u00a3450bn jump in the value of land. The rise continues a trend since 2012 that has pushed the average assets held by each Briton to \u00a3155,000, up \u00a36,000 from 2016. The Office for National Statistics said consistent increases in the value of land meant it accounted for 51% of the UK\u2019s net worth in 2016, higher than any other G7 country that produces similar statistics. In France, which has a land mass twice the size of the UK, land values account for 41% of wealth while in Germany they account for only 26%. This week several landowners have outlined plans for developments, including the Duke of Westminster\u2019s Grosvenor Group, which said it was taking a growing interest in residential property outside central London. It said it would build thousands of homes on greenfield sites around Oxford and Cambridge, which are to benefit from Treasury plans to connect the two university towns with a cross-country rail link. Analysts said much of the increase in land values was in response to Britain\u2019s rising population, which has put pressure on the government to back house builders seeking to develop green field sites and farmland in south-east England and other development hotspots around the country. The price of farmland can increase by 100 times when developers succeed in persuading ministers to redesignate it for housing. Areas of London that were previously derelict, especially in the east of the capital, have seen huge rises in values as regeneration efforts and improved transport links have fed into property prices. Commercial property has also enjoyed an upswing in value since Britain\u2019s recovery following the 2008 banking crash, more than offsetting recent declines in much of the retail sector. The ONS figures go beyond a study last year by Lloyds bank that showed that Britain\u2019s net worth had climbed above \u00a310tn for the first time but did not single out the value of land. The steady increase in land values is expected to trigger further calls for a land value tax or new rules allowing local authorities to reap the rise in values by allowing them buy land earmarked for development. A growing number of thinktanks and politicians support imposing a tax that would take a slice of rising land values. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has urged the Treasury to develop a scheme, while the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas has tabled a private member\u2019s bill proposing a land value tax. Labour said in its 2017 election manifesto that it would consider a similar tax. Mark Wadsworth, the head of the Campaign for Land Value Taxation, said: \u201cThe minority with a vested interest in high land values will no doubt celebrate higher values, saying that is shows the importance of land to the UK economy. \u201cIn truth, land values are not a net addition to national wealth, they merely represent the benefits that accrue to landowners because of government spending on public services funded out of general taxation; land values are actually just a measure of ongoing transfers of wealth from taxpayers to landowners and a zero-sum game.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "'British to our core' Aston Martin brushes off Brexit concerns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aston Martin has brushed off concerns over Brexit after announcing plans to press ahead with a flotation on the London Stock Exchange that could value the luxury carmaker at about \u00a35bn. James Bond\u2019s favourite carmaker said that while it had given detailed consideration to what impact Britain\u2019s departure from the EU might have on business, it did not believe it would pose a major threat to the 105-year-old firm. Aston Martin\u2019s confidence over Brexit differs from the wider UK car industry, which has expressed strong concerns over the state of post-EU planning. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of thinking about Brexit but it doesn\u2019t materially impact our plans. We\u2019ve considered it very deeply,\u201d said Mark Wilson, the company\u2019s chief financial officer. Aston Martin is hoping the sale of at least 25% of its shares through the public listing will allow it to invest in greater production volumes and new products. The flotation will be seen as a vote of confidence in the UK, with few large initial public offerings (IPOs) expected before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union in March 2019. Wilson said that while there was the possibility of listing the company elsewhere, with New York a possibility, the company \u201cstarted out with the hypothesis that London was the right place\u201d. He said: \u201cAston is a 105-year-old brand, British to our core, manufacturing and engineering exclusively in Britain. The London Stock Exchange is a truly global pool of capital and arguably sets the highest standards of governance.\u201d The plans to float come at a key time for the company, which has gone bust seven times since it was founded by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin in a small London workshop in 1913. Its main owners are the Italian investment firm Investindustrial and a group of Kuwait-based investors. Under the current chief executive, Andy Palmer, Aston Martin has revamped its product lineup and been transformed from a loss-making company into a profitable one. Revenues increased 8% to \u00a3445m in the first half of 2018, while pre-tax profits rose 2.5% to \u00a320.8m. The company expects to sell between 6,200 and 6,400 cars in 2018 after selling a record 5,098 cars last year \u2013 its highest number in nine years. Aston Martin\u2019s biggest market is the UK, which accounts for 30% of sales, with the EU (excluding the UK) accounting for 25%, followed by the Asia-Pacific region with 24% and the US with 20%. Aston Martin, whose models include the V8 and V12 Vantage, said its half-year performance was driven by its consulting business and increased revenue from sales of its special edition vehicles, including the Vanquish Zagato family and DB4 GT continuation models. It is hoping to double production to 14,000 vehicles a year as demand from super-rich car enthusiasts increases. The company said the average selling price, including specials, increased by 8% from \u00a3155,000 in the first half of 2017 to \u00a3167,000 in the first six months of 2018, as more customers chose to personalise their vehicles with costly design options and special features. \u201cYou can bespoke your Aston Martin as deep as your pockets will allow,\u201d Wilson said. He said that because the carmaker was a global company, any weakness in one particular market, such as Europe, could be offset with sales elsewhere and added that the firm is used to dealing with tariffs in most of its export markets. China is a major growth market for Aston Martin, which is capitalising on the growth of the middle classes. The company imports about two-thirds of its parts from Europe, with the rest coming from the UK. It has already started stockpiling engines in preparation for Brexit, keeping a five-day supply rather than the usual three days, Wilson said. Despite playing down Brexit concerns, in official documents relating to the IPO, the company conceded Brexit posed a number of potential risks to business, including its ability to hire and retain skilled workers. Aston Martin aims to publish a prospectus, including full details of the share sale, on 20 September. Eligible employees and customers of the carmaker will be able to apply to buy shares at the offer price. The company recently began production of its new Vantage sports car model, which is handbuilt at its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. Next to hit the production line will be the DBS Superleggera, a super GT with a top speed of 211mph (340km/h) and 0-62mph acceleration in 3.4 seconds. The company is building a new factory in Wales, where it is expected to base production of its Lagonda Vision emissions-free electric sports car. The character of James Bond has driven an Aston Martin intermittently on film since 1964, when he drove a DB5 in Goldfinger. \u201cAston Martin\u2019s rich history and the power of its brand \u2013 nowhere more evident than in the James Bond films \u2013 means that the carmaker\u2019s planned flotation on the London Stock Exchange is bound to attract a lot of attention, especially as a reported \u00a35bn valuation would put the firm on the fringes on the FTSE 100,\u201d said Russ Mould, a director at the investment platform AJ Bell.",

Aston Martin\u2019s confidence over Brexit differs from the wider UK car industry, which has expressed strong concerns over the state of post-EU planning. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/29/aston-martin-journey-from-bond-favourite-to-international-acclaim\">Aston Martin's journey from Bond favourite to international acclaim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of thinking about Brexit but it doesn\u2019t materially impact our plans.

Wilson said that while there was the possibility of listing the company elsewhere, with New York a possibility, the company \u201cstarted out with the hypothesis that London was the right place\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cAston is a 105-year-old brand, British to our core, manufacturing and engineering exclusively in Britain. The London Stock Exchange is a truly global pool of capital and arguably sets the highest standards of governance.\u201d</p> <p>The plans to float come at a key time for the company, which has gone bust seven times since it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/29/aston-martin-journey-from-bond-favourite-to-international-acclaim\">founded by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin in a small London workshop in 1913</a>.

The company expects to sell between 6,200 and 6,400 cars in 2018 after selling a record 5,098 cars last year \u2013 its highest number in nine years. Aston Martin\u2019s biggest market is the UK, which accounts for 30% of sales, with the EU (excluding the UK) accounting for 25%, followed by the Asia-Pacific region with 24% and the US with 20%. </p> <p>Aston Martin, whose models include the V8 and V12 Vantage, said its half-year performance was driven by its consulting business and increased revenue from sales of its special edition vehicles, including the Vanquish Zagato family and DB4 GT continuation models.</p> <p>It is hoping to double production to 14,000 vehicles a year as demand from super-rich car enthusiasts increases. The company said the average selling price, including specials, increased by 8% from \u00a3155,000 in the first half of 2017 to \u00a3167,000 in the first six months of 2018, as more customers chose to personalise their vehicles with costly design options and special features. </p> <p>\u201cYou can bespoke your Aston Martin as deep as your pockets will allow,\u201d Wilson said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/28/aston-martin-expected-to-unveil-london-stock-exchange-flotation\">Aston Martin unveils London Stock Exchange flotation</a> </p> </aside>  <p> He said that because the carmaker was a global company, any weakness in one particular market, such as Europe, could be offset with sales elsewhere and added that the firm is used to dealing with tariffs in most of its export markets. China is a major growth market for Aston Martin, which is capitalising on the growth of the middle classes.</p> <p>The company imports about two-thirds of its parts from Europe, with the rest coming from the UK. It has already started stockpiling engines in preparation for Brexit, keeping a five-day supply rather than the usual three days, Wilson said. </p> <p>Despite playing down Brexit concerns, in official documents relating to the IPO, the company conceded Brexit posed a number of potential risks to business, including its ability to hire and retain skilled workers.</p> <p>Aston Martin aims to publish a prospectus, including full details of the share sale, on 20 September.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy recorded its strongest economic growth in nearly four years in the three months to the end of June, according to revised figures. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2% annualized rate, the commerce department said on Wednesday after revising its second-quarter calculations, establishing the quarter as the strongest in terms of growth since late 2014. Many economists had forecast a downward revision of growth to about 4%. The figures helped send Wall Street to new highs on Wednesday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes both broke records for the fourth consecutive session, boosted by gains for technology companies including Amazon and Alphabet. Amazon rose 3.4% as the online retailer edged closer to becoming the second US company after Apple to be worth $1tn. Its market value stands at $971bn. After the initial calculation of 4.1% was announced in July, Donald Trump hailed the figures as \u201can economic turnaround of historic importance\u201d. On Wednesday, the US treasury department attributed the revisions to higher levels of spending by businesses on software and a decline in imports, including petroleum. Balanced out against out against GDP numbers for previous quarters, the revision puts the US economy on track to hit the Trump administration\u2019s target of 3% annual growth. But economists warn that the growth is unlikely to be sustained as the quarter reflected unique boosters, including Trump\u2019s $1.5tn tax cut package, which helped tweak consumer spending upwards, and revenue from soya bean exports to China ahead of raised tariffs coming into effect. Economists had expected second-quarter GDP growth would be revised down one-tenth of a percentage point to a 4% pace in anticipation of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, including tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the US, China, the EU, Canada and Mexico coming into effect. On the downside, growth in consumer spending was lowered to 3.8% in the second quarter instead of the previously reported 4%. But the trends may be reversed in the coming months. The US Conference Board, which measures consumer confidence, a solid indicator of consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity, said its confidence index had hit its highest level since October 2000. The index climbed to 133.4 in August, despite expectations from a survey of Reuters economists that it would fall to 126.7, as consumers reported short-term economic optimism. \u201cThese historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending in the near term,\u201d said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. The rise in consumer confidence comes as US stocks hit record highs after a six-month climb back from February\u2019s market correction \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 index has jumped 3% in the past two weeks. Trump tweeted to trumpet the news: \u201cConsumer confidence pops in August to highest level since October 2000.\u201d A plentiful job supply, coupled with a rise in the percentage of US households describing current business conditions as improving to 40.3%, from 38.1% a month earlier, are key components for the overall rise in consumer confidence. In a note to clients, Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that consumer optimism \u201csuggests a degree of skepticism about trade, inflation or anything else knocking the economy off track\u201d. Baird warned however that \u201cconsumers may be caught by surprise\u201d should any of those develop into a larger problem.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mining conglomerate the Adani Group is trying to prevent Indian authorities from accessing its business records as part of an investigation into an alleged $4bn fraud by power companies. Lawyers for Adani on Tuesday filed a plea asking the Bombay high court to quash a formal request by Indian investigators to Singaporean authorities to force the company to produce information regarding its coal imports from Indonesia. The request is part of an investigation by India\u2019s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) into a $4.4bn alleged fraud by 40 power companies including six Adani subsidiaries. According to DRI documents, the companies allegedly used fake middlemen to inflate the price of coal they were importing from Indonesia. The scheme allowed the companies to charge higher tariffs by exaggerating their production costs, the DRI claimed. If true, the alleged scam would also have allowed the companies to siphon billions of dollars from India into offshore bank accounts where Indian authorities would struggle to tax or account for the money. Adani and the other energy companies named by the DRI, including Essar and the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, have denied any wrongdoing. Adani has been contacted for comment about the Bombay high court legal challenge. The company has been working to build one of the world\u2019s largest coalmines in Australia and has had to pass several Australian state and federal government probity tests to secure licences to mine. It recently cleared one of its last Australian legal hurdles, overcoming a legal challenge by Indigenous groups who claim the company has not sought their consent for the project. But it still requires a loan to build a rail link between the mine and a coal port at the Galilee Basin. The Bombay high court challenge is the third attempt by Adani to prevent Indian investigators from gaining access to its records regarding the Indonesian imports. The DRI in 2016 petitioned the governments of Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong for assistance in gaining access to the overseas bank records of state-owned Indian banks whose accounts were allegedly used to facilitate the scam. Adani challenged that request in Singapore lower court, which disagreed and ordered the company to turn over its records. Adani appealed against the order in the Singapore high court but was ruled against earlier this month. It is now trying to challenge the Indian authorities\u2019 request in the Bombay high court. Adani has been fighting separate allegations for the past four years that it used a shell company in Dubai to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from the company\u2019s books into Adani family tax havens overseas. In August 2017, the Guardian published extensive details of the financial fraud allegations collected by the DRI. Shortly after the publication of the evidence, an Indian official appointed to review the case dismissed the accusations. The company says it \u201cstrongly denies\u201d the allegations. \u201cIt is a standard procedure for the group to follow international competitive bidding route for major capital expenditures to ensure transparency and competitiveness in the process,\u201d it said in an earlier statement to the Guardian. \u201cAll our transactions are always conducted within the framework of extant regulatory guidelines and provisions.\u201d India\u2019s customs department is appealing against the dismissal, arguing the order clearing Adani was biased towards the company and poorly reasoned. The case is yet to be heard. Hearings in the Bombay high court case are expected to begin next month.",

    "webTitle": "US economy grows more strongly than expected in second quarter - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US economic growth was slightly stronger than expected in the second quarter, coming in at 4.2% rather than 4%. Meanwhile the hope that Canada will join the new trade agreement between the US and Mexico is giving some support to stock markets, although concerns about Italy\u2019s financial position and worries about Spanish banks\u2019 exposure to Turkey are limiting the gains in Europe. And the FTSE 100 is heading lower as the pound stablises against the dollar and moves higher against the euro, currently up 0.33%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A quick view from ING strategist Viraj Patel: Anthony Kurukgy, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: If the US Federal Reserve needed one final economic indicator to back a move to increase interest rates further when the FOMC meet again next month, today\u2019s GDP reading will have provided just that. With US growth now at pre-financial crisis levels (4.2%), the futures market will continue to bet on another hike come December if growth continues in Q4. Whether Washington likes it or not, September may not be the last time the Fed tightens monetary policy this year. The US commerce department said: With this second estimate for the second quarter, the general picture of economic growth remains the same; the revision primarily reflected upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and private inventory investment that were partly offset by a downward revision to personal consumption expenditures. US economic growth was slightly better than forecast, turning in its best performance in four years, according to a second estimate of the figures. On an annualised basis, second quarter GDP growth came in at 4.2%, better than the initial reading of 4.1%. The performance was also better than the decline to 4% which analysts had been expecting. As mentioned previously, Turkey\u2019s currency continues to come under pressure: Another possible eurozone problem child, Italy, has seen its bond yields fall and the price rise today after recent weakness. The support has come from a report in La Stampa newspaper saying that the country may seek help from the European Central Bank when it unveils new spending plans next month. Previously there have been suggestions the country\u2019s propose budget could breach eurozone targets, and this has put its bonds under pressure recently. The La Stampa report suggested Italy could ask for the ECB to buy more of its bonds to avoid financial speculation. US markets are expected to open unchanged, while Europe continues to drift lower. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: It\u2019s been a quiet start to trading on Wednesday, with equity markets in Europe slightly in the red and US futures pointing to a flat open in a few hours. With NAFTA negotiations finally making progress, there is a sense of relief that the risk of a global trade war is easing, which has been supportive for sentiment recently. There is still a long way to go with Trump recently again threatening tariffs on cars from Europe and the US preparing another $200 billion of tariffs against China but any progress is welcome and it\u2019s hopefully something we\u2019ll see more of in the months ahead. The Canadian dollar has gained ground in recent days on reports that it is re-joining talks and offering concessions that could result in an agreement by the end of the week. Trump had previously threatened to proceed with a US-Mexico trade agreement as a replacement for NAFTA, in effect cutting Canada out, which could have had a significant impact on the Canadian economy. While this was more than likely a bluff aimed at forcing the hand of the Canadians, it is a relief that no such move will likely be necessarily as it would have been harmful for all concerned. Another factor pressuring markets is the continuing economic trouble in Turkey. The Turkish lira has been under pressure on concerns about the outlook for the country, and is currently at a two year low. There is also a worry that Turkey\u2019s problems could lead to wider contagion in emerging markets, and also spill over into Europe\u2019s banking system. Reuters reports that analysts at Man Group believe Spanish banks in particular are vulnerable to the problems in Turkey. The agency quotes Man as saying: As the Turkey crisis persists and investors worry about contagion in the rest of the emerging markets, we believe the European banking system generally, and Spain especially, could be at risk. Spain\u2019s Ibex is currently one of the biggest losers among European markets, down 0.75%. Markets are slipping back after their early gains. The FTSE 100 is now down 0.38% after sterling stablised on hopes that an extension to the October Brexit deadline for agreement could lead to progress in the discussions. The UK\u2019s leading index is full of overseas earners which dislike a stronger pound. The dips in Europe are less severe, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both down just 0.02%. But worries about Italy\u2019s debt levels have pushed the FTSE MIB down 0.32%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Asia\u2019s positive session has not been carried over into the European morning so far, with indices either flat or lower in early trading. US markets look like they are running out of momentum for the time being, with the upcoming long weekend likely to be the culprit for some usual profit-taking. After an early gain, the FTSE 100 has moved sharply into reverse, testing the 7600 level once again, this time from above. The index looks beset on two fronts this morning; first of all, the stronger dollar has stopped the commodity rally in its tracks, dragging down the mining sector, and news of a possible extension to Brexit talks has given sterling a lift. It is important to keep some perspective here though \u2013 while the FTSE is essentially flat on the year (excluding dividends) it is at least 10% higher from the March lows. This kind of digestion of a big move higher is entirely normal in markets, so all is not lost for the index just yet. Earlier we had some disappointing consumer confidence figures from Germany. Rising inflation and the likely effect of continuing trade tensions between the US and EU contributed to a dip in the GfK consumer sentiment index to 10.5 going into September from 10.6 the previous month. Analysts had expected an unchanged figure. This was the second month in a row that sentiment deteriorated. GfK said: Despite the second decline in a row, consumers continue to assume that the good consumer economy will continue even if the dynamic could possibly drop off somewhat. Therefore, GfK expects that private consumption for this year will increase by 1.5 percent in real terms and meet the GfK forecast made at the beginning of the year. The positive outlook for the consumer economy will only continue as is if the job market remains stable, which is the current assumption, and there are no additional risks threatening from the price front. A further increase in inflation would certainly dampen the consumer climate. It\u2019s a positive start in Europe, but by no means a really convincing one. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Investors continued to greet the US-Mexico trade deal with wary positivity, the European markets just about nudging higher after the bell. The FTSE, which got that belated bounce on Tuesday as it played catch-up following bank holiday Monday, opened up a few points, a smidge above 7630. There was even less of interest in the Eurozone, with the DAX and CAC at 12550 and 5500 respectively, with investors put off from doing anything else due to concerns surrounding the Italian economy. Despite more front page worries about the cost and chaos of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, the pound managed to avoid furthering Tuesday\u2019s losses as Wednesday got underway. Against the dollar it was unchanged at $1.287, while against the euro it actually rose 0.2%, lifting off of its recent near one year lows. There\u2019s really not a lot to work with this Wednesday morning, beyond the various ongoing macro-tensions, leaving investors sitting on their hands until this afternoon\u2019s US Q2 GDP reading. The positive developments on the trade front following the US-Mexico deal have helped push European markets higher at the open. But the gains are limited by worries about Italy\u2019s economy, following recent comments that the country might breach eurozone caps on public spending. The FTSE 100 has opened up 0.15% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.16% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.17%. But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 0.03%. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: No records are expected to be broken in European share markets just yet. Some of the optimism about the deal struck between the US and Mexico has turned to concerns over Italian debt levels. Mexico reaching an amicable solution with the US, especially in the automotive industry, increases the likelihood Europe will end with a similar result. The positive industry news bodes well for recently pressured auto shares including Volkswagen and Citroen Peugeot. Concerns about European bank exposure in Italy is a worry, hot off the heels of similar concerns over Turkey. The comments from the deputy prime minister about Italy breaching the 3% cap on public deficits is confirmation that Italy\u2019s new populist government is even less fiscally responsible than its predecessors. Italy\u2019s political upset combined with its high debt load are a significant risk factor for European equities though the second half of 2018. France\u2019s economy grew at 0.2% quarter on quarter in the second three months of the year, in line with initial estimates. The annualised growth rate was 1.7%, as expected. The French statistics agency INSEE said: Imports bounced back this quarter (+1.0% after \u22120.4%) as did exports to a lesser extent (+0.2% after \u22120.4%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth, \u22120.3 points, after a neutral contribution in Q1. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for Europe: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets continue to be lifted by the more positive outlook for the US trade situation, following the deal between President Trump\u2019s administration and the Mexican government to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. There are hopes too that Canada, the other NAFTA signee, will join the new deal within the next few days. And although the agreement does little to indicate how things might develop in the US row with China and the EU, investors are taking the optimistic view for the moment. So with US markets hitting new peaks and Asia moving ahead overnight, European markets are expected to open higher. Here is our latest story on the positive response to the trade talks: The main economic event of the day is US GDP which is expected to show strong growth in the revised second quarter figures. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The consensus estimate is 4% ,and keep in mind the advanced reading was 4.1%. In the first-quarter the economy grew by 2.2%. There is a growing belief that President Trump\u2019s tax cuts are kicking in, and we could see higher levels of growth at the back end of the year in comparison with the beginning. Yesterday, the US Conference Board consumer sentiment report hit is highest level since late 2000. French GDP figures are also due shortly, with annualised growth forecast to reach 1.7%.

Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s been a quiet start to trading on Wednesday, with equity markets in Europe slightly in the red and US futures pointing to a flat open in a few hours. </p> <p>With NAFTA negotiations finally making progress, there is a sense of relief that the risk of a global trade war is easing, which has been supportive for sentiment recently. There is still a long way to go with Trump recently again threatening tariffs on cars from Europe and the US preparing another $200 billion of tariffs against China but any progress is welcome and it\u2019s hopefully something we\u2019ll see more of in the months ahead. </p> <p>The Canadian dollar has gained ground in recent days on reports that it is re-joining talks and offering concessions that could result in an agreement by the end of the week. Trump had previously threatened to proceed with a US-Mexico trade agreement as a replacement for NAFTA, in effect cutting Canada out, which could have had a significant impact on the Canadian economy. While this was more than likely a bluff aimed at forcing the hand of the Canadians, it is a relief that no such move will likely be necessarily as it would have been harmful for all concerned.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8674bee4b0447fbe861b65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-29T10:31:46.206Z\">11.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another factor pressuring markets is the continuing economic trouble in Turkey.</p> <p>The Turkish lira has been under pressure on concerns about the outlook for the country, and is currently at a two year low. There is also a worry that Turkey\u2019s problems could lead to wider contagion in emerging markets, and also spill over into Europe\u2019s banking system.</p> <p>Reuters reports that analysts at Man Group believe Spanish banks in particular are vulnerable to the problems in Turkey. The agency quotes Man as saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the Turkey crisis persists and investors worry about contagion in the rest of the emerging markets, we believe the European banking system generally, and Spain especially, could be at risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>Spain\u2019s Ibex is currently one of the biggest losers among European markets, down 0.75%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b866291e4b0b69fd6c57aef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-29T09:14:53.263Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets slip back</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are slipping back after their early gains.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is now down 0.38% after sterling stablised on hopes that an extension to the October Brexit deadline for agreement could lead to progress in the discussions. The UK\u2019s leading index is full of overseas earners which dislike a stronger pound. The dips in Europe are less severe, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both down just 0.02%.</p> <p>But worries about Italy\u2019s debt levels have pushed the FTSE MIB down 0.32%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Asia\u2019s positive session has not been carried over into the European morning so far, with indices either flat or lower in early trading. US markets look like they are running out of momentum for the time being, with the upcoming long weekend likely to be the culprit for some usual profit-taking.</p> <p>After an early gain, the FTSE 100 has moved sharply into reverse, testing the 7600 level once again, this time from above. The index looks beset on two fronts this morning; first of all, the stronger dollar has stopped the commodity rally in its tracks, dragging down the mining sector, and news of a possible extension to Brexit talks has given sterling a lift.</p> <p>It is important to keep some perspective here though \u2013 while the FTSE is essentially flat on the year (excluding dividends) it is at least 10% higher from the March lows. This kind of digestion of a big move higher is entirely normal in markets, so all is not lost for the index just yet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b86593ae4b0447fbe861a47\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-29T08:36:13.817Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German consumer confidence slips again</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier we had some disappointing consumer confidence figures from Germany.</p> <p>Rising inflation and the likely effect of continuing trade tensions between the US and EU contributed to a dip in <a href=\"https://www.gfk.com/insights/press-release/german-consumer-climate-declines-slightly-once-again/\">the GfK consumer sentiment index</a> to 10.5 going into September from 10.6 the previous month. Analysts had expected an unchanged figure. This was the second month in a row that sentiment deteriorated. GfK said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the second decline in a row, consumers continue to assume that the good consumer economy will continue even if the dynamic could possibly drop off somewhat. Therefore, GfK expects that private consumption for this year will increase by 1.5 percent in real terms and meet the GfK forecast made at the beginning of the year. </p> <p>The positive outlook for the consumer economy will only continue as is if the job market remains stable, which is the current assumption, and there are no additional risks threatening from the price front. A further increase in inflation would certainly dampen the consumer climate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b864f7ee4b0b69fd6c57a86\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-29T07:48:35.301Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s a positive start in Europe, but by no means a really convincing one. Connor Campbell, financial analyst<strong> </strong>at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continued to greet the US-Mexico trade deal with wary positivity, the European markets just about nudging higher after the bell.</p> <p>The FTSE, which got that belated bounce on Tuesday as it played catch-up following bank holiday Monday, opened up a few points, a smidge above 7630. There was even less of interest in the Eurozone, with the DAX and CAC at 12550 and 5500 respectively, with investors put off from doing anything else due to concerns surrounding the Italian economy.</p> <p>Despite more front page worries about the cost and chaos of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, the pound managed to avoid furthering Tuesday\u2019s losses as Wednesday got underway. Against the dollar it was unchanged at $1.287, while against the euro it actually rose 0.2%, lifting off of its recent near one year lows. </p> <p>There\u2019s really not a lot to work with this Wednesday morning, beyond the various ongoing macro-tensions, leaving investors sitting on their hands until this afternoon\u2019s US Q2 GDP reading. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8644f1e4b0b69fd6c57a5d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-29T07:18:47.130Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The positive developments on the trade front following the US-Mexico deal have helped push European markets higher at the open. But the gains are limited by worries about Italy\u2019s economy, following recent comments that the country might breach eurozone caps on public spending.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has opened up 0.15% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.16% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.17%. But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 0.03%. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No records are expected to be broken in European share markets just yet. Some of the optimism about the deal struck between the US and Mexico has turned to concerns over Italian debt levels. Mexico reaching an amicable solution with the US, especially in the automotive industry, increases the likelihood Europe will end with a similar result. The positive industry news bodes well for recently pressured auto shares including Volkswagen and Citroen Peugeot. </p> <p>Concerns about European bank exposure in Italy is a worry, hot off the heels of similar concerns over Turkey. The comments from the deputy prime minister about Italy breaching the 3% cap on public deficits is confirmation that Italy\u2019s new populist government is even less fiscally responsible than its predecessors. Italy\u2019s political upset combined with its high debt load are a significant risk factor for European equities though the second half of 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b864312e4b0bdafc1627f0b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-29T06:59:58.660Z\">7.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">French economy grows by 1.7% in second quarter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/3602903?sommaire=3592635\">France\u2019s economy grew at 0.2% quarter on quarter</a> in the second three months of the year, in line with initial estimates.

The name Aston Martin came a year later after their prototype successfully made it around the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire. Aston Martin took its place on the international motor racing stage by competing in the 1922 French Grand Prix but the business ran into financial trouble over the next few years and was rescued in 1926 by a group of investors. It developed a competitive range of sports cars with an increasing reputation for engineering and design, entering the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars was stepped up in the 1930s, with 140 cars built in 1937 \u2013 the highest prewar figure. The English industrialist David Brown bought the business in 1947, expanding operations and relocating production from Kensington to Feltham. Production was again moved in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. In 1963 the Aston Martin DB5 entered production and the famous relationship with James Bond was born a year later when it was made the car of choice for 007 in the film Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery. The character of James Bond has driven an Aston Martin intermittently on film since then, featuring in several films such as GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies and Skyfall. The luxury carmaker changed hands a number of times during the 1970s and 80s and in 1987 the Ford Motor Company took a 75% stake. The DB moniker \u2013 David Brown\u2019s initials \u2013 was resurrected with the introduction of the DB7 in 1993, the year that Ford took full ownership of the company. Aston Martin opened a new headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, in 2003, which was the first purpose-built factory in the company\u2019s history. It returned to the racetrack in 2005 with the DBR9, a race car based on the DB9 road car. In 2007, Aston Martin was sold again, this time to a consortium of two Kuwaiti investment houses, Investment Dar and Adeem Investment, for nearly \u00a31bn. Now one of the world\u2019s biggest sports car brands, the current chief executive, Andy Palmer, has overhauled the business by revamping the product lineup and returned the business to profit after years of losses. Aston Martin is planning to make its stock market debut in London later this year, in an initial public offering that is expected to value the company at \u00a35bn.",

      "bodyText": "House prices in London will fall this year and next, with the possibility of a full-blown crash if Britain leaves the EU without striking a deal, according to a poll of housing market specialists. Prices in the capital are expected to fall by 1.6% this year and 0.1% next year, a quarterly Reuters poll of about 30 analysts found, as the international buyers traditionally attracted by the London property market are put off by uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations. \u201cCentral London is tanking because the traditional international buyers are staying away \u2013 and the quantum of buyers is falling. A disorderly Brexit will exacerbate this trend,\u201d said Tony Williams at property consultancy Building Value. There is about a one-in-three chance of a significant correction in London house prices by the end of 2019, according to the poll. When asked what effect a disorderly Brexit would have on house prices in the capital, responses ranged from \u201cshort-term fall\u201d to \u201cdamaging\u201d to \u201cdisaster\u201d. \u201cIn the short term the additional uncertainty will disproportionately affect London, causing the value of some properties, particularly high value properties, to fall further,\u201d said Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol. Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and fears are rising that the government will fail to agree a deal with the bloc before then. London is now a weak spot in the wider UK housing market, with many homebuyers unable to afford a property in London after a run of strong house price in the capital. Meanwhile a higher rate of stamp duty on second homes has also weighed on buyer appetite in London. The average asking price for a home in London was \u00a3609,205 in August according to the property website Rightmove, more than double the national average of \u00a3301,973. \u201cThe weight of evidence suggests that housing is overvalued once more,\u201d said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics. When asked to rate the level of London house prices on a scale of one to 10, where one is extremely cheap and 10 is extremely expensive, the median response in the Reuters poll was nine. On a national level, prices were rated seven.",
