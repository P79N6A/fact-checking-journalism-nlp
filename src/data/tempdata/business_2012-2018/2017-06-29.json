      "bodyText": "Labour politicians told ministers \u201cnot to do a grubby deal with the Murdochs\u201d in order to push through 21st Century Fox\u2019s \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky after Ofcom warned there were serious concerns that any takeover would hand the family increased influence over news and politics in the UK . The MPs\u2019 intervention came in response to the culture secretary telling the Commons on Thursday that she was \u201cminded\u201d to accept the regulator\u2019s conclusion that the Competition and Markets Authority should conduct a full six-month examination of the deal. Ofcom, Karen Bradley added, had concluded that the extra inquiry was required because the Murdoch family would have \u201cmaterial influence\u201d as a result of buying Sky \u2013 but held the door open for potential negotiations that would avoid a full inquiry. The minister said that Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James, now has until 14 July to offer concessions to Bradley in an attempt to prevent the television mega merger being referred for further scrutiny. The Murdochs had offered to fund a Sky News service for five years, with a separate editorial board, but this had been rejected by Bradley. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, told Bradley that she should not accept any undertakings in lieu of a full competition inquiry. He said: \u201cCan I urge the secretary of state not to do a grubby deal with the Murdochs, because we know their history, they break every undertaking they make, from the Times to the Wall Street Journal.\u201d Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, said that Bradley\u2019s announcement was part of a practised routine that he predicted would lead to the government approving the deal after Fox offers concessions. \u201cNothing about this decision is a surprise. It\u2019s the old playbook. The secretary of state has known all along what she wants to end up doing, but she has to follow the established dance steps,\u201d he said. Shares in Sky rose more than 3% after Bradley\u2019s announcement as financial analysts claimed Fox could swiftly agree concessions with the government to secure the controversial takeover. Fox already owns 39% of Sky. Thomas Singlehurst, a media analyst at investment bank Citigroup, said: \u201cUltimately we think the likelihood not only of deal completion, but on a reasonable timeframe \u2013 one to three months \u2013 has increased.\u201d Bradley told MPs the warning by Ofcom that media plurality would be reduced was \u201cunambiguous\u201d and \u201cpersuasive\u201d. Ofcom\u2019s report shows that if the deal goes ahead Murdoch businesses would have the third largest total reach of any news provider \u2013 lower only than the BBC and ITN \u2013 and would uniquely operate across television, radio, newspapers and online. \u201cOfcom\u2019s report states that the proposed transaction would give the Murdoch family trust material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms,\u201d she said. However, John Whittingdale, Bradley\u2019s Conservative predecessor as culture secretary, praised her for the \u201cscrupulous\u201d handling of the takeover and played down concerns about the impact of media plurality, suggesting that the deal should go through. \u201cWhen it comes to plurality, it is increasingly obvious \u2013 and the general election bore this out \u2013 that the printed press are of a waning influence and the real media giants today are Google and the social media giants,\u201d he said. Ofcom dismissed an assertion by Fox that its media presence has been diluted with media plurality flourishing from the rise of digital rivals, such as news distributors Google and Facebook and new outlets, such as Vice, BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post. In fact, Ofcom said that Murdoch\u2019s news media is disproportionately benefiting from digital media compared to rivals. \u201cOur analysis suggests that Sky News and The Sun may receive a disproportionate amount of consumption through intermediaries, relative to their reach and share of reference,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cThis analysis is supported by data from Sky and News Corp, which show high levels of consumption of their content through third-party platforms, for example Facebook Instant Articles or Snapchat.\u201d Ofcom said in its report that the proposals to fund a Sky-branded news service for five years would mitigate concerns about media plurality and were more robust than undertakings offered by Murdoch when he bought the Times and Sunday Times in 1981 and the Wall Street Journal in 2007. But it added they could be strengthened. Fox said it was disappointed by Bradley\u2019s decision not to accept the undertakings and will \u201cmake representations\u201d to her about the decision and Ofcom\u2019s report. The company added: \u201cWhile we welcome the secretary of state\u2019s decision on broadcasting standards, we are disappointed that she does not accept Ofcom\u2019s recommendation stated in its report that \u2018the proposed undertakings offered by Fox to maintain the editorial independence of Sky News mitigate the media plurality concerns\u2019.\u201d However, the Murdochs did clear one major hurdle in their attempt to buy Sky after Ofcom concluded they were \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of Sky\u2019s UK broadcasting licence. The regulator said that phone hacking at the News of the World and allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News had amounted to significant corporate failure at the Murdochs companies \u2013 but this was not enough to prevent them from holding a broadcasting licence. Ofcom found there was no \u201cclear evidence\u201d that senior executives at Fox were aware of sexual misconduct before 2016, and that Fox and Sky\u2019s compliance record with the broadcasting code was in line with other broadcasters. The Murdoch\u2019s previous bid for Sky collapsed in 2011 when News Corporation was forced to withdraw its interest amid public furore over phone hacking at the News of the World. The company bidding this time is 21st Century Fox, which owns the 20th Century Fox film studio and the Fox TV network. It was carved out of Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation empire in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. Murdoch\u2019s remaining newspapers, including the Sun and the Times, are now part of a separate company, News Corp, although both it and 21st Century Fox are still controlled by the media mogul and his family. Hacked Off, which represents phone hacking victims, condemned the decision not to refer the bid to the CMA on the grounds of broadcasting standards and said the Murdochs have an \u201cappalling record of corporate governance failures\u201d. Evan Harris, joint executive director of Hacked Off, said: \u201cKaren Bradley should not waste time on \u2018undertakings\u2019. Undertakings in lieu from the Murdochs are not worth the paper they are written on, and cannot possibly be considered by the government as a remedy for Ofcom\u2019s concerns.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ofcom has published two in-depth reports on 21st Century Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of Sky which demonstrate why it has concerns about the Murdochs\u2019 influence on UK news and politics if the deal goes through. The media regulator\u2019s report into the \u201cpublic interest test\u201d for the deal examines the size and influence of 21st Century Fox, News Corp and Sky, and the track record of the Murdochs. It also hints at the concessions that the Murdochs could offer to push the deal through. A separate report by Ofcom clears the Murdochs and Fox as being \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a UK broadcasting licence despite the regulator expressing concern about \u201cextremely serious and disturbing\u201d allegations of harassment at Fox News. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s power over the British media The regulator concluded that Rupert Murdoch and his son James would have too much influence over the British media. \u201cThe proposed transaction would give the Murdoch family trust material influence over news providers with a significant presence on television, radio, printed newspapers and online,\u201d said Ofcom in its most important report on the proposed Sky takeover. Crucially the regulator looked across all of Murdoch\u2019s companies, including News Corp, the owner of the Sun and the Times which is not part of the deal, in making its assessment. In other words, the separation of 21st Century Fox, the Murdoch-controlled company hoping to buy Sky, from News Corp, which owns the newspapers, made no difference in the eyes of the regulator. Ofcom said the Murdoch family maintains \u201cmaterial influence\u201d over the conglomerate. This analysis, which completely changes the calculus, meant that Murdoch entities would have the third largest reach of any news provider. Ofcom said that the enlarged company would mean 31% of adults would use a Murdoch-controlled news outlet, behind the BBC on 77%, and ITN, the maker of news for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, on 39%. The regulator said that the deal would see Murdoch-owned media account for a 10% share of all the news that the public consume, comfortably behind the BBC on 42%, and in line with ITN on 11%. But if this made the Murdoch news interests seem relatively modest, the regulator immediately injected a moment of doubt. \u201cThis data may understate the importance of Fox/Sky and News Corp,\u201d said Ofcom. Concerns, too, were raised about the impact of Murdoch titles on the political process. Ofcom said that buying Sky may increase the ability of the Murdochs to \u201ccoordinate editorial policy of news outlets under their influence\u201d and \u201cmay increase the influence that members of the Murdoch family trust have over the political process\u201d. Concerns over Sky News spin-off plans Ofcom also raised \u201csignificant concerns\u201d that a full spin-off of Sky News, which was accepted as a media plurality remedy at the time of the last bid, would not solve the issue of Murdoch media power this time. The media regulator is concerned that the loss-making Sky News is likely to become a smaller operation if run as a separate business and could therefore make the situation worse. \u201cA degradation or loss of Sky News could potentially present risks to plurality equal to or greater than those presented by the transaction itself,\u201d said Ofcom. The regulator said Fox might look to strengthen its existing proposal by lengthening the five-year funding offer as well as the \u201congoing arrangements\u201d for the appointment of independent board members at Sky News. The last time Murdoch tried to buy Sky in 2011, a similar structure was proposed for Sky News, but with a 10-year funding guarantee. This was accepted by the then minister in charge, Jeremy Hunt, prompting some analysts to think that enhanced remedies could be sufficient again. Fox had proposed that the board members initially be appointed by the Sky independent directors, and then subsequently by 21st Century Fox\u2019s nominations and corporate governance committee. Ofcom\u2019s \u2018fit and proper\u2019 test \u201cWe have concluded that the behaviours alleged at Fox News amount to significant corporate failure,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cHowever, the overall evidence available to date does not provide a reasonable basis to conclude that if Sky were 100% owned and controlled by Fox, they would not be fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.\u201d Misconduct at Fox News in the US: \u2018Regular dirty old man talk\u2019 Ofcom said it was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the way Fox responded to the sexual misconduct and harassment allegations made against Fox News staff. Fox acknowledged there was a continuum from physical assaults and demands for sexual favours to salacious talk that the company described in a meeting with Ofcom as \u201cregular dirty old man talk\u201d. Fox subsequently told Ofcom that the phrase was not intended to diminish the seriousness of any conduct. \u201cWe found the language used by Fox to describe some of its employees\u2019 misconduct to us tended to downplay the harm caused and diminish the victims,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cWhilst we accept that its comments may have been relevant to an explanation of the credibility of the claims, we consider that some of the comments were superfluous and unnecessarily pejorative for this purpose.\u201d Ofcom also said it was \u201ctroubled\u201d by Fox\u2019s handling of the case of the former Fox news presenter Bill O\u2019Reilly. O\u2019Reilly was the host of Fox\u2019s top-rating show The O\u2019Reilly Factor who left in April 2017 amid sexual harassment claims and an advertising boycott. \u201c[Fox] was already aware of multiple cases that had led to settlements when it renewed its contract with him in February,\u201d the regulator added. \u201cWhile we accept that Fox considered the evidence in these cases to be equivocal, the number of them is concerning.\u201d There was also a suggestion by Fox at an Ofcom meeting in April that it was seen by some board members at the US film and television group as being to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201ccredit that he settled cases personally\u201d without recourse to management. Fox later retracted that statement. In May Fox wrote a letter to Ofcom clarifying \u201ccertain misunderstandings\u201d. The US company said it didn\u2019t mean to imply that some board members considered O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behaviour acceptable or give him credit for not alerting his employer to his misconduct. \u201cIn the light of this clarification, we remain concerned that board members regarded O\u2019Reilly\u2019s settling cases personally as somehow a point in his favour,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cIn order to have a concern about fitness and properness we would need to see evidence of misconduct in the parent company, Fox. However, we have no clear evidence that senior executives at Fox were aware of misconduct before it was escalated to them.\u201d The ongoing scandal at Fox News has claimed a number of high-profile executives, including the late chief executive Roger Ailes, a once all-powerful and longstanding friend of Rupert Murdoch who once told him about a case alleging misconduct against O\u2019Reilly and the co-president Bill Shine. Ofcom said that it has \u201cno other evidence - and no submissions have been made to us - that any executive director at Fox new about the alleged misconduct prior to July 2016\u201d. As a result \u201cOn that basis their failure to act cannot be held against them,\u201d said Ofcom. James Murdoch and his brother Lachlan flew in to London for a personal meeting with Ofcom on 30 May to put Fox\u2019s case better. They told Ofcom that \u201cno individual working for Fox News could now be under the impression that sexual harassment is acceptable, having seen the sacking of Ailes, O\u2019Reilly and a number of other employees including very senior managers\u201d. Phone hacking This subject barely featured in the analysis. Ofcom said it dealt with phone hacking in 2012 when the regulator conducted a review of the \u201cfit and proper test\u201d at the time of the News of the World hacking revelations, which ended up with Andy Coulson, a former editor of the tabloid being found guilty. The regulator said: \u201cSo far only limited new evidence has emerged\u201d. Ofcom said that no new material evidence \u201cdirectly touching on\u201d James and Rupert Murdoch has come to light since the 2012 investigation. In 2015, Rebekah Brooks was named chief executive of News UK, a year after she was cleared of all charges relating to the phone-hacking scandal. Brooks received a pay-off of more than \u00a310m after resigning from News Corp in 2011 at the height of the hacking scandal that forced the closure of News of the World. Campaigning groups made submissions to Ofcom arguing that the reappointment of Brooks, who admitted that when she had been chief executive of Murdoch\u2019s publishing business she did nothing to investigate hacking except when forced by external pressure, said a lot about the \u201cattitude and expectations of senior executives towards misconduct\u201d. Ofcom dismissed this argument saying that Brooks, one of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s closest executives, has no role in the management of Sky, or even News Corporation, and so is not relevant. \u201cShe is an employee, subject to the supervision of the board of News Corporation, which includes its independent directors,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cBrooks was re-employed after new corporate governance arrangements were established in light of phone hacking, specifically to prevent heads of business units, like her, from dealing unsupervised with matters involving possible systematic illegality.\u201d However, the spectre of the phone-hacking scandal is set to resurface later this year as the Sun faces a new trial. \u201cDisclosure is still ongoing in civil litigation against [The Sun] and if this throws up new evidence, we will consider it as part of our ongoing duty to assess fitness and properness,\u201d said Ofcom. Ofcom said that under the new corporate governance arrangements bought in after her departure any future issues would immediately be escalated to News Corporation\u2019s general counsel, a figure more senior than Brooks. The media regulator indicated that if phone hacking were to blow up again at the Murdoch\u2019s newspapers it would take that into account to potentially trigger another fit and proper test of Fox\u2019s right to hold a broadcasting licence. \u201cJames and Lachlan Murdoch have put themselves personally behind the new arrangements,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cWe therefore do not consider that Brooks\u2019 reappointment of itself suggests that those exercising control over Fox have an irresponsible attitude to wrongdoing or how it is handled. If evidence were to emerge in future that the new arrangements are defective, we would take it into account in our ongoing fit and proper duty.\u201d",

It also hints at the concessions that the Murdochs could offer to push the deal through.</p> <p>A separate report by Ofcom clears the Murdochs and Fox as being \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a UK broadcasting licence despite the regulator expressing concern about \u201cextremely serious and disturbing\u201d allegations of harassment at Fox News.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/29/all-you-need-to-know-21st-century-fox-sky-takeover-deal\">All you need to know about Fox's Sky deal</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Rupert Murdoch\u2019s power over the British media</strong></h2> <p>The regulator concluded that Rupert Murdoch and his son James would have too much influence over the British media. \u201cThe proposed transaction would give the Murdoch family trust material influence over news providers with a significant presence on television, radio, printed newspapers and online,\u201d said Ofcom in its most important report on the proposed Sky takeover.</p> <p>Crucially the regulator looked across all of Murdoch\u2019s companies, including News Corp, the owner of the Sun and the Times which is not part of the deal, in making its assessment. In other words, the separation of 21st Century Fox, the Murdoch-controlled company hoping to buy Sky, from News Corp, which owns the newspapers, made no difference in the eyes of the regulator. Ofcom said the Murdoch family maintains \u201cmaterial influence\u201d over the conglomerate.</p> <p>This analysis, which completely changes the calculus, meant that Murdoch entities would have the third largest reach of any news provider. Ofcom said that the enlarged company would mean 31% of adults would use a Murdoch-controlled news outlet, behind the BBC on 77%, and ITN, the maker of news for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, on 39%. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jun/29/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-is-now-very-likely-to-succeed\">Rupert Murdoch's Sky bid is now very likely to succeed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The regulator said that the deal would see Murdoch-owned media account for a 10% share of all the news that the public consume, comfortably behind the BBC on 42%, and in line with ITN on 11%. But if this made the Murdoch news interests seem relatively modest, the regulator immediately injected a moment of doubt. \u201cThis data may understate the importance of Fox/Sky and News Corp,\u201d said Ofcom.</p> <p>Concerns, too, were raised about the impact of Murdoch titles on the political process. Ofcom said that buying Sky may increase the ability of the Murdochs to \u201ccoordinate editorial policy of news outlets under their influence\u201d and \u201cmay increase the influence that members of the Murdoch family trust have over the political process\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Concerns over Sky News spin-off plans</strong></h2> <p>Ofcom also raised \u201csignificant concerns\u201d that a full spin-off of Sky News, which was accepted as a media plurality remedy at the time of the last bid, would not solve the issue of Murdoch media power this time. </p> <p>The media regulator is concerned that the loss-making Sky News is likely to become a smaller operation if run as a separate business and could therefore make the situation worse. \u201cA degradation or loss of Sky News could potentially present risks to plurality equal to or greater than those presented by the transaction itself,\u201d said Ofcom.</p> <p>The regulator said Fox might look to strengthen its existing proposal by lengthening the five-year funding offer as well as the \u201congoing arrangements\u201d for the appointment of independent board members at Sky News. The last time Murdoch tried to buy Sky in 2011, a similar structure was proposed for Sky News, but with a 10-year funding guarantee. This was accepted by the then minister in charge, Jeremy Hunt, prompting some analysts to think that enhanced remedies could be sufficient again.</p> <p>Fox had proposed that the board members initially be appointed by the Sky independent directors, and then subsequently by 21st Century Fox\u2019s nominations and corporate governance committee.</p> <h2><strong>Ofcom\u2019s \u2018fit and proper\u2019 test</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWe have concluded that the behaviours alleged at Fox News amount to significant corporate failure,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cHowever, the overall evidence available to date does not provide a reasonable basis to conclude that if Sky were 100% owned and controlled by Fox, they would not be fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Misconduct at Fox News in the US: \u2018Regular dirty old man talk\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Ofcom said it was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the way Fox responded to the sexual misconduct and harassment allegations made against Fox News staff. Fox acknowledged there was a continuum from physical assaults and demands for sexual favours to salacious talk that the company described in a meeting with Ofcom as \u201cregular dirty old man talk\u201d.</p> <p>Fox subsequently told Ofcom that the phrase was not intended to diminish the seriousness of any conduct.</p> <p>\u201cWe found the language used by Fox to describe some of its employees\u2019 misconduct to us tended to downplay the harm caused and diminish the victims,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cWhilst we accept that its comments may have been relevant to an explanation of the credibility of the claims, we consider that some of the comments were superfluous and unnecessarily pejorative for this purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom also said it was \u201ctroubled\u201d by Fox\u2019s handling of the case of the former Fox news presenter Bill O\u2019Reilly. O\u2019Reilly was the host of Fox\u2019s top-rating show The O\u2019Reilly Factor who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/apr/19/bill-oreilly-fox-news-sexual-harassment-board-meeting\">left in April 2017 amid sexual harassment claims</a> and an advertising boycott.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/apr/19/bill-oreilly-fox-news-sexual-harassment-board-meeting\">Bill O'Reilly out at Fox News after sexual harassment claims and ad boycott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c[Fox] was already aware of multiple cases that had led to settlements when it renewed its contract with him in February,\u201d the regulator added. \u201cWhile we accept that Fox considered the evidence in these cases to be equivocal, the number of them is concerning.\u201d</p> <p>There was also a suggestion by Fox at an Ofcom meeting in April that it was seen by some board members at the US film and television group as being to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201ccredit that he settled cases personally\u201d without recourse to management.</p> <p>Fox later retracted that statement. In May Fox wrote a letter to Ofcom clarifying \u201ccertain misunderstandings\u201d. The US company said it didn\u2019t mean to imply that some board members considered O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behaviour acceptable or give him credit for not alerting his employer to his misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cIn the light of this clarification, we remain concerned that board members regarded O\u2019Reilly\u2019s settling cases personally as somehow a point in his favour,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cIn order to have a concern about fitness and properness we would need to see evidence of misconduct in the parent company, Fox. However, we have no clear evidence that senior executives at Fox were aware of misconduct before it was escalated to them.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ongoing scandal at Fox News has claimed a number of high-profile executives, including the late chief executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-news\">Roger Ailes</a>, a once all-powerful and longstanding friend of Rupert Murdoch who once told him about a case alleging misconduct against O\u2019Reilly and the co-president Bill Shine.</p> <p>Ofcom said that it has \u201cno other evidence - and no submissions have been made to us - that any executive director at Fox new about the alleged misconduct prior to July 2016\u201d. As a result \u201cOn that basis their failure to act cannot be held against them,\u201d said Ofcom.</p> <p>James Murdoch and his brother Lachlan flew in to London for a personal meeting with Ofcom on 30 May to put Fox\u2019s case better. They told Ofcom that \u201cno individual working for Fox News could now be under the impression that sexual harassment is acceptable, having seen the sacking of Ailes, O\u2019Reilly and a number of other employees including very senior managers\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Phone hacking</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/29/james-murdoch-how-he-came-back-from-the-phone-hacking-scandal\">James Murdoch: how he came back from the phone-hacking scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This subject barely featured in the analysis. Ofcom said it dealt with phone hacking in 2012 when the regulator conducted a review of the \u201cfit and proper test\u201d at the time of the News of the World hacking revelations, which ended up with Andy Coulson, a former editor of the tabloid being found guilty. The regulator said: \u201cSo far only limited new evidence has emerged\u201d.</p> <p>Ofcom said that no new material evidence \u201cdirectly touching on\u201d James and Rupert Murdoch has come to light since the 2012 investigation.</p> <p>In 2015, Rebekah Brooks was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/12/rebekah-brooks-news-corp\">named chief executive of News UK</a>, a year after she was cleared of all charges relating to the phone-hacking scandal. Brooks received a pay-off of more than \u00a310m after resigning from News Corp in 2011 at the height of the hacking scandal that forced the closure of News of the World. </p> <p>Campaigning groups made submissions to Ofcom arguing that the reappointment of Brooks, who admitted that when she had been chief executive of Murdoch\u2019s publishing business she did nothing to investigate hacking except when forced by external pressure, said a lot about the \u201cattitude and expectations of senior executives towards misconduct\u201d.</p> <p>Ofcom dismissed this argument saying that Brooks, one of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s closest executives, has no role in the management of Sky, or even News Corporation, and so is not relevant.<br></p> <p>\u201cShe is an employee, subject to the supervision of the board of News Corporation, which includes its independent directors,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cBrooks was re-employed after new corporate governance arrangements were established in light of phone hacking, specifically to prevent heads of business units, like her, from dealing unsupervised with matters involving possible systematic illegality.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, the spectre of the phone-hacking scandal is set to resurface later this year as the Sun faces a new trial.<br></p> <p>\u201cDisclosure is still ongoing in civil litigation against [The Sun] and if this throws up new evidence, we will consider it as part of our ongoing duty to assess fitness and properness,\u201d said Ofcom.</p> <p>Ofcom said that under the new corporate governance arrangements bought in after her departure any future issues would immediately be escalated to News Corporation\u2019s general counsel, a figure more senior than Brooks.<br></p> <p>The media regulator indicated that if phone hacking were to blow up again at the Murdoch\u2019s newspapers it would take that into account to potentially trigger another fit and proper test of Fox\u2019s right to hold a broadcasting licence.<br></p> <p>\u201cJames and Lachlan Murdoch have put themselves personally behind the new arrangements,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cWe therefore do not consider that Brooks\u2019 reappointment of itself suggests that those exercising control over Fox have an irresponsible attitude to wrongdoing or how it is handled. If evidence were to emerge in future that the new arrangements are defective, we would take it into account in our ongoing fit and proper duty.\u201d<br></p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "The high court has given the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, two weeks to make a critical, long-delayed ruling over the Southern rail crisis. The order was made after Southern commuters sought a judicial review of the government\u2019s handling of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, which incorporates Southern. Passengers have suffered more than a year of severe delays and cancellations on their train service, but GTR claimed the worst disruption was down to sickness and industrial action outside their control. The firm argued in 2016 that the circumstances constituted \u201cforce majeure\u201d and therefore it could not be held accountable for breaching its contractual commitments. Campaigners and MPs had argued that the Department for Transport\u2019s response to the force majeure claim was necessary to determine whether GTR should be stripped of its franchise. James Hodivala, for the Association of British Commuters, told the court that the 14-month wait amounted to an unreasonable delay by the government, while there had been a \u201clack of transparency\u201d over the benchmarks Southern had to achieve under its contract. But lawyers for the DfT told the judge that Grayling would \u201cimminently\u201d make a decision on the claim. Justice Ouseley said he would not grant a judicial review on the understanding that ministers would communicate a decision within two weeks. Clive Sheldon, for the transport secretary, said Grayling was \u201cfully aware\u201d of the inconvenience suffered by Southern\u2019s 300,000 passengers, and his imminent decision would be followed by another on whether any enforcement or remedial action should be taken. Campaigners claimed it as a victory, although the judge rejected the commuter group\u2019s arguments for a judicial review on grounds that the government was in breach of the Equality Act because of problems with access suffered by disabled passengers. He ordered that the ABC should pay two-thirds of the DfT\u2019s \u00a325,900 legal costs. Emily Yates, a co-founder of the ABC, said: \u201cWe are disappointed he did not accept our case about disability access, but we regard today as a victory.\u201d She said forcing the government to make a decision on force majeure was \u201cmore of an immediate victory than if we had won outright. It\u2019s a tremendous result\u201d. A DfT spokesman said: \u201cWe are pleased the high court has thrown out the application for a judicial review. An independent report by rail expert Chris Gibb, which was published last week, made it very clear that the responsibility for disruption on Southern was primarily caused by industrial action led by RMT and Aslef and exceptional levels of staff sick leave. \u201cWe have been considering whether the extensive disruption to the line last year was entirely beyond GTR\u2019s control and our decision was due to be communicated to the company imminently.\u201d Labour accused Grayling of \u201cducking responsibility\u201d for Southern. MP Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cPassengers should not have had to go to the courts to seek accountability. Ultimately, the buck stops with the government. Tory ministers, who designed and awarded the franchise, have been ducking their responsibility for Southern\u2019s abysmal service and for directing this unnecessary industrial dispute.\u201d The two-and-a-half-hour hearing was held as Southern drivers started an overtime ban which led to the cancellation of hundreds of services. Mick Whelan, general secretary of the drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said: \u201cThe ban reflects the total loss of trust and goodwill between train drivers and the company.\u201d GTR said it was running around 75% of Southern trains on Thursday, more than during the last overtime ban, and planned to increase the number from Monday, as well as maintaining a full weekend timetable.",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch will be smiling. A possible referral of the Sky bid to the competition authorities is a setback, but the overall plot is moving perfectly satisfactorily from his point of view. Soon he may be in the familiar position of haggling over fine details, such as the future of Sky News. In a negotiation with regulators and politicians, Murdoch usually finds a way to get a deal done. One outside risk to 21st Century Fox\u2019s ambitions has been removed completely. Media regulator Ofcom looked at the sexual harassment scandals at Fox News in the US and decided they are not a problem, takeover-wise. The allegations amount to \u201csignificant corporate failure\u201d but Sky would still be a fit and proper organisation to hold a broadcast licence under 100% ownership by Fox. That outcome was expected since the regulatory threshold for removing a broadcast licence is high (Owen Oyston, who did suffer the sanction, was convicted of rape) and it would be a brave regulator that deprived the punters of live football, even temporarily. Culture secretary Karen Bradley is instead minded to refer the deal to the Competition and Markets Authority on grounds of media plurality \u2013 essentially the fact that Murdoch interests in the UK already span broadcast, radio, print and online. A full takeover of Sky, from Fox\u2019s current holding of 39%, might increase the Murdochs\u2019 ability to \u201cinfluence the overall news agenda\u201d and \u201cthe political process\u201d. That sounds like a serious risk to the deal, but probably isn\u2019t. Murdoch\u2019s initial attempt to head off a competition investigation was a pledge to fund Sky News for five years and give the channel a separate editorial board. It was rejected by Bradley because it merely \u201cmitigated\u201d the risks, rather than removed then, but Murdoch is free to try again in the next fortnight. He probably will. His first offer is rarely his best. Back in 2011, before the original bid was scuppered by the phone-hacking scandal, Murdoch was willing to spin off Sky News as a separately listed public company. It\u2019s not obvious that same structure would be accepted this time because Ofcom, for one, is worried about the ability of loss-making Sky News to survive outside the family. But giving Sky News 10 years of funding, and beefing up the editorial safeguards, might work. Even on the opening offer, Ofcom reckons the proposed editorial board for Sky would be \u201cmore robust\u201d than arrangements at the Murdoch-owned Times and Dow Jones, which are widely derided as utterly flimsy. If Bradley still isn\u2019t persuaded \u2013 or if Fox does nothing \u2013 then the CMA really will be called into action. But one suspects Murdoch would still fancy his chances of success. The CMA could even clear the deal outright and demand no undertakings at all on Sky News. An investigation would take six months, which introduces the risk of events intervening (another general election and a Labour government?), but that\u2019s life. The stock market cut to the chase. Sky\u2019s share price rose 3%. At 988p, or only 8% below the \u00a310.75 bid price, it is saying the takeover \u2013 even if you loathe it \u2013 is still very likely to happen in the end. Burberry cheques in focus again For a FTSE 100 company to lose one vote on pay is embarrassing. To lose two would look like its board has learned nothing and takes its shareholders for mugs. For Burberry, and chairman Sir John Peace, the danger is real. In 2014, 53% of shareholders voted against a remuneration report that included a \u00a315m award of shares to chief executive Christopher Bailey. Now two big proxy voting agencies are advising shareholders to vote against this year\u2019s version. Glass Lewis is still worried about that 2014 award, arguing that Burberry doesn\u2019t explain itself properly when it decides what proportion should vest. ISS seems to agree (it calls the performance conditions \u201cmurky\u201d) but its primary objection is that Burberry over-cooked its calculation of a buy-out award for incoming finance chief Julie Brown when she was hired from Smith &amp; Nephew. The risk of a defeat has sent Burberry into a fine frenzy. Peace and remuneration chair Fabiola Arredondo are lobbying shareholders furiously for support ahead of the annual meeting in a fortnight. Brown has surrendered half her award and the company has issued a note attempting to shed light on how it judges Bailey\u2019s performance. The deeper problem may not be the points raised by ISS and Glass Lewis but Burberry\u2019s record of showering its executives, especially Bailey, with vast sums. Peace, after 13 years in the chair, should know the drill: if he loses a second vote, he should accelerate a retirement currently vaguely scheduled for sometime before the end of next year.",

Thank you for all your comments today and please join us again tomorrow. AM Over in Dublin, Irish tourism leaders have been expressing concerns about the impact of Brexit on the industry. Reilly Dugery reports: At a British Irish Chamber of Commerce seminar on Thursday, Brexit was described as a \u201ctrain with lights coming screaming down the track at us\u201d by Eoin O\u2019Mara Walsh of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. Shane Clarke of Tourism Ireland warned that Brexit had already had a negative impact on tourism, with 900,000 fewer visitors from the UK and a 20% decrease in British spending on the island since the beginning of 2017. Over 12 months, this decrease is expected to cost the island more than \u20ac100 million. John Concannon of Creative Ireland insisted that in order to maintain its appeal to tourists, Ireland must find an identity, comparing the country to a younger sibling having the chance to step outside of his older brother\u2019s shadow. Concannon stated that economic investment in cultural events and initiatives would increase the satisfaction of the local population and subsequently entice potential visitors to the island. All members of the panel agreed that the loss of a soft border and a common travel area would be detrimental for the industry and that significant investment would be necessary to ensure a sustainable future for tourism in Ireland. George Osborne, editor of the Evening Standard and former chancellor of the exchequer, has got another job, taking the total to six. He will take on the unpaid role of honorary professor of economics at the University of Manchester, starting in July. In a series of lectures and masterclasses he will build on his work on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, which he began in number 11. Osborne said he was \u201cbowled over by this honour\u201d. He now has six jobs: Editor, Evening Standard Chairman, Northern Powerhouse Partnership Advisor, Blackrock Speechmaker, Washington Speakers Bureau Fellow, McCain Institute Professor of economics, University of Manchester Read our full story here: There were no new revelations on interest rates when Mark Carney was interviewed earlier by Bloomberg TV. In fact there was no mention of rates at all, with the focus of the interview on a new report on climate change. Read our story on the report here: IG traders are forecasting a mixed opening for Wall Street: Sticking with the US, there were 244,000 new claims for jobless benefits last week, more than the 240,000 forecast by economists in Reuters poll. The figure for the previous week was revised up to by 1,000 to 242,000. US growth has been revised up to 1.4% (on an annual basis) in the first quarter, from an earlier estimate of 1.2%, the Commerce Department said. The boost came from unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger rise in exports. It was still a slowdown compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, when GDP increased 2.1%. Thousands of striking public sector workers have held a mass protest rally in Athens as unionists consider whether they should continue a 12-day walk-out that has left tonnes of rotting rubbish on the streets. The government has not ruled out bringing in the army, or forcibly mobilising the strikers through recourse to the courts, if they decide to continue with the industrial action. Marching on parliament earlier, municipal employees held banners proclaiming : \u201cNo firings, make all contract workers permanent now.\u201d Temperatures hit 44C in some parts of Athens on Thursday with the heatwave now fuelling fears of a public health crisis on account of the massive mounds of rubbish that have accumulated. \u201cDepending on developments, all available state mechanisms will be used not to endanger public health,\u201d said the government spokesman Dimitirs Tzanakopoulos. With temperatures expected to rise on Friday the army could be brought in as early as this evening. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who held talks with unionists on Tuesday, said obligations to creditors behind the country\u2019s three international bailouts made it impossible to satisfy all demands. German consumer inflation rose unexpectedly in June, to 1.6% from 1.5% in May, the Federal Statistics Office said. It had been expected to fall to 1.4%. When harmonised to make the figures comparable with other EU countries, the rate rose to 1.5% from 1.4%. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist for Germany, said this could be the \u201clast inflation hooray\u201d and considers the dilemma facing the ECB. Looking ahead, lower oil prices and the stronger euro exchange rate should lower headline inflation in the coming months. Today\u2019s German inflation data provides further evidence for the ECB\u2019s (and other central banks\u2019) current dilemma: a cyclical upswing without significant inflationary pressure. If even an economy which has just entered its ninth year of economic expansion and which has record high employment hardly shows any inflationary pressures, how could the eurozone as a whole do so any time soon? Over the last 48 hours, financial markets have been overly excited about the ECB and possible tapering. Looking back at the now famous Sintra speech of ECB president Draghi confirms our earlier view that the ECB has not drastically changed its stance, neither its own take on the economy or the future path of monetary policy. The ECB will strike a very cautious balance between moving towards tapering, without jumping the gun and distorting markets. This week\u2019s market reaction has been a clear reminder for the ECB that steering market expectations is an extremely tough job to do. Over in Greece, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is in confident mood. Speaking at a conference in Athens, Euclid Tsakalotos signalled that the debt-stricken country plans to return to markets within a year. He took many aback saying the country would attempt to access markets whether it had been included in the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme or not. Backtracking from the Greek government\u2019s previous stance that entry into the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme was essential to market return, Tsakalotos said the belief now was that it would have a largely \u201csymbolic\u201d effect and, as such, should not be given with too much significance. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t elevate it too high \u2026 it would be very useful. It is important but mostly in symbolic terms,\u201d he told the conference also attended this year by officials representing Greece\u2019s quartet of creditors. The leftist-led government, he said, was now placing more emphasis on persuading investors that when the thrice-bailed out nation does tap markets it isn\u2019t a one-off. He insisted it was important that Greece - essentially exiled from capital markets since 2010 - didn\u2019t go in \u201ctoo early.\u201d \u201cWhat we need to do is ensure that the investment community knows there will be a programme of access to the markets. When we do go, we want to ensure that the markets know that it\u2019s apart of a strategy of going two, three, four times, so they understand not the details but the process.\u201d Here is our story on the government\u2019s decision to refer the Sky bid to the competition watchdog: Bradley says parties will have until 14 July to make representations before a final decision is made. Sky\u2019s shares are up: Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, says she is referring Fox\u2019s \u00a311.7bn offer for Sky to the Competition and Markets Authority for a \u201cphase two\u201d inquiry on the grounds of media plurality. The culture secretary is making a statement on her decision on Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of Sky... Eurozone economic sentiment rose more than expected in June to its highest level in almost 10 years, according to monthly data from the European commission. Optimism rose across all sectors of the economy, pushing the headline index to 111.1 in June from 109.2 in May. It was the highest since August 2007, and beat expectations of a smaller increase to 109.5. The commission\u2019s business confidence also rose, to its highest level since April 2011. So all in all, eurozone firms do not seem ruffled at the prospect of Brexit. Peter Vanden Houte, ING\u2019s chief economist for the eurozone, says the survey suggests the European Central Bank is safe to take \u201cbaby steps\u201d towards tightening policy. The eurozone economy continues its winning streak, making a growth figure above 2% no longer a fantasy. The current figures fit the picture painted by [ECB president] Mario Draghi earlier this week pretty well: the eurozone economy is definitely gaining momentum. One should note that the recent trend in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation down again in the coming months. At the same time, expectations for unemployment in the consumer survey fell to the lowest level since 2007. This could increase wage bargaining power and ultimately lead to higher wages, which is according to Mario Draghi the lynchpin for monetary policy. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item forecasting group, says that even small rises in interest rates could cause problems for households: It may be that the heightened squeeze on consumer purchasing power is increasing the need for some consumers to borrow. The Bank of England will be far from happy with the May consumer credit data, and it could bolster the case for a near-term interest rate hike to try to curb consumers\u2019 readiness to borrow. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given high borrowing levels. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist and dove-turned-hawk, has been out and about on a mini tour of Wales (Barry, Porth and Ely in Cardiff). He reiterated his point that interest rates might have to \u201cedge up\u201d if the cost of living continues to rise in Britain. He told BBC Wales: We need to look seriously at the possibility of raising interest rates to keep the lid on those cost of living increases. For now we are happy with where the rates are, we need to be vigilant for what happens next. Last week Haldane stunned markets with the declaration that UK rates may have to rise later this year. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of comparison site money.co.uk, says the rise in consumer credit is worrying. This jump is concerning - it\u2019s worrying providers have been lending more money while the gap between how much credit they are willing to give v how much people are actually earning has got wider. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u2019ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. If you\u2019re thinking of borrowing money you must be realistic with yourself. Work out if you can actually afford it and how stretched it will leave you each month. If you were to lose your job do you have the means to pay it back? News flash! The pound broke through the $1.30 barrier for the first time in five weeks. It is up more than half a cent or 0.5% against the dollar. Traders are standing by their bet that the Bank of England is readying for a rate rise after those comments from Governor Mark Carney on Wednesday. The stronger than expected consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures come just two days after the Bank of England told banks they must hold more capital in the face of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. Household finances are coming under increasing strain as inflation outpaces wage growth. That means consumers are forced to dip into their savings or take on more debt in order to maintain spending. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the latest figures suggest consumers aren\u2019t losing too much sleep over the pay squeeze: May\u2019s UK money and credit figures provide another reason to think that the consumer slowdown shouldn\u2019t be too severe. Not only was the monthly rise in consumer credit of \u00a31.7bn up on April\u2019s \u00a31.5bn increase, but it was well above the consensus expectation (\u00a31.4bn) too. Meanwhile, the number of mortgages approved for new house purchase rose from an upwardly-revised 65,051 in April to 65,202 in May, also higher than the consensus expectation (of 64,000). This suggests that households remain confident enough to increase borrowing to help smooth consumption, in the face of the squeeze on their real incomes. Of course, this will do nothing to allay policymakers concerns about the recent rapid increases in unsecured lending and strengthens the case for the Financial Policy Committee to act to address this issue at its next meeting in September. The Bank of England has just published its latest consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures. Consumer lending rose by \u00a31.7bn in May, following a \u00a31.5bn rise in April. UK economists were predicting a slowdown in lending to \u00a31.4bn. There was a 10.2% rise in unsecured consumer borrowing, year-on-year in the three months to May, up from 9.7% in April. It was the joint highest since November. Meanwhile the number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 65,202 in May, little changed from April\u2019s 65,051. It beat economists\u2019 forecasts of 64,000 approvals. UK banking shares are benefiting this morning from developments in the US, where banks passed the second round of the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test. It opened the door to higher payouts to shareholders, and boosted confidence about the general health of the sector. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said UK banking shares are enjoying the \u201cUS halo effect\u201d. Banking stocks jumped on the open after regulators in the US gave the greenlight to higher dividends and buybacks, whilst the hints of a shift in tone from central bankers towards tightening is spurring hopes of higher interest rates again. HSBC led the FTSE 100, rising nearly 4% at the start of play. Standard Chartered rose 2%, while Barclays, Lloyds and RBS were all up more than 1%. With a big index weighting that HSBC boost powered the FTSE 100 higher, while gains for mining stocks as metal prices firmed also supported. The boost seems to have been the halo effect from the US, as all the major banks passed stress tests, which means they can now significantly raise shareholder returns. The Fed has effectively green-lighted up to $100bn in dividends and buybacks. US banks rose in after-hours trading as a result. FTSE 100\u2019s biggest risers this morning: It\u2019s been a mixed start for European markets this morning. The FTSE is leading the risers, boosted by the banking and mining sectors. The scores so far: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,42 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 12,674 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,248 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 20,994 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,697 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: flat at 386 The government is due to announce today whether or not it will give the go ahead to 21st Century Fox\u2019s proposed \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is expected to make the announcement later this morning. She could decide to wave the deal through, discuss options with Fox to address any issues raised by Ofcom, or refer the takeover to the Competition and Markets Authority. Here is a reminder of the background: Some UK corporate news now. The Financial Reporting Council is to take a deeper look at the role played by \u2018Big Four\u2019 accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers in BT\u2019s \u00a3530m Italian accounting scandal. After \u201cinitial enquiries\u201d, the UK\u2019s corporate governance watchdog announced a full investigation into the audits performed by PwC on BT over the three years from 2015 to 2017. BT wrote off \u00a3530m in January over \u201cimproper practices\u201d, sending its shares tumbling 21% in a day. Chief executive Gavin Patterson has since seen his pay packet slashed by \u00a34m, while the firm\u2019s European head Corrado Sciolla lost his job over the affair. The euro is also climbing higher against the dollar this morning as investors bet on tighter monetary policy across Europe. It is currently up 0.4% at \u20ac1.1425, boosted by comments on Tuesday from Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. Draghi\u2019s statement that \u201creflation\u201d was returning to the eurozone prompted speculation of policy tightening, even after ECB sources felt compelled to clarify on Wednesday that he was not signalling immediate action. Bloomberg TV will be showing an interview with Mark Carney at 11.30. Markets are now pricing in a 50% chance of a UK rate rise by the end of 2017. Let\u2019s see if the Bank of England governor provides any more clarity. The pound dropped sharply immediately after the 8 June general election, when it became clear Theresa May had lost her majority. Sterling has now returned to pre-election levels after Carney\u2019s rate rise hint. It is edging closer towards $1.30 this morning, at $1.2974. Traders at spread-betting firm IG predict European markets will open higher this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets had much to digest on Wednesday after surprise comments from Mark Carney were interpreted as a hint that he is moving closer to a vote for a rate hike. The pound jumped to a post-election high after his remarks at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, and the currency has built on those gains this morning. The pound is currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2963. However, the devil is in the detail and some analysts say that while his comments were certainly less dovish than his Mansion House speech, Carney wasn\u2019t suggesting he\u2019s ready to press the button on a rate rise just yet. We\u2019ll keep you updated on all the latest developments. Also coming up today... At 9.30am the Bank of England will publish the latest data on consumer credit and mortgage approvals data. This should be interesting following the Bank\u2019s warning earlier this week of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. A snapshot of eurozone business confidence in June is scheduled for 10am. German inflation data at 13.00 is expected to show a slight dip in the rate to 1.4% in June from 1.5% in May. In the US we have the second revision of first-quarter growth, and weekly jobless claims data, both at 13.30. And here is a reminder of what Mark Carney had to say on Wednesday:",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator is scrutinising the fast-growing car finance sector and has held discussions with the US authorities about the market. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said the FCA wanted to understand what was going on in the car finance market. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Does it mean there are more cars or [is it that] the form of financing has changed? I think it\u2019s something to do with the latter rather then the former,\u201d he said. Lending on car loans is the fastest-growing part of the consumer finance market, which is growing at 10.3% a year overall. Within that, car finance is growing fastest at 15% a year, while credit card lending is rising at 9% and personal lending at 7%. Bailey said his \u201chunch\u201d was the market had undergone a structural change and was behaving more like a market for secured lending \u2013 such as mortgages \u2013 rather than an unsecured market such as credit cards or personal loans. \u201cIt has become more like the US, more of a secured finance market than it was in the past,\u201d said Bailey. Regulators need to know if consumers will prioritise paying back a car loan before other forms of unsecured lending, such as credit cards or personal laons. The FCA is concerned about a lack of transparency, potential conflicts of interest and irresponsible lending in the motor finance industry and after its review will decide whether it needs to take action to curtail the explosive growth. Most of the growth has been fuelled by personal contract plans, which can start at less than \u00a3100 a month and with only a \u00a3100 deposit. Carbuyers never actually purchase the car, but make payments to cover the depreciation on a vehicle between driving it out of the showroom and handing it back, usually three years later. Earlier this week, the Bank of England ordered banks to start setting aside more capital in the face of the rapid growth of consumer finance, such as credit cards, car finance and personal loans. The Bank calculates there is \u00a358bn of outstanding car dealership finance, with some 40% coming from banks. It says that 85% of new cars were bought with dealership finance in 2016 - up from about half in 2009. The US has a longer established market for car finance and the FCA has been talking to regulators there about the implications. \u201cIf you talk to people in the US what they say is you need to view it through the lens of secured borrowing,\u201d said Bailey. Speaking to an audience at the British Bankers Association, Bailey said the regulator was keen to avoid taking any action that might push borrowers to illegal lenders. \u201cThere are sections of the public who do have a justifiable need for credit but whose credit records are not necessarily straight forward,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAn example of this is where you\u2019ve got people with increasingly erratic income.\u201d In January 2015 price caps on pay day loans came into force \u2013 at no more than 0.8% a day \u2013 which the FCA is monitoring to ensure that borrowers are not forced towards more expensive forms of credit.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has pledged to protect 7,000 engineering jobs in the east Midlands as part of a \u00a3150m investment, its largest single outlay in the UK for more than a decade. The engineering firm struck a deal with trade unions that will safeguard work for nearly a third of its 22,300-strong UK workforce for five years, as it prepares to double the number of engines it builds. Rolls-Royce will ditch plans to close a precision machining facility in Derby, saving 150 jobs that were at risk, as well as creating 200 new positions by building a new testing facility for jet engines. Of the \u00a3150m planned investment, \u00a390m will be spent on building the \u201ctestbed\u201d, Rolls-Royce\u2019s sixth in Derby, where it puts engines destined for commercial jets through their paces. The testbed will be large enough for Rolls-Royce\u2019s new range of UltraFan engines, which are bigger and designed to be more fuel efficient than previous models. It will also use the site to test the Trent 900, which powers the Airbus A380 \u201csuperjumbo\u201d; the Trent 1000, used on Boeing\u2019s \u201cDreamliner\u201d; and the Trent XWB, which powers the Airbus A350 and has become the world\u2019s fastest-selling engine. The overall plan also includes investment in Rolls-Royce\u2019s large engine maintenance, repair and overhaul facility, as well as the Hucknall and Annesley sites in Nottinghamshire. The trade union Unite, which had been campaigning for extra investment from Rolls-Royce, said the plan \u201ceffectively secures the manufacturing base of Roll-Royce in the UK for the next 20 years, along with 7,000 high-quality jobs\u201d. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: \u201cThis is great news for a world-beating workforce making world-class engines and testament to the hard work of Unite\u2019s shop stewards and members. \u201cIt is a good day for British manufacturing that must not be undone by a botched Brexit. \u201cThe government must now play its part by pursuing a \u2018jobs first\u2019 Brexit and securing tariff-free access to the single market and customs union. A failure to do so risks future investment and decent high quality manufacturing jobs.\u201d Rolls-Royce\u2019s commitment to protecting UK jobs comes just four months after it reported a \u00a34.6bn pre-tax loss, the largest in its history, due to the impact of Brexit on sterling and the cost of settling corruption charges. The business secretary, Greg Clark, said the investment \u201cunderpins the critical role the UK plays within the global aerospace sector\u201d. \u201cThe UK and Rolls-Royce are known throughout the world as pioneers of advanced engineering technology,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "2017 June Karen Bradley rules on whether UK government will allow Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21 Century Fox to take 100% control of Sky. April The European regulator gives Fox\u2019s \u00a311.7bn proposed takeover of Sky \u201cunconditional approval\u201d, clearing it of any potential competition issues. March The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, refers Fox\u2019s bid to Ofcom, the UK regulator, over public interest concerns. The watchdog is tasked with investigating whether the deal gives Rupert Murdoch too much control of UK news media and whether Fox, which owns the rightwing Fox News channel, will adhere to existing standards of accuracy and impartiality once it takes full control of broadcasting assets including Sky News. Separately, Ofcom launches an investigation to establish whether the Murdoch family are \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of Sky after the phone-hacking scandal and sexual harassment allegations that have emerged at Fox News in the US. 2016 9 December Sky announces that its independent directors have agreed an offer price of \u00a310.75 per share in cash from 21st Century Fox. October More than 50% of Sky\u2019s independent shareholders vote against James Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman at the annual general meeting. January Sky announces that James Murdoch is to return as chairman in May, replacing Nicholas Ferguson. 2014 July BSkyB buys 21st Century Fox\u2019s 57.4% stake in Sky Deutschland and 100% of Sky Italia for about \u00a34.9bn. It also buys out the other shareholders in Sky Deutchsland to take full control of the broadcaster. The deal adds nearly 10 million subscribers in Germany and Italy to the company\u2019s 11.5 million customers in the UK and Ireland. In November, BSkyB rebrands as Sky. 2013 June Murdoch\u2019s BSkyB stake moves to newly created TV and film company 21st Century Fox, which is spun out of News Corporation into a separately listed public company. His newspapers, including the Sun, Times and Sunday Times, become part of a second company, News Corp. 2012 September Ofcom concludes that BSkyB remains a fit and proper owner of broadcast licences. However, it is highly critical of James Murdoch over his handling of the phone-hacking scandal when he was chairman of the publisher of the Sun, Times and the now-defunct News of the World. April James Murdoch steps down as BSkyB chairman but remains on the board. 2011 July News Corporation abandons Sky takeover on the day all three main UK political parties are due to call on it to drop the deal in a Commons vote, as public outrage over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal grows. 2010 June BSkyB rejects a 675p a share offer from News Corporation for the 61% of the satellite broadcaster it does not own. The offer is increased to 700p and the two sides start talks. In the same month, BSkyB announces annual pre-tax profits topped \u00a31bn for the first time. 2007 December James Murdoch is promoted to chairman and chief executive of BSkyB\u2019s parent company News Corporation. Jeremy Darroch replaces him as BSkyB chief executive. 2006 July Sky Broadband launches, taking on telecoms competitors including BT. 2003 November Murdoch sees off a potential shareholder revolt to install his son James as BSkyB chief executive. 1998 October BSkyB launches Sky Digital, offering hundreds of channels and more interactivity. 1994 November BSkyB becomes a publicly listed company, floating on the London and New York stock exchanges, raising \u00a3900m by offering 20% of the stock to investors. Murdoch\u2019s holding reduced to 39%. 1992 August BSkyB launches live coverage of the first season of Premier League football, revolutionising UK TV sport and boosting the company\u2019s subscriber numbers. 1990 November After a costly battle for subscribers with rival BSB, Murdoch engineers a 50/50 merger creating BSkyB, with Sky executives taking most senior jobs in the new company. 1989 5 February Rupert Murdoch launches analogue satellite broadcaster Sky Television, offering nine channels including Sky News.",

      "bodyText": "The fund management industry has become an elaborate exercise in siphoning savers\u2019 capital for the benefit of insiders, critics have grumbled for years, with strong justification. Now the Financial Conduct Authority finally agrees \u2013 roughly speaking. The regulator\u2019s language is softer, but many of its findings support familiar complaints about opaque fee structures, conflicts of interest and inadequate governance oversight. Price competition is \u201cweak in a number of areas\u201d to the point where average profit margins are 36% for asset managers and fees for active funds haven\u2019t changed in 10 years. There is no relationship between charges and performance. Investment objectives aren\u2019t communicated clearly. Benefits of scale aren\u2019t passed onto retail investors. The charge sheet is long. The question is whether the FCA\u2019s proposed remedies go far enough. There are some easy wins like banning the grubby practice known as \u201cbox management\u201d \u2013 managers pocketing the difference between the \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201csell\u201d price when a unit in a fund is merely being transferred between customers. That some managers currently feel entitled to help themselves to this risk-free income is outrageous. A push for greater transparency \u2013 the big theme in the report \u2013 is welcome. The FCA supports the disclosure of all-in fees, including transaction charges. About time, too: all-in fees should mean what they say. The idea that fund managers should have at least two independent directors is sensible, though the FCA could have been bolder on numbers. The voice of customers is more likely to be heard if their interests are represented in the boardroom. Yet one gets a strong sense that the FCA, having lifted the lid on an industry that has escaped scrutiny for too long, knows its work has only just started. The list of other financial players scheduled for investigation is also long: investment consultants, fund platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown (whose profit margins can be as high as 70%), hedge funds and the private equity brigade. Delivering a blast of transparency to all those corners of the investment game is not going to happen overnight. But the FCA should keep going and resist the inevitable lobbying backlash. Over the past 20 years, the fund management industry has exploded in size and its top individuals grown immensely wealthy. It\u2019s about time somebody asked whether it is delivering value for money for customers. The answer in too many cases is no. Ploughing on at the Co-op bank Hurrah, the Co-operative Bank is saved. In truth, a successful recapitalisation never seemed in serious doubt, even when buyers didn\u2019t show up with decent takeover offers. The hedge funds who have supported the bank since 2013 knew their best interests were served by finding fresh cash and supporting a debt-for-equity swap. Even after five years of losses in a row, there is still a decent retail bank at the core of the operation. Customers, including 1.4 million current account holders, have stayed loyal. The technology has been expensively overhauled. Sometime around 2021, the hedge funds may be able to sell. Their returns may not match their original expectations but, in current circumstances, ploughing on makes more financial sense for them than giving up. Can the Co-op Bank credibly still travel under a co-operative banner, though? Its chairman, Dennis Holt, protests that the ethically minded punters either don\u2019t mind, or don\u2019t notice, that the Co-op Bank is controlled by hedge funds. They are more interested in the bank\u2019s trading values, he says. Well, okay, but Holt is dodging the question: the word \u201cco-operative\u201d in this context surely describes an ownership model, not a set of business principles. In practice, the polite fiction can probably continue harmlessly. Certainly, the business secretary, who has powers to intervene, would be unwise to upset the financial reconstruction by insisting on a change of name. It wouldn\u2019t be worth the hassle. Tesco workers may well question Lewis\u2019s bonuses Another day, another round of job losses at Tesco. This time 1,200 posts are going at head office. All supermarkets are reining in costs, of course, and Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, has more reason than most to cut. The share price, at 172p, down 16% this year, betrays the worry that his turnaround programme is losing puff. Some of Tesco\u2019s soon-to-be-former employees may wonder if the \u00a35.3m paid to Lewis in bonuses over the past two years was a reward for a commercial revival that hasn\u2019t yet happened.",

There is no relationship between charges and performance. Investment objectives aren\u2019t communicated clearly. Benefits of scale aren\u2019t passed onto retail investors. The charge sheet is long.</p> <p>The question is whether the FCA\u2019s proposed remedies go far enough. There are some easy wins like banning the grubby practice known as \u201cbox management\u201d \u2013 managers pocketing the difference between the \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201csell\u201d price when a unit in a fund is merely being transferred between customers. That some managers currently feel entitled to help themselves to this risk-free income is outrageous.</p> <p>A push for greater transparency \u2013 the big theme in the report \u2013 is welcome. The FCA supports the disclosure of all-in fees, including transaction charges. About time, too: all-in fees should mean what they say. The idea that fund managers should have at least two independent directors is sensible, though the FCA could have been bolder on numbers. The voice of customers is more likely to be heard if their interests are represented in the boardroom.</p> <p>Yet one gets a strong sense that the FCA, having lifted the lid on an industry that has escaped scrutiny for too long, knows its work has only just started. The list of other financial players scheduled for investigation is also long: investment consultants, fund platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown (whose profit margins can be as high as 70%), hedge funds and the private equity brigade. Delivering a blast of transparency to all those corners of the investment game is not going to happen overnight.</p> <p>But the FCA should keep going and resist the inevitable lobbying backlash. Over the past 20 years, the fund management industry has exploded in size and its top individuals grown immensely wealthy. It\u2019s about time somebody asked whether it is delivering value for money for customers. The answer in too many cases is no.</p> <h2>Ploughing on at the Co-op bank</h2> <p>Hurrah, the Co-operative Bank is saved. In truth, a successful recapitalisation never seemed in serious doubt, even when buyers didn\u2019t show up with decent takeover offers. The hedge funds who have supported the bank since 2013 knew their best interests were served by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/28/co-op-bank-rescue-deal-co-operative-group-hedge-funds\">finding fresh cash and supporting a debt-for-equity swap</a>.</p> <p>Even after five years of losses in a row, there is still a decent retail bank at the core of the operation. Customers, including 1.4 million current account holders, have stayed loyal. The technology has been expensively overhauled. Sometime around 2021, the hedge funds may be able to sell. Their returns may not match their original expectations but, in current circumstances, ploughing on makes more financial sense for them than giving up.</p> <p>Can the Co-op Bank credibly still travel under a co-operative banner, though? Its chairman, Dennis Holt, protests that the ethically minded punters either don\u2019t mind, or don\u2019t notice, that the Co-op Bank is controlled by hedge funds. They are more interested in the bank\u2019s trading values, he says. Well, okay, but Holt is dodging the question: the word \u201cco-operative\u201d in this context surely describes an ownership model, not a set of business principles. </p> <p>In practice, the polite fiction can probably continue harmlessly. Certainly, the business secretary, who has powers to intervene, would be unwise to upset the financial reconstruction by insisting on a change of name. It wouldn\u2019t be worth the hassle.</p> <h2>Tesco workers may well question Lewis\u2019s bonuses</h2> <p>Another day, another round of job losses at Tesco. This time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/28/tesco-to-cut-1200-head-office-jobs\">1,200 posts are going at head office</a>. All supermarkets are reining in costs, of course, and Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, has more reason than most to cut. The share price, at 172p, down 16% this year, betrays the worry that his turnaround programme is losing puff. Some of Tesco\u2019s soon-to-be-former employees may wonder if the \u00a35.3m paid to Lewis in bonuses over the past two years was a reward for a commercial revival that hasn\u2019t yet happened.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The London-to-Edinburgh rail line is facing its third crisis of private ownership in 11 years after Stagecoach clashed with the government over the terms of its East Coast franchise. Stagecoach has also admitted that in hindsight it overpaid for the \u00a33.3bn contract, blaming factors including Brexit and terrorism for underperformance that punched an \u00a384m hole in its finances. The difficulties facing Virgin East Coast, 90% owned by Stagecoach and 10% by Virgin, prompted renewed calls for nationalisation of the railways. The transport group said it expected to renegotiate its \u00a3412m-a-year contract with the Department for Transport in the light of state-owned Network Rail\u2019s failure to deliver infrastructure upgrades and an expected delay in the arrival of new trains. \u201cThe franchise will have to be reset because the terms and assumptions no longer apply,\u201d Martin Griffiths, the chief executive of Stagecoach, said. But the DfT said it expected Stagecoach to \u201chonour its financial commitments\u201d. It insisted that 65 new Hitachi trains would arrive on schedule in 2018, but did not comment on stalled infrastructure improvements. The dispute raises the possibility that Stagecoach could end up paying something closer to the \u00a3235m that state-owned Directly Operated Railways (DOR) did in the final year of a franchise it took on in 2009, when the government seized control from National Express. National Express became the second private company to taste failure on the East Coast route after shipping and transport group Sea Containers went bust in 2006. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport minister, said the East Coast line \u2013 the scene of a dispute between Jeremy Corbyn and Virgin East Coast about overcrowding \u2013 showed privatised rail was \u201cdysfunctional, broken and needed to be brought to an end\u201d. The RMT union said re-privatising the line had been a \u201cgamble doomed to failure\u201d. Griffiths pointed to Stagecoach\u2019s \u00a3140m expenditure on improving services, which he said would not have happened under state ownership, adding that taxpayers could still expect a \u201csignificant return\u201d. But analysts said it was possible that Stagecoach, which is losing money at present but expects to make a profit on the line by 2019, could become the third private operator to abandon the franchise. \u201cIf they can reach agreement with the DfT and their financial provisions are suitably conservative, that won\u2019t come to pass,\u201d said Gerald Khoo of stockbroker Liberup Capital. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t reach agreement, or something else [goes] significantly wrong with the franchise or the wider economy, then all bets are off.\u201d The East Coast line has underperformed in its first two years, forcing Stagecoach to take a one-off charge of \u00a384m for the \u201conerous contract\u201d. Operating profit in its rail division, which also includes the East Midlands and South West franchises, slumped from \u00a367m to \u00a331m. The company blamed factors including low consumer confidence related to Brexit and the general election, terrorism, and low fuel prices encouraging people to drive or fly. Griffiths said: \u201cHindsight is a wonderful thing. We would have liked to have bid less now, but I can\u2019t change that.\u201d Asked if Stagecoach could end up walking away like National Express, he said: \u201cWe have a contract, we are honouring our contract and supporting the business. I don\u2019t like announcing losses, but the circumstances are what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British taxpayers face paying billions of pounds more than previously expected for dismantling the North Sea\u2019s oil rigs in a further sign that the industry is becoming a burden on public finances. Decommissioning oil and gas facilities across the UK continental shelf will cost an estimated \u00a359.7bn, according to a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA). About half of that will be borne by oil companies, the rest by the public purse through tax relief. The figure is even higher than a recent estimate of \u00a353bn by the energy experts Wood Mackenzie and the business department\u2019s previous estimate of \u00a352bn. The OGA, a government regulator, said that in its worst-case scenario the bill could jump to \u00a382.7bn. However, the authority said it had set the industry a target of cutting costs by 35%, which it hoped could see the cost drop below \u00a339bn. The decommissioning of smaller rigs has been under way for years as the region\u2019s production began to decline, but a new wave of bigger projects are beginning to be removed. In May, Shell removed the first of four rigs from the Brent field 100 miles north of Shetland, part of a plan that will take years and cost single-digit billions alone. Oil companies enjoy between 40% and 75% tax relief on their clean-up costs because of their contribution to Treasury coffers during production years. But decommissioning and a slump in oil prices meant the oil and gas sector was a net drain on the Treasury of \u00a3396m in 2016 for the first time. The Oil and Gas Authority assessment covers the cost of clean-up for existing and proposed offshore platforms, pipelines, wells and terminals. It arrived at the figure of \u00a359.7bn after looking at data from 34 industry operators. Gunther Newcombe, the group\u2019s operation director, said: \u201cThis report provides us with a starting-point cost estimate of \u00a359.7bn to decommission UK oil and gas infrastructure. The challenge now is to save industry and the taxpayer money and achieve safe decommissioning for \u00a339bn or less.\u201d But hitting the cost-cutting target would require a \u201csignificant change\u201d in the way industry approached decommissioning, he added. While technology will be one way of cutting costs, another could be a rethink of the regulations covering the removal of oil and gas facilities. Some conservationists now support leaving an approach of \u201crigs to reef\u201d, where old rigs are left to become artificial reefs rather than fully removed \u2013 with the savings diverted to a fund to protect sea life. In March, the Treasury said it would look at plans to allow the tax relief for decommissioning to be attached to an asset \u2013 eg the oil field \u2013 rather than a company. Currently, a company that has run an oil operation and paid tax for years can claim tax relief, but cannot transfer that benefit with a sale. Oil groups such as BP and Shell have both recently sold stakes in their North Sea interests to smaller, independent players as they look for more profitable prospects elsewhere in the world. A panel of industry experts has also been appointed to advise government on selling fields and keeping them producing oil. A government spokeswoman said: \u201cThe oil and gas sector continues to deliver significant economic benefits to the UK, by supporting around 300,000 jobs, and meeting half of the UK\u2019s primary energy needs.\u201d",
