      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland declared on Thursday it was on track for a partial privatisation next year but sparked a fresh row over bonuses at the scandal-hit institution. The bank posted an annual loss of more than \u00a35bn and Stephen Hester, its chief executive, admitted 2012 had been a \"chastening\" year after its \u00a3390m Libor rigging fine. Its total losses since the 2008 bailout have now topped \u00a334bn. However, the bank is still paying out \u00a3607m in bonuses in the coming weeks. The shares were among the biggest fallers on the stock market, losing more than 6% to 323p \u2013 which amounts to a near \u00a315bn loss on the taxpayer's 82% stake. Hester, however, said \"the light at the end of the tunnel\" toward privatisation was \"coming much closer\" while Sir Philip Hampton, RBS's chairman, hoped the bank would start to pay a \"token\" dividendto shareholders \u2013 the first since the banking crisis \u2013 \"as soon as possible\". He said: \"Our objective is to give the government options to sell its stake as soon as possible and it would be very good if we could make that 'as soon as possible' 2014.\" A government spokesman insisted that \"there is no timetable for a disposal\" although ideas for a free distribution of shares to 46m voters had been floated as recently as a fortnight ago. George Osborne claimed credit for the decision by RBS to \"accelerate\" its focus on UK retail and corporate banking. It announced further streamlining of the investment bank and a plan to spin off part of its US operation, known as Citizens, in two years. Hester described UK Financial Investments, which looks after the stakes in the bailed-out banks, as becoming \"more activist in trying to present its views\". Asked what form any share sale would take, Hampton said he expected taxpayers to be able to \"participate in the availability of shares\" although he warned about the number of football stadiums that would be needed for shareholder meetings. Hester said the privatisation of RBS would be a \"seminal\" moment, appearing to indicate that he intended to stay on to see the task through. Despite the loss, RBS has paid out \u00a3607m in bonuses, \u00a3215m of which went to its investment bankers whose division was behind the Libor scandal. The bank, which said bonuses would have been \u00a3500m higher without the Libor fine, risked inflaming the row over City pay further by indicating that its annual report in March could disclose how many of its staff take home more than \u00a31m. Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said: \"We need radical change in the culture of our banks and that must include reining in bloated bonuses, which are a device for keeping traders focused on the weeks ahead, rather than years ahead.\" Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, said that RBS was \"starting 2013 in a weaker financial position than the market had anticipated\". The bank insisted it would meet international targets for capital before the deadline in 2019. Hester stressed that the bank's assets had been reduced by \u00a3906bn since their peak in 2008 but acknowledged the cost of the payment protection insurance scandal, for which the bank took a further \u00a3450m charge to take the total cost to \u00a32.2bn, and the interest rate swap mis-selling scandal had required a further \u00a3650m charge. The computer meltdown in June cost \u00a3175m. He said: \"2012 saw landmark achievements for RBS. It was also a chastening year. Along with the rest of the banking industry we faced significant reputational challenges as we worked with regulators to put right past mistakes.\" Osborne, who this week rejected calls for RBS to be fully nationalised, said: \"I have been very clear that I want to see RBS as a British-based bank, focused on serving British businesses and consumers, with a smaller international investment bank to support that activity rather than to rival it.\" The chancellor added: \"The government's strategy is for RBS be a stronger and safer bank, which in time can be returned to full private ownership.\" But he did not give any clues as to his preferred route for when a share sell-off can begin. Hester acknowledged the influence of the government and also the regulators which have been conducting a review of bank capital. There had been an \"important accommodation\" over the bank's capital, Hester said. \"The two revisions to our strategy that go with that are a further shrinkage of our markets business, with the capital there coming down significantly further over the next couple of years\" and the intention to start selling Citizens. On bonuses, Hester said that while the figure looked a \"big number\", it was below the \u00a31.8bn being paid out at Barclays and sums handed out by rivals UBS and Deutsche Bank. RBS was forced to sell off its insurance business Direct Line by Brussels in return for the taxpayer bailout in 2008 and spun off a third of the operation last year, for which it has already been forced to take a goodwill writedown of \u00a3394m. \u2022 This story was amended on Thursday 28 February to correct the figures for the amount being paid in bonuses",

      "bodyText": "Spain's answer to RBS \u2013 Bankia \u2013 has published the worst results ever seen by a Spanish corporation, racking up 2012 losses of \u20ac19.2 bn (\u00a316.6bn) as the nationalised bank drowned in a sea of toxic real estate left over from the country's burst housing bubble. The figures confirmed the dire fortunes of a bank formed out of a merger of seven of Spain's ailing savings banks in 2010 as the government made a futile attempt to save them from disaster. Client flight during 2012 helped bring a 13% fall in total deposits. Bankia became the focus of Spain's banking crisis last year after auditors refused to sign off on the accounts presented by company president Rodrigo Rato, a former finance minister from prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party (PP) and one-time head of the International Monetary Fund. It is now taking \u20ac18bn in bailout funds from the country's Frob bank restructuring fund, which had to borrow the money from the eurozone's bailout fund as part of a \u20ac40bn rescue of several struggling banks. Just months before being nationalised in May Bankia had been reporting \u20ac309m in profits for 2011. That figure eventually turned into \u20ac3bn in losses. The bank's former management is under investigation by the courts, with an investigating magistrate taking evidence in recent weeks from auditors Deloitte and former Bank of Spain president Miguel Angel Fern\u00e1ndez Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. No one has yet been charged in the case. Press reports suggested that holders of Bankia shares \u2013which were sold aggressively to the bank's own retail customers as it desperately tried to raise money in 2011 \u2013 will see their investment virtually wiped out. The Frob fund has denied reports that, under pressure from the eurozone's bailout funds, it is to give them a value close to zero. Reuters reported that Brussels officials believe the shares, worth 29 cents on Thursday, should be valued at just one cent each. Spain, according to the same report, is fighting for a 10 cent valuation. Retail clients bought the shares for \u20ac3.75. Bankia has now dumped its toxic real assets in the government-backed Sareb \"bad bank\", which received \u20ac37bn of assets from four rescued banks in December. Sareb is now set to receive about \u20ac15bn of assets from four more banks, confirming its position as one of Europe's biggest holders of real estate. Bankia took provisions of \u20ac24bn in 2012 and insisted that the cleanout would enable it to return to profit this year. \"We start 2013 from a solid position, with a clean balance sheet, good solvency levels and an excellent liquidity situation. Our challenge now is to make Bankia a profitable institution that is able to return to society the support it has received,\" Bankia boss Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Goirigolzarri said. \"It will be a complex year, a year of challenges.\" Non-performing loans fell to 13% in December \u2013 worse than the Spanish banking average of 10.4%. The figure would have been around 15% had it not offloaded property on to the bad bank. Bankia will be 70% government-owned once it completes the capital increase and must shrink its balance sheet by 60% as a condition of the rescue. It is cutting 4,500 jobs and plans to raise \u20ac8bn by selling its portfolio of stakes in companies such as International Airlines Group \u2013 the parent company of British Airways and Iberia. It also plans to sell Florida-based City National Bank within six months.",

      "bodyText": "Roll up, roll up, who wants to buy a share in a loss-making bank that may need more capital and has yet to spin off two subsidiaries? This opportunity may soon be yours, fellow citizen. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, said on Thursday he hoped the government would be able to sell part of its 82% stake \"as soon as possible\" and that it would \"be good if we could make that 2014\". However, meeting that timetable would be going some. There is no iron rule that says RBS has to be a \"normal\" bank at the point of privatisation. But that has always been the expectation and it is adventurous to think that the goal could be achieved by, say, the autumn of next year. It feels about a year too soon. Think of the long list of things that still have to happen at RBS. The final stage of restructuring the investment bank has to be undertaken, and more non-core assets have to be shed. Capital levels have to be increased in order to meet the various demands of the Basel and UK regulators \u2013 with the latter's precise thresholds still unclear. The government has to agree to lift the block on dividend payments imposed via the \"dividend access share\" under the terms of the 2008 bailout. Under orders from the EU, 316 branches have to be sold, probably via flotation as Williams &amp; Glyn's. And, now that George Osborne is insisting more loudly that RBS be a \"British-based bank,\" 25% of US subsidiary Citizens has to be floated off. Those last two actions are probably not essential ahead of privatisation \u2013 Williams &amp; Glyn's, after all, is only 2% of group assets \u2013 but the others are. Negotiations with the government on the access share should be straightforward since both sides clearly want to deal and it's just a question of price (RBS would have to pay \u00a31bn-\u00a32bn, think analysts). Capital levels at the bank, while still too low, are clearly improving. And chief executive Stephen Hester might complete the rest of financial restructuring within 18 months \u2013 after all, on the asset-shedding front, it's been hard to fault his speed. So, making a few heroic assumptions, the checklist might be completed in 2014. There's one final problem. The unveiling of a credible dividend policy \u2013 essential to attract retail investors \u2013 surely implies that RBS has reached a point where there are some profits to distribute. The earliest RBS is likely to make a clean and meaningful profit is 2014, with the full-year numbers to be announced in February 2015. That, surely, would be the natural moment to start talking seriously about privatisation. The problem for the government is that it would love to get in ahead of the general election in May 2015. It rather looks as if Thursday's whetting of appetites is designed to make that politically-dictated timetable seem credible. It's a risky game to play since a 2014 ambition could be blown off course by events \u2013 fresh flames in the eurozone debt crisis, some new banking scandal, and so on. Common sense suggests the best time to sell shares in RBS would be when the UK economy \u2013 the real driver of the value of the bank \u2013 is showing some real growth. That is when the state is likely to gain the best return (or smallest loss) on the \u00a345bn invested in RBS. Osborne, if he wants to hurry things along, should concentrate on addressing Britain's growth problem. Maybe that dangerous radical, Lord Lawson of Blaby, has him rattled with talk of full nationalisation of RBS. The European parliament thinks it has fixed the problem of excessive bank bonuses. It hasn't. It has underestimated banks' ingenuity and determination to pay top staff life-changing sums. Placing a cap on bonuses at one times salary (or two times if shareholders approve) will inevitably be met by increases in fixed pay. Indeed, that process is under way already as regulators have demanded that bonuses be paid partly in shares that have to be held for specified periods. The traders wanted to be \"compensated\" for this change and, by and large, they got their pay rises. There is, it is true, some pressure in the other direction. Even in banks' boardrooms, they've noticed that the cost of entry to the investment banking casino has gone up. Higher capital thresholds, and lower profits, have led to smaller bonus pools. In their quiet way, shareholders have also demanded a greater share of the spoils for themselves. But how is the European parliament's intervention meant to aid this process? It won't. Instead, banks will introduce higher fixed salaries and convoluted pay schemes. In terms of making banks safer, this measure is most likely to be counterproductive. It's too blunt.",

Cooper said that while Barclays was now increasing its dividend payments again, the bank was still distributing a third of what it was in 2008. Meanwhile Standard Chartered had doubled its dividends since 2007, from \u00a3570m to \u00a31.3bn last year.",

It was disbanded in 1985 and, while RBS has suggested the use of the brand in the past, Hester said its rebirth was now his \"baseline\" plan to dispose of the branches which the EU demanded be sold after the government rescue. However, RBS will need to ask the EU to extend the November 2013 sale deadline \u2013 in a setback for the government, which is keen to inject new competition into high street banking. The Financial Services Authority is intending to allow new banks to run on nearly half as much capital as established ones in effort to bolster competition, a plan which did not appear to be immediately popular with RBS. The costly collapse of the sale of the branches to Santander last year has highlighted the difficulties in injecting competition into retail banking which is dominated by the \"big four\" players. Lloyds Banking Group, required to spin off 632 branches by Europe, is expected to admit on Friday that it will miss a self-imposed deadline to sell them to the Co-op when it publishes its results for 2012. That deal also involves the reappearance of an old banking name: TSB \u2013 the Trustee Savings Bank, which Lloyds took over in the 1990s. Lloyds is also working on a potential flotation of this business in case the Co-op deal falls through. Hester said the possibility of uniting the two carved-out branch networks from the two bailed-out banks to make a bigger and stronger entity had been considered, informally but was likely to be too complicated to be practical.

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed, and it's as if the Italian election impasse and the consequent revival of worries about the eurozone never happened. With central bankers including US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and ECB boss Mariio Draghi making dovish comments on further stimulus measures, investors have been in a cautiously positive mood. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 34.93 points higher at 6360.81, up 0.55% \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.86% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.85% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.6% \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 1.15% \u2022 In Athens the market ended up 0.95% Italian and Spanish bond yields eased back too. And in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged towards new highs in early trading, up around 10 points. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. In a speech in France earlier in the week, Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann turned to humour for effect: Well, I am German so I would not dare to tell a joke. But as I am in Paris I might try at least to pass on a little quip I heard the other day. It goes like this: \u201cHow many Germans do you need to change a light-bulb? One, he holds the light-bulb and the rest of Europe revolves around him\u201d. I\u2019m afraid this quip reflects the impression some might have of Germany at the moment. But let me add two things: first, the same joke was being told in the 1990s, and back then, the French where the ones holding the light-bulb. Second, the joke did not reflect actual circumstances in the 1990s, nor does it reflect them today. Meanwhile: In the US the latest manufacturing survey has come in better than expected. The Chicago purchasing managers index rose from 55.6 to 56.8 in February, whereas analysts had been expecting a drop to 54. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The index rose to its highest level since March 2012, suggesting a broad-based improvement in activity in the first quarter of 2013. The national manufacturing ISM will be released tomorrow. Market consensus is for a slight decline to 52.5 from 53.1 in January. We see some upside risks as the picture described by Fed regional surveys is - on average - more upbeat. Meanwhile, tomorrow also marks the day when US spending cuts are due to come into effect, although last-ditch talks between the parties will continue. The IMF warned it would likely cut growth forecasts for the US and the global economy if the cuts - the so-called 'sequestration' - take place. According to Reuters, IMF spokesman William Murray said it would shave around 0.5 percentage points off the US growth forecast. At the moment it is predicting 2% growth this year. He said: We will see what happens on Friday, but everybody is assuming that sequestration is going to take effect. What it means is that we are going to have to re-evaluate our growth forecasts for the US and other forecasts. Back with banking bonus caps, and Michel Barnier - EU internal market commissioner - has said the UK should welcome the move as a fair response to taxpayer anger over the cost of restructuring imprudent banks. He told Reuters' summit on the future of the eurozone that he did not believe the proposals would drive banks out of the City of London to other financial centres such as Switzerland or Singapore. He said: I don't think it is likely that banks that have an interest in working today and tomorrow in the single market will take the risk of leaving the single market simply because of this reason of the remuneration of their executives. Speaking of the Italian election, Ireland does not believe the uncertainty over the outcome should derail its plans to issue bonds this year. The country aims to sell a new benchmark 10-year bond in the first half of the year, the chief executive of its National Asset Management Agency John Corrigan told Dow Jones. He said: Italy is obviously going through a difficult time following the election and that has some impact on European capital markets, but our judgement is it won't knock us off course in relation to our return to the market. Here's the Economist's view of this week's Italian election result (no comment needed): Olli Rehn has now turned his attention to the UK, saying it should remain involved in the EU. He says if he were a British citizen, he would not want his country sitting on the European sidelines. It is firmly in Britain's interest to use its energy to reform Europe rather than undo it. Not a fan of a referendum then, it would seem. As one of our former colleagues notes: Rehn has added that there is a need to urgently complete the repair of the banking system. And with that I'll pass you over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Back to London, where Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, is expressing his confidence that Italy will swiftly find its way forward. Speaking at a Policy Network conference, he says it is important that Italy pursues reform for sustainable growth. More generally, he says high debt countries have only one option, to restore sustainability to finances. Surplus countries, meanwhile, should use reforms to boost domestic demand. He says fiscal consolidation needs to proceed at a careful but steady pace. The mixture of good and bad news from Madrid today reflects the uncertainty hanging over Spain's economy as the government boasts about almost meeting EU-set deficit targets while austerity deepens recession. My colleague Giles Tremlett reports: The 6.74% budget deficit - just 0.4% off target - will be welcomed in Brussels, though the figure surprises some observers. It is still possible that, as with the 2011 deficit, it will increase as more reliable figures appear over coming weeks. Most impressively, assuming the figures are accurate, is the way regional governments - once the rogue elephants in Spain's public finances - have slashed deficits close to government-set targets. But a final quarter drop in GDP of 0.8% - more than double the previous quarter's shrinkage - bodes badly for a country where unemployment is already officially at 26%, as consumer spending falls even while Spaniards save less. Early (and incomplete) figures for this quarter point to \"continued contraction of activity, in a context of marked apathy in internal consumption,\" according to the Bank of Spain. Mariano Rajoy's government hopes it will be rewarded for good behaviour - and for not being Italy - with a relaxation of this year's Brussels-set deficit target, which is currently at 4.5%. It is also predicting a return to growth at the end of the year. But the biggest fear in Madrid today is that a predicted fragile recovery that is still more than six months away will be thrown off track if Italy provokes a return to euro jitters - with Spain first in line to suffer contagion. Sticking with the US, jobless claims dropped 22,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 344,000. That was better than expected and suggests the jobs market in the US is picking up. US GDP has been revised up to +0.1% for the fourth quarter of 2012 from an original estimate that GDP actually fell by 0.1%. Still this was not as big a revision as some had forecast, with analysts betting that the economy had in fact grown by 0.5%. (Just to clarify, the US GDP figures are annualised, so they show the value that would be registered if the quarterly rate of change were maintained for a full year.) There has been a clear improvement over the past year in Europe's economic situation but there is more work to be done to lift the southern economies out of trouble, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny said today. With masterful understatement, he noted the nervousness about Italy's inconclusive election results but said it should not be overdone. Of course everyone's a bit nervous. One should keep things in perspective. I do not think there will be fundamental change in the politics in Italy because there are just economic necessities that you have to follow. There was a bond auction yesterday that went quite well. One shouldn't overdo it. London mayor Boris Johnson expresses his opposition to the EU bonus cap, in his inimitable style. This is possibly the most deluded measure to come from Europe since Diocletian tried to fix the price of groceries across the Roman empire. It would be interesting to know what people abroad think of Boris. Clown or comedy genius? Meanwhile the election of pro-bailout candidate Nicos Anastasiades in Cyprus has boosted the chances of a deal with international lenders, says Moody's But the ratings agency said the results of the weekend's other eurozone election did not alter its assessment the island could eventually default. It said: Domestic banks' recapitalisation needs remain uncertain and we anticipate Cyprus' debt burden will rise dramatically, reaching an unsustainable level. There is a 50% chance that the sheer size of Cyprus' anticipated debt load will eventually compel authorities to pursue every avenue for debt reduction, including private sector losses on Cypriot debt. More assurances that Italy will stick with the euro project. The faster they come the weaker they sound. Here's European council president Herman Van Rompuy, who this morning expressed his full confidence that Italy will continue to remain a stable and strong member of the European Union and of the eurozone. Van Rompuy met outgoing Italian prime minister Mario Monti today to discuss the upcoming council, which will discuss growth and job creation. Despite the UK government's opposition to the EU bonus cap, MEPs from both Labour and the Tories broadly welcomed the deal. Labour MEP, Arlene McCarthy, said: These rules are designed to make banks safer, more accountable and ensure they focus on lending to the real economy. It's a shame that the UK government has sought to defend this broken bonus culture by acting as the trade union for a minority of highly paid traders. The coalition government says they want reform of the banking sector yet they are the only member state to defend the status quo by maintaining the current flawed bonus culture. Conservative MEP, Vicky Ford, said: I do fear that a cap on bankers bonuses is a blunt instrument but I was pleased to sharpen it by including elements that encourage bankers to take long-term decisions, otherwise they risk their bonuses being clawed back. Of course some top bankers will be affected by the bonus cap but I feel that we have managed to produce a deal that will strike the right balance for the majority of bankers who take responsible decisions. If the bonus cap is shown to cause bankers to begin relocating outside the EU then we will have the ability to swiftly look again at the provisions in place through an early review. The EU cap on bonuses (see 7.32am and following) could alter the way the City works and for the better, says another commentator from the Cass business school. Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour, said: The new EU curbs on bankers\u2019 bonuses will force banks to rethink how they motivate their star performers. For some time banks have relied on super-sized bonuses to attract and retain star performers. Some of the alternatives to large bonuses will include longer-term incentives which are linked to performance of the institution over five or 10 years. It might include soft incentives such as better working hours, more supportive work environments, more opportunities for self-actualisation and more interesting design of jobs. This could lead to workplaces where bankers are no longer willing to put up with 364 days of stressful work and one good day when bonuses are paid. This will mean banking is likely to be a more attractive job for a wider range of people. The cap on bonuses will also mean that banks need to rethink their business models. Until now banks have relied on a few stars in small units of investment banking to make significant chunks of the bank\u2019s profit. Now banks will need to think about ways of harnessing the talent of the vast majority of their employees who don't receive giant bonuses. This could see the large banks returning to older style banking. But, he writes, the cap could drive bankers into more lucrative posts at hedge funds or private equity firms. Spain will miss its target for deficit reduction this year, but not by too much. The public deficit has come down to 6.74% in 2012, from 8.9% in 2011. That misses the target of 6.3% agreed with Europe, but should be enough to appease the markets. The European Commission is said to be happy with Spain's performance and is expected to give the country another extension on shrinking the deficit to below 3%. At present, that target is set (somewhat ambitiously) for next year. Spain's treasury minister Cristobal Montoro said there was no need for new budget cutting measures, and that strict rules on autonomous regions' spending are working. Just to confirm the EU bonus cap has been written specifically for the financial industry, so it will apply to bankers' and their ilk, not other industries. Thanks to laasan for the question in the comments below. Why do they do it? Surely by now politicians are so afraid of the damaging headlines, they should know not to be photographed in bizarre poses. But apparently not. The Evening Standard is running a picture of embattled chancellor George Osborne skipping... even as he grapples with the loss of the UK's triple-A rating, a rising deficit, and an economy struggling to show any kind of growth. Post your captions in the comments below. Here's Pete Hahn of Cass Business School, on the bonus cap. Much of banking and economics are cyclical and the basis of bonuses was to address cyclicality. Certainly, bonus payments lost that purpose and need to be reoriented. Yet, the current proposal appears aimed at ludicrously legislating the economic cycle and creating ever higher fixed salaries and perks for those leading the largest banks. Those worried about Europe's growth might think about how high fixed pay packages with limited upside might influence senior bankers to increase risk taking or not. There's more reaction coming through on the EU cap on bonuses agreed overnight (see 7.23am). Unsurprisingly, there are dissenting voices in the City. Mark Boleat, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said: This bonus cap risks placing the EU at a competitive disadvantage to other international financial centres in Asia and the US. The devil will be in the detail but removing flexibility from pay arrangements in this highly cyclical industry would seem counterintuitive - especially if it leads to higher fixed salaries. In recent years, much work has been undertaken to tie remuneration and incentives more closely to sustainable, long-term performance. This has included introducing a right of claw-back, payment in shares with only a limited cash element and deferred payment, and greater transparency over the packages paid to the highest earners in a business. This is already changing the culture across the industry to ensure pay reflects performance. The MEP who negotiated the deal for the European Parliament, Othmar Karas, this morning tried to downplay the impact of the cap in Germany. But, as AP's Brussels correspondent notes, any effect felt there will be multiplied in London. Back to Italy, where the president Giorgio Napolitano said he sees no risk of wider European contagion from the Italian political situation. Reuters reports him saying there is a difficult path ahead but that he is convinced Italy's future is in Europe. He says he is confident that Italy will continue to take its responsibilities and accept sacrifices needed to continue the European project. The Italian people have made a democratic choice that must be respected, he says. The constitution does not allow the process of forming a new government to be accelerated. Eurozone inflation eased in January to 2%, paving the way for a possible rate cut from the European Central Bank. Eurostat said the annual inflation rate came down from 2.2% in December. That brings the 12-month average to 1.9%, just below the ECB's inflation target, which could let the central bank cut rates in a bid to boost activity. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: The ECB currently seems reluctant to take interest rates lower than the current record low level of 0.75%, but the bank could be forced into reconsidering its position if the eurozone fails to show clear signs of economic improvement over the coming weeks or if the euro strengthens anew to reach new highs. Downside risks to the eurozone outlook could mount if protracted political uncertainty in Italy leads to a renewed intensification of sovereign debt tensions. Reports are emerging that Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 who won a sizable portion of the vote at the Italian elections \u2013 is being probed in Naples for suspected corruption and illegal party funding. Italian news agency ANSA said the case regards money allegedly paid to Senator Sergio De Gregorio \u2013 who defected from the centre left to join Berlusconi's party some years ago \u2013 citing judicial sources. The news prompted little surprise on Twitter at least. Over in Ireland, EC president Jose Manuel Barroso is sounding upbeat. Speaking to a business conference, he said there are signs that confidence is returning to Europe, but the situation is still \"fragile\". The banking debt crisis exposed the uneven performance of competitiveness across Europe and the region must now implement reforms for businesses to get the most out of the single market, he said. And, for his Irish audience, he praised the country's progress under the bailout programme. He was appearing alongside Irish prime minister Enda Kenny, who said the country has to deal with the 'issue of high unemployment'. Figures out yesterday showed Irish unemployment falling, but still high at 14.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. Kenny also had warm words about European politics. It's no wonder Monti agreed to keep his commitment at the European Commissions Competition forum. He clearly wanted a bit of love after Sunday's humiliating defeat. Mario Monti, outgoing PM, concludes with the following... The message I would like to leave with you, in 2013 Italy will have a close to zero structural deficit. There is an accompanying strategy at the EU level that needs to be pursued, unless we passively allow that simplistic, some would say populistic (I do not pass judgment on the Italian elections) tendency to have the EU policies derailed. He gets rapturous applause and a standing ovation. But it's got to be said it was a very dry speech. Against the likes of Beppe Grillo, it's no great surprise he didn't get the votes at home. If you do the right policies and don't get the recognition (ie rates don't come down), there is a political backlash, says Monti. Monti says there are delays between when a good reform is brought in and when the benefits are felt. The benefits in terms of growth tend to take more time than the benefits to the financial markets. Back to outgoing Italian prime minister Mario Monti, who is speaking in Brussels. He is defending his record, saying the market situation in 2011 left no choice but to cut the budget and push through reforms, despite low growth. We'll keep one eye on that. Meanwhile, German unemployment fell in February, although slightly less than forecast (in seasonally adjusted terms). The number of people out of a job dropped by 3,000 to 2.9m in February, while economists were expecting it to fall by 5,000. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.9% (after January's rate was revised up to 6.9%). The closely watched jobless total (which is not adjusted) remained above the 3m mark. So far, the focus is very much on competition and it does not look like he will be taking questions. Italy has felt the benefits of competition with new high-speed rail links, says Mario Monti (who is still being billed as Italy's prime minister, despite being the clear loser in Sunday's elections). Over to Brussels, where Mario Monti is giving the keynote speech at a Competition Conference. You can watch it live here, he's speaking in English. Over to the stock markets, which are looking up on the hope that central banks will step in again to support the economy, although Italy is lagging behind amid the political uncertainty. UK FTSE 100: up 0.4%, or 27 points, at 6353 Germany Dax: up 0.8% France CAC 40: up 0.6% Spain IBEX: up 0.8% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.1% Sticking with Spain, one of the country's nationalised banks today posted a loss of \u20ac19bn, by far the largest loss ever reported in Spanish corporate history. The bank has undertaken a major operation cleaning its balance sheet of soured property loans and other loss-making activities over the past year. Investors were expecting a big number after Bankia warned of huge losses when it was bailed out late last year. The Bankia chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri said in a statement that the bank's priority is... To make Bankia a profitable institution in order to return to the community the support it has given us. There is some miserable data out of Spain this morning, which saw its GDP figures revised down to -0.8% for the final quarter of last year, from an initial estimate of -0.7% That means the Spanish economy shrank by 1.9% over the year. That is the sixth straight quarter that Spain's economy contracted and the downturn appears to be speeding up, with GDP dropping at its fastest quarterly pace since mid-2009. Still nothing has been settled in Italy after Beppe Grillo \u2013 the ex-comedian whose Five Star Movement broke through in spectacular style at the elections \u2013 ruled out backing a government led by the centre left. Though European markets are settling down after the inconclusive election results, there is still plenty of nervousness out there. And eurozone policymakers are falling over themselves to point out they never said the crisis was over. German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble said that Italy's inconclusive weekend election had raised the risk of market turmoil spreading to other euro countries and urged Italian politicians to form a stable government quickly. He told Reuters: The election result in Italy has sparked doubts in the market that a stable government can be formed. When such doubts arise there is a danger of contagion. We saw this last year when elections in Greece led to political uncertainty. Other countries are then infected. I never said the euro crisis was over. I only said that we have made significant progress. We need to continue on this path, but we will have setbacks. Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Re-Define think tank, meanwhile says it is economically sound and morally right. He writes: This will help tackle the culture of excessive risk-taking and the bending of rules that has now become endemic to banking. Undertaking this at an EU-wide level will also limit any large-scale migration of the so-called \u2018talent\u2019. It will reduce the risks borne by tax-payers and go a long way to rehabilitate the industry, making it focus on serving the real economy again. But there are concerns the move will be counterproductive. This from the chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit... Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. Overnight, EU leaders agreed to introduce what will amount to the world's strictest curbs on bankers' bonuses, railroading opposition from the UK Treasury. The basic agreement will cap bankers' bonuses at a year's salary. While it still needs approval from EU governments, the main points could become law as early as next year. And the UK cannot veto it. This will rock the City of London, where bonuses can sometimes be as much as 12 times a bankers' salary. My colleague Ian Traynor reports from Brussels: The UK financial sector was dealt a withering blow on Wednesday night when the European Union agreed on moves to slash the bonuses that may be paid to bankers, defeating strong Treasury opposition to the new rules. A meeting of officials from the 27 countries of the EU with MEPs and the European commission agreed to cap bankers' bonuses broadly at a year's salary, with the proviso that the bonus could be doubled subject to majority shareholder approval. The agreement has still to be approved by EU governments before coming into force next year. While details may still be tweaked, it is expected that the main points will become EU law. Britain, strongly opposed to the new legislation, will not be able to veto it as it will be carried by a qualified majority vote of the EU member states. The deal will be another blow for Chancellor George Osborne who strongly opposed the deal. The FT reports: Tensions were so high that George Osborne, at one point snapped and said defending the package would make him \"look like an idiot\".",

For some time banks have relied on super-sized bonuses to attract and retain star performers.</p> <p>Some of the alternatives to large bonuses will include longer-term incentives which are linked to performance of the institution over five or 10 years. It might include soft incentives such as better working hours, more supportive work environments, more opportunities for self-actualisation and more interesting design of jobs. This could lead to workplaces where bankers are no longer willing to put up with 364 days of stressful work and one good day when bonuses are paid. This will mean banking is likely to be a more attractive job for a wider range of people.</p> <p>The cap on bonuses will also mean that banks need to rethink their business models. Until now banks have relied on a few stars in small units of investment banking to make significant chunks of the bank\u2019s profit. Now banks will need to think about ways of harnessing the talent of the vast majority of their employees who don't receive giant bonuses.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK financial sector was dealt a withering blow on Wednesday night when the European Union agreed on moves to slash the bonuses that may be paid to bankers, defeating strong Treasury opposition to the new rules. A meeting of officials from the 27 countries of the EU with MEPs and the European commission agreed to cap bankers' bonuses broadly at a year's salary, with the proviso that the bonus could be doubled subject to majority shareholder approval. The decision to limit the annual bonuses that may be paid to bank employees came despite stiff British resistance to the move and is certain to have a strong impact on the \"fat cat\" culture of the City of London, the EU's financial centre. \"For the first time in the history of EU financial market regulation, we will cap bankers' bonuses,\" said Othmar Karas, an Austrian MEP involved in the negotiations between the parliament and the governments. The decision to act on bonuses came as part of a broader initiative on bank regulation known as the Capital Requirements Directive aimed at forcing Europe's financial sector to insure itself against the kind of weaknesses of the past five years that triggered an international emergency and frequently left taxpayers footing the bills for bank failures. The agreement has still to be approved by EU governments before coming into force next year. While details may still be tweaked, it is expected that the main points will become EU law. Britain, strongly opposed to the new legislation, will not be able to veto it as it will be carried by a qualified majority vote of the EU member states. The highly complex piece of legislation has been four years in gestation, aimed at setting new equity and liquidity standards for the banks to spare taxpayers the burden of having to shell out for reckless behaviour leading to collapse. The new rules for the first standardise behaviour for all of Europe's banks, parallel to ongoing efforts to establish a new eurozone banking supervisor, with authority vested in Frankfurt at the European Central Bank. \"This overhaul of EU banking rules will make sure that banks in the future have enough capital, both in terms of quality and quantity, to withstand shocks. This will ensure that taxpayers across Europe are protected into the future,\" said Michael Noonan, the finance minister of Ireland which currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Britain sought to block the new rules, not so much because it wanted to dilute the curbs on bankers' bonuses, but because it wanted to retain the power to make its own decisions and not be subject to a regime set in Brussels. The agreement had to win the endorsement of the European Parliament which still has to vote on the package, but is likely to endorse it. MEPs pushed the bonus caps in particular. \"European banks will have to set aside more money to be more stable and concentrate on their core business, namely financing the real economy, that of small and medium-sized enterprises and jobs,\" said Karas, the Austrian MEP who led the negotiations for the parliament.",

      "bodyText": "High street store closures increased tenfold last year as the woes of Clinton Cards and Game took their toll, a survey has shown. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Local Data Company showed the net number of store closures was 1,779 in 2012 \u2013 up from 174 in 2011. It added that the number of stores closed by retail chains could double this year from 14 stores a day in 2011 to 28 a day in 2013, after HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops collapsed. The report found that payday loan stores and pound shops are the fastest-growing retailers on the high street, with card shops, computer game and health food stores the most depleted. Payday loan firms increased their high street presence by 20%, pawnbrokers were up 13%, and nearly two pound shops were opened every week across the country. Mike Jervis, insolvency partner and retail specialist at PwC, said: \"2012 saw more retail chains go into insolvency than ever before. The failed chains generally shared two problems \u2013 too many stores and too little multichannel activity.\" Card shops suffered a net fall of 188 stores, a 23% drop, mainly due to Clinton Cards going bust last year, while the failure of Game contributed to a 45% fall in high street computer game stores. The survey, which measured data from 500 towns and cities, also found that the number of store closures outstripped the number of store openings in every region of the country.",
