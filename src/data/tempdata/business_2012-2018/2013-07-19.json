      "bodyText": "Tax structures used by Amazon to route billions of pounds from sales to British customers through Luxembourg, paying negligible UK tax, are among a series of international loopholes earmarked for closure in a programme of reforms backed by G20 nations. The \"once-in-a-century\" move to patch up holes in international tax rules was unveiled in Moscow by George Osborne and fellow finance ministers from France and Germany, who have together been the driving force behind calls for reform. France's Pierre Moscovici said the 15-point action plan, which has been produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development club of industrialised nations, was a \"major breakthrough\" and was \"at the heart of the social contract\". \"It is clear multinational companies have developed an unprecedented know-how for minimising their worldwide tax pressure,\" he said. \"These situations are literally impossible to explain to our fellow citizens.\" Osborne agreed: \"People and companies have to pay the taxes that are due, it's the only way to operate in a fair and competitive society \u2026 Our message is clear: everyone must pay their fair share of tax.\" Under current rules, Amazon's \u00a34.2bn annual sales in the UK, which rely on a network of eight mega-warehouses across Britain, are routed through Luxembourg. Revenue &amp; Customs has no taxing rights over any profits from those sales. Under the proposals, multinationals with warehouses will be taxed in the country where the distribution centres are located. Friday's OECD plan, which will lead to firm recommendations within 12 to 30 months, has support of the increasingly influential economies of Brazil, China and India as well as the likes of Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland \u2014 all of whom have been accused of beggar-thy-neighbour tax policies. But even as the European trio of finance ministers congratulated one another on the unprecedented show of G20 unity, behind the scenes there were growing concerns that national self-interest could scupper some elements of the plan. Notably absent from the launch event was the US treasury secretary, Jack Lew. Sources with knowledge of the extensive negotiations said the US was growing increasingly frustrated with sniping from European politicians targeted at some of the most successful US multinationals including Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Lew used an article in the Financial Times to call on Europe and other economies to knuckle down and focus on fostering growth rather than squabbling over taxing rights. \"When [finance ministers] \u2026 gather in Moscow, getting people back to work must be top of the agenda,\" he said. \"In many parts of the world, such as Europe, growth is too weak to drive job creation, and it is critical to take steps to bolster private hiring.\" His remarks appear to echo recent warnings from big business lobby groups such as the United States Council for International Business and the Confederation of British Industry suggesting the scale of multinational tax avoidance had been exaggerated and draconian measures to stamp it out risked damaging job creation. While the US accepts there is merit to updating OECD tax treaty rules, senior figures in Washington are quietly seething at the behaviour of French tax authorities, who have aggressively challenged the tax claims of digital businesses such as Google, Microsoft and LinkedIn, raiding their Paris offices in recent years. Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that American negotiators had in effect blocked more radical French ambitions for new tax rules targeted at digital multinationals. Instead, a fresh OECD taskforce is to be set up and given a year to study business models in this industry and how profits should best be apportioned between countries. Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy, said: \"We know the Europeans are very concerned about the digital economy \u2013 we have that [concern] in all non-US economies \u2026 We all know about the problem of Google not paying tax. It is much more difficult to identify the different business models [and how to tax them].\" Also understood to be a focus of frustration for US negotiators are mixed messages from Osborne and David Cameron on the UK's approach to multinational tax. On the one hand, the prime minister has sought to make political capital attacking \"companies [that] navigate their way around legitimate tax systems, and even low tax rates, with an army of clever accountants\". On the other hand, the coalition government has been aggressively courting foreign multinationals by slashing the rate of corporation tax from 24% to an eventual 20%. From January, Britain has also introduced new rules attractive to multinationals with offshore financial subsidiaries of the kind controversially used by Vodafone to gain a tax advantage. Most recently, the introduction of a so-called \"patent box\" tax break for research and development companies choosing to base themselves in Britain has also caused friction at an international level. Such tax breaks are to come under scrutiny in the G20 reform programme. The Italian lorry and tractor maker Fiat Industrial has recently announced plans to relocate to Britain, attracted by the favourable tax regime. Last year, the insurance group Aon, best known as shirt sponsors of Manchester United, moved its headquarters to London. Tax experts say there is now a queue of major multinationals exploring similar moves. \"I know of more than 40 multinational companies that have been looking to undertake global and regional headquarter relocations into Britain,\" Steve Varley, the UK chairman of Ernst &amp; Young, said in May. OECD officials are alive to the risk of the reform agenda being paralysed by in-fighting. Officials have warned: \"Inaction in this area \u2026 could lead to global tax chaos marked by the massive reemergence of double taxation.\" Among those hoping the programme is not derailed are non-international companies in the UK and elsewhere, which have become increasingly vocal in their attacks on the unfair tax advantages afforded to multinationals such as Amazon. Some of Britain's largest high-street chains \u2013 including Sainsbury's, John Lewis, Dixons and Mothercare \u2013 have all called for a crackdown on Amazon's tax arrangements.",

The system has been pushed to breaking point by new ways of structuring cross-border business \u2013 some due to advances in technology, but many others the product of what the OECD describes as \"the increasing sophistication of tax planners in identifying and exploiting the legal artbitrage opportunities and the boundaries of acceptable tax planning\".

The UK's new so-called \"patent box\" tax break for intellectual property companies will come under scrutiny. \u2022 A raft of treaty updates to neutralise the tax advantages of complex financial instruments, schemes and structures, including hybrid capital, interest payment deductions and over-capitalisation. \u2022 A requirement on multinationals to disclose the most aggressive \"tax planning\" structures to the authorities otherwise often relying on limited, local data that does not show the impact of transnational schemes to lower tax. \u2022 New ways to rapidly introduce the OECD recommendations around the world.

These groups argue that the current system is so open to abuse it should be replaced with a new model \u2013 known as unitary taxation \u2013 which they claim would better link the apportionment of taxable profits by multinationals to the territories in which economic activities occur. The OECD claimed there was international consensus at the G20 against such a radical approach.

These groups argue that the current system is so open to abuse it should be replaced with a new model \u2013 known as unitary taxation \u2013 which they claim would better link the apportionment of taxable profits by multinationals to the territories in which economic activities occur. The OECD claimed there was international consensus at the G20 against such a radical approach. Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy, said he was \"agnostic\" but that member nations regarded such proposals as \"unfeasible\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's China, what did you expect? Its healthcare system is a pit of corruption, the result of underfunding by a government that prefers skyscrapers to hospitals. That seems to be the City's relaxed view of the bribery allegations made against GlaxoSmithKline's Chinese operation. Analysts coolly conclude that a country accounting for 3% of group sales can't inflict any serious damage. The share price has barely budged since the storm broke. The City's view is too breezy for at least three reasons. First, reputation matters to drug companies these days \u2013 and matters in particular to chief executive Sir Andrew Witty. He has been on a clean-up campaign during his five years in charge. Last year, when GSK paid a $3bn fine for mis-selling drugs in the US, Witty said he was dealing with \"echoes of the past\" and announced his determination that such events would never happen again. Nobody should doubt his sincerity but the Chinese allegations, if they are proved, would represent a serious failure of management. As far one can tell, GSK put in audit controls that it thought were sufficient for China; it may have been bamboozled by a sophisticated internal scam that was hard to spot without access to private bank accounts and emails. But that would be an explanation of failure, and won't help GSK on the image front. Witty the unwitting is poor branding when you are dealing with governments around the world. Second, GSK will probably have to rethink its entire model of doing business in China and other \"high risk\" countries. That signals disruption ahead as internal compliance controls are overhauled yet again. Third, even after any fines are paid in China, GSK will have to arrive at a working arrangement with a central government that appears to have a twofold agenda of running an anti-corruption drive and getting more funding into its dysfunctional healthcare system. If you're an optimist, greater opportunity for GSK could emerge from the mess \u2013 profit margins of drugs might fall but the reward could be greater volumes and a better-regulated market. But, to judge by the current aggressive rhetoric in China, the road to that position could be very long indeed. The story is still developing, but the City looks to be underplaying it. \u2022 The most useful service Lord Davies could perform in his interim report on London runways, which is due at the end of this year (the final report comes after the 2015 election), is to give a view on whether the UK actually needs a single \"hub\" airport. If this vexed question could be settled, the fog around the great airport debate might start to clear. The \"hub\" notion is presented by the owners of Heathrow as their trump card. The theory says the best way to secure flights to far-flung cities \u2013 the places that are supposed to be critical to our prospects as a trading nation \u2013 is to make lots of passengers gather under one roof. More planes to Bangalore and Beijing become viable when potential passengers include both locals and transit passengers from many countries, goes the theory. This logic is endorsed by supporters of the Boris Island and Isle of Grain plans \u2013 they want to close Heathrow and build a new hub in the east. So, if a hub really is vital to the UK, the choice of poison becomes clearer. We can opt for the gruesome prospect of more planes over London by expanding Heathrow; or we suffer the delay and \u00a330bn-plus cost of building in Kent and bet that the multinationals gathered in the M4 corridor will stay in the UK; or perhaps we turn Stansted into a new hub. But is the hub theory rubbish? Yes, say Gatwick's owners, who argue that BAA, when it had a monopoly on London's main airports, was fixated on Heathrow. Plenty of big cities, like New York, get along with several airports. The suspicion here is that Gatwick makes a fair point. Airbus and Boeing are building planes designed to go point-to-point and Heathrow still looks to be stuffed with short-haul tourist flights that don't need to be there. Lord Davies can't deal in suspicions, of course. His commission's job is to produce a detailed economic case, weigh probabilities and gaze into the future of air transport. But the hub is the heart of the debate. If the advantages of a single mega-airport are overblown, the Heathrow gorilla can be faced down and the Kentish spectaculars put on file for a few more decades. Gatwick or Stansted \u2013 the least disruptive places to add a runway in the south-east \u2013 would then be the logical places to look. \u2022 A moment in history? Well, it's not every day that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says co-ordinated action is needed to avert \"global tax chaos\". For good measure, the organisation's top tax official said that \"the golden age of 'we don't pay taxes anywhere' is over\" for multinationals with over-complicated, tax-minimising corporate structures. So, look out, Amazon and Google. We should applaud the OECD and G20, which commissioned the study, for getting this far. Current international tax regimes are clearly ill-suited for the age of the internet, globalisation and intellectual capital. Multinationals have exploited last century's rules ruthlessly. Reform is overdue. A word of caution, though. Before we can welcome an era of peace, love and international tax co-operation, there's an awful lot of politics to be played out. All that has been agreed so far is a set of principles. When hard rules start to be thrashed out potential winners and losers will emerge and the already-visible cracks between nations are likely to widen. The UK, Germany and France have driven the debate this far. How many compromises will the US be prepared to make? Its politicians are less than impressed by the UK's tolerance of tax havens; as for Germany, it thinks the UK's \"patent box,\" one of the coalition government's proudest boasts, is an underhanded tactic; the list goes on. There is potential for the OECD's study to trigger a very big deal indeed \u2013 but, for now, it is just potential. Bonus pay Off the rails If Tim O'Toole, chief executive of FirstGroup, expected applause for turning down a \u00a3592,000 bonus, he was wrong. Some 30% of votes were cast against the bus and rail firm's remuneration report this week. The rebels were right not be deflected. FirstGroup's shares have collapsed in value, the dividend has been axed and the company has just whacked its investors with a three-for-two rights issue to raise \u00a3615m. It doesn't matter that the bonus was waived \u2013 it should not have been awarded in the first place. Prof David Begg, chair of the pay committee, is the man responsible. He needs to know that bonuses are discretionary. You don't have to obey the bonus calculator when it produces weird results; you are allowed to use common sense. The professor escaped with a 10% vote against his re-election and should count himself fortunate.",

A series of books on BP have blamed Browne for concentrating on acquisitions and cost-cutting rather than the nuts and bolts of the business, leading, some have said, to Texas City and eventually to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout, in which 11 people died. Browne has always vehemently denied the charge, pointing out in a Newsweek article that the number of engineers employed by the company rose under his command. His friends agree: \"It's a bit much to blame John for something that happened three years after he left. The fact is that most senior business people still regard him very, very highly.\" To judge by his position as the most senior business figure in government, David Cameron does, too.",

      "bodyText": "Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, the FTSE 100 miner being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over claims of fraud, bribery and corruption in Africa, is suing Sir Paul Judge, a City grandee and former director, for allegedly leaking information to the media. The Kazakhstan-focused firm, which is subject to a \u00a33bn takeover by its three oligarch founders, accuses Judge of \"malicious leaks\" that have damaged the company's reputation and stock market value. ENRC demanded that Judge, who quit the company alongside former chairman Mehmet Dalman earlier this year, immediately returns all confidential documents. The company is also seeking millions of pounds in damages. Gerhard Ammann, ENRC's new chairman, said: \"We have conducted thorough investigations into the malicious leaks that have damaged the company, its reputation and ultimately shareholder value. \"While these investigations continue, the company has an obligation to bring legal action where appropriate in order to protect the company's information and stakeholders' interests.\" A lawyer representing Judge, who had served on ENRC's board for six years, did not respond to requests for comment. Details of the high court lawsuit will not be made public for 14 days, but it is understood to allege that Judge is the source of leaked documents allegedly proving ENRC made \"cash payments to African presidents\". Judge, an ex-director general of Conservative Central Office and a former senior figure at Cadbury Schweppes, has been served with a so-called Section 2 notice by the SFO requiring him to hand over documents and help with its criminal investigation into ENRC. The SFO is investigating \"allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa\". The SFO has also served a Section 2 notice on Dechert, a law firm that was investigating whistleblower claims on behalf of ENRC. Dechert was fired by ENRC just two weeks before its report was due to be handed over to the SFO. In an eight-page letter sent to ENRC following its sacking Dechert claimed to have found \"documentary evidence regarding the making of cash payments to African presidents\" in connection with the purchase of a copper smelter in Zambia. While looking into the acquisition of a copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dechert said it also found \"evidence that documents had been falsified, the CFO of ENRC had been misled, and that $35m [\u00a322.6m] had been misappropriated\".

      "bodyText": "Speculation about the identity of the next deputy governor of the Bank of England was mounting on Friday after it emerged that two of the leading possible candidates had not applied. The vacancy for one of the Bank's three deputies was created when Paul Tucker resigned after losing out on the top job to Canada's former central banker, Mark Carney. The \u00a3260,000-a-year role was advertised last month and two top Treasury officials \u2013 Tom Scholar and John Kingman \u2013 had been regarded as suited to the position, which has become available during what is expected to be a period of dramatic change under Carney. However, the Financial Times reported that both Scholar and Kingman were part of the panel assessing the applications for the job, alongside the permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, ruling them out from consideration. They are expected to interview candidates including Morgan Stanley analyst Huw van Steenis and Treasury official Charles Roxburgh next week. Internal candidates from the Bank of England were reported to be Andy Haldane, a senior official in charge of financial stability, and Paul Fisher, an executive director of markets. Applicants not called for interview were informed in the last few days and include Peter Hahn, a fellow at Cass Business School, and Thomas Huertas, a former official at the Financial Services Authority who now works at consultants Ernst &amp; Young. When the position was advertised it was described as a \"high-profile and influential role at a time of significant change \u2013 both within the bank and throughout global and domestic financial markets\". Carney, who was the surprise choice to replace Sir Mervyn King when King retired at the end of last month, is expected to be consulted on the candidates for deputy governor, who will have particular responsibility for financial stability and the 600 staff. Technically, the Queen makes the appointment. The other deputy governors are Andrew Bailey, who oversees banking regulation at the Prudential Regulation Authority, and Charlie Bean, who oversees monetary policy and whose role will be advertised next year when he steps down. While the governor's role was also advertised, Carney was not part of the original process and eventually was appointed on a five-year term, rather than the eight years that had been advertised.",

    "webTitle": "FTSE 100 fades at end of positive week, with Arm lower after poor US technology updates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A week when the US market reached new peaks ended on a more cautious note after disappointing results from a number of major technology companies. Markets have been buoyant in recent days as the US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke suggested to Congress that any slowdown in its $85bn a month bond buying programme was not likely in the immediate future and would depend on the state of the world's largest economy. On top of that came positive results from healthcare groups and banks including Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. But then Intel, Microsoft and Google all produced results below expectations, which took some of the shine off the week. Microsoft fell around 10% in early trading on Friday and Google nearly 4%, while the poor figures put UK technology companies under pressure, with Arm losing 23.5p to 897.5p ahead of the chipmaker's results next week. Overall the FTSE 100 finished the day at 6630.67, down 3.69 points but up 86 points on the week. Investors shrugged off the continuing problems in the eurozone, with political uncertainty in Portugal and Spain, and continuing protests in Greece against the cutbacks agreed as part of the country's bailout agreement. Mining shares had been supported for much of the week by Chinese data which showed GDP growth of 7.5% in the second quarter, in line with forecasts, and by a number of positive production updates. But on Friday profit takers moved in, leaving Rio Tinto 31p lower at 2917.5p and BHP Billiton down 11.5p at 1869.5p. Among the day's risers IMI added 28p to \u00a314 as Citigroup named the engineer as one of its most preferred stocks. It said: We see further significant margin upside at IMI, driven by both mix and restructuring. A strong balance sheet and yield are both supportive, too. National Grid climbed 10p to 774.5p as New York State - where the company has operations - forecast a surge in electricity usage as air conditioners were switched on during the current heatwave. But Standard Life slipped 5.4p to 385p after rival Aviva, up 0.3p at 372.3p, poached one of its senior executives. Euan Munro is joining as chief executive of Aviva Investors, which has \u00a3274bn assets under management, and leaving his position in the investments division of Standard Life. Aviva was also helped by a positive recommendation from Morgan Stanley: Aviva is in the earlier stages of its balance sheet repair process. We believe that as it works to improve the fungibility of cash back to the centre in the medium-term the dividend can grow faster than earnings \u2013 driving a re-rating. Among the mid-caps, software group Micro Focus International fell 8p to 759p after disappointing results from SAP. Analyst Roger Phillips at Sanlam Securities said: The problem area remains Asia-Pacific, where revenues declined by 15% in headline terms. The main exposure within our coverage universe to Asia (Japan specifically) is Micro Focus (sell, target price:600p) with around 15% of group revenues from this region, due to the group being the number two player in the Cobol industry against Fujitsu. SAP and Micro Focus are both \"horizontal\" enterprise software players addressing multiple vertical markets and so we see some degree of read across. Micro Focus commented that Japan had been challenging at its full year results in June, and the year on year comparative for the first half of 2014 is extremely tough due to a one-off licence fee of $4m that buoyed up the first half of 2013. As a result, we see this as a weak spot that could get weaker for Micro Focus. Defence group Chemring closed 22.9p lower at 298.2p after UBS moved from buy to neutral and cut its price target from 360p to 330p. Analyst Charles Armitage said: We believe the implementation of the restructuring plan by the new management team is likely to drive an improvement in Chemring's profitability and cash flow, despite the headwinds from tough defence markets.

      "body": "<p>A week when the US market reached new peaks ended on a more cautious note after disappointing results from a number of major technology companies.</p> <p>Markets have been buoyant in recent days as the US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke suggested to Congress that any slowdown in its $85bn a month bond buying programme was not likely in the immediate future and would depend on the state of the world's largest economy. On top of that came positive results from healthcare groups and banks including Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>But then Intel, Microsoft and Google all produced results below expectations, which took some of the shine off the week. Microsoft fell around 10% in early trading on Friday and Google nearly 4%, while the poor figures put UK technology companies under pressure, with <strong>Arm</strong> losing 23.5p to 897.5p ahead of the chipmaker's results next week.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished the day at 6630.67, down 3.69 points but up 86 points on the week. Investors shrugged off the continuing problems in the eurozone, with political uncertainty in Portugal and Spain, and continuing protests in Greece against the cutbacks agreed as part of the country's bailout agreement.</p> <p>Mining shares had been supported for much of the week by Chinese data which showed GDP growth of 7.5% in the second quarter, in line with forecasts, and by a number of positive production updates. But on Friday profit takers moved in, leaving <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> 31p lower at 2917.5p and <strong>BHP Billiton </strong>down 11.5p at 1869.5p.</p> <p>Among the day's risers <strong>IMI</strong> added 28p to \u00a314 as Citigroup named the engineer as one of its most preferred stocks. It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We see further significant margin upside at IMI, driven by both mix and restructuring. A strong balance sheet and yield are both supportive, too.<strong> </strong></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>National Grid</strong> climbed 10p to 774.5p as New York State - where the company has operations - forecast a surge in electricity usage as air conditioners were switched on during the current heatwave.</p> <p>But <strong>Standard Life</strong> slipped 5.4p to 385p after rival <strong>Aviva</strong>, up 0.3p at 372.3p, poached one of its senior executives.</p> <p>Euan Munro is joining as <a href=\"http://www.aviva.com/media/news/item/aviva-appoints-euan-munro-as-ceo-of-aviva-investors-17176/\" title=\"\">chief executive of Aviva Investors,</a> which has \u00a3274bn assets under management, and leaving his position in the investments division of Standard Life. Aviva was also helped by a positive recommendation from Morgan Stanley:</p> <blockquote> <p>Aviva is in the earlier stages of its balance sheet repair process. We believe that as it works to improve the fungibility of cash back to the centre in the medium-term the dividend can grow faster than earnings \u2013 driving a re-rating.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, software group <strong>Micro Focus International </strong>fell 8p to 759p after disappointing results from SAP. Analyst Roger Phillips at Sanlam Securities said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The problem area remains Asia-Pacific, where revenues declined by 15% in headline terms. The main exposure within our coverage universe to Asia (Japan specifically) is Micro Focus (sell, target price:600p) with around 15% of group revenues from this region, due to the group being the number two player in the Cobol industry against Fujitsu. SAP and Micro Focus are both \"horizontal\" enterprise software players addressing multiple vertical markets and so we see some degree of read across. Micro Focus commented that Japan had been challenging at its full year results in June, and the year on year comparative for the first half of 2014 is extremely tough due to a one-off licence fee of $4m that buoyed up the first half of 2013. As a result, we see this as a weak spot that could get weaker for Micro Focus.</p> </blockquote> <p>Defence group <strong>Chemring</strong> closed 22.9p lower at 298.2p after UBS moved from buy to neutral and cut its price target from 360p to 330p. Analyst Charles Armitage said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We believe the implementation of the restructuring plan by the new management team is likely to drive an improvement in Chemring's profitability and cash flow, despite the headwinds from tough defence markets. We estimate there is further upside of around \u00a35m-\u00a310m to earnings, above the targeted \u00a310m cost savings, from an improvement in execution across the businesses. </p> <p>We are concerned about the continued uncertainty on the short term outlook for US defence budgets as sequestration has not been fully implemented. This presents a challenge to management efforts to restructure Chemring in the short term because of the short cycle nature of many of Chemring's businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Sirius Minerals</strong> had a bad week, with its shares subsiding 4p to 18.5p on Friday to make a 33% fall since Monday.

We\u2019re not talking about some minor setback along the way, but something more fundamental. The country\u2019s whole way of doing business, the economic system that has driven three decades of incredible growth, has reached its limits. You could say that the Chinese model is about to hit its Great Wall, and the only question now is just how bad the crash will be.</p> </blockquote> <p>The big problem is that China is running out of surplus peasants, he writes, the workers who have flooded into urban factories to man production lines. That surplus labour, which kept wages pinned to the floor, is now running out.</p> <blockquote> <p>That should be a good thing. Wages are rising; finally, ordinary Chinese are starting to share in the fruits of growth. But it also means that the Chinese economy is suddenly faced with the need for drastic \u201crebalancing\u201d \u2014 the jargon phrase of the moment. Investment is now running into sharply diminishing returns and is going to drop drastically no matter what the government does; consumer spending must rise dramatically to take its place. The question is whether this can happen fast enough to avoid a nasty slump.</p> <p>And the answer, increasingly, seems to be no.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not everyone agrees; this debate looks set to run.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key point Krugman misses: China isn't so much hitting a wall as bringing itself to an emergency stop.

The World Bank and the United States have been pushing China to make a move to market-driven pricing of credit.</p> <p><em>But</em>, the significance may lie more in the symbolism than the substance, according to some experts.</p> <p>Here are some reactions, via <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23377060\">BBC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/china-removes-floor-on-lending-rates-offered-by-nation-s-banks.html\">Bloomberg</a>: </p> <p>Mark Williams, chief Asia economist, Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's a very big deal, probably more in terms of what it symbolises than the effect on the economy. China has been talking about interest rate liberalisation for a long time, this is one of the biggest steps they could have taken. It does not necessarily change very much today, but it tells you something about the trajectory. Only a very small proportion of loans will be affected by this decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flemming Nielsen, senior analyst, Danske Bank:</p> <blockquote> <p>This underlines that China is moving to a fully convertible currency and floating exchange rates. Liberalisation of interest rates is a necessary condition for convertible currency and floating rates and their next step will be to widen the daily trading band for renminbi. They should do that within the next three months.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ken Peng, senior economist at BNP Paribas SA:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most observers would be disappointed to find out that it was only the removal of the lending rate floor...This decision shows that some reform is being done, but may actually reduce the chances for deposit-rate liberalization in the near term. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-19T13:22:38.128Z\">at 2.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51e937c1e4b0b889c5b501a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-19T12:57:37.114Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No deal yet on Portugal's \"national salvation\" austerity coalition.

      "bodyText": "Back in Moscow, the first day of the G20 finance ministers' meeting is winding up and we have had a glimpse of the summit communique, courtesy of Reuters. The word of the day is rebalancing, with predictably warm words about boosting \u201cjobs and growth\u201d Here are the top lines from the draft that Reuters has seen. \u201cWe are determined to continue progress with rebalancing of global demand, which requires internal rebalancing through structural reforms and exchange rate flexibility.\u201d \u201cWe reiterate our commitments to move from more rapidly toward more market-orientated exchange rate systems and to refrain from competitive devaluation.\u201d The text did not specify debt targets, but said fiscal strategies should be \"credible, country-specific and ambitious\". So does this mean Germany will do more to encourage consumer spending? And where will all those jobs come from in austerity-battered southern Europe? We will have more on the site later on the G20 summit, especially that major tax deal. And on that note, I am wrapping up the blog for the day. Thank you all for following and have a good weekend. JR Talking of China... Economist Paul Krugman has written a gloomy, but fascinating blog on China's economic problems. China is in big trouble. We\u2019re not talking about some minor setback along the way, but something more fundamental. The country\u2019s whole way of doing business, the economic system that has driven three decades of incredible growth, has reached its limits. You could say that the Chinese model is about to hit its Great Wall, and the only question now is just how bad the crash will be. The big problem is that China is running out of surplus peasants, he writes, the workers who have flooded into urban factories to man production lines. That surplus labour, which kept wages pinned to the floor, is now running out. That should be a good thing. Wages are rising; finally, ordinary Chinese are starting to share in the fruits of growth. But it also means that the Chinese economy is suddenly faced with the need for drastic \u201crebalancing\u201d \u2014 the jargon phrase of the moment. Investment is now running into sharply diminishing returns and is going to drop drastically no matter what the government does; consumer spending must rise dramatically to take its place. The question is whether this can happen fast enough to avoid a nasty slump. And the answer, increasingly, seems to be no. Not everyone agrees; this debate looks set to run. China has announced a eye-catching banking reform - the People's Bank of China will end controls over the interest rates that smaller banks are allowed to charge their customers. The World Bank and the United States have been pushing China to make a move to market-driven pricing of credit. But, the significance may lie more in the symbolism than the substance, according to some experts. Here are some reactions, via BBC and Bloomberg: Mark Williams, chief Asia economist, Capital Economics: It's a very big deal, probably more in terms of what it symbolises than the effect on the economy. China has been talking about interest rate liberalisation for a long time, this is one of the biggest steps they could have taken. It does not necessarily change very much today, but it tells you something about the trajectory. Only a very small proportion of loans will be affected by this decision. Flemming Nielsen, senior analyst, Danske Bank: This underlines that China is moving to a fully convertible currency and floating exchange rates. Liberalisation of interest rates is a necessary condition for convertible currency and floating rates and their next step will be to widen the daily trading band for renminbi. They should do that within the next three months. Ken Peng, senior economist at BNP Paribas SA: Most observers would be disappointed to find out that it was only the removal of the lending rate floor...This decision shows that some reform is being done, but may actually reduce the chances for deposit-rate liberalization in the near term. No deal yet on Portugal's \"national salvation\" austerity coalition. Journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo says government and opposition remain divided on \u20ac4.4bn cuts. Italy's government has survived that no-confidence vote (see 12.27). Meanwhile, economy minister Fabrizio Saccomanni has hinted the government could sell stakes in state companies to clear the country's debts. Saccomanni told Bloomberg TV: \"I do not exclude the Treasury selling shares in publicly owned companies, including [energy companies] ENEL, Eni and [defence and aerospace group] Finmeccanica, to reduce the debt.\" Via Italian news agency AGI Debt is not just a European story today. Detroit, once known as motor city, has filed for bankruptcy, with debts of at least $18bn (\u00a312bn). The Wall Street Journal writes on the long painful decline of the town that was the equivalent to California's Silicon Valley in the early twentieth century. Michigan's Republican governor Rick Snyder said: This was a difficult and painful decision, but I believe there are no other viable options... This is a situation that's been 60 years in the making in terms of the decline of Detroit. From a financial point of view, let me be blunt: Detroit is broke.\" Helena Smith in Athens dissects German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's visit to Greece yesterday. In Greece Sch\u00e4uble is a hated man; loathed as much for the austerity he has personally prescribed as the manner with which it has been handed out. No one is more identified with the twin ills \u2013 runaway unemployment and rising poverty \u2013 now bedevilling the county than he. To pretend otherwise is to play a fool's game. But on Thursday Sch\u00e4uble pulled off a stellar performance doing just that as he made his first visit to the country since the eruption of Europe's debt crisis in Greece in late 2009. The political opposition may have declared him persona non grata. And riot police may have turned Athens into a garrison town, its roads sealed off in one of the biggest security cordons thrown around the capital in living memory. But responding with a charm attack few would have thought possible for a politician more usually associated with irascibility, in meeting after meeting Sch\u00e4uble pressed home the message that he was \"happy\" to be in Greece \u2013 and even better, delighted with the progress its debt-stricken economy had made. \"This visit is an expression of our confidence in, and support for Greece,\" he enthused. \"I have not come as a teacher to give lessons.\" ..... \"This is nothing but a PR campaign, an attempt to say Greece is a success story and the eurozone crisis is over,\" a senior prime ministerial aide confided. \"And we all know that is not the case because it's only now, in the coming months, that we will even begin to see the results of the measures.\" It is the season for no-confidence votes - yesterday, Portugal; today Italy. Minister Angelino Alfanois is being called on to resign over the deportation of the family of a Kazakh dissident. Investors are turning their gaze to Portugal once again, as the country's political parties scramble to agree a \"salvation\" deal that will keep its international bailout on track. Last night the centre-right coalition government survived a no-confidence vote, but political consensus is fragile. President Anibal Cavaco Silva has called for a \"national salvation pact\" between the parties. At stake are plans to cut spending by \u20ac4.7 billion next year to keep the country on track to meet EU-IMF bailout. Analysts at Citi are not too hopeful. The political situation remains unstable, with early elections in the autumn still a clear possibility if parties do not reach common ground to form a grand coalition. According to Reuters, the yield gap on Portugal's ten-year bonds is close to its lowest point this year, suggesting investors are still worried about the country's credit. The extraordinary scenes on the streets of Madrid last night when thousands of protesters calling for the resignation of Mariano Rajoy clashed with police. As AP reported, the peaceful event turned violent and ended in arrests. Rajoy is denying allegations that he took illegal payments and so far refusing to resign. Lots more on El Pais - hat tip CatalanPaddy Another sign of the pain in southern Europe can be read in Vodafone's latest quarterly results, out this morning. The world's second largest phone company reported steep falls in revenues in Spain and Italy, as consumers cut back on mobile calls and hang onto their old handsets. Revenues for the three months to 30 June were down 10.6% in Spain and 17.6% in Italy. Even in Germany, Vodafone's biggest European market, revenues fell 5.1%, while they dropped 4.5% in the UK. I've taken the numbers from Reuters. Here in the UK, data showed that the government is on course to meet its borrowing targets, even though the deficit for June was slightly worse than expected. This leaves the public sector net debt standing at \u00a31,202.8 billion, 75% of gross domestic product. And that is not counting the cost of bank bailouts... Here is some analysis from ING The public finance numbers for June aren\u2019t quite as good as hoped for with the deficit (public sector net borrowing excluding financial interventions) coming in at \u00a38.0bn versus consensus forecasts of \u00a38.5bn.... The government\u2019s full year (underlying) borrowing forecast of \u00a3120.9bn also looks on track. With economic activity starting to show some positive signs and with employment continuing to grow we would not be surprised to see the full year borrowing figure creeping below this forecast though. More on the G20 crackdown on tax avoidance. Finance ministers in Moscow have endorsed the first ever international approved plan to rein in tax avoidance by big multinational companies. George Osborne and his finance minister counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble have issued a joint statement. Britain and Germany want competitive corporate tax systems that attract global companies to our countries, but also want global companies to pay those taxes. Here is the story from my colleague, Simon Bowers It is the most ambitious programme of reform since the principles for bilateral tax treaties were first laid down by the League of Nations in the 1920s, laying the ground for the modern era of globalised trade. The action plan sets out 15 initiatives for arming tax authorities around the world with the tools to crack down on some of areas international leaders agree are among the most widely exploited by multinational tax avoiders. But tax-campaigners see little to cheer. This is what the Financial Transparency Coalition (FTC), an umbrella group of charities, had to say: The OECD has done little to dispel its reputation as the \u201crich men\u2019s club\u201d by effectively ruling out the active participation of developing countries in shaping the tax reform agenda. As widely expected, European stocks fell on market opening: FTSE 100 -0.40% 6,607.14 DAX 30 -0.50% 8,295.49 CAC 40 -0.55%, 3,906.00 Over in Japan, the Nikkei ended 1.5% lower, ahead of a weekend election, where prime minister Shinzo Abe is expected to take control of the upper house. Reuters reports that Abe is heading for a resounding win, although economy-watchers worry that a big victory \u201ccould allow him to push nationalist policies at the expense of his \u201cAbenomics\u201d agenda of monetary expansion\". Barclays Capital writes: \u201cThe outcome from this weekend's upper house elections will help determine the ability of the Abe administration to deliver on structural reforms and its long-term growth strategy.\u201d Via Reuters Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. The global caravan of international summitry is in Moscow today, where G20 finance ministers and central bankers will discuss the jobs crisis, against a backdrop of 60% unemployment in Greece and Spain. US treasury secretary Jack Lew has issued a brisk message to the Europeans to pull their socks up and get the economy moving again. Lew writes in the FT (\u00a3) When the finance and labour ministers of the Group of 20 leading nations gather today in Moscow, getting people back to work must be top of the agenda. In many parts of the world, such as Europe, growth is too weak to drive job creation, and it is critical to take steps to bolster private hiring. We have an enormous stake in Europe's success. Recalibrating the pace of fiscal consolidation, so that a fall in activity does not require more cuts, is a step in the right direction. Now that sounds like a warning against further austerity... Also on the G20 agenda is a plan to close down tax loopholes used by corporations such as Apple and Amazon (more later). Here in the UK, we are expecting an update on the public finances at 9.30 I'll be tracking events in Moscow and beyond throughout the day...",

      "bodyText": "More than 30 City banks have been put on standby to advise and help the government with the return of Lloyds Banking group and Royal Bank of Scotland to the private sector. JP Morgan Cazenove has landed the role of lead adviser on the possible sell-off of the stakes in the bailed-out banks, which for Lloyds could begin next month. The appointments were made by UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which looks after the stakes. It is the start of a process to line up banks ready to stand behind any sale of the 39% stake in Lloyds and the 81% stake in RBS. UKFI's decision to put so many banks on its roster, to be called upon once the decision to sell has been made, risks alienating City investors. \"You don't need that amount of banks,\" said one investor. \"People perceive you are trying to overly manage the process rather than let the open markets decide.\" Major City investors get concerned when large numbers of banks are lined up to advise on deals as its pushes up the fees paid and restricts the variety of research they receive on the stocks. Last week the investor body the Association of British Insurers said that only a small number of banks \u2013 perhaps as few as three \u2013 should be involved in running the syndicates set up to sell off stakes in companies. Among the banks named, UKFI has selected 11 so-called bookrunners \u2013 who are in charge of co-ordinating the sale \u2013 although it may not appoint them all when a sale begins. JP Morgan Cazenove, the US-owned City firm where the former prime minister Tony Blair is an adviser, will waive any fee for the advice it provides on selling down the stakes in the banks. The bank, created when the US bank JP Morgan bought the traditional City firm Cazenove, was also a key adviser to the government during the depths of the 2008 banking crisis when \u00a365bn of taxpayer money was used to buy shares in both banks to stop them collapsing. The banks on the list of possible bookrunners are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS, the Swiss bank which already acts as broker to both RBS and Lloyds. These banks, along with others, are also included in listings for more junior roles of co-lead manager, capital markets adviser, and financial and/or strategic adviser. The banks will be picked from the list at short notice once the decision to begin the sell-off is taken. The sale of between 5% and 10% of Lloyds could start after the bank publishes its interim results on 1 August. According to the chancellor, George Osborne, it is most likely to take the form of a sale of a chunk of shares to institutional investors before a later offering to retail investors. A sale of RBS is thought to be further off as the government has appointed Rothschild to provide advice on transferring its troubled loans into a bad bank. Rothschild is receiving a fee of \u00a3850,000 while legal advisers at Slaughter &amp; May, the law firm involved in the 2008 bank bailouts, will charge by the hour. The City has been watching the share price of the banks for a signal when the sell-off might begin, but UKFI said this week that the prices would not be used as gauge to decide whether a sale was value for money for the taxpayer. Instead UKFI said it would look at each bank's future earning prospects and review the total price received for the share sales and not just the first tranche sold off. Lloyds shares closed at 69p \u2013 below the 73.6p average that the taxpayer paid but above the 61p at which the boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio can start to claim his bonus if the shares are sold off. RBS shares closed at 337p, below the 500p average price the stake was bought by the taxpayer. A replacement for UKFI chief executive, Jim O'Neil, who recused himself from the selection process of the roster of banks as he is preparing to move to Bank of America Merrill Lynch this year, is expected to be named shortly.

      "bodyText": "Finance ministers from 20 of the world's largest economies have endorsed the first internationally co-ordinated attempt to roll back decades of ballooning tax avoidance by many of the biggest multinational corporations in the world. Co-ordinated by the OECD, the Paris-based body representing large industrial nations, a new tax reform action plan has won the support of wider G20 members \u2013 including the increasingly influential China, India and Brazil. Through the European Union, countries such as Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland \u2013 all of whom have been accused of beggar-thy-neighbour tax policies \u2013 are also backing the project, details of which are due to be unveiled at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Moscow on Friday. It is the most ambitious programme of reform since the principles for bilateral tax treaties were first laid down by the League of Nations in the 1920s, laying the ground for the modern era of globalised trade. The initiative follows a string of high-profile tax expos\u00e9s by politicians, whistleblowers, anti-poverty campaigners and journalists, shining a light on byzantine corporate structures created by household name companies including Vodafone, Google, Amazon, Starbucks, Diageo, Cadbury and Apple. Campaigning reports by the Guardian stretching back to its 2009 Tax Gap series have been cited by the OECD as contributing to unprecedented public awareness of the problem. \"Unfortunately, the rules are now being abused,\" said the OECD secretary-general, Angel Gurr\u00eda. \"[Our] action plan aims to remedy this, so multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.\" As well as responding to mounting public outcry, world leaders have also taken up the issue with renewed vigour hoping to repair some of the leaks in their strained national exchequers. Among the countries driving the initiative have been Germany and the UK, with the British chancellor, George Osborne, and his finance minister counterpart, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, issuing a joint statement on the fringes of a G20 meeting in Berlin in November calling for radical reform. \"Britain and Germany want competitive corporate tax systems that attract global companies to our countries, but also want global companies to pay those taxes,\" they said. The action plan sets out 15 initiatives for arming tax authorities around the world with the tools to crack down on some of areas international leaders agree are among the most widely exploited by multinational tax avoiders. These targeted initiatives are to produce a range of hard recommendations for changes to the tax treaty rulebook, with deadlines ranging from between 12 months and two-and-a-half years. Among the highlights are additional disclosures multinationals must make to all tax authorities, helping officials know where to look for the worst avoidance. Proposals to require companies such as Amazon with extensive warehouse networks in a country to pay more local tax; multinationals posting high-value \"intangible\" assets, such as brands and intellectual property rights, to tax havens will also targeted; as will special tax break policies introduced by individual nations that are seen as predatory. Despite the ambition of the G20 project \u2013 the scale and pace of which still risks breaking the consensus at a political level \u2013 some anti-poverty campaigners claim it does not go far enough. \"The OECD has done little to dispel its reputation as the 'rich men's club' by effectively ruling out the active participation of developing countries in shaping the tax reform agenda,\" said the Financial Transparency Coalition (FTC), an umbrella group including charities such as Christain Aid, Global Witness, Global Financial Integrity Tax Justice Network and Transparency International. Some FTC member groups want to explore whether the many hundreds of existing bilateral tax treaties that facilitate global trade should be torn up and replaced with a new model \u2013 known as unitary taxation \u2013 which they claim would better link the apportionment of taxable profits by multinationals to the territories in which economic activities occur. Elements of this country-by-country approach have been cherry picked for a narrow aspect of the OECD's reform agenda. Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy and Administration who has been leading the reform project, said the long-standing debate in this contentious area had become \"like a religion\" for advocates on both sides, but insisted he remained \"agnostic\". However, he added there was consensus among G20 members that unitary taxation was not a feasible solution. Another area for which the action plan has already received criticism is its limited ambitions for targeting tax avoidance by a new generation of multinationals operating in a digital economy with business models never envisaged by those who first drafted tax treaty principles. The Guardian revealed on Monday that the US had frustrated attempts by European politicians, particularly the French, for more radical action in this area. The OECD has signaled that more analysis needs to be done on the new and varied ways business is conducted in the digital economy before a timetable for firm recommendations can be set. It is setting up a new OECD taskforce to carry out this research in the next 12 months. The chair of this group is yet to be decided, but France, Germany, the UK and Australia are all understood to be keen to lead the debate.
