      "bodyText": "Britons are feeling more optimistic than at any time for nine years according to the latest snapshot of consumer confidence, as economic recovery becomes more established. GfK's monthly tracker of the nation's mood rose from 0 in May to 1 in June \u2013 putting the index into positive territory for the first time since March 2005. Nick Moon, managing director of social research at GfK, described it as \"psychologically important\" but said the real test would be whether heightened positivity could be maintained in the run up to next year's general election . He said: \"The last time the index was consistently positive was back in 2002 and this must be the next 'target' from the government's point of view as we get close to the election period.\" Consumers were slightly more optimistic in June about the general economic backdrop than they were in May, but more pessimistic about their own financial situation over the next 12 months. The Office for National Statistics is expected to confirm on Friday that the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the first quarter, unchanged from its earlier estimates, although some economists predicted the number would be revised up to 0.9%. Household budgets remain under pressure however, with wage growth lagging behind inflation. The CBI's latest snapshot of the economy suggested growth in the three months to June was slightly slower than in the three months to May, but remained strong. Growth weakened among distribution businesses, but was roughly unchanged among manufacturing and business and consumer services companies, the lobby group said. \"Our growth indicator provides firm evidence that UK GDP is now returning to its pre-recession peak, as the recovery forges ahead,\" said Katja Hall, deputy director-general of the CBI.",

    "webTitle": "Barclays shares tumble after allegations about private 'dark pool' trading system", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Damning allegations that Barclays cheated and defrauded its customers pushed shares in the besieged bank to their lowest levels in 18 months on Thursday and set back attempts by its boss Antony Jenkins to turn around its troubled reputation. The shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, at one point losing 9% before closing 6.5% lower at 215p \u2013 wiping \u00a32.4bn off the value of the bank. The fall was prompted by a lawsuit filed overnight by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. He accused Barclays of \"a systematic pattern of fraud and deceit\" over the way it operated its \"dark pool\" private trading system. Schneiderman said the dark pool \u2013 a means by which traders can remain anonymous until they have completed trades and which was publicised in a recent book on Wall Street by Michael Lewis \u2013 was used to favour high-frequency traders, contrary to promises made in marketing literature. \"Barclays grew its dark pool by telling investors they were diving into safe waters. According to the lawsuit, Barclays' dark pool was full of predators \u2013 there at Barclays' invitation,\" Schneiderman said. High-frequency traders use complex computer systems to buy and sell huge volumes of stocks in milliseconds to profit from tiny movements in share prices. Barclays' new legal counsel, Bob Hoyt \u2013 who worked in George W Bush's White House \u2013 was in New York to lead an urgent inquiry into the allegations, which come as Jenkins has been pledging to clean up Barclays. The allegations date from 2011 until the present, so include the time Jenkins has been in charge. He was promoted to running the bank in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal which forced out Bob Diamond and other top executives. Jenkins emailed staff - many of whom have been sent on ethics and cultural training - to tell them he would not tolerate any abuse of customers. \"I have ... always made it clear that cultural change will take time, but it is precisely incidents such as this which drive home the urgent necessity of the programme we have embarked on to transform the values and conduct of this business. I will not tolerate any circumstances in which our clients are lied to or misled and any instances I discover will be dealt with severely,\" he said. Jenkins said he felt \"deep disappointment and frustration\" about the latest allegations. The bank refused to say if anyone had been suspended as a result of the attorney general's lawsuit, but in a statement \"noted\" the allegations about Barclays' dark pool. These opaque trading platforms are operated by a number of banks. Barclays' is called LX Liquidity Cross and has been operating for four years. \"Amongst other relief, the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief,\" Barclays said. \"Barclays will update the market, if appropriate, in due course.\" Bloomberg reported that customers were refusing to deal in the Barclays' dark pool since the allegations. Sandy Chen, banking analyst at Cenkos, believes the US authorities may be considering injunctions on dark pool trading \u2013 and suggested that Barclays' banking licence in New York could be suspended. \"Barclays' response noted that the complaint seeks 'injunctive relief'\u2013 which we think signals that the New York attorney general and Barclays are already debating whether injunctions on dark pool trading should be imposed,\" Chen said. In echoes of the emails and electronic chats provided at the time of Barclays' \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor, the attorney general cited alleged conversations between staff. \"Happy to take liberties if can all agree,\" one is quoted as saying. Schneiderman alleges that Barclays was trying make its dark pool the biggest in the US. The allegations are being made at a time when other European banks are facing action from US regulators \u2013 notably BNP Paribas \u2013 and when Barclays is also fighting allegations by City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority that it behaved \"recklessly\" during a 2008 fundraising. The New York attorney general had been looking at dark pools before the publication of Lewis's book \u2013 Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt \u2013 which shows how professional investors could trade more quickly to make profits. On CNBC, Schneiderman would not comment on whether others were being investigated but said \"the conduct here is so egregious and ongoing we felt we had to move on this\". Barclays shares were hit because of the uncertainty about the financial penalties that may be imposed if the allegations are proved and because of the potential impact on its investment banking division. While Jenkins is scaling back the investment bank as part of 19,000 job cuts announced in May, he had intended to keep the equities division in which the dark pool business operates. Christopher Wheeler, banks analyst at Mediobanca, questioned what \"collateral damage\" might caused.",

While apparently modest in its initial impact, it breaks new ground.</p> <p>\u201cThe measure alone is already an important signal. It demonstrates the Bank\u2019s preparedness to use a financial stability tool as an insurance against the risk of overheating. It is a major departure for the UK.</p> <p>\u201cTwo years ago the Bank seemed somewhat coy about using tools that targeted loan to income ratios, questioning whether there had been sufficient debate to make their use acceptable to the public. The Bank has now signalled that it may act vigorously to head off the economic and financial stability risks that may arise from an overheating housing market. It will ration some high loan-to-income mortgages from October. The more the market were to overheat, the more this measure could bite.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>And the price of breaking new ground is another session before Tyrie's committee:</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFurther use of tools such as these could, in the long run, have a big effect on millions of people.

France's unemployment total has hit a new record high, as the country's government struggles to get to grips with its jobless problems. The number of job seekers jumped by another 24,800, or 0.7%, in May, pushing the total out of work to to 3,388,900 people. In a statement, the French labour ministry conceded that the figures were not good. It blamed the latest rise in unemployment on \"weaker than expected growth\" this year. France's economy stagnated in the first three months of 2014, and recent business surveys have suggested private sector activity has shrunk in the last quarter. France's economy is only expected to grow by 0.7% this year, and Labor Minister Francois Rebsamen has warned that this won't be enough to bring down unemployment: Rebsamen said: \"To create jobs in the private sector you need growth: 0.7% is better but we'll need to push harder\" (thanks to Dow Jones for the quote) One factor pushing Barclays shares down this afternoon -- Bloomberg reports that it is already losing customers, following allegations that it allowed predatory high-frequency traders to prey on institutional investors. More here: Barclays Dark Pool Said Shunned by Clients Shares in Barclays have tumbled 6.5%, finishing the day down 15p at 215p as traders try to calculate the impact of its 'dark pool' lawsuit. That's the lowest level since November 2012, I think, knocking around \u00a32.5bn off its share price. Today's financial stability report also shows that geopolitical risk has risen this year among bankers, presumably in response to events in Ukraine and Iraq. Here's the chart: The BoE adds: Geopolitical risk was the second most-cited risk and identified as the most difficult to manage by respondents . UK political risks \u2014 for example, relating to Scottish independence and EU exit \u2014 also increased in prominence, though they were only cited as a key risk by around one in seven respondents. Talking tough, but not actually doing a lot. Does Mark Carney remind you of anyone? Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons governor Carney been taking a few lessons from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi - credited with saving the euro with his promise to do 'whatever it takes' two summers ago. And perhaps the same trick will work in the UK. Larry writes: There are three reasons for giving the Bank the benefit of the doubt. The first is that rhetoric can have an impact. Draghi showed that clearly with his pledge to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. Closer to home Carney's predecessor, Lord King, managed to slow down the UK's last house price boom \u2013 if only temporarily \u2013 with a single speech in the mid-2000s. The new governor has made it clear that he is watching lenders closely and they will be expected to respond to the raising of the gubernatorial eyebrows. Want the other two reasons? Click below: Mark Carney's housing pill needs time to let economy digest it Back in the financial markets... the Dow Jones industrial average has dipped in early trading on Wall Street, down 47 points or 0.3% at 16821. The European markets are calm, with the main indices flat. But Barclays share price continues to be hammered, following last night's lawsuit filed by the US attorney general over its 'dark pool' trading systems. It is now down over 7% at 213.4, the lowest level in 21 months. Barclays shares tumble after allegations about private 'dark pool' trading system Ground-breaking they may be, but the Bank of England's measures will not have much immediate impact on loan availability at NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. Their head of mortgages, Lloyd Cochrane, points out that they already have restrictions to prevent reckless lending: We place a strong focus on affordability and in early June we introduced a four times loan-to-income cap and maximum term of 30 years for all mortgage loans of \u00a3500,000 or more. We also apply what we believe is a prudent test of customer affordability across all residential mortgages, at a stressed interest rate of 7%, and have done for more than five years. It\u2019s vitally important that we help our customers ensure they can afford their mortgage today and in the future. Andrew Tyrie MP, the highly respected chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, has also issued a response to today's report. And Tyrie argues that today's measures are an important stage in the UK's economic recovery. He's particularly struck that the Bank is prepared to peg loans to income levels: \u201cThis is a very significant announcement. While apparently modest in its initial impact, it breaks new ground. \u201cThe measure alone is already an important signal. It demonstrates the Bank\u2019s preparedness to use a financial stability tool as an insurance against the risk of overheating. It is a major departure for the UK. \u201cTwo years ago the Bank seemed somewhat coy about using tools that targeted loan to income ratios, questioning whether there had been sufficient debate to make their use acceptable to the public. The Bank has now signalled that it may act vigorously to head off the economic and financial stability risks that may arise from an overheating housing market. It will ration some high loan-to-income mortgages from October. The more the market were to overheat, the more this measure could bite. And the price of breaking new ground is another session before Tyrie's committee: \u201cFurther use of tools such as these could, in the long run, have a big effect on millions of people. The FPC, a relatively new body, is still largely unknown to the public. It is therefore important that it does everything it can to explain its decisions. The Treasury Committee will be seeing members of the FPC on 15 July with that in mind.\u201d Two days ago, one Committee member said the Bank was acting like an \"unreliable\" boyfriend. Wonder what gems they'll come up with next time... Back to the Bank of England's financial stability report.. Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, has declared that today's measures are \"welcome\" \u2013 but also a reminder that Britain needs to address its housing market supply problem: We are not building enough homes to match rising demand and responsibility for that lies with the Chancellor, not the Bank of England. As the Governor pointedly said last month the Bank of England can't build a single house. \"Labour has repeatedly called for action to boost housing supply, but the Government has failed to act and we've seen the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. The danger of George Osborne's failure to get more homes built is that we end up with a premature rise in interest rates to rein in the housing market which ends up hitting millions of families and businesses. \"You can't deal with the cost-of-living crisis and create a strong and balanced recovery without building more homes. That's why Labour has committed to getting at least 200,000 new homes built a year. And we should introduce a Help to Build scheme for small and medium-sized builders alongside a reformed Help to Buy.\" Just in -- signs that the US labour market continues to recover, and Americans are feeling the benefits in their pay packets. The weekly jobless claims figure (measuring the number of people filing new unemployment benefit claims) dipped by 2,000 people to 312,000. And separate consumer spending figures showed that personal incomes rose by 0.4% in May. However, spending only rose by 0.2%, below forecasts. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank says the Bank is \"stepping gently on the brakes\", rather than slamming the pedal to the floor to tame the housing market. That approach has some merits -- the Financial Policy Committee is a relatively new body with a lot of untested tools. But, and it's a big one -- the housing market is the UK economy\u2019s traditional \"Achilles heel\" (as Larry Elliott pointed out during the press conference) Schulz adds: With house prices rising at nearly 10% year-on-year in April according to ONS data and rises spreading outside of London, the boom-bust cycle risks returning. The market for higher risk mortgages, i. e. those with high loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios, is rebounding and in some pockets exceeding pre-crisis levels. One important to flag up: the Bank of England expects house prices to rise by another 20% over the next three years. But despite that, it has backed away from taking more decisive action today -- relying instead on this \"insurance\" against the market spinning further out of control. This chart from the financial stability report explains: And this chart shows how London house prices have outperformed the rest of the UK recently: Mark Carney is \"raising his figurative eyebrows\" at the risks in the housing market, says Aberdeen Asset Management investment manager Luke Bartholomew says. But the measure laid out today will really only hit those looking to buy in London, he adds. Bartholomew also puts his finger on another issue -- Mark Carney's habit of changing his tune. High street banks have already started to tighten standards and the Bank may feel the mortgage market review has done enough to constrain risky lending. But some will feel this softly softly approach is another example of the mixed messages people feel they get from Carney. There is certainly nothing today that will be seen as a potential substitute for the monetary tightening that is coming. Bruce Dear, head of London Real Esatate at law firm Eversheds, says the Bank of England is trying to \"drown the housing market's over-exuberance in red tape\". But Dear also fears that some borrowers and lenders will still be tempted to dodge the new recommendations: Nothing kills enthusiasm like a form, but the new affordability and borrower tests will only be as good as the people applying them. \"Remember the phantom room rents and inflated incomes used to get mortgages in the last boom? In the end, the only things that will really cool the market are putting up rates and building thousands more homes - now.\" Today's measures are an 'insurance policy\" for the future, rather than a clampdown today. So says Miles Shipside of Rightmove, who explains the Bank of England is giving buyers a \"clear message\" to only borrow what they can repay, and firing a \"warning shot\" at lender not to relax their standards. But today's measures are only a \"minor\" tightening, on top of the tighter rules which were implemented in April (the mortgage market review). In effect, the FPC is rubber-stamping the view that we are not currently in the midst of a property bubble as the recommendations that it is proposing will have no material impact on the market in London, or elsewhere, in the immediate or short-term . It obviously believes that the cooling that we\u2019ve seen in both price growth and demand in recent weeks and months is evidence of a market that is starting to sort itself out. However, in case of trouble further down the line, it has instituted an insurance policy on riskier lending by limiting mortgages of 4.5 times loan to income to just 15% of total lending. Genworth, which sells mortgage insurance in the UK, also reckons any impact from today's measures will mainly fall on London. Vice President Simon Crone says: \u201cLimiting the proportion of high loan to income (LTI) mortgages is a well-intended move, but it will mostly affect London and adds to a series of interventions that encourage growth with one hand and rein it in with the other. I\"m going to mop up some of the best reaction on today's announcements from the Bank of England. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has welcomed today's moves, saying the new tests \"will clearly ensure resilience to shocks\". Director general, Paul Smee says the clampdown on high loans will mainly affect the capital: \"Limiting the level of a lender's lending to no more than 15% of new mortgages at 4.5 times income or above (and none at all for Help to Buy guaranteed loans) is likely to impact the London market more than elsewhere. Nationally, 9% of new loans are at 4.5 times income or more, but the figure is 19% in London. Catching up. The Bank of England's financial stability report is online here. Governor Carney's opening statement is here (pdf). And here is the Treasury announcement, stating that the Help To Buy scheme can no longer be used for mortgages of 4.5 times borrowers' income, or more. OK, that's the end of the press conference. A quick summary of the key points: The Bank of England has resisted clamping down hard on the UK housing market today, but announced two recommendations to prevent lending spiralling out of control. Mark Carney has not gone as far as some people had expected. He argued that household indebtedness does not pose \"an imminent threat to stability\" Underwriting standards are more responsible than they were in the past. However, we have seen time and again how quickly responsible can turn to reckless, creating risks that ultimately derail the UK economy. The Bank is creating a firebreak, Carney explained, to avoid Britain suffering another housing boom and bust. Today's measures centre on two main points. 1) An Affordability Test: mortgage lenders must assess whether borrowers could still afford their mortgage if Bank Rate were to be 3 percentage points higher than at the origination of the loan. (That's a slight tightening with previous stress test recommendations) 2) A Lending Cap. No more than 15% of any lender\u2019s total number of new residential mortgages should be at or greater than 4.5 times the borrower\u2019s income. Our City editor Jill Treanor comments: The Bank of England has adopted a wait and see approach to the housing market, concluding there is no immediate threat to the system even though house prices in London have now breached their 2007 peak. At this morning's press conference (highlights start here), Carney said the measures are designed to help deliver a broadening, strengthening recovery. He said: \"They will prevent lending getting too far ahead of income growth and they'll prevent a slide into riskier lending and higher indebtedness that could undermine the economic expansion over the medium term.\" But several economics journalists warned that the Bank may not be doing enough to prevent the housing market spiralling out of control. During the Q&amp;A, Carney said: \u2022 further action could be needed if house prices rise faster than expected, or if wages don't rise as fast. \u2022 He also played down the suggestion that the Bank will need to use the \"big stick\" of interest rate rises, saying monetary policy is not the best tool to control the housing market. Sam Fleming of the FT seeks more information about the cap on high income-to-value loans. Carney explains that it is based on volume, so only 15% of new loans is allowed to be at more than 4.5 times a borrowers' income. But we will be watching closely in case lenders \"try to game the system\". Carney reiterates that the loan-to-income cap will bite more quickly if incomes fail to rise as quickly as the Bank expects. So could the new cap, restricting lenders to just 15% of new loans over 4.5x income, be changed? Carney says that the Bank will watch the situation, and act appropriately. It could adjust the loan-to-income cap if necessary. The Bank's current forecast is that house price growth will slacken within a year, while incomes will pick up. But if that proves too optimistic, further action could be needed. To clarity one point -- the new loan-to-value cap means that lenders must ensure that most of their new loans are granted below the loan-to-value level of 4.5 times income. Just 15% of total borrowing is allowed to be over that level (I garbled that bit earlier - now corrected). What happens if a Bank breaches that rule? Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor for Prudential Regulation, says that the bank could used its enforcement powers, but that wouldn't be the first step. And obviously, both the lender and the borrower would know the risks. (and as flagged up earlier, many first-time buyers have to take out mortgages at a loan-to-value ratio around 4.5x income) Larry Elliott, our economics editor, says that only someone with no knowledge of Britain's recent economic history (pock-marked with housing booms and busts) could be truly confident that today's plan will work. What will you do if this doesn't work? New tools, or the Big Stick of rate rises? Carney (a little riled?) replies that he does know his British economic history (thank you very much), having first lived here in the 1980s. He says there is a broad range of additional tools. One option is to ask banks to hold more capital , because of the macro economic risks. And yes, the bank could used monetary policy to cool the market. But it's not clear that this would be the best way to tackle the situation, given inflation is below the Bank's targets. The council for mortgage lending says that in the first three months of this year 9% of loans were 4.5 times income or more (Hilary Osborne flags up) Back in the BoE press conference, Paul Mason of Channel 4 says it's the \"Bank of Zero\". Today's measures have zero impact on the housing market today, Mason says, while the new countercyclical capital buffer of '0%' (announced this morning). Carney responds by defending the Bank's actions. He says the new affordability test (a 3% jump in interest rates) is what \"prudent lenders too\". The Bank's stress test...\"there is no reason to conclude that the stress test is zero\". It includes a 35% drop in house prices, a 6 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, and a three-year recession. Shares in housebuilders have jumped on the back of the Bank of England's news. Persimmon and Barratt Development are both up over 4%. That's a signal that these announcements are NOT as tough as some had expected. Crucially, the Bank has not made any changes itself to Help to Buy. Is the chancellor being too dramatic by declaring this morning that NO Help To Buy mortgages can be granted at more than 4.5 times the borrowers' income, asks a mischievous Robert Peston. Carney points out that any HTB loan is -- by definition -- being granted at a high income multiple. Today's changes are the \"limit of our tolerance\" on the housing market, says Carney (suddenly sounding terribly serious). If we need to recalibrate, we will. Carney continues that the Bank of England is acting in a way that doesn't slow the revovery, that allows prudent lending, but puts Banks and Building Society on notice, and also puts a firebreak in place for the future. Ed Conway of Sky also asks whether the Bank is simply talking, rather than acting. Carney replies: We are putting in place a firebreak on high loan-to-income lending, riskier lending... but we're not shutting it off entirely. What impact will these measures have on the London property market, asks Jennifer Ryan of Bloomberg? There is headroom for further lending, Carney replies, but not infinite room, as there are dangers in offering such high loan-to-value loans. Onto questions -- Richard Edgar of ITV goes first. Nothing announced today will actually affect the housing market right now - so hasn't the status quo been reinforced? Carney says the measures will have \"an impact of the durability of the expansion.\" The 4.5 times cap on loan-to-income, and the tougher affordability tests should prevent a repeat of the housing crashes Britain has suffered in the past. But yes, if someone could get a mortgage yesterday, they can get one today. Governor Carney welcomes the news that George Osborne has announced that loans at or above 4.5 times borrowers\u2019 income can NO LONGER be included in the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. That's tougher than the Bank's recommendation that only 15% of a bank's loans can be granted at over the 4.5 times limit. The new affordability rules kick in today. Carney says it's not the Financial Policy Committee's job to control house prices - but it is worried about the state of household indebtedness in the UK. Household debt isn't an immediate threat - but it is a worry for the future. Mark Carney is explaining that the Bank of England is acting now, to avoid the housing market spiralling out of control and threatening financial stability. The governor says that the UK economy is broadening and strengthening, but the housing market is the main risk to financial stability. Breaking: the Bank of England has announced tougher new rules on mortgage availability to avoid to housing market destabilising the economy. It has JUST announced a new affordability test on banks -- they must now calculate the impact if interest rates rise by three percentage points (so, from 0.5% today to 3.5% -- but rather higher in a few year's time). It has also announced a cap on lending so that 85% of new mortgages must be granted at no more than 4.5 times loan to income levels  Here are the key points: 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FINANCIAL POLICY COMMITTEE SAYS TO CAP BULK OF HIGH LOAN-TO-INCOME MORTGAGES, TOUGHEN UNDERWRITING STANDARDS 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - TO SET FROM OCTOBER LOAN TO INCOME RATIO AT 4.5 FOR 85 PCT OF NEW MORTGAGES 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - NEW CAP WOULD APPLY TO LENDERS WHO GRANT MORE THAN 100 MLN STG OF HOME LOANS A YEAR 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - HOME LOANS GRANTED FROM TODAY BUT COMPLETED FROM OCTOBER WILL COUNT TOWARDS TOTAL VOLUME FOR SETTING PLANNED CAP 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - TOUGHENS AFFORDABILITY TESTS FOR NEW HOME LOANS FROM THURSDAY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIALLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - MOST LENDERS ALREADY OPERATE WITHIN THE LTI CAP 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT HOUSEHOLD INDEBTEDNESS POSES AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO STABILITY, MEASURES AIMED TO INSURE AGAINST THIS RISK 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - EIGHT TOP UK LENDERS MUST MAINTAIN CORE EQUITY RATIO OF 7 PCT, LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3 PCT 10:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND FPC - SETS FIRST FORMAL COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER FOR BANKS AT 0 PCT Here's the livestream of the Bank of England's press conference (right-click to open in a new tab). OK, so the Bank of England is poised to announce what decisions were taken by its Financial Policy Committee at its meeting last week. And there's plenty of anticipation that it will do something to cool the housing market. The BBC's Robert Peston has put his cards on the table, predicting tighter rules on how much borrowers can be lent, and more rigorous affordability 1) a proposed formalisation of the voluntary restrictions announced by Lloyds and RBS, viz a prohibition on mortgages greater than four times household income for loans of more than \u00a3500,000 - because in most of the country outside London and the south, there are relatively few houses worth more than that. 2) a tightening up of the so-called affordability test banks apply to anyone requesting a mortgage, to ensure they can keep up the repayments in the event mortgage rates rise to 7%. My colleagues Jill Treanor and Larry Elliott are embedded in the Bank, ready for 10.30am. At that moment, we'll get a flood of newsflashes -- just as Mark Carney starts to read a prepared statement. Then there'll be a Q&amp;A. It'll all be streamed live here. The City really doesn't like the look of Standard Chartered's trading update -- shares are now down 6.5% after its warning of 'disappointing trading' this year. The pound has risen against the US dollar, ahead of the publication of the Bank of England's Financial Stability report in under 30 minutes. Sterling has risen by 0.2%, back through the $1.70 mark and close to its highest level since August 2009. Traders may be calculating that the Bank will clamp down on the housing market, and thus give more freedom to leave interest rates alone. Paul Robson, a currency strategist at RBS Global Banking, told Reuters: \"The devil will be in the detail but the rule of thumb is that the tighter macroprudential policy becomes, the looser the margin that conventional monetary policy can be, i.e. interest rates might not have to be raised quite as early or aggressively as they would have otherwise been.\" It's not looking like a great day for banks. Standard Chartered has just warned shareholders that its performance in the last six months have not met expectations. Income in the first half of 2014 will be lower than a year ago, by a \"mid single-digit\" percentage. And the main culprit its Financial Markets division, where income has tumbled by a fifth in the face of a \"challenging external environment\". Lenny Feder, head of the Financial Markets division, is \"taking a sabbatical\", and the process of finding a permanent replacement has already started. Peter Sands, group chief executive, was frank about the situation: \"This has been a disappointing first half, with difficult trading conditions, particularly in financial markets. We are making good progress against our refreshed strategy and are taking the right actions in response to a challenging environment - managing costs very tightly, disposing of non-core businesses and optimising the deployment of capital. Shares in Standard Chartered have promptly fallen by over 4%, putting it in second place on the FTSE 100 losers board behind Barclays (now -5%) Consumer electronics group Dixons has told reporters that it has benefited from the pick-up in the UK housing market and the World Cup. Chief executive Sebastian James was briefing the press after reporting a 10% jump in pre-tax profits. My colleague Sean Farrell was on the call, and reports: Is it better to watching England lose on a big new TV? I find hiding behind a cushion has its merits.... Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, predicts the Bank of England will announce measures to cool the \"frothy\" UK property market this morning (from 10.30am) Here's why: The pace of housing price increases accelerated to a year-on-year pace of 11.1 percent in May according to data from the Nationwide Building Society, marking a seven-year high. The central bank\u2019s own data shows UK citizens owe a hefty \u00a31.2 trillion on their homes. That has officials worried about excessive levels of debt, which could potentially lead to a crisis akin to the US mortgages fiasco that metastasised into the 2008 credit crunch and subsequent global recession. Banking analyst Sandy Chen believes that the \"dark pool\" US lawsuit could be very serious indeed for Barclays -- and could lead to its licence to operate in New York being reviewed. Chen, of Cenkos Securities, writes: The lawsuit from the NY Attorney General alleging \u201ca systematic pattern of fraud and deceit\u201d in Barclays' LX (\u201cLiquidity Cross\u201d) equities dark pool is predictably detailed \u2013 and if attorney-general Schneiderman executes this according to plan, we would expect him to review Barclays Libor non-prosecution agreement and Barclays New York banking licence in due course. Barclays response noted that the complaint seeks \u201cinjunctive relief\u201d \u2013 which we think signals that the NY AG and Barclays are already debating whether injunctions on dark pool trading should be imposed. Chen also explains the majority of Barclay's income from \"Equities and Prime Services\" came from America, and could now be at risk. And there's also the damage to Barclays' reputation, which CEO \"Saint Antony\" Jenkins has been trying hard to improve.... We've castigated mining giant Glencore in the past for being the only FTSE 100 company with an all-male board. So it's only right to applaud the news that it has bounded into 21st Century by appointing its first female non-executive director -- Patrice Merrin. Merrin looks pretty darned experienced \u2013 she spent a decade at Canadian mining firm Sherritt, and then ran Luscar, Canada's largest thermal coal producer. Which rather proves the point that there's no shortage of talented people of either gender in the business world. As chairman Tony Hayward put it: \"Her record of non-executive director appointments, activist involvement and industry advisory board service is also an excellent complementary skill set to our Board. \" The selloff continues, as traders wonder just how serious this lawsuit could be for Barclays. Takeover news: the London Stock Exchange has announced that it has finalised the acquisition of Frank Russell, the US investment management firm and index compiler, for $2.7bn. LES says it's a \"rare opportunity\" -- and the City appears to agree, pushing its shares up 4.5%. LSE is already dropping hints that it might spin off the investment management side of the business -- clearly it's the indexes that really caught its eye. fastFT have a good take. Shares in Barclays have tumbled to an 18-month low at the start of trading in London. Barclays shares slid by 4.5% to 219p, the lowest level since October 2012, following the news last night that it is being sued by the US attorney general. Barclay is accused of favouring high-frequency traders who used its \u201cdark pool\u201d trading system, while misleading institutional investors about the risks. These \"dark pools\" are designed to allow investors to buy and sell large amounts of shares anonymously, rather than alerting the market to their trading before it has been completed. But in this lawsuit, Barclays is accused of misleading major City and Wall Street players over how safe the pool actually was; actually allowing \"predatory behaviour\" which it claimed was prohibited. Barclays issued a short statement this morning, confirming the lawsuit and promising to \"update the market, if appropriate, in due course\". The Bank of England has made it clear that it doesn't want to raise interest rates to calm the property sector. So what options does the FPC have? It could advise banks not to offer loans over a certain multiple (based either on income, or house value). Lloyds Banking Group has already taken measures itself - it won't lend more than 4.5 times income. It could tweak the capital reserve rules imposed on banks, making them hold more cash to cover bad loans (and therefore meaning less is available for lending) It could tighten up the affordability measures used to test whether people can afford to repay their mortgages [although the current rules have only been operating since April] George Osborne has now given the BoE the power to scale back the government's Help to Buy programme; potentially, it could lower the maximum loans available under the scheme. Of course, the housing market isn't the only threat to financial stability - but whatever the Bank does will probably hog the headlines today. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Has the Bank of England decided to take steps to cool the UK housing market? We find out this morning, when its Financial Policy Committee announces what decisions it has taken (if any) to maintain financial stability in the British economy. The FPC has a whole bag of 'macro prudential' tools at its disposal \u2013 although many haven't been used before. Many analysts expect the Bank to make some moves in the housing sector \u2013 perhaps instructing banks to rein in risky lending, or through changes to the government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme. The FPC announces its decisions at 10.30am, followed by a press conference in London, which we'll track live here. I'll also be watching Barclays, which last night was accused of using its 'dark pool' trading system to favour high-frequency traders, exposing its own clients to a pack of voracious predators. Barclays sued by New York attorney general over alleged 'dark pool' fraud In the corporate world, we're analysing results from Dixons and Carphone Warehouse (soon to merge into one company, of course). And European stock markets are expected to inch higher, after we learned yesterday that the US economy shrank by a shocking 2.9% in the last quarter, on an annualised basis. The figures are historic (for January-March), and recent data has been much stronger, but it reinforces expectations that the Federal Reserve will maintain loose monetary policy for longer. As IG's Chris Weston comments from Australia: Price action in capital markets overnight once again highlights traders\u2019 love affair with stimulus and an easy stance towards monetary policy from certain developed market central banks. This concept still feels wrong, and one would have hoped that at this stage in the cycle we would be seeing organic growth as a more prominent reason to celebrate. Alas not - instead, the markets are still swigging merrily from the punchbowl. I'll be tracking all the action through the day.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, is hoarding land and buildings covering an area big enough to build 15,000 homes, a Guardian analysis has revealed. The size of the embattled retailer's land bank, theoretically large enough to replicate the government's proposed new garden city at Ebbsfleet, is far greater than previously estimated and remains on its books despite much of it being bought to build out-of-town Extra superstores which are no longer financially attractive as shoppers turn their back on the big weekly grocery shop. The scale of Tesco's land holdings are revealed as the grocer's under-pressure boss, Philip Clarke, steels himself for a barracking from disgruntled shareholders at Friday's AGM. Clarke has said it could take three years to turn the struggling UK chain around. Its most recent sales figures were the worst in a generation. The study of Land Registry records by the Guardian and aerial photography company Getmapping reveals Tesco's British property portfolio covers 4.6m sq m, spanning around 310 separate sites that do not currently house a Tesco store in England, Scotland and Wales. The data is a snapshot of Tesco's land ownership, taken from Land Registry records in March, which was then matched against the retailer's own database to remove existing stores. Some of the portfolio is residential property or rented to other retailers, but the majority is undeveloped. The analysis comes at a time when the Labour party is floating a \"use-it-or-lose-it\" policy for firms sitting on large amounts of undeveloped land, as well as various calls to develop the greenbelt and to \"retrofit old cities to modern demands\". Supermarket land banks came under the spotlight of the Competition Commission seven years ago, when the major chains faced allegations they were buying up land to prevent rivals from developing in certain towns. At the time, Tesco was reported to have 185 sites \u2013 said to equate to 410,000 sq m of new store space \u2013 that it could develop without getting permission from government regulators. Last year, the retailer cut the valuation of about 460,000 sq m of its land by \u00a3800m \u2013 as it admitted it would never build on many of the sites it had accumulated over the years. Tesco last year said its UK property empire was worth \u00a320bn. The new details on the land bank follow news that Tesco is \"urgently investigating\" its property division \u2013 and faces potential fines \u2013 after the Guardian revealed the chain has been failing to comply with a Competition Commission (now the Competition and Markets Authority or CMA) order for the past four years. The 2010 directive related to Tesco's use of restrictive covenants, which allow former landowners to control how plots are developed after they have been sold, and which the supermarket had repeatedly insisted it had removed as ordered. The Guardian's analysis has also discovered that the supermarket chain: \u2022 Has accumulated large amounts of unused land close to existing superstores. \u2022 Has bought up successful local pubs, turning them into convenience stores. One became a squat. \u2022 Has acquired a substantial portfolio of established residential property. \u2022 Has turned down offers for at least one site from rivals, despite having no plans to develop the land. A Tesco spokesman said: \"We only buy land with the intention of delivering developments. Like other supermarkets, we own a pipeline of sites where we intend to develop new stores for our customers over the coming years. As we have previously announced, in response to changing customer shopping habits we have decided to reduce the new space we build each year, building fewer large stores. \"Where we no longer intend to develop sites, we sell them, lease them or develop them for housing. We are very willing to sell or lease sites to other retailers where they make the best commercial offer, and have done so many times.\" The spokesman declined to comment on the size of Tesco's land bank, or to comment on City speculation that the retailer would likely be forced into further write downs of its unused sites. The Competition Commission's 2007 inquiry found no evidence that the land holdings of the major supermarkets impacted on competition, although the theory continues to be debated within the property sector. While the Commission's report ordered supermarkets to remove selected restrictive covenants, its overall conclusions found no evidence to prove allegations that the industry owned land in order to thwart competition. \"We do not find grocery retailers are engaging in the holding of undeveloped land (or land banking) as a strategy to impede the entry by rival grocery retailers into local markets,\" it said. The arguments are being revived as Aldi and Lidl look for new sites. The discount stores are having a big effect on Tesco's trading and their influence was shown on inflation, which fell to its lowest level in almost five years in May partly because of supermarket discount wars. The practice of holding a large land bank is not exclusive to Tesco, but as the market leader it is widely believed to own by far the largest within the UK supermarket sector. Last month, Sainsbury's said a review of its \"property pipeline\" identified a number of sites that it no longer wants to develop, resulting in a \u00a392m write down in its books. The hoarding of development land for long periods has also drawn criticism in the house building sector \u2013 which owns far larger plots of land than the supermarkets \u2013 and in December Ed Miliband promised the next Labour government would legislate to prevent profiteering property developers stockpiling land, in order to more than double the number of homes being built each year in England. However, even that policy \u2013 considered radical by many and hated by house builders \u2013 does not go far enough for some. Prof Karel Williams of the Manchester Business School, added: \"With Ed [Miliband] it stops at the headline. Use-it-or-lose-it should surely apply to councils, superstores and straight property companies.\" While the aggregate size of Tesco's land bank could theoretically be used to build many homes, it is distributed across Britain, with areas of some plots likely to be unsuitable for housing. Fred Harrison, an economist who has called for land to be taxed as if the sites were in use, added: \"Companies own all this land and choose not to use it. You can't force them to sell it, but given there is a market demand for it and we know the value, you can charge the owners for the public services that make the land valuable. Then they lose money if they just sit on it with no revenue\".

      "body": "<p>Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, is hoarding land and buildings covering an area big enough to build 15,000 homes, a Guardian analysis has revealed.</p> <p>The size of the embattled retailer's land bank, theoretically large enough to replicate the government's proposed new garden city at Ebbsfleet, is far greater than previously estimated and remains on its books despite much of it being bought to build out-of-town Extra superstores which are no longer financially attractive as shoppers turn their back on the big weekly grocery shop.</p> <p>The scale of Tesco's land holdings are revealed as the grocer's under-pressure boss, Philip Clarke, steels himself for a barracking from disgruntled shareholders at Friday's AGM. Clarke has said it could take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/16/tesco-profits-fall-philip-clarke-defiant\" title=\"\">three years to turn the struggling UK chain around</a>. Its most recent sales figures were the worst in a generation.</p> <p>The study of Land Registry records by the Guardian and aerial photography company Getmapping reveals Tesco's British property portfolio covers 4.6m sq m, spanning around 310 separate sites that do not currently house a Tesco store in England, Scotland and Wales. The data is a snapshot of Tesco's land ownership, taken from Land Registry records in March, which was then matched against the retailer's own database to remove existing stores. Some of the portfolio is residential property or rented to other retailers, but the majority is undeveloped.</p> <p>The analysis comes at a time when the Labour party is floating a \"use-it-or-lose-it\" policy for firms sitting on large amounts of undeveloped land, as well as various calls to develop the greenbelt and to \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/21/no-housing-crisis-just-very-british-sickness\" title=\"\">retrofit old cities to modern demands</a>\".</p> <p>Supermarket land banks came under the spotlight of the Competition Commission seven years ago, when the major chains faced allegations they were buying up land to prevent rivals from developing in certain towns. At the time, Tesco was reported to have 185 sites \u2013 said to equate to 410,000 sq m of new store space \u2013 that it could develop without getting permission from government regulators.</p> <p>Last year, the retailer cut the valuation of about 460,000 sq m of its land by \u00a3800m \u2013 as it admitted it would never build on many of the sites it had accumulated over the years. Tesco last year said its UK property empire was worth \u00a320bn.</p> <p>The new details on the land bank follow news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/10/tesco-failing-comply-2010-competition-order-supermarket-restrictive-convenant\" title=\"\">Tesco is \"urgently investigating\" its property division \u2013 and faces potential fines \u2013 after the Guardian revealed the chain has been failing to comply with a Competition Commission (now the Competition and Markets Authority or CMA) order for the past four years</a>. The 2010 directive related to Tesco's use of restrictive covenants, which allow former landowners to control how plots are developed after they have been sold, and which the supermarket had repeatedly insisted it had removed as ordered.</p> <p>The Guardian's analysis has also discovered that the supermarket chain:</p> <p>\u2022 Has accumulated large amounts of unused land close to existing superstores.</p> <p>\u2022 Has bought up successful local pubs, turning them into convenience stores. One became a squat.</p> <p>\u2022 Has acquired a substantial portfolio of established residential property.</p> <p>\u2022 Has turned down offers for at least one site from rivals, despite having no plans to develop the land.</p> <p>A Tesco spokesman said: \"We only buy land with the intention of delivering developments. Like other supermarkets, we own a pipeline of sites where we intend to develop new stores for our customers over the coming years. As we have previously announced, in response to changing customer shopping habits we have decided to reduce the new space we build each year, building fewer large stores.</p> <p>\"Where we no longer intend to develop sites, we sell them, lease them or develop them for housing. We are very willing to sell or lease sites to other retailers where they make the best commercial offer, and have done so many times.\"</p> <p>The spokesman declined to comment on the size of Tesco's land bank, or to comment on City speculation that the retailer would likely be forced into further write downs of its unused sites.</p> <p>The Competition Commission's 2007 inquiry found no evidence that the land holdings of the major supermarkets impacted on competition, although the theory continues to be debated within the property sector.</p> <p>While the Commission's report ordered supermarkets to remove selected restrictive covenants, its overall conclusions found no evidence to prove allegations that the industry owned land in order to thwart competition. \"We do not find grocery retailers are engaging in the holding of undeveloped land (or land banking) as a strategy to impede the entry by rival grocery retailers into local markets,\" it said.</p> <p>The arguments are being revived as Aldi and Lidl look for new sites. The discount stores are having a big effect on Tesco's trading and their influence was shown on inflation, which fell to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/17/uk-inflation-lowest-since-october-2009\" title=\"\">its lowest level in almost five years in May partly because of supermarket discount wars</a>.</p> <p>The practice of holding a large land bank is not exclusive to Tesco, but as the market leader it is widely believed to own by far the largest within the UK supermarket sector. Last month, Sainsbury's said a review of its \"property pipeline\" identified a number of sites that it no longer wants to develop, resulting in a \u00a392m write down in its books.</p> <p>The hoarding of development land for long periods has also drawn criticism in the house building sector \u2013 which owns far larger plots of land than the supermarkets \u2013 and in December Ed Miliband promised the next Labour government would legislate to prevent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/15/ed-miliband-housebuilding-labour-councils-developers\" title=\"\">profiteering property developers stockpiling land</a>, in order to more than double the number of homes being built each year in England.</p> <p>However, even that policy \u2013 considered radical by many and hated by house builders \u2013 does not go far enough for some. Prof Karel Williams of the Manchester Business School, added: \"With Ed [Miliband] it stops at the headline. Use-it-or-lose-it should surely apply to councils, superstores and straight property companies.\"</p> <p>While the aggregate size of Tesco's land bank could theoretically be used to build many homes, it is distributed across Britain, with areas of some plots likely to be unsuitable for housing.</p> <p>Fred Harrison, an economist who has called for land to be taxed as if the sites were in use, added: \"Companies own all this land and choose not to use it. You can't force them to sell it, but given there is a market demand for it and we know the value, you can charge the owners for the public services that make the land valuable. Then they lose money if they just sit on it with no revenue\".</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Will Franklin and Patrick Scott</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 June to correct the homophone sights/sites.</p>",

State-of-the-art technology dominates the top 10 list \u2013 headed by a WiFi-connected doll, with a price tag of \u00a375, designed to help children with their homework. Cayla can answer questions using Google, although swear words and certain topics are blocked. The doll can be synced with an Android or iOS device via Bluetooth or use speech-to-text technology to look up answers online. Barbie's Colour Change handbag, costing \u00a340, allows youngsters to hold it against any item of clothing and then press a button to match more than 100 different shades. Virtual pets, which dominated last year's top 10, have been swept aside in favour of other hi-tech gadgets, although there are no tablet devices. Last year, the Teksta robotic puppy was so popular that it sold out completely. This year it has been joined by a dinosaur \u2013 the Teksta T-Rex, which walks backwards and forwards, moving its head from side to side, sniffing and chewing on its favourite bone, and spitting it out with a giant burp when it has had enough. Another toy prompting the yuk factor beloved by kids is an interactive monster-under-the-bed called Xeno, which can display more than 40 different expressions through its animated LCD eyes, has pull-out snot dripping from its nose and can fart to order. LeapFrog's LeapTV also makes the list this season with its educational, active video gaming system. It costs \u00a3135. Hamleys toy buyer Eve Fifer said: \"These are predominantly hi-tech toys which we are predicting will be top sellers, but they are not just machines: they all allow the youngsters playing with them to use their creativity and imagination.\" Amid huge strides by retailers to make toys \"non-gender specific\", she said children would simply make up their own minds about what they wanted. \"We no longer group or colour-code toys according to gender and we don't see this as an issue.\" A \u00a365 BoomCo airpump gun with soft bullets (described as a blaster using darts) was as likely to appeal to girls as to boys. Another top 10 toy is the \u00a325 Doh Vinci vanity box, which allows children to become 3D designers, and the Kiddizoom Smart Watch, which shows the time but can also take and edit photos, record videos and play three built-in games. 3D printing is also being used in a new range of Makies dolls \u2013 retailing from \u00a370 \u2013 which allow the owner to create a \"mini me\". Hamleys, which has five stores in the UK, said many of the toys will be launched over the summer, although the Christmas gift buying season at its stores does not really take off until after the October half-term. Reassuringly, Hamleys has not forgotten traditional toys. It will be relaunching its own-brand range of classic and wooden toys, including bricks, pull-along toys and clocks over the summer.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney's been taking lessons from his chum Mario Draghi. The president of the European Central Bank has become a dab hand at getting what he wants just by talking tough. Carney is trying to turn the same trick with Britain's housing market. The governor of the Bank of England certainly cranked up the rhetoric on Thursday as he presented Threadneedle Street's financial stability report. The Bank was concerned about the high level of personal debt. It was aware how quickly responsible lending could become reckless. It was an alert to the major risks that the bursting of a property bubble posed to the UK economy. But apart from Carney's language, there wasn't much in the way of direct action to cool down the housing market. The Bank's new affordability test says mortgage lenders should assess whether borrowers could still keep up their monthly payments if mortgage rates were to be three percentage points higher than when they took out the home loan. But as the Bank acknowledges, most lenders are already using a 2.5 to three percentage-point stress test to assess the financial vulnerability of customers. Nor will the second measure have any immediate impact. This is the stipulation that no more than 15% of the new mortgages granted by lenders should be at or greater than 4.5% of a borrower's income. At present, only around 10% of loans fall into this category, while some lenders have already voluntarily imposed a lower loan to income cap of four times a borrower's income. After all the speculation in the run-up to the release of the FSR, the Bank is now open to the accusation that it has bottled it. Given Britain's long and inglorious history of property bubbles going pop, it may live to regret not doing more now to prevent house-price inflation accelerating from its current level of 9% (as measured by an average of the Halifax and Nationwide monthly surveys). There are, though, three reasons for giving the Bank the benefit of the doubt. The first is that rhetoric can have an impact. Draghi showed that clearly with his pledge to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. Closer to home Carney's predecessor, Lord King, managed to slow down the UK's last house price boom \u2013 if only temporarily \u2013 with a single speech in the mid-2000s. The new governor has made it clear that he is watching lenders closely and they will be expected to respond to the raising of the gubernatorial eyebrows. Secondly, the measures announced on Thursday will eventually bite if developments in the housing market unfold in the way that the Bank expects. The share of new mortgages at loan to income ratios of 4.5 and above is forecast to hit 15% within the next 12 months, and sooner if house prices grow more rapidly than Threadneedle Street is predicting. Carney and his FPC colleagues don't think the property market is booming out of control but have taken out an insurance policy in case it does. Finally, the Bank has a number of other tools it can use and Carney listed them today. It could make the stress tests tighter; it could make loan to income caps tougher; it could introduce loan to value curbs; it could force banks and building societies to hold more capital against mortgage lending. Ultimately, of course, the Bank's monetary policy can step in with higher interest rates if the FPC proves not to be up to the job. The Bank's strategy is a tentative one, taking things in a \"graduated and proportionate\" manner, as Carney puts it. This is not especially exciting, but there are times to be tentative rather than aggressive. And this is one of them.",

The share of new mortgages at loan to income ratios of 4.5 and above is forecast to hit 15% within the next 12 months, and sooner if house prices grow more rapidly than Threadneedle Street is predicting. Carney and his FPC colleagues don't think the property market is booming out of control but have taken out an insurance policy in case it does.</p> <p>Finally, the Bank has a number of other tools it can use and Carney listed them today. It could make the stress tests tighter; it could make loan to income caps tougher; it could introduce loan to value curbs; it could force banks and building societies to hold more capital against mortgage lending. Ultimately, of course, the Bank's monetary policy can step in with higher interest rates if the FPC proves not to be up to the job.</p> <p>The Bank's strategy is a tentative one, taking things in a \"graduated and proportionate\" manner, as Carney puts it. This is not especially exciting, but there are times to be tentative rather than aggressive. And this is one of them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Remember Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins' famous memo to staff at the start of last year? \"We must never again be in a position of rewarding people for making the bank money in a way which is unethical or inconsistent with our values,\" he declared. He went on: \"There might be some who don't feel they can fully buy into an approach which so squarely links performance to the upholding of our values. My message to those people is simple: Barclays is not the place for you. The rules have changed. You won't feel comfortable at Barclays and, to be frank, we won't feel comfortable with you as colleagues.\" A worthy declaration after past scandals, especially the damaging \u00a3290m Libor-rigging settlement that spelled the end for Bob Diamond and brought Jenkins into office. The question, though, was always whether Jenkins' word was law within Barclays. Did he have the ability and power to enforce a change of culture quickly, especially at the US end of the investment bank dominated by ex-Lehmans staff? Now New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has alleged \"fraud, dishonesty and deception\" in Barclays' operation of a so-called \"dark pool\" trading system in US. His 30-page lawsuit is filled with references to 2013 and 2014 \u2013 well into Jenkins' reign. Barclays has yet to make a detailed response to the allegations. The bank says it takes the charges \"very seriously\" and that \"the integrity of the markets is a top priority of Barclays\". The bank could yet choose to defend its behaviour and fight the case, as it is with allegations that it rigged energy markets in the US between 2006 and 2008. But US regulators tend not to back down easily. Schneiderman is making three specific and detailed complaints. First, that Barclays gave preferential treatment to aggressive high-frequency traders by feeding them privileged information on trading patterns. Second, that the bank didn't warn pension funds and conventional investors that the LX dark pool was dominated by predatory high-frequency traders. Third, that Barclays' heavily-marketed software for monitoring trading, and removing aggressive players, was \"a sham\". Schneiderman paints a picture of a bank that was hell-bent on creating the biggest dark pool and didn't care if clients got the best prices for the shares they were buying and selling. And he claims internal whistleblowers provided much of his evidence. One \"former senior Barclays director\" is reported to have said: \"It's almost like they are building a car and saying it has an airbag and there is no airbag or brakes.\" To repeat, Barclays' detailed response is awaited. But this lawsuit clearly has the potential do serious damage to Barclays' reputation with institutional clients. It could also do immediate and specific damage. Sandy Chen, banking analyst at Cenkos, says he expects Schneiderman to try to revisit Barclays' non-prosecution agreement after the Libor settlement and even Barclays' banking licence in New York. He adds: \"Barclays noted that the complaint seeks \"injunctive relief\" \u2013 which we think signals that the New York attorney general and Barclays are already debating whether injunctions on dark pool trading should be imposed.\" That would cause an immediate hit to revenues. In short, this affair has the potential to play havoc with Jenkins' reform programme. In the brief period of optimism that coincided with Jenkins' memo and strategic review at the start of 2013, Barclays shares touched 300p for the first time since the calamitous Libor scandal. Optimism is now in shorter supply. The share price is 219p, down 5% today. Jenkins has always argued that overhauling Barclays is a big job that will take time. The task looks even bigger and longer today.",

      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered warned that profits will fall this year and said the head of its worst performing business had gone on a long-term break from the Asia-focused bank. In its second warning on financial performance in just over six months, the bank said operating profit for the first half of this year would fall about 20%, reducing profits for all of 2014. The bank's shares fell 4.2% to \u00a312.00, down 25% since last August. They were the second-biggest FTSE 100 fallers behind Barclays, whose shares were hit after the New York attorney general accused it of fraud. Peter Sands, Standard Chartered's chief executive, said the first half of 2014 was disappointing and blamed tough trading at its financial markets business. Lenny Feder, head of financial markets and one of the bank's most senior executives, has gone on a year's \"sabbatical\" and the bank is understood to be looking for a permanent replacement. In a trading update, Sands said: \"This has been a disappointing first half, with difficult trading conditions, particularly in financial markets. We are making good progress against our refreshed strategy and are taking the right actions in response to a challenging environment \u2013 managing costs very tightly, disposing of non-core businesses and optimising the deployment of capital. As we navigate this difficult period, we remain focused on the drivers of value creation for our shareholders, continuing to build our franchise to make the most of the enormous opportunities in our markets.\" Sands said in March that the bank expected modest growth in revenue and profit this year after profit for 2013 fell 7% to $7bn (\u00a34bn) last year \u2013 the first fall for a decade. He has reorganised the business and pledged to get to grips with the ailing business in Korea, which forced a $1bn writedown last year. After withstanding the financial crisis and being feted as the star of British banking, things have turned rocky for Standard Chartered. A fine of \u00a3415m in late 2012 for breaching US sanctions against Iran was followed by a downturn in financial performance that prompted the bank to abandon its revenue target in November and publish a profit warning the following month. The bank faced a big rebellion over executive pay at its annual meeting last month as shareholders protested over high pay for worse performance. Standard Chartered said financial markets income was the biggest challenge for the group. Banks including Barclays have been hit by low volatility in markets, reducing client trading, and regulators' demands that they hold more capital against trading activities. Writedowns on problem loans will rise by a \"high-teens percentage\" in the first half, an increase the bank said was in line with expectations. The bank was also hit by a $75m loss on \"certain strategic investments\".",

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets need to confront the \"brutal reality\" of the changes taking place in their market and fight back or pay a huge price, the chief executive of the struggling Morrisons chain has warned. Dalton Philips compared the big grocery retailers' current situation \u2013 under attack from the discounters \u2013 to that of the airlines, where low-cost operators such as Ryanair and easyJet now control about half the market. He also pointed to one-time big corporate names like Kodak and Nokia, whose market dominance was wiped out because of their failure to accept that the industry had changed. Philips said it was feasible that discounters could take up to 25% of the UK grocery market \u2013 which would make them nearly as big as Tesco is now. The big supermarkets are losing market share fast as customers buy more online and defect in droves from big edge of town superstores to smaller, and cheaper in-town discounters. \"You can't out-discount a discounter but you have got to face into their challenge,\" Philips told the British Retail Consortium's annual symposium in London. \"That's what we are about, fighting back. If the middle market doesn't fight back it pays a huge price.\" Philips, who admitted he was nervous about giving his speech after Morrisons founder Sir Ken Morrison recently criticised his strategy as \"bullshit\", is attempting to win back customers lost to discount chains such Aldi and Lidl by slashing prices. He has recently cut prices on 1,200 items by an average of 17% and has warned that the Morrison's profits will halve as a result. The price cuts are costing \u00a31bn and the company's share price has dived since he unveiled his strategy. Philips said he took inspiration from long-term Vietnam prisoner of war Jim Stockdale who survived years in a detention camp because he realised: \"You have to retain faith that in the end you will prevail while the whole time confronting the most brutal reality of the state you are in. Retailers need to face that brutal reality. \"You have got to be in the game on price. If you are not, customers will just leave you. It is not about being a discounter it's about getting to a level where customers will reappraise you.\" He said that France's Carrefour had shown that fighting back against discounters was possible as it had seen its market share grow after cutting prices. In the face of massive structural change in the UK market, Philips said Sainsbury's decision to form a joint venture to bring Danish discounter Netto back to the UK was a smart move. \"It's a recognition of the structural shifts in the market and a channel growing so quickly that you have got be a part of it,\" he said. But he suggested that a joint venture could be a challenge as it depended on the record of the partner.",

      "bodyText": "Glencore has appointed a female director after years of political pressure, ending its status as the last bastion of all-male boards in the FTSE 100. Patrice Merrin, a Canadian former mining executive, has joined the mining and commodities trader as an independent non-executive director. Lord Davies, the former trade minister, set a target in 2011 for 25% female representation at FTSE 100 companies by next year. At the time, 21 of Britain's top public companies had all-male boards but by March this year Glencore was the last. Vince Cable, the business secretary, criticised Glencore last month for its persistent failure to appoint a female director. He said he would demand a meeting with the company's chairman, former BP boss Tony Hayward after already discussing the subject with Glencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg. At Glencore's annual meeting a month ago, Hayward said the company wanted to appoint a female director by the end of this year. Cable said Glencore had three years to find a suitable woman to join the board. Announcing Merrin's arrival, Hayward said: \"On behalf of the board I am delighted to announce the appointment of Patrice Merrin. Patrice's in-depth experience of operating across the resources sector will help strengthen the board's ability to work with the opportunities and challenges presented by the global extractive industry. Her record of non-executive director appointments, activist involvement and industry advisory board service is also an excellent complementary skill set to our board. \" Merrin, 64, worked at the mining group Sherritt for 10 years and rose to be chief operating officer before leaving in 2004. She then spent two years at Luscar, Canada's biggest thermal coal producer, which she ran as chief executive for a year. She became a director of another Canadian miner, Stillwater, when an activist investor forced the company to revamp its board. Davies made his recommendations after the financial crisis highlighted a lack of dissenting voices in boardrooms, which are made up largely of white, middle-class businessmen. Studies have shown that companies with female board members pay more attention to risk and are more financially successful.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dixons Retail has detected long-awaited stirrings of a recovery in consumer spending as World Cup television sales helped it get off to a good start in the current financial year. For the year to 30 April, Dixons disclosed profit before tax, excluding one-off items and discontinued businesses, up 10% to \u00a3166m. Sales at stores open a year or more rose 3% to \u00a3228m. Sebastian James, the Dixons chief executive, said the group was in a strong financial position as it prepared for its agreed merger with Carphone Warehouse. The first two months of the current financial year continued Dixons's encouraging performance from the previous year, he added. \"The new financial year has started well, with an uplift in TV sales driven by the World Cup, but we also believe we are seeing the early glimmers of a consumer recovery. \"On this there is no certainty just yet, but what we know for sure is that if we maintain a tight rein on costs, our pricing sharp \u2013 against all comers \u2013 and our service levels high, customers will continue to choose us over others.\" Strong growth in the wider economy has not yet flowed through consistently to the high street. Though the sector is past the dark days of the recession, when household names such as Woolworths failed, many retailers have reported weak sales suppressed by lack of consumer spending power after years of falling real wages. After reporting strong Christmas sales in January, James was more gloomy. He warned that any consumer recovery was fledgling and that trading would remain tough. Carphone Warehouse reassured investors with full-year earnings in line with forecasts, saying its weakness in its dealer business was balanced by strong demand for 4G contracts. The group, which sold Virgin Mobile France in May, reported earnings excluding interest and tax of \u00a3151m, up from \u00a3132m, and in the middle of its predicted range of \u00a3145m of \u00a3155m. It said the Dixons merger was progressing well, with the deal already approved by European regulators and a shareholder prospectus due to be published on Thursday. Andrew Harrison, the chief executive, said: \"The history of Carphone Warehouse has been one of anticipating change and positioning the business to take advantage of this change. Looking ahead, the shifts we see in the marketplace offer considerable opportunities to create value \u2026 From a position of strength, we are planning to take greater advantage of these developments through our proposed merger with Dixons Retail plc.\" Revenues fell 2% to \u00a33.28bn during 2014, owing to difficulties at its dealers operation, which sells phones to businesses through independent traders. Weakness in Germany and Portugal led to a net 36 store closures, and the company ended the year with 2,024 outlets. Carphone opened 33 Samsung stores in seven countries, under a deal to operate standalone outlets for the South Korean manufacturer. The company said it grew share in contract phone sales, as European operators switched on their 4G services and customers sought its advice for super-fast mobile. \"We were encouraged by customer take-up of 4G services as network infrastructure was rolled out more widely across the UK market during the year,\" Carphone said. \"The significantly improved network quality and download speeds have encouraged customers to take richer data packages, which in turn drive increases in monthly line rental.\"",

      "bodyText": "Barclays is facing a fresh blow to its reputation after receiving a lawsuit over its \"dark pool\", the specialist trading system publicised by the author Michael Lewis in his latest book about Wall Street. In the latest setback for the bank as it battles to restore its reputation following the Libor-rigging scandal, the New York attorney general accused Barclays of misrepresenting the safety of its dark pool, a trading system under which trades can be conducted in private. Eric Schneiderman accused Barclays of \"a systematic pattern of fraud and deceit\" by operating its dark pool to favour high-frequency traders \u2013 firms that use complex computer systems to buy and sell huge volumes of stocks in milliseconds to take advantage of often tiny movements in share prices. Schneiderman is conducting a sweeping investigation into these trading systems at a time when some experts calculate high-frequency trading accounts for the majority of US stock market trading. Scrutiny of the practice intensified following the March release of Lewis's book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt, which argues that high-frequency traders have rigged the stock market by taking advantage of systems unavailable to others. Dark pools are a type of private market through which investors can deal without revealing their identities. Barclays' dark pool, LX, is one of the biggest.

Schneiderman alleged Barclays operated its dark pool to favour high-frequency traders and gave them systematic advantages over others trading in the pool in order to attract them. He said the investigation was aided \"significantly\" by a number of former Barclays employees.
