      "bodyText": "Reckless company directors may have to compensate victims of their failed business dealings under new measures being brought forward by Vince Cable, the business secretary. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said Cable was \"taking aim at dodgy directors\" by bringing in tougher penalties, with some of the worst offences recently seen in scam wine investment, landbanking and carbon credit schemes that targeted elderly people. Under the new measures, there would be greater freedom for courts to ban those with fraud convictions overseas from setting up in Britain, which could have prevented the Italian businessman Massimo Cellino from becoming a director of Leeds United Football Club. Courts would also have the power to force directors to compensate those who have lost out because of misconduct or serious failures in a business. The government would be able to intervene and request such action against a miscreant director but the final decision would be with a judge. Judges in such cases would also have a duty to take past misdemeanours into account when deciding whether to disqualify a director, including previous business failures, the nature of any losses, overseas conduct and breaches of specific laws. However, the government appears to have watered down its plans from original proposals to make sure directors were automatically disqualified after overseeing a certain number of failed businesses in a \"three strikes and you're out\" system. The new measures are likely to be brought forward as draft legislation as part of the Queen's speech next month, which sets out the government's legislative programme for the next session of parliament. \"Some people have suffered unnecessary losses as a result of rogue behaviour,\" said Cable. \"These measures will protect the British economy and our reputation as a good and fair place to do business by banning directors who have already been convicted of offences overseas from running British companies. \"Rogue directors can cause a huge amount of harm in terms of large financial losses, unnecessary redundancies and lifelong investments going down the drain. It is only right that we should put the toughest possible sanctions in place, make sure we stamp out unfair practices and deter those who are looking to act dishonestly.\" The new measures were broadly welcomed by the Institute of Directors, which said: \"The buck stops with the board, and the public rightly expects directors to maintain the highest standards.\" Roger Barker, director of corporate governance at the business group, said: \"Most directors take their role extremely seriously and will not be affected by the measures announced by the government today. However, the growing extent of directors' responsibilities and potential liabilities highlights the need for proper induction and training for those that are assuming significant board roles.\" Matthew Fell, director for competitive markets at the CBI, said: \"These new rules will help ensure that the UK's world-leading company law regime continues to underpin its attractiveness as a place to do business. \"Tackling the damaging behaviour of a small minority of individuals will help to reinforce confidence in the majority of directors who run their businesses well and create jobs and growth throughout the UK.\" The business department said the new laws could have stopped Cellino becoming a director of Leeds United after he won a battle for ownership of the club after successfully appealing against the Football League's decision to block his takeover. Cellino initially failed the league's owners and directors test after being convicted of tax evasion last month in a Sardinian court, but the decision was overturned. He also has two fraud convictions, nearly 13 and 18 years old, which are considered spent in English law. A spokesman for the business department said of the government's proposals: \"Someone like Cellino would be unable to be a director of a company \u2013 regardless of the Football League.\" The number of company director disqualifications in 2010 stood at 1,437 and fell to 1,151 in 2011 and 1,031 in 2012 before an increase to 1,053 in the first three quarters of 2013, figures from the department show.",

In fact, Co-op democracy is an embarrassing sham. Members can only vote for area committee members on the basis of anodyne and very brief personal statements which make no mention of political affiliation and posts already held. Candidates are specifically forbidden to canvass. Area committee members then elect regional board members, and regional board members then elect a large proportion of the national board. This is a system the old GDR would have been proud of.</p> <p>If you track down an area committee member on Twitter you might be able to establish some communication if they happen to be reform-minded. Otherwise, area, regional and national board members are (for the ordinary member) completely uncontactable. This rigged electoral system, lack of transparency and accountability and pathological secretiveness is shameful. Reform is urgently needed if the Co-op is to survive.<br><strong>Ian Healey</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a member of the Co-op I agree with almost all Paul Myners says about the present structure of the management boards. Where I disagree with him is when he says he is not in position to negotiate on reform. As a member of House of Lords he can purpose an act of parliament to regulate the Co-op. There are good precedents for regulating membership and mutual organisations by act of parliament, and with a large group of MPs sitting in the Co-op party interest it should be possible to get a bill though parliament quickly.</p> <p>The only way to cut through the byzantine boards and committees is to go for the big-bang solution \u2013 and I would prefer one proposed by Myners to any alternative advanced by the big banks and the present Tory-dominated government.<br><strong>David Spafford</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 So, Unite the union has waded into the discussion about the future of the Co-operative Group (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/14/co-operative-group-co-op-employees-unite-union-myners-reforms\" title=\"\">End boardroom bickering, say Co-op workers</a>, 15 April). I wonder how Unite members would feel if there was a lively debate within the union on a key policy issue \u2013 the relationship with the Labour party for example \u2013 and an employer was to suggest that they should end this \"public politicking\". Co-operatives are founded on the principle of member control and democracy, one member one vote. Precisely the same governance arrangement as trade unions. It is therefore up to us, the members, to discuss how the crisis in our business is best to be resolved. Lord Myners is absolutely right in pointing out that ordinary members of the Co-operative Group have&#xa0;not had a real say in its affairs. Whether or not his proposed solution is&#xa0;the right one is a matter for discussion.</p> <p>Two hundred years ago the boundary between trade unions and co-operatives was often fluid. Both movements were set up on the principle that unless workers controlled capitalism, then capitalism would control workers.

      "bodyText": "Whether or not a referendum of all members is a good way to decide on Co-op governance reform (My view of the Co-op will protect its values, 14 April), Paul Myners has correctly identified the democratic deficit in the Co-op's structures. In fact, Co-op democracy is an embarrassing sham. Members can only vote for area committee members on the basis of anodyne and very brief personal statements which make no mention of political affiliation and posts already held. Candidates are specifically forbidden to canvass. Area committee members then elect regional board members, and regional board members then elect a large proportion of the national board. This is a system the old GDR would have been proud of. If you track down an area committee member on Twitter you might be able to establish some communication if they happen to be reform-minded. Otherwise, area, regional and national board members are (for the ordinary member) completely uncontactable. This rigged electoral system, lack of transparency and accountability and pathological secretiveness is shameful. Reform is urgently needed if the Co-op is to survive. Ian Healey Brighton \u2022 As a member of the Co-op I agree with almost all Paul Myners says about the present structure of the management boards. Where I disagree with him is when he says he is not in position to negotiate on reform. As a member of House of Lords he can purpose an act of parliament to regulate the Co-op. There are good precedents for regulating membership and mutual organisations by act of parliament, and with a large group of MPs sitting in the Co-op party interest it should be possible to get a bill though parliament quickly. The only way to cut through the byzantine boards and committees is to go for the big-bang solution \u2013 and I would prefer one proposed by Myners to any alternative advanced by the big banks and the present Tory-dominated government. David Spafford Brighton \u2022 So, Unite the union has waded into the discussion about the future of the Co-operative Group (End boardroom bickering, say Co-op workers, 15 April). I wonder how Unite members would feel if there was a lively debate within the union on a key policy issue \u2013 the relationship with the Labour party for example \u2013 and an employer was to suggest that they should end this \"public politicking\". Co-operatives are founded on the principle of member control and democracy, one member one vote. Precisely the same governance arrangement as trade unions. It is therefore up to us, the members, to discuss how the crisis in our business is best to be resolved. Lord Myners is absolutely right in pointing out that ordinary members of the Co-operative Group have not had a real say in its affairs. Whether or not his proposed solution is the right one is a matter for discussion. Two hundred years ago the boundary between trade unions and co-operatives was often fluid. Both movements were set up on the principle that unless workers controlled capitalism, then capitalism would control workers. It's a shame that a trade unionist accepts uncritically the idea that a co-operative should be run in the same way as a plc, and suggests an ignorance of the philosophical basis of co-operative enterprise. It's time for a fresh look at the common history and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 common future of two movements that stand for the principle that profit and greed is not the only basis to run society. Stirling Smith Bolton \u2022 It's not just Lord Myner's proposed Co-op Group reforms that may be rejected by the Co-op Group Board (Report, 14 April) but also Co-op members' proposals for community buy-outs of the group's farms. It is shocking that the group has ditched its co-op values and principles by a distress sale of its farm estate, having ignored invitations from co-operators for community co-op buy-outs of the farms. The sale was only recently announced, and even though Savills have not had time to draw up farm particulars, we understand that bids are needed by the end of May. This means that the Co-op Group is selling off the family silver to wealthy people, hedge funds and speculators, and that the Co-op farm estate will be lost as a commonly owned asset. So, we propose that Ursula Lidbetter, the Co-op Group chair, urgently convene a meeting to discuss how some of the farms can be bought at a fair price by co-operative community buy-outs.
