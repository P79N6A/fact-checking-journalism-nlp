      "bodyText": "The latest wages growth data released by the bureau of statistics on Wednesday has provided good news for the government. Wages are now growing faster than they have for three years and the news is generally good across all industries. We are finally seeing real wages increasing, albeit at a much slower rate than in the past. After four-and-a-half years of slowing wages growth, we now finally seem to be back in a more regular scenario in which growth is mostly increasing \u2013 from an annual low in March 2017 of 1.9%, the latest growth is up to 2.2% in trend terms and 2.3% seasonally adjusted: The private sector has seen a definite improvement in wages growth. Throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017 private-sector wages never grew by more than 0.5% in any quarter; now we have had three quarters in a row with growth above that level. But that of course is a pretty low bar to get over \u2013 before 2015 there had only ever been one quarter in which private-sector wages had grown below 0.5% and that happened during the global financial crisis. So yes, things are better, but we\u2019re not quite at \u201cgood times are here again\u201d levels. The good news is that the wages growth is quite widespread. Across the economy, only the industries of arts and recreation, and information media and telecommunications, have slower annual growth now than they did a year ago: The bureau notes that the wage growth is also coming from \u201can increased contribution of jobs covered by each wage-setting method\u201d \u2013 awards, enterprise bargaining agreements and individual agreements compared with September last year. Certainly there has been a good increase in the annual wage growth of enterprise bargaining agreements. EBAs set in the September quarter last year reached an average low annual growth of 2.2%, while those agreed to in the first quarter of this year averaged 2.7%: Interestingly, the biggest driver of the growth is not a jump in large wage rises but rather an increase in the number of wage rise being given. Research by James Bishop, the senior research economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia who is on secondment to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, reveals that the pick-up in the wage price index \u201clargely reflects an increase in the frequency of wage increases, rather than an increase in the average size of the increases\u201d. So there is not suddenly a raft of \u201coh my god, wages breakout!\u201d-style big wage rises, but that more businesses across the nation are once again granting wage rises after a long period of little or no increases. All of this of course has big political implications. The government has for a long time now been struggling to convince voters that the solid economic and employment growth we are experiencing is delivering benefits for households. It also very much impacts on the budget figures which predict strong wages growth \u2013 and thus strong income tax revenue growth over the next three years. The latest figures make those predictions seem less unlikely, but there is still a way to go till we get wages growing at the 2.75% that the May budget predicted would occur by June next year \u2013 let alone the 3.25% growth to occur in the following year: One bit of news that is firmly in the good news/bad news category is that the relationship between wages growth and unemployment does appear to be back in sync. As the unemployment rate falls, wages growth is expected to increase \u2013 something that did not happen through 2015 and 2016 but which has been happening for more than 18 months now. But the problem is there appears to have been a dramatic shift such that unemployment rates now are associated with much lower wages growth than in the past. From 1998 to 2012, an unemployment rate of the current level of 5.2% would have been expected to deliver wages growth of around 3.8% \u2013 well below the current 2.2% trend rate: It appears now that the better relationship is between that of underemployment and wages growth. The current underemployment rate of 8.3% is delivering the level of wages growth that would be expected over the past 15 years: But it means that for wages growth to return to the 3.5% level that the Reserve Bank considers a neutral rate \u2013 and which should deliver on average 1% real wages growth \u2013 we need underemployment to fall still further to 7.0%, a level it has not been since the end of 2012. But at least real wages are increasing. After an unprecedented five-year period of flat wages growth, finally we are seeing some signs of life: The 2.2% annual wages growth is above the core inflation growth of 1.8% as well as the consumer price index growth of 1.9%. It means that real wages grew in the past year faster than they have since 2013: But the level of growth remains utterly pathetic compared with previous years \u2013 we have not seen real wages grow in a year by more than 1% now for six years, something that would have once been unthinkable outside of a recession. The wages figures are good news \u2013 finally wages are going up consistently and most industries are experiencing the improvement. Should this translate into household incomes, the government will at least have a chance to argue that people are better off now than they were five years ago when it took office. But there remain ongoing concerns that unless we are able to significantly reduce underemployment, we will continue to have much lower wages growth than in the past, even if unemployment falls to historically low levels.",

Defeat duly arrived on Wednesday as the government capitulated and said, yes, maximum stakes will be reduced to \u00a32 from next April, rather than the October 2019 date announced by chancellor Philip Hammond in the budget. What on earth possessed Hammond to try to delay reform? In doing so, he ignored the recommendation in the gambling review that the \u00a32 limit should be adopted within nine to 12 months. That document was published in May, leaving April 2019 \u2013 the start of a new financial year \u2013 as a natural date for introduction. Hammond\u2019s choice of next October carried no rhyme or reason. This, remember, is a policy designed to reduce harm caused by gambling addiction. If a government is convinced it needs to act, surely it would wish to do so as soon as possible. The thin official explanation from culture minister, Jeremy Wright, was that a responsible Treasury should \u201ctake the needs of those employed by the gambling industry into account\u201d. But as an economic argument, it\u2019s miserable. Any job losses in the bookmaking industry should be offset by job gains elsewhere if punters spend more on food, clothes, eating out and so on, as Larry Elliott argued on these pages recently. As for giving the bookies time to adapt, an 11-month warning of change was enough. These businesses can move quickly: look at the speed at which William Hill is building its US operations since liberalisation of the rules there. There wasn\u2019t even an argument for delay based on the impact on the Treasury\u2019s revenues since Hammond had ensured reform will be tax-neutral by lifting duties on online casinos from 15% to 21%. That change will now also happen next April. The suspicion is that the Treasury was simply nobbled by bookies\u2019 lobbyists. If so, it\u2019s depressing \u2013 and, actually, also surprising. In the boardrooms, they\u2019d moved on. The battle over stakes had already been lost. The plea for a six-month delay to October was a try-on that few seriously thought would succeed. Hammond\u2019s stance has been baffling. There was no advantage for him in delaying reform \u2013 just the risk of an embarrassing U-turn that he has now had to perform. A shocking misjudgment. Power companies lead a merry dance over price cap SSE is sticking to its story, even if the outside world thinks one explanation for the delay in the intended merger of its retail business with that of npower is far-fetched. Yes, the energy giant is still banging on about the government\u2019s energy price cap, as if this measure had appeared from a clear sky. Ofgem\u2019s default tariff cap is \u201ccomplex\u201d, says SSE, before grumbling that the energy regulator only took its final decisions on 6 November. Well, yes, it did \u2013 but those decisions surprised nobody. The Ofgem figure of \u00a31,137 for the initial cap on an average dual-fuel rate differed from the September estimate by approximately \u00a31. The would-be merger partners\u2019 models should have been able to cope. It seems more likely that SSE and npower have been thrown into confusion because their retail businesses continue to haemorrhage customers. SSE lost 460,000 customers in the 12 months to September, which was a sharp fall but not as severe as the decline in npower\u2019s persistently loss-making operation. \u201cThere is now some uncertainty as to whether this transaction can be completed as originally intended,\u201d says SSE. If chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies simply means he\u2019s demanding better terms from npower\u2019s owner, he should spit it out and spare us the elaborate dance. Intu is entitled to turn down entreaties by Mike Ashley Mike Ashley, as he announced the closure of four House of Fraser (HoF) stores in Intu\u2019s shopping centres, urged other institutional landlords to be \u201cmore proactive\u201d to help save HoF outlets in their schemes. Why should they be? If it is correct that Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct was proposing to pay close to zero rent, Intu is within its rights to refuse his offer. The property firm has always claimed the demise of BHS was not as damaging for its business as feared because it was able to sign new tenants. It may be exaggerating. It may also be optimistic in thinking it can repeat the trick with the space HoF will vacate. But it is entitled to try its luck. Intu is running a commercial operation \u2013 not a charity for Ashley\u2019s benefit.",

SSE lost 460,000 customers in the 12 months to September, which was a sharp fall but not as severe as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/13/troubled-npower-sheds-500000-customer-accounts-in-2018\">the decline in npower\u2019s persistently loss-making operation</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is now some uncertainty as to whether this transaction can be completed as originally intended,\u201d says SSE.

Why should they be? If it is correct that Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct was proposing to pay close to zero rent, Intu is within its rights to refuse his offer.</p> <p>The property firm has always claimed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/23/all-bhs-stores-to-shut-down-by-20-august\">demise of B</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/23/all-bhs-stores-to-shut-down-by-20-august\">HS</a> was not as damaging for its business as feared because it was able to sign new tenants. It may be exaggerating. It may also be optimistic in thinking it can repeat the trick with the space HoF will vacate. But it is entitled to try its luck. Intu is running a commercial operation \u2013 not a charity for Ashley\u2019s benefit.</p>",

The Washington-based organisation said there would be a jump in consumer spending and business investment following a deal that secured frictionless trade with the European Union, lifting the UK\u2019s growth rate beyond the 1.5% it expects for 2019. In a report on the outlook for the British economy, the IMF also backed up the chancellor\u2019s claim that the failure of MPs to agree a deal would bring forward much of the financial pain of leaving the EU. IMF officials said they had not worked out the direct impact of Brexit in their most recent analysis, but it was clear that a hard Brexit without a deal would harm the UK economy. \u201cA disruptive departure without an implementation period could have serious negative economic consequences,\u201d it said in its annual health check. \u201cWhile all likely Brexit outcomes will entail costs for the UK economy by departing from the frictionless single market that now prevails, an agreement that minimises the introduction of new tariff and non-tariff barriers would best protect growth and incomes in the UK and EU. \u201cClose cooperation and coordination with the EU to prevent disruptions and mitigate risks will be important to achieve a smooth transition,\u201d it said. In his budget last month, Hammond said the economy would get a double boost from a Chequers-style deal that almost replicated the current trade arrangements for goods across the EU. He said the outlook for growth would improve, generating higher business profits and wages that in turn would boost tax receipts, giving the government greater leeway to increase public spending and cut taxes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Debenhams shares plunged by more than a fifth on Wednesday amid fears for its financial health, as a grim year for some of the high street\u2019s best-known names threatened to get even worse. The 240-year-old department store chain was valued at just \u00a365m by the end of the day, after its shares fell by 21% amid reports that it was now being shunned by suppliers. It was the biggest one-day fall recorded by the retailer for more than a decade. The sharp decline also came after very poor weekly sales figures released by John Lewis on Tuesday. The rival department store chain said fashion and home sales collapsed by more than 11% on 2017 levels last week. Last month Debenhams revealed plans to shut up to 50 stores and wrote off the value of its brand and the cost of unwanted shop leases and IT systems \u2013 resulting in a \u00a3500m loss. The shares lost more than 21% \u2013 closing at just 5.27p \u2013 on reports that some of its suppliers have turned against the company. Twelve months ago the shares were changing hands at 40p and five years ago they were more than 100p. Two London-based suppliers have cut ties with Debenhams while another has reduced the amount of business it does with the chain, according to fashion trade magazine Drapers. Their decision was reportedly triggered by a decision made by credit insurers to reduce the protection they provide for suppliers to cover their costs in the event that Debenhams goes bust and is unable to pay them. Reducing the amount of cover available to Debenhams suppliers indicates that the credit insurers, which have extensive experience of the retail market, believe the chain is at risk. The move comes just weeks after credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded its long-term outlook for Debenhams and increased its \u201cprobability of default\u201d rating, which assesses how likely it is that the company will be unable to pay some or all of its debts. \u201cThey owed us so much money at any one time, we decided it was too risky,\u201d one supplier told Drapers. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it. I know other suppliers are nervous about going forward with Debenhams, [and] we were in the same boat. It could be a disaster for them.\u201d Another supplier said they had become more cautious recently after taking a financial hit on the administration of Debenhams\u2019 fellow department store House of Fraser. Debenhams did not deny the reports, but a spokesman said: \u201cMany suppliers don\u2019t use credit insurance. Those that have used it historically are well aware of the current situation and work with retailers to manage things accordingly. Debenhams is well stocked for Christmas.\u201d Several household name businesses have run into severe financial difficulty or collapsed altogether so far this year, at a cost of 85,000 jobs, amid torrid conditions caused by factors such as business rates, rising wage costs and online competition. Toys R Us, electricals firm Maplins and Poundworld all collapsed into administration earlier this year, while Evans Cycles and House of Fraser were bought out of administration by Sports Direct, putting jobs at risk. Other firms have taken emergency measures to avert failure, such as shutting loss-making stores via a company voluntary arrangement, which typically also involves landlords reluctantly accepting lower rents. Mothercare, Homebase and New Look have opted for CVAs, contributing to one of the worst periods in living memory for the high street.",

    "webTitle": "Flybe \u2013 buffeted by fuel prices and weak pound \u2013 goes up for sale", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The budget airline Flybe has put itself up for sale as a cocktail of rising fuel prices, the weaker pound and lower demand weigh on profits. Stobart Group and easyJet are among the contenders for all or part of Flybe\u2019s business, after the Exeter-based airline said it is in discussions with a number of strategic operators about a potential sale of the company, in a statement to the stock market. Flybe\u2019s announcement follows a warning last month that profits for the year would be significantly lower than investors expected because of a softening in the market \u2013 in part because of uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. The weaker performance prompted a review of measures to cut costs and reduce the number of flights it makes, although on Wednesday it said further action may be necessary. Flybe has appointed an investment bank, Evercore, to help to find a buyer, although it gave no indication of when or if a deal should be expected, or the identity of possible buyers. Stobart Group, the infrastructure firm, already has a franchise agreement with Flybe, and walked away from a bid for the airline in March. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment. EasyJet, the larger UK budget airline, has recently shown an appetite for acquisitions, after expressing interest in parts of troubled Italian carrier Alitalia, although it is understood it would be unlikely to bid for the entirety of Flybe\u2019s operations. An easyJet spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that we will play a role in consolidation where it makes sense. We evaluate all opportunities as they arise and have no further comment to make.\u201d Christine Ourmi\u00e8res-Widener, Flybe\u2019s chief executive, said the airline has a \u201cstrategy in place that is working\u201d but is suffering from \u201cexternal headwinds\u201d. A sale is one of multiple options being explored. \u201cWe will look at the performance of each route,\u201d the chief executive said, adding that reductions in the number of flights is also a possibility as the airline attempts to decrease its fleet size from 78 to 70. The airline is prepared to move quickly to adjust its schedule if required, she added. Redundancies were not planned because the airline will rely on natural attrition of staff numbers, she said. Union bosses expressed concerns about the airline\u2019s plans. Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said the announcement was unsettling for workers. \u201cOur first priority will be to remove the uncertainty facing our members by seeking assurances on jobs, pay and terms and conditions from both Flybe and any potential new owners,\u201d he said. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association, said the announcement was \u201ca bolt out of the blue\u201d for its members. He added that Flybe is \u201cfundamentally a sound airline\u201d. The union will closely scrutinise any sale, but could take \u201cother steps in order to protect our members\u2019 interests\u201d. Shares in Flybe surged by as much as 40% as trading opened on Wednesday, but eventually slumped to a loss of 3.4%. This values the business at \u00a324m, down from more than \u00a3100m in March.

The weaker performance prompted a review of measures to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/17/flybe-profits-warning-wipes-40-off-regional-airlines-value\">cut costs and reduce the number of flights</a> it makes, although on Wednesday it said further action may be necessary.</p> <p>Flybe has appointed an investment bank, Evercore, to help to find a buyer, although it gave no indication of when or if a deal should be expected, or the identity of possible buyers.</p> <p>Stobart Group, the infrastructure firm, already has a franchise agreement with Flybe, and walked away from a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55124f90-2da1-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381\">bid for the airline in March</a>. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.</p> <p>EasyJet, the larger UK budget airline, has recently shown an appetite for acquisitions, after expressing interest in parts of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9045212-dd38-11e8-9f04-38d397e6661c\">troubled Italian carrier Alitalia</a>, although it is understood it would be unlikely to bid for the entirety of Flybe\u2019s operations.</p> <p>An easyJet spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that we will play a role in consolidation where it makes sense. We evaluate all opportunities as they arise and have no further comment to make.\u201d</p> <p>Christine Ourmi\u00e8res-Widener, Flybe\u2019s chief executive, said the airline has a \u201cstrategy in place that is working\u201d but is suffering from \u201cexternal headwinds\u201d. A sale is one of multiple options being explored.</p> <p>\u201cWe will look at the performance of each route,\u201d the chief executive said, adding that reductions in the number of flights is also a possibility as the airline attempts to decrease its fleet size from 78 to 70. The airline is prepared to move quickly to adjust its schedule if required, she added.</p> <p>Redundancies were not planned because the airline will rely on natural attrition of staff numbers, she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77e8b570acba62ba195f1c964aa4c4217bbd0b7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e8b570acba62ba195f1c964aa4c4217bbd0b7a/0_563_3856_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Ourmi\u00e8res-Widener\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Ourmi\u00e8res-Widener says Flybe has a strategy in place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Moore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Union bosses expressed concerns about the airline\u2019s plans.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The convicted former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli has been deported from the UK to Ghana, his country of birth, after Home Office officials put him on a flight from Heathrow airport on Wednesday afternoon. Adoboli, who was arrested in Glasgow on Monday when he went to report to the Home Office, was taken to Harmondsworth immigration removal centre on Monday. He was not informed about when and how he would be deported but on Wednesday afternoon he was taken by five escorts to Heathrow airport and was due to be put on a flight at about 5pm to be returned to Ghana, where he has not lived since the age of four. The deportation comes after a long battle by Adoboli, his lawyers and a large and diverse group of supporters, to try to keep him in the UK. Speaking to the Guardian on his way to the airport Adoboli, 38, vowed to continue his fight from Ghana to be allowed to live in the UK. He has called on the Home Office to implement a key recommendation in a report this summer from Stephen Shaw that foreign national offenders who have lived in the UK since childhood should not be deported. Adoboli came to the UK at the age of 12 and attended school and university here. \u201cThis Home Office policy to deport people who have been here since childhood is destroying the fabric of our society,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many people are saying that this policy is too draconian. Even City commentators are saying that.\u201d Adoboli has received unprecedented levels of support from 138 MPs and MSPs. Celebrities including the actor Naomie Harris and broadcaster June Sarpong, trade unionists including Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, and Dave Prentice, the general secretary of Unison, as well as academics and business leaders have signed open letters to the home secretary calling for Adoboli to be allowed to remain in the UK. But in a letter to Adoboli\u2019s MP, Hannah Bardell, on Wednesday, Sajid Javid said that the Home Office had considered the individual circumstances of his case and decided that it did not meet any of the exceptions specified in legislation that could lead to halting the deportation and that the Home Office\u2019s decision had been upheld by the courts. In his letter, Javid said: \u201cThe public expects robust action to be taken against foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crime.\u201d Adoboli, 38, lost his most recent legal challenge when he sought permission in the immigration court for a judicial review of the refusal of his latest application to remain in the UK. This was not granted. Adoboli was jailed for seven years in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud that cost UBS $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn). He was released after serving half his sentence. Adoboli\u2019s legal team argued that after he served his sentence for banking fraud, he had dedicated himself to public speaking and hosting workshops about improving probity in the finance sector, and warning people against making the kind of errors he did while working for UBS. He has been working with the Forward Institute, which promotes responsible leadership in business and society. Adoboli\u2019s lawyer, Jacqueline McKenzie, of McKenzie Beute &amp; Pope , said: \u201cThe home secretary should recognise that he has a discretion to look at a case again even though a deportation order has been made. He chose to maintain his position so the ongoing merits of deportation could not be scrutinised by an independent judge. He should recognise this rather than hiding behind the intention of parliament to deport foreign nationals or claiming justification in the public interest.\u201d",

The merger, agreed in November 2017, was intended to create the second largest retail energy supply company in the UK, behind British Gas, but the companies will now miss a deadline for its completion by April next year as they discuss new terms. In a statement on Wednesday accompanying its half-year results, SSE said: \u201cThere is now some uncertainty as to whether this transaction can be completed, as originally contemplated.\u201d The deal was approved by competition regulators in August, but intense competition has added to the worries facing the two companies, undermining the case for shareholders to back the move. There are 70 energy suppliers competing for UK customers and 4.3 million switched electricity provider in the first 10 months of 2018, according to Energy UK statistics. SSE said that customer numbers in the retail arm had fallen by 460,000 in the year to September, to 6.48 million. Innogy, the German owner of npower, said customers numbers fell by 530,000, to 4.3 million, in the equivalent period. The big six energy companies\u2019 troubles deepened this month when Ofgem, the energy regulator, said that prices would be limited to \u00a31,137 a year for the typical British customer, forcing the big suppliers to adjust their default tariffs. Innogy and SSE are now discussing \u201cpotential changes to the commercial terms of the planned transaction\u201d. An update is expected by the middle of December. SSE said its board believes \u201cthe best future\u201d for the retail operations \u201cwill continue to lie outside the SSE group\u201d. Losses at SSE\u2019s retail energy arm, SSE Energy Services, were almost nine times greater than the same period last year in the six months to the end of September. SSE Energy Services lost \u00a362.1m in total, while profit margins for the new company in the current financial year are expected to be less than half those achieved in the year to March 2018.",

      "bodyText": "Fears for the health of the eurozone economy have intensified after Germany, the single currency\u2019s powerhouse, suffered its first contraction in more than three years. Tough emission tests affecting the country\u2019s strategically important automotive industry, lower consumer spending, and weaker exports triggered by rising global protectionism resulted in the economy shrinking by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2018. Germany\u2019s first period of falling output since the first three months of 2015, and its worst performance since early 2013, helped drag eurozone growth from 0.6% to 0.2% in the three months ending in September, highlighting the vulnerability of the eurozone to a disorderly Brexit. The contraction followed growth of of 0.5% in the second quarter, and financial markets expect a bounce-back in Germany in the final three months of 2018 as bottlenecks in car plants during the summer come to an end. The consultancy firm Oxford Economics said the 8% fall in car production in the third quarter rippled through the motor industry\u2019s supply chains and cut growth by 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter. Germany has posted average quarterly growth of 0.5% in recent years, and had that trend continued, eurozone GDP in the third quarter would have been 0.4% rather than 0.2%. Destatis, Germany\u2019s statistics office, said the country\u2019s foreign trade position had deteriorated, with exports falling and imports rising. It added that there were mixed signals for domestic demand, with German households spending less but firms investing more in machinery, equipment and construction. Government spending was also slightly higher in the third quarter. The trade weakness was partly caused by temporary factors, including disruption to car production before new and more rigorous emissions tests that came into force in September. Goods exports make up 40% of German gross domestic product \u2013 a much bigger proportion than for the next two biggest eurozone economies, France and Italy \u2013 making the country particularly vulnerable to the tit-for-tat tariff war between the US and China. Economists warned there were some worrying structural developments in Germany. Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist based in Germany for the Dutch bank ING, said the worst economic performance since the beginning of 2013 was another wake-up call for the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. He said: \u201cProblems with the emission norms created severe production problems in the automotive industry, higher energy prices completely erased previous wage increases and also do not underestimate the negative confidence effect from the World Cup. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare to predict the performance of the national football team but at least the automotive sector should rebound in the coming months and somewhat lower energy prices should revamp private consumption. However, the poor export performance, despite a weak euro exchange rate, suggests that trade tensions and weaknesses in emerging markets could continue to weigh on Germany\u2019s growth performance.\u201d Annual growth in Germany was 1.1% in the third quarter, weaker than the 1.3% predicted by economists and sharply lower than the 2% annual growth rate in the second quarter. The slowdown came amid signs that the boost to growth provided to the eurozone economy by the European Central Bank has become less potent. Ultra-low interest rates and the money-creation process known as quantitative easing have combined since early 2015 to stimulate activity and reduce unemployment. Jennifer McKeown, the chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggested the German economy was on track for growth of 1.5% in 2018, weaker than the research consultancy\u2019s previous forecast of 1.8%. She added: \u201cWe still expect a healthy expansion of about 1.8% in 2019 but there are clear downside risks relating particularly to the situation in Italy. And for now at least, the contraction in German GDP coupled with the Italian government\u2019s refusal to revise its budget plans will add to downward pressure on the euro exchange rate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "UK bridal chain Berketex Bride has collapsed into administration leaving customers thousands of pounds out of pocket and without a wedding dress in the latest retail failure. The Grantham-headquartered chain said it had closed its doors on Tuesday and would not be reopening, affecting about 300 people who had placed orders. The firm, which has sold wedding dresses and other bridal wear for more than 50 years, had 15 stores nationwide, including concessions in Debenhams. Locations include Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Newcastle, Chester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Leicester, Bristol, Croydon, London\u2019s West End, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin. Berketex, which employed about 80 people and had annual sales of \u00a31.5m, has appointed insolvency firm Wilson Field to manage the process. A spokesman for Wilson Field said the firm had faced mounting cash problems. \u201cThis is another example of the hard time retailers are experiencing \u2013 and how companies are needing to react to the demands of different shopping habits and online retail,\u201d he said. A Facebook post offered no information on whether customers who had placed orders would receive a refund.

      "bodyText": "Four more House of Fraser department stores are to close down after Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct failed to agree a new, lower rent deal with the stores\u2019 landlord. The stores, in Nottingham, Norwich, Gateshead\u2019s Metrocentre and the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex, all belong to the property business Intu. The new closures, which will cease trading in the new year, are likely to lead to hundreds of job losses. In a statement, Ashley said: \u201c We had multiple meetings with Intu but we were no further forward after 14 weeks. Unfortunately, these stores now face closing in the new year.\u201d In a direct criticism of Intu, Ashley added: \u201cI urge other institutional landlords to be more proactive to help save the HoF stores in their schemes.\u201d The Sports Direct billionaire, who swooped on House of Fraser in August when it collapsed into administration, has been trying to negotiate rent cuts for the stores. In September, when he announced the closure of the Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon stores, he blamed \u201cgreedy\u201d landlords, who refused to be \u201creasonable\u201d, for the shutdowns. The tycoon has warned that time is running out for rent deals to be arranged. In October two other closures were also announced, in Exeter and Shrewsbury. Kendals in Manchester is also to close, along with House of Fraser stores in Cirencester and Chichester. Intu is the subject of a bid from a group of investors to take the business private. On Wednesday morning the company said it had given the bidder, led by Intu\u2019s deputy chairman John Whittaker with backing from Saudi and US investors, extra time to make a firm offer. Intu owns 14 shopping centres, including Eldon Square in Newcastle, the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Merry Hill, near Dudley. A spokesman for Intu said Ashley had informed the company he was shutting down the stores on Wednesday morning: \u201cWe have been advised this morning that the four House of Fraser stores in our portfolio will be closing in early 2019.\u201d The spokesman added: \u201cWe have had numerous meetings with Sports Direct, including at the highest level, to try to agree terms. While we cannot discuss the detail, we have been unable to reach agreement.\u201d Intu said the closures represent about \u00a34.3m of its rental income and 526,000 sq ft of retail space and said it was \u201centhusiastic about the opportunity to re-engineer and re-let this underperforming space to new and exciting alternatives.\u201d The Intu statement acknowledged that finding tenants for big spaces is an uphill task, as so many major retailers are closing space. Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer are both closing shops. Intu said it might consider \u201cnon-traditional shopping centre uses\u201d. When House of Fraser went into administration it had 59 stores and nearly 16,000 staff, either directly employed or working at in-store concessions. When Ashley bought the business from the administrators he paid \u00a390m and said he hoped to keep 47 outlets open, turning them into \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d. There are currently 22 House of Fraser stores that have been saved from closure, saving an estimated 3,500 jobs. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 November 2018. An earlier version placed the Metrocentre in Newcastle, rather than Gateshead.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation was unchanged at 2.4% in October after a rise in the cost of petrol and utility bills was offset by falling food prices. City economists had predicted an increase to 2.5% but a price war on the high street, especially among food retailers, drove down the cost of the weekly shop and held back consumer inflation. The Office for National Statistics said transport costs \u2013 particularly fuel \u2013 were the biggest factor pushing up the cost of living. Gas and electricity prices, which tend to track the cost of crude oil, also rose in October compared with the previous month. Analysts said the pause in the downward path of the consumer prices index (CPI) reflected the ups and downs of the pound over the past year as traders waited for the outcome of Brexit talks. A further fall in the pound would increase the cost of imports and push inflation back towards highs seen in 2017, when the November figure reached 3.1%. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cBrexit is still the elephant in the room when it comes to the future path of inflation, and consequently of monetary policy. \u201cThat\u2019s because the pound now waxes and wanes with the Brexit negotiations and that has a big impact on how much UK consumers pay for imported goods. \u201cWhat the market sees as a positive Brexit deal will deliver a higher pound and lower inflation.\u201d Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a fall in food inflation to 0.9% in October from 1.5% in September was a surprise and was unlikely to continue into November. \u201cNonetheless, CPI inflation should remain on a downward trend over the coming months, reaching 2.0% at some point in the first quarter of 2019 because retailers have largely finished passing on higher import prices to consumers,\u201d he said. He said utility bills went up on average after the rise in prices by two large energy suppliers and the government increased its safeguard tariff, which applies to 5m households who have prepayment meters or receive the warm home discount. However, a cap on bills and falls in crude oil prices, which have pushed down the cost of Brent crude from $80 to $65 in only a month, should start to have an effect, he added. The TUC said inflation was still eating up most of the nation\u2019s pay rises after figures for September showed wages increasing at 3.1% on a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "Iceland is to unleash a life-size animatronic orangutan on the streets of the UK after its Christmas advert highlighting the impact of palm oil production was banned for breaching political advertising rules. The supermarket chain has turned to special effects technology befitting Hollywood to create an ultra-realistic robotic orangutan for a stunt to raise awareness of the plight facing the species from deforestation of its habitat for palm oil production. The orangutan, created by a team who have worked on films and TV shows including Doctor Who and Sherlock, will first appear clinging to a Christmas tree in Coin Street, south London, before moving to other locations, including Oxford Street and several parks in the capital. It will then appear at a number of Iceland stores around the country, including Manchester and Birmingham, apparently \u201csearching for a new home\u201d. The replica orangutan is controlled remotely and by a specialist puppeteer who has studied the ape\u2019s movements. Last week, Iceland\u2019s rebadging of an animated short film was rejected by Clearcast, the body that vets adverts, for breaching rules banning political advertising in the 2003 Communications Act. The ban prompted a public outcry, with stars including James Corden, Anna Friel and Paloma Faith supporting a campaign to allow it to be aired on TV. It has also drawn political attention, with the MP Michael Gove tweeting to praise Iceland for raising awareness. More than 12 million people have watched the ad on Facebook, where UK broadcast TV regulations do not apply. An online petition on Change.org calling for the ad to be allowed to air has drawn almost 750,000 supporters. \u201cOur stranded, distressed orangutan is a stark and potent symbol of the effects of deforestation,\u201d said Richard Walker, Iceland\u2019s managing director. \u201cWe are determined to be at the forefront of efforts to guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction and Iceland will continue to be a driving force until this environmental impact is drastically reduced.\u201d Iceland has been accused of deliberately planning an ad that would be controversial and perhaps be banned, a relatively common tactic among advertisers seeking to get more bang for their marketing buck through free publicity. Iceland has denied this, saying it had booked \u00a3500,000 of media space on TV for the ad campaign, although this is not a significant TV budget for a major retailer. The retailer has an extensive range of palm oil-free products that it is seeking to promote across the festive season. Iceland will still be placing TV ads but only 10-second clips that will highlight palm oil-free products. To its credit, Iceland has put ethics surrounding this issue at the heart of the chain. Earlier this year it became the first major UK supermarket to pledge to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods. \u201cWe always try to give people a real choice about what they buy and this was a key driver of our decision to allow Iceland customers to join us in saying \u2018no to palm oil,\u2019\u201d Walker said. \u201cI am immensely proud of the work our food development team has carried out to create this new Christmas range without palm oil \u2013 a celebration of our commitment to end its use before the year closes.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola has scaled back its UK Christmas truck tour after opposition from local authorities and fresh demands from health bodies for it to stop handing out free sugary drinks. Usually the tour, which first ran in 1995, is hosted by councils, shopping centres and other landowners as part of their Christmas festivities. This year more than a third fewer visits are planned than last time. The tour kicked off in Glasgow last week and will visit 24 towns and cities, down from 38 last year, making its final stop in London on 16 December. Last year, in response to considerable local opposition coordinated by the Sugar Smart campaign, Public Health England issued guidance to local authorities warning of the impact of such marketing promotions on the prevalence of diet-related issues such as obesity and tooth decay. In the annual stunt, two 14-tonne lorries decorated with thousands of fairy lights and playing the Holidays are Coming jingle tour the UK offering free 150ml cans of Coca-Cola, Zero Sugar and Diet Coke. Public protests against the promotion have taken place in Glasgow, Waltham Forest in London, Plymouth and Bristol. Some cities including Carlisle \u2013 where the council passed a motion not to invite the truck back \u2013 and Liverpool are not participating this year, and in other areas there have been complaints to Coca-Cola and local hosts including Asda and Tesco. Eighty-three organisations and campaigners have signed a letter calling on Coca-Cola to hand out only sugar-free drinks. Coordinated by the food and health charity Sustain, the signatories include the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, World Cancer Research Fund International, the Royal Society for Public Health and 27 local councils. The truck is again visiting areas that have worse-than-average health problems relating to diet, the letter points out. Fourteen of the 19 stops in England have above-average prevalence of excess weight among 10- and 11-years-olds. With fewer appearances on council-owned land, almost half of the truck\u2019s stops this year are on supermarket land, with Asda and Tesco hosting five stops each. Coca-Cola defended its use of the promotional Christmas trucks, which it said had made 397 stops in the UK to date and covered 737,000 miles. In a reply to Sustain, Jon Woods, the general manager of Coca-Cola GB and Ireland, said the company expected 90% of the drinks sampled this year to be zero sugar, and drinks would not be given to children under 12 unless a parent was with them.",

    "webTitle": "IMF says governments could set up their own cryptocurrencies", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Governments should consider offering their own cryptocurrencies to prevent the systems becoming havens for fraudsters and money launderers, Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund said referring to the fast-growing fintech industry. Lagarde said central banks had to work quickly to establish digital cash for burgeoning networks of private financial transactions or risk their mushrooming into trading networks that were inherently unstable. A system regulated by central banks could become the basis for a rapid expansion of financial services to developing world countries and the poorest people in western societies without the risks associated with privately managed digital currencies, she said. The IMF\u2019s proposal is likely to be greeted warily by many digital currency operators who believe one of the main attractions of their technology is that it lies outside the mainstream banking system. The involvement of a central bank could also be seen as imposing heavy-handed regulation that would slow down transactions and raise costs. However, businesses wishing to use the underlying blockchain technology to process transactions are likely to welcome the IMF\u2019s endorsement and the involvement of central banks in preserving the integrity of new financial systems. The Bank of England, which is watching developments in digital currencies closely, already runs the systems that process stock exchange and banking transactions, and oversees the cash and coins that a digital currency is expected to replace. Speaking at a fintech conference in Singapore, Lagarde said central banks would take over the processing of transactions while private-sector providers offered innovative services to customers. \u201cThe advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments. In addition, they would offer a more level playing field for competition, and a platform for innovation. Meanwhile your bank or fellow entrepreneurs would have ensured a friendly user experience based on the latest technologies,. \u201cPutting it another way. The central bank focuses on its comparative advantage \u2013 back-end settlement \u2013 and financial institutions and start-ups are free to focus on what they do best \u2013 client interface and innovation. This is public-private partnership at its best.\u201d Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrency transactions, allows users to maintain a digital account and be paid in a digital currency such as bitcoins. They can use the account, or digital wallet, to make purchases without their identity being revealed. Billions of pounds of investment is going into startup businesses that offer services based on blockchain technology, which they say can be cheaper and quicker than services offered by mainstream banks. But currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have had dramatic increases and falls in value, limiting their take-up. Bitcoin has also suffered setbacks following a spate of robberies at digital currency exchanges which have left customers millions of pounds out of pocket. Sweden\u2019s central bank has run tests and the IMF has credited Canada, China and Uruguay as also moving ahead with plans to provide a digital currency. Lagarde said many consumers were wary of using bank accounts to buy goods and services because they could be tracked by third-parties such as insurers, who could increase charges based on transactions data. She said it was legitimate to prefer digital cash but that central banks needed to have oversight to prevent customer funds being stolen and to stop abuses by criminal gangs. IMF research showed that only central banks could develop systems that would be safe enough to meet the needs of the modern user. Lagarde added: \u201cA new wind is blowing, that of digitalisation. In this new world we meet anywhere, anytime. The town square is back \u2013 virtually, on our smartphones. We exchange information, services, even emojis, instantly \u2026 peer to peer, person to person. \u201cWe float through a world of information, where data is the \u2018new gold\u2019, despite growing concerns over privacy and cyber-security. A world in which millennials are reinventing how our economy works, phone in hand. And this is key; money itself is changing. We expect it to become more convenient and user friendly, perhaps even less serious looking. \u201cWe expect it to be integrated with social media, readily available for online and person-to-person use, including micropayments. And, of course, we expect it to be cheap and safe, protected against criminals and prying eyes.\u201d",

The involvement of a central bank could also be seen as imposing heavy-handed regulation that would slow down transactions and raise costs.</p> <p>However, businesses wishing to use the underlying blockchain technology to process transactions are likely to welcome the IMF\u2019s endorsement and the involvement of central banks in preserving the integrity of new financial systems.</p> <p>The Bank of England, which is watching developments in digital currencies closely, already runs the systems that process stock exchange and banking transactions, and oversees the cash and coins that a digital currency is expected to replace.</p> <p>Speaking at a fintech conference in Singapore, Lagarde said central banks would take over the processing of transactions while private-sector providers offered innovative services to customers.</p> <p>\u201cThe advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments. In addition, they would offer a more level playing field for competition, and a platform for innovation. Meanwhile your bank or fellow entrepreneurs would have ensured a friendly user experience based on the latest technologies,.</p> <p>\u201cPutting it another way. The central bank focuses on its comparative advantage \u2013 back-end settlement \u2013 and financial institutions and start-ups are free to focus on what they do best \u2013 client interface and innovation.
