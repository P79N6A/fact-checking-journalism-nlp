    "webTitle": "US Federal Reserve expected to keep interest rates on hold", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial markets have become over reliant on central banks, a leading international body said on Sunday, as investors prepared for the latest announcement on interest rates from the US Federal Reserve. The Bank for International Settlements, known as the central bankers\u2019 bank, said in its latest quarterly bulletin that the institutions had become over-burdened with the responsibility for tackling a slowdown in growth. The comments from the the Swiss-based BIS came at the start of a week when the Fed and the Japanese central bank both prepare to update the markets on their latest interest policies. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold, despite concerns that the strength of the world\u2019s largest economy warrants a rise in borrowing costs. Analysts on Wall Street said there was little likelihood of an interest rate rise when Fed officials meet on Wednesday, saying there was only a 12% chance of a hike from the current 0.5% rate. Forecasts of a rate rise in September were downgraded following a 1.1% rise in annual inflation reported in August, up from 0.8% in July. Analysts said the rise in prices was unlikely to have much influence on the Fed, because it was mostly the result of the biggest jump in health costs for 32 years and a modest increase in housing rents, while food and consumer goods prices remained flat. A decision to freeze rates would bring the Fed into line with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which both kept interest rates at historic lows at their September meetings. As the focus turns to the Fed and the Bank of Japan, which could add further stimulus to its already broad package of measures to cut the cost of credit, Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS\u2019s monetary and economic department, said at the launch of the quarterly bulletin: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly evident that central banks have been overburdened for far too long\u201d. The bulletin outlined how markets had responded since the UK\u2019s vote in June to leave the EU, which prompted the Bank of England to cut rates for the first time in more than seven years to 0.25%. \u201cThrough a combination of near zero, or even negative, policy rates, large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance, central banks have been seeking to ease financial conditions in order to boost the economy and, above all, to bring inflation up closer to their numerical objectives,\u201d Borio said. \u201cDevelopments in the period under review have highlighted once more just how dependent on central banks markets have become,\u201d he said. Borio also cautioned about their role in the BIS annual report in June. The Fed, which raised rates from their crisis level of near zero in December 2015, now seems likely to raise rates in December, according to a poll of analysts. It is under pressure to do so from savers who have spent the last eight years locked into zero interest accounts, and from regulators concerned that low interest rates are driving investors to speculate on the world\u2019s stock markets. The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has complained that low interests rates are denying savers a return on their pension funds and fostering a speculative stock market bubble. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said the timing of the presidential vote could override other concerns. \u201cA September hike cannot be ruled out completely, above all given the fact that a November meeting hike looks to be off the table, given its proximity to the election,\u201d he said. The prospect of an interest rate rise in the US has receded after the International Monetary Fund signalled that it would be revising down its July prediction of 3.1% growth for this year when it publishes its World Economic Outlook next month. Employment figures also showed that the US suffered a lull in job creation last month. There were 151,000 jobs added to the US economy in August, below economists\u2019 forecasts for 180,000 and a marked slowdown after two bumper months of growth. The Fed has hinted at a rate rise before the end of this year. Its chair, Janet Yellen, said in May that she and fellow policymakers would watch the economic data closely. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate \u2013 and I have said this in the past, I think \u2013 for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Financial markets have become over reliant on central banks, a leading international body said on Sunday, as investors prepared for the latest announcement on interest rates from the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>The Bank for International Settlements, known as the central bankers\u2019 bank, said in<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1609_ontherecord.htm\"> its latest quarterly bulletin</a> that the institutions had become over-burdened with the responsibility for tackling a slowdown in growth.</p> <p>The comments from the the Swiss-based BIS came at the start of a week when the Fed and the Japanese central bank both prepare to update the markets on their latest interest policies.</p> <p>The Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold, despite concerns that the strength of the world\u2019s largest economy warrants a rise in borrowing costs.</p> <p>Analysts on Wall Street said there was little likelihood of an interest rate rise when Fed officials meet on Wednesday, saying there was only a 12% chance of a hike from the current 0.5% rate.</p> <p>Forecasts of a rate rise in September were downgraded following <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN11M193\">a 1.1% rise in annual inflation reported in August</a>, up from 0.8% in July. Analysts said the rise in prices was unlikely to have much influence on the Fed, because it was mostly the result of the biggest jump in health costs for 32 years and a modest increase in housing rents, while food and consumer goods prices remained flat.</p> <p>A decision to freeze rates would bring the Fed into line with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which both kept interest rates at historic lows at their September meetings.</p> <p>As the focus turns to the Fed and the Bank of Japan, which could add further stimulus to its already broad package of measures to cut the cost of credit, Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS\u2019s monetary and economic department, said at the launch of the quarterly bulletin: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly evident that central banks have been overburdened for far too long\u201d.</p> <p>The bulletin outlined how markets had responded since the UK\u2019s vote in June to leave the EU, which prompted the Bank of England to cut rates <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">for the first time in more than seven years</a> to 0.25%. \u201cThrough a combination of near zero, or even negative, policy rates, large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance, central banks have been seeking to ease financial conditions in order to boost the economy and, above all, to bring inflation up closer to their numerical objectives,\u201d Borio said.</p> <p>\u201cDevelopments in the period under review have highlighted once more just how dependent on central banks markets have become,\u201d he said. Borio also cautioned about their role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/26/debt-fuelled-growth-trigger-financial-crash-governments-told-bis\">in the BIS annual report in June</a>. </p> <p>The Fed, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">which raised rates from their crisis level of near zero in December 2015</a>, now seems likely to raise rates in December, according to a poll of analysts. It is under pressure to do so from savers who have spent the last eight years locked into zero interest accounts, and from regulators concerned that low interest rates are driving investors to speculate on the world\u2019s stock markets. </p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has complained that low interests rates are denying savers a return on their pension funds and fostering a speculative stock market bubble. </p> <p>Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said the timing of the presidential vote could override other concerns. \u201cA September hike cannot be ruled out completely, above all given the fact that a November meeting hike looks to be off the table, given its proximity to the election,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prospect of an interest rate rise in the US has receded after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/imf-urges-g20-to-champion-globalisation-at-china-summit\">the International Monetary Fund signalled</a> that it would be revising down <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/19/imf-cuts-uk-growth-forecasts-following-brexit-vote\">its July prediction of 3.1% growth for this year</a> when it publishes its World Economic Outlook next month. </p> <p>Employment figures also showed that the US suffered a lull in job creation last month. There were 151,000 jobs<strong> </strong>added to the US economy in August, below economists\u2019 forecasts for 180,000 and a marked slowdown after two bumper months of growth. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/26/janet-yellen-speech-jackson-hole-federal-reserve-interest-rate\">The Fed has hinted at a rate rise before the end of this year</a>. Its chair, Janet Yellen, said in May that she and fellow policymakers would watch the economic data closely. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate \u2013 and I have said this in the past, I think \u2013 for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate.\u201d </p> <p><br></p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Toxic fumes from one of Glencore\u2019s copper plants in Zambia caused the death of a politician, the African country\u2019s high court said, in a ruling that could trigger fresh claims against the company. The London-listed mining and commodities trader was ordered to pay 400,000 Zambian kwacha (\u00a330,000) in damages to the widower of Beatrice Mithi, a politician who died after inhaling sulphur dioxide released by Glencore subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines. The ruling in June means Glencore could face new claims from residents of the Mufulira district, where local people have long complained of health problems allegedly caused by emissions from Mopani\u2019s copper smelter. Laywers for Glencore contested the claim, citing an environmental indemnity agreement signed with the Zambian government in 2000. However, a judge in Kabwe, in Zambia\u2019s Copperbelt region,ruled that the agreement did not apply because sulphur dioxide emissions had exceeded legal limits. \u201cBy emitting sulphur dioxide into the environment exceeding statutory limitations [Mopani Copper Mines] breached its duty of care owed to her [Mithi] and the community,\u201d the ruling said. Mr Justice Sichinga also dismissed evidence from two doctors, who claimed that asthma, diabetes and heart problems may have caused her death. The legal battle featured in the Rundschau programme on the SRF TV channel in Switzerland. A postmortem found that Mithi died from \u201cacute respiratory failure due to inhalation of toxic fumes\u201d at a church service on New Years\u2019 Eve in 2013. The FTSE 100 firm completed a \u00a3300m project in 2014 to build an acid plant to raise the capture of sulphur dioxide from 50% to 97%. The Switzerland-based commodities and mining giant is appealing against the decision in Zambia\u2019s supreme court. In a statement, Glencore cited \u201cprocedural irregularities\u201d in the ruling, saying the judge did not consider evidence that its defence team submitted. Glencore said the judge \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d defence evidence and disputed any link between emmissions at Mopani\u2019 and Mithi\u2019s death. Traidcraft, which is campaigning for greater legal accountability for companies operating overseas, said: \u201cThis is yet another case of an irresponsible company, listed in the UK, causing serious harm through its operations in a developing country. \u201cThe decision of the Zambian high court in this case is welcome, but it\u2019s hard to see how it will have much of a deterrent effect on this or other companies. \u201cThe government have an opportunity right now to deal with this. They are looking at how to prosecute companies for \u2018white collar\u2019 crimes but this could be extended to consider other serious corporate crimes, including failure to deal with severe pollution or causing deaths.\u201d Glencore bought Mopani Copper Mines in 2000, inheriting a longstanding sulphur emissions problem that has fuelled simmering tension with the community. Anger at emissions erupted in riots in August 2014. It has previously enjoyed immunity from claims relating to the period between 2000 and 2014 thanks to its environmental liability agreement.",

      "bodyText": "You probably have to be old enough to have bought Sgt Pepper when it first came out to recall the angst, but there was a time when people cared about Britain\u2019s trade deficit. There were screaming headlines. There were runs on the pound. There were policy changes to choke off imports and to boost exports. As far as the economy was concerned, the summer of love in 1967, which included a song by the Beatles called Fixing a Hole, ended with a 14% devaluation to balance the books. So it was quite nostalgic last week when Roger Bootle and John Mills urged the government to take steps to prevent sterling\u2019s recent depreciation from being reversed. Keeping the pound cheap, they said, was necessary to build up the UK\u2019s manufacturing base, reverse the slide in investment as a share of national output and close a current account deficit that is now far higher than it ever was in the stop-start days of the 1960s. A competitive exchange rate can help the balance of payments because it makes exports less expensive and imports dearer. In theory, it should help UK manufacturers to increase their market share, which in turn should encourage new investment in order to support rising production. When the deutschmark was weak in the years immediately after the second world war, West Germany took full advantage. Bootle and Mills are quite right to point out that Britain has suffered from periods when the exchange rate has been absurdly over-valued, most egregiously during the early Thatcher years from 1979 to 1981, but also under Labour during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Both periods contributed to the hollowing out of industry and the steady deterioration in trade figures. The current account deficit reflects Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world, and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in. Running permanently big deficits comes at a cost. They are financed either by Britons selling off their overseas assets or by investors from other countries buying up assets in the UK. There is always the risk that UK assets become less attractive, and if the investors suddenly pulled their money out there would be a run on the pound. The financial markets have so far been relaxed about the UK running a current account deficit of 7% of GDP, but that doesn\u2019t mean they will always be so. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, it makes sense to take action to close it, which is one reason the Bank of England has been hinting at further interest rate cuts. Lower borrowing costs equate to downward pressure on the pound. To that extent, Mark Carney and the other eight members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee are doing exactly what Bootle and Mills suggest. There is more, however, to solving Britain\u2019s chronic current account problem than simply driving down sterling. For a start, there\u2019s the little matter of how you keep the pound at its current depreciated levels. Official interest rates are already close to zero, so there is a limit to how much they can be cut. Money creation through quantitative easing could be deployed to keep the pound cheap, but the evidence since QE was first used in 2009 is that it boosts activity more through raising asset prices and consumer spending than it does through higher manufacturing output. The reality is that keeping a currency stable at a low level when they are free to float on the foreign exchanges and in the absence of capital controls is quite a challenge. A second and perhaps even more important issue is whether exporters will exploit sterling\u2019s depreciation. There are two ways in which a company can do so. They can try to capture market share by reducing their prices, or they can keep output unchanged but cream off higher profits. Britain\u2019s short-termist culture means there is forever a temptation to take the latter option, because that goes down better with shareholders. In Germany, where 80% of the mid-sized companies that make up the Mittelstand are not publicly quoted, there is much less pressure to make an instant killing. Over the years, there have been times when governments have sought to tackle some of the UK\u2019s supply side deficiencies, which include the way businesses are financed, a lack of investment in new plant and research, poor skills, inadequate management and poor industrial relations. Theresa May has made the right sort of noises since becoming prime minister, talking about the need to put workers on boards, tighten up the takeover code and look at boardroom remuneration practices. As Bob Bischof, the chairman of the Anglo-German forum noted, Britain is adopting the German business model as it is leaving the EU. This is perhaps not quite as curious as it sounds, given that the German model predated the EU and has proved its enduring worth despite the disastrous obsession with ever-greater integration that led to the creation of the euro. The golden age for German workers was when the Beatles were knocking around the Hamburg clubs in the early 60s. Nor has membership of the single market done much to boost UK exports to its EU partners. A study by Adam Slater of the Oxford Economics consultancy has shown that the value of Britain\u2019s exports to the EU \u201cgrew considerably more slowly from 1993 to 2015 (4% per year) than in the pre-single market phase of the UK\u2019s EU membership (16% per year) and also more slowly than in the 1950-1972 period before the UK joined the EU (8%)\u201d. Slater\u2019s analysis highlights how the UK\u2019s trade pattern has shifted away from the EU since the 1990s. More than 60% of UK goods exports went to the EU in the late 1990s, but this share has since fallen to 45%. Since 2007, UK exports to the rest of the EU have barely grown. What\u2019s more, Oxford Economics notes that a 1% rise in EU GDP leads to only around half the rise in UK exports to the bloc that a 1% rise in GDP in the rest of the world prompts in British exports to non-EU countries. Should the recent trend continue, the EU would account for 37% of UK goods exports by 2035 and 30% by 2050, which would be back to its 1960 level. The projections make no allowances for any potential Brexit effects on the future pattern of UK trade, but it is easy to see how they might have some bearing on the negotiations that will take place once the government finally triggers article 50. The EU will clearly remain a key trading partner for the UK, but membership of the single market is less important than it was at the turn of the millennium. Trade relationships with emerging economies such as China will become increasingly significant. Hence, perhaps, the decision not to upset Beijing over Hinkley Point.

Maykut was invited to join the board of New Jersey\u2019s Garden State Taxidermists Association, where she has been pushing ideas around using social media to reach a new audience and moving taxidermy competitions from rural areas to places with a bigger and more diverse audience.

Finding already dead animals for her work has led Maykut to the pet shop mice doomed to be snake food, furrier auctions, where she picks up the heads fashion designers don\u2019t want, butcher remains of animals like quail, rabbits, deer and ducks as well as pest control companies that kill raccoons or other small mammals. Maykut sees her work as an homage to the animal, a way to \u201cgive them a second life, life after death\u201d.<br></p> <p>While the new iteration of the age old craft is more humane, a strong stomach for death is still required. Maykut grew up in an industrial part of New Jersey, without any exposure to dead animals but she does recall her interest starting early, when she would collect dead butterflies as a child that she found around a lilac bush. \u201cI would covet them and go hide them in my bedroom under my bed growing up. It was pretty and I would just look at it. So I would start hoarding these dead insects secretly,\u201d she tells me. That childhood habit let her to learning how to preserve the butterflies. \u201cBefore I did taxidermy I was pinning butterflies, that was the gateway drug for taxidermy for me,\u201d she says with a laugh.<br></p> <p>Back at the class the students are finishing up their mice with props provided by Maykut. \u201cCan it be a goth mouse?\u201d one student asks. Another student contemplates a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Van_Helsing\">Van Helsing</a> mouse but settles on making the mouse a nun instead. A bible and cross prove to be popular props, as do a set of tiny vinyl records and bottles of wine. After miniature top hats and other props, evaluated for their cool factor have been hot glued to the student\u2019s creations, Maykut walks around with a syringe full of embalming fluid to inject into the heads of the mice, complementing the students on their work and providing tiny tweaks to their morbid masterpieces.</p>",

The taxidermy community recognized that it needs to change with the times and has been receptive to change. Maykut was invited to join the board of New Jersey\u2019s Garden State Taxidermists Association, where she has been pushing ideas around using social media to reach a new audience and moving taxidermy competitions from rural areas to places with a bigger and more diverse audience. She sees her classes as another way to introduce the craft to more people and foster other budding taxidermists. These days, in New York City alone, in addition to Maykut\u2019s classes, Atlas Obscura offers regular taxidermy classes with another young woman taxidermist, Katie Innamorato, who comes from an art background. The Morbid Anatomy Museum offers its own version with its taxidermists in residence, Divya Anantharaman, who teaches classes on topics like how to taxidermy a chicken or make wearable taxidermy for fashion. Like the teachers, most of the students in Maykut\u2019s classes are women. Taxidermy classes fit into the DIY movement, she says, and is another craft that people can learn when they get sick of sitting in a cubicle at work, one that has become a popular part of home decor for its kitsch value. Her mice classes are a way to frame taxidermy as something cute and whimsical, not something related to hunting, she explains. In addition to its embrace of whimsy, an emphasis on never killing for the sake of taxidermy has set the new generation of taxidermists apart and shifted the types of animals that are taxidermied. Finding already dead animals for her work has led Maykut to the pet shop mice doomed to be snake food, furrier auctions, where she picks up the heads fashion designers don\u2019t want, butcher remains of animals like quail, rabbits, deer and ducks as well as pest control companies that kill raccoons or other small mammals. Maykut sees her work as an homage to the animal, a way to \u201cgive them a second life, life after death\u201d. While the new iteration of the age old craft is more humane, a strong stomach for death is still required. Maykut grew up in an industrial part of New Jersey, without any exposure to dead animals but she does recall her interest starting early, when she would collect dead butterflies as a child that she found around a lilac bush. \u201cI would covet them and go hide them in my bedroom under my bed growing up. It was pretty and I would just look at it. So I would start hoarding these dead insects secretly,\u201d she tells me. That childhood habit let her to learning how to preserve the butterflies. \u201cBefore I did taxidermy I was pinning butterflies, that was the gateway drug for taxidermy for me,\u201d she says with a laugh. Back at the class the students are finishing up their mice with props provided by Maykut. \u201cCan it be a goth mouse?\u201d one student asks. Another student contemplates a Van Helsing mouse but settles on making the mouse a nun instead. A bible and cross prove to be popular props, as do a set of tiny vinyl records and bottles of wine. After miniature top hats and other props, evaluated for their cool factor have been hot glued to the student\u2019s creations, Maykut walks around with a syringe full of embalming fluid to inject into the heads of the mice, complementing the students on their work and providing tiny tweaks to their morbid masterpieces.",

      "bodyText": "Despite the majority of the British public being opposed to a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C, according to various surveys, Theresa May has approved the \u00a318bn project. The arguments against it are well understood \u2013 cost, safety and national security. On the first point, George Osborne, the former chancellor, was on the radio supporting the project last week, claiming that the costs would be borne by French group EDF and its Chinese partner CGN. That is disingenuous at best, misleading at worst. EDF and CGN expect to make a profit from their investment and the National Audit Office has said the project could cost taxpayers almost \u00a330bn in subsidies to these companies. Other factors May had to consider when making a final call about whether to go ahead with Hinkley included the diplomatic repercussions of scrapping a project that was significant to France and China. The shadow of Brexit also hung over the decision: this is not a time to be damaging relationships with two key trading partnerships. EDF and CGN\u2019s reputations were on the line. EDF has lost its finance director and is at war with its trade unions because of the project. China \u2013 a country not renowned for taking disappointment well \u2013 has said the opportunity to invest in UK nuclear will allow it to advertise its technological expertise to the world. As a result, May faced a decision akin to not inviting your boss to your wedding. It is your day, you are more than entitled to make that decision and you probably shouldn\u2019t have invited them in the first place: but snubbing them is not going to be positive for your career prospects. The government was not overwhelmed by alternatives either. Yes, Rolls-Royce could build smaller nuclear reactors around the country and yes, other forms of renewable energy could help. But Hinkley is scheduled to start producing electricity by 2025 and deliver 7% of the UK\u2019s energy needs. Could the other options really deliver that much electricity in the same time frame? One of the criticisms of Hinkley is that it is an answer to an old question, with energy requirements and technology evolving all the time. Well, yes: that is partly because the project was first dreamt up 10 years ago \u2013 and to block construction now would eradicate a decade of work. Taking all this into account, it looks like May and her government have played the percentages. They may not have been excited about the idea of Hinkley, but the cons of scrapping it at this stage probably outweigh the pros. However, Britain\u2019s energy strategy beyond Hinkley is another matter. It was surprising that alongside the government\u2019s announcement that the nuclear power plant would go ahead there were suggestions emanating from Whitehall and Beijing that similar projects in Bradwell, Essex, and Sizewell, Suffolk, were also on track. The Bradwell B project is particularly noteworthy because CGN will design the reactor and own two-thirds of it. The Chinese company plans to submit its design for Bradwell within weeks. May and her government must seriously think about whether they want more nuclear power stations popping up around the country. While the decision on whether to proceed with Hinkley became wrapped up with diplomatic issues, Bradwell and Sizewell must only be approved if the government genuinely believes they are the best solution to Britain\u2019s energy issues. Most experts would say they are not. Stopping Bradwell and Sizewell would not be straightforward: one of the main reasons that CGN supported Hinkley Point was so it could develop its own power station at Bradwell. However, it is possible that the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the government could, for example, reject CGN\u2019s design for the reactor. Or the Chinese could be offered the opportunity to invest in another high-technology project on attractive terms, such as High Speed 2. So, while Hinkley could finally become a reality, the debate about nuclear power stations is far from over. A good start on pay reform Reform is coming to the world of executive pay, or so our new prime minister leads us to believe, but what form should it take? Iain Wright\u2019s business, innovation and skills select committee promised on Friday to lift the floorboards not just on executive pay, but on corporate governance and the composition of boardrooms, including workers\u2019 representatives. That is a very wide brief \u2013 possibly too wide to achieve consensus. In the meantime, Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), the fund management arm of the insurance company, put forward two proposals that have the virtue of being easy to understand. First, LGIM said public companies should publish the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and that of the median employee. This idea is so sensible that it is a wonder it is still regarded as vaguely controversial. It is true, as the critics grumble, that ratios are crudely measured and don\u2019t tell the whole story of a company\u2019s approach to pay. But, come on, boards of large public companies have spent 20 years bamboozling the outside world, and their shareholders, with the complexity of their pay schemes. A dose of crudity would be welcome and oblige remuneration committees to look beyond the boardroom. Second, LGIM says directors\u2019 annual bonuses should be capped at two times salary. This idea is more inflammatory because some remuneration committees seem to believe that executives won\u2019t put in a decent shift unless they are chasing bonuses worth up to 500% of salary. Such inflation has served to disguise the truth about bonuses. They have become a form of semi-guaranteed salary supplement: an executive has to mess up monumentally to get nothing. In the process, the original meaning of a bonus \u2013 a reward for exceptional performance \u2013 has been ignored. A cap at 200% would restore a degree of sanity. LGIM\u2019s proposals should not be regarded as full package. Much more is needed for public\u2019s trust in business is to improve. But they are a start. Sensible boards should comply, rather than a kick up a fuss that will only invite heavy intervention by government. Carney\u2019s schoolboy error Headline writers owe a debt of thanks to the schoolchildren of Coventry. More than three years after he became the governor of the Bank of England, a gentle grilling of Mark Carney at the Whitley Academy winkled out a piece of information that had eluded Fleet Street\u2019s finest in their many interviews and profiles of him. Asked what his nickname had been as a child in Canada, a startled Carney said it had been \u201ccarnage\u201d, an admission that will undoubtedly come back to haunt him should the economy go awry under his stewardship. Carnage Carney struggled to explain monetary policy without lapsing into jargon and at one stage felt he had to explain to his teenage audience that John Lennon was a member of a 1960s group called the Beatles. Never work with children or animals, WC Fields once said. Sage advice, governor, sage advice.",

      "bodyText": "Will they, won\u2019t they? The answer to the stock market\u2019s latest guessing game will come on Wednesday, when the US Federal Reserve reveals whether it plans to raise interest rates this month. A mixed bag of US economic data in recent weeks and contradictory comments from Federal Reserve members has caused volatility in the market, as investors struggled to pin down what the Fed might actually do. The final major comment from a Fed member before a period of purdah came on Monday, with governor Lael Brainard taking the dovish tack. The Fed decision comes as the Bank of Japan \u2013 which also meets this week \u2013 and Bank of England contemplate cutting rates further. Analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: \u201cGiven recent data, it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a scenario that could see the Federal Reserve nudge rates higher next week. To do so would fly in the face of their claim to be data-dependent, given that third-quarter GDP expectations continue to get marked lower.\u201d On the other hand, US inflation came in higher than expected on Friday, meaning the decision is by no means clear-cut. Whatever happens on Wednesday, the markets will immediately move on. Probably to wondering whether the Fed will raise rates at its December meeting. Saga\u2019s investors hope to hear a tale of the sea Plans for a third cruise ship due in 2019 show the desire of over-50s specialist Saga to reduce its reliance on insurance underwriting and expand its travel and broking businesses. It also wants to build up its brand name in other areas, and half-year results on Wednesday will give management a chance to update investors on developments. According to analysts at Peel Hunt, the key questions will revolve around its launch of a panel in its motor insurance business to reach a broader range of customers, the progress of a reinsurance deal with Munich Re and the resilience of the travel operations given the turmoil in the industry. Peel Hunt said: \u201cSaga is in transition to reduce its underwriting exposures and grow its broking and travel profits. The half-year results will show the progress the company has made so far this year. We expect earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to drop 4% to \u00a3125m. Lower reserve releases and the recent reinsurance agreement with Munich Re overshadows the gradual increase in the recently established motor broker panel income, which should accelerate in 2017-18.\u201d Investors will also want to learn more about its improved dividend policy, unveiled in April \u2013 although, like Saga\u2019s core market, you suspect many might already be on board. Kingfisher profits rise, but B&amp;Q may be in a fix \u201cA shocker \u2026 a disappointingly poor store where the trading strategy was unclear to customers.\u201d That\u2019s the view of well-regarded City analyst Tony Shiret after a recent visit to a B&amp;Q outlet. For good measure, the Haitong scribe said there was an \u201curgent need to reinvent this format\u201d. Not what V\u00e9ronique Laury, chief executive of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, would have wanted to hear as she struggles with uncertain trading in the UK and France and growing competition from Homebase, now taken over by Australia\u2019s Wesfarmers. (To be fair, Shiret\u2019s visit to a Homebase store left him thinking it was not particularly cheap, but he added that it was \u201cinteresting and different\u201d.) B&amp;Q has been upgrading its technology and is experimenting with new formats, while Laury has unveiled plans to boost profits by \u00a3500m a year from 2021 by unifying its product offering across the business. All this, along with buyback plans, has helped lift its shares in recent months. Despite concerns about consumer spending, Kingfisher is expected to report a 10% rise in half-year profits to \u00a3420m on Tuesday. But it is the comments on the outlook which will be scoured for clues as to whether B&amp;Q can really fix itself.",

The answer to the stock market\u2019s latest guessing game will come on Wednesday, when the US Federal Reserve reveals whether it plans to raise interest rates this month.</p> <p>A mixed bag of US economic data in recent weeks and contradictory comments from Federal Reserve members has caused volatility in the market, as investors struggled to pin down what the Fed might actually do. The final major comment from a Fed member before a period of purdah came on Monday, with governor Lael Brainard taking the dovish tack. The Fed decision comes as the Bank of Japan \u2013 which also meets this week \u2013 and Bank of England contemplate cutting rates further.</p> <p>Analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: \u201cGiven recent data, it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine a scenario that could see the Federal Reserve nudge rates higher next week. To do so would fly in the face of their claim to be data-dependent, given that third-quarter GDP expectations continue to get marked lower.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, US inflation came in higher than expected on Friday, meaning the decision is by no means clear-cut. Whatever happens on Wednesday, the markets will immediately move on. Probably to wondering whether the Fed will raise rates at its December meeting.</p> <h2>Saga\u2019s investors hope to hear a tale of the sea</h2> <p>Plans for a third cruise ship due in 2019 show the desire of over-50s specialist Saga to reduce its reliance on insurance underwriting and expand its travel and broking businesses.</p> <p>It also wants to build up its brand name in other areas, and half-year results on Wednesday will give management a chance to update investors on developments.</p> <p>According to analysts at Peel Hunt, the key questions will revolve around its launch of a panel in its motor insurance business to reach a broader range of customers, the progress of a reinsurance deal with Munich Re and the resilience of the travel operations given the turmoil in the industry.</p> <p>Peel Hunt said: \u201cSaga is in transition to reduce its underwriting exposures and grow its broking and travel profits. The half-year results will show the progress the company has made so far this year. We expect earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to drop 4% to \u00a3125m. Lower reserve releases and the recent reinsurance agreement with Munich Re overshadows the gradual increase in the recently established motor broker panel income, which should accelerate in 2017-18.\u201d</p> <p>Investors will also want to learn more about its improved dividend policy, unveiled in April \u2013 although, like Saga\u2019s core market, you suspect many might already be on board.</p> <h2>Kingfisher profits rise, but B&amp;Q may be in a fix</h2> <p>\u201cA shocker \u2026 a disappointingly poor store where the trading strategy was unclear to customers.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the view of well-regarded City analyst Tony Shiret after a recent visit to a B&amp;Q outlet. For good measure, the Haitong scribe said there was an \u201curgent need to reinvent this format\u201d. Not what V\u00e9ronique Laury, chief executive of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, would have wanted to hear as she struggles with uncertain trading in the UK and France and growing competition from Homebase, now taken over by Australia\u2019s Wesfarmers.</p> <p>(To be fair, Shiret\u2019s visit to a Homebase store left him thinking it was not particularly cheap, but he added that it was \u201cinteresting and different\u201d.)</p> <p>B&amp;Q has been upgrading its technology and is experimenting with new formats, while Laury has unveiled plans to boost profits by \u00a3500m a year from 2021 by unifying its product offering across the business. All this, along with buyback plans, has helped lift its shares in recent months.</p> <p>Despite concerns about consumer spending, Kingfisher is expected to report a 10% rise in half-year profits to \u00a3420m on Tuesday. But it is the comments on the outlook which will be scoured for clues as to whether B&amp;Q can really fix itself.</p>",
