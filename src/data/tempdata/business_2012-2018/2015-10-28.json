      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s attempt at being more open and transparent is off to a mixed start. Matthias M\u00fcller, the new chief executive, left a conference call for investors after just 30 minutes without answering many of their questions about the diesel emissions scandal. M\u00fcller may have been heading off to China with Angela Merkel, but this was inauspicious for a man who was pledged to make VW more \u201cdown to earth\u201d\u2013 whatever that means for a multinational company. The 11 million customers affected by the diesel emissions scandal still do not know how their vehicle will be fixed and shareholders have no idea how much the crisis will eventually cost. Instead of useful new information, the car makers third quarter results were full of corporate sound bites. A pledge to be more transparent \u2013 while at the same time saying very little \u2013 was not the only contradiction in VW\u2019s results. Why is Muller pledging \u201cprofoundly change the way we do things\u201d while at the same time blaming the diesel scandal on a few rogue engineers? And why is he building a new group structure when the investigation into how defeat devices were fitted into vehicles is still ongoing? Perhaps it would be helpful to give the German carmaker a helping hand by translating some of the mumbo jumbo in its results: \u201cOur customers are at the core of everything that our 600,000 employees worldwide do\u201d \u2013 we are really sorry. \u201cWe need a culture of openness and cooperation\u201d \u2013 staff were scared of former boss Martin Winterkorn. \u201cWe will review in detail our current portfolio of more than 300 models and examine the contribution that each one makes to our earnings\u201d \u2013 we will stop selling rubbish cars. \u201cWe must uncover the truth and learn from it\u201d \u2013 we must find someone to blame and move on quickly. Shareholders breathed a sigh of relief at the lack of more bad news in results \u2013 sending the shares up 1% - but this was an unsatisfactory start to M\u00fcller\u2019s tenure. Quadplay ... without CMA The Competition and Markets Authority has cleared BT\u2019s takeover of EE but Ofcom is still taking a look and may force BT to sell Openreach. Got that? Didn\u2019t think so. The UK\u2019s competition watchdog took a hammering for almost scuppering the tie-up between Poundland and 99p Stores by warning the enlarged group would have to sell off stores, so we should probably applaud its lack of interference here. Only, in light of that decision, allowing two huge telecommunications groups to come together without asking them to jump through hoops appears inconsistent. It suggests that the CMA may be taking a narrow view of the world. The Poundland and 99p Stores deal was deemed to be troubling because it would dominate the single-price retail market, even though no-one shops exclusively in pound stores. Similarly, the CMA has concluded that BT and EE overlap nicely and won\u2019t dominate in either mobile or broadband. But that is the entire point of the deal \u2013 to build a business that can snap up consumers across mobile, broadband, landline and television, or \u201cquad play\u201d as it has become known. An overarching review of the quadplay is being undertaken by Ofcom, the industry regulator, which begs the question why the CMA bothered getting involved in the first place. Apple the invicible Back in the crazy month of August when it seemed a stock market crash was round the corner, Apple boss Tim Cook saved the day by sending an email to CNBC insisting that his company was still performing well. Now we can see why Cook spoke out. Apple enjoyed a 31% rise in net profits year-on-year to $11.1bn (\u00a37.2bn) in its last quarter, while sales were up 22% to $51.5bn. This was better than Wall Street analysts had predicted. Over-confidence would appear to be the only threat to Apple at the moment, because nothing else can stop it. The new iPhone 6s and supersized iPad Pro are likely be hits, but perhaps the biggest boost could come from Apple\u2019s pay-by-month financing scheme. This will allow customers who couldn\u2019t afford to pay upfront for an iPhone and didn\u2019t want to sign up to a contract with a mobile operator to buy a brand new phone, and will also encourage them to upgrade to the latest model every year.",

      "bodyText": "The owner of Dulux paint has warned that the UK is facing a skills crunch that could exacerbate the country\u2019s housing shortage. AkzoNobel, one of the biggest industrial companies in Europe, has opened a new academy in Slough designed to train painters and decorators in an attempt to stop a slide in the number of tradesmen in Britain. Recent surveys have claimed there is a shortage of 33,000 tradesmen in London and the south-east alone, while two thirds of construction firms claim they have turned down work because of a lack of resources. Matt Pullen, head of AkzoNobel in the UK, said: \u201cDemand is growing and supply is constrained. It is a bit of crunch. This could lead to a situation where homebuilding slows down because you don\u2019t have the tradesmen to fill the building.\u201d The academy will train between 3,000 and 4,000 people a year when it is up and running and has been accredited by the City &amp; Guilds institute. Pullen was speaking at a briefing in London where Ton B\u00fcchner, the chief executive of AkzoNobel, called on the UK to remain in the EU. AkzoNobel has close links to the UK after buying the chemicals group ICI in 2008 for \u00a38bn. The company employs more than 3,600 people in the country. B\u00fcchner said: \u201cFrom a business perspective we would have a desire for the UK to stay inside. From a personal opinion, I would much rather have the UK actually help to improve the EU from within rather than commenting from the sidelines.\u201d B\u00fcchner is one of a number of executives to speak out about the UK remaining in the EU, alongside Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, and Henri de Castries, the boss of Axa, one of the world\u2019s biggest insurance companies. However, B\u00fcchner refused to say that AkzoNobel would reconsider making investments in the UK if it left the EU. He said the company had invested in the UK for \u201creasons other than its presence in the EU\u201d. Nonetheless, he added: \u201cA country that has that level of relevance in a geographical area like Europe should be in [the EU] from where we stand.\u201d",

BSH Hausger\u00e4te, which makes household appliances under the Bosch and Siemens brands, said it was taking steps to sue Dyson in the UK over what it said were false allegations made by billionaire founder Sir James Dyson. It did not specify what form the legal action would take. Dyson, best known for its bagless vacuum cleaners, said its lawyers were not aware of any legal claim by BSH. The threatened action is the latest skirmish between the companies over energy consumption, which has led to Dyson claiming that Bosch and Siemens had misled consumers in \u201cbehaviour akin to the Volkswagen scandal\u201d. Sir James claimed last week that BSH cleaners had been built with electronics that allowed them to draw more power in home use than they did in laboratory tests. BSH said all its vacuum cleaners were tested in accordance with the EU energy label and ecodesign directive for vacuum cleaners and met the standards in full. Dyson claimed that independent testing had shown that machines made by Bosch and Siemens could draw more than 1,600W of power when used in the home, despite having a rating of 750W. The UK company has sued BSH in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium on the basis that it misleads consumers. BSH said it showed a year ago that Dyson had advertised incorrect values on energy labels for its appliances. BSH said Dyson\u2019s claims were unfounded and untrue and that its vacuum cleaners were fitted with sensors designed to maintain suction as the bag filled up. It said this loss of suction was \u201cone of the main challenges\u201d for bagged cleaners and that it fitted the sensors in 2013 before the EU energy label was introduced in September last year. The legal spat between two of the biggest names in home appliances has added bite because German industry is in shock after Volkswagen admitted using defeat devices to rig emissions tests for its cars. BSH said Dyson\u2019s claims risked linking it to the scandal at Volkswagen. The BSH chief executive, Karsten Ottenberg, said: \u201cWe have long been aware that James Dyson has a history of taking a very aggressive approach against his competitors and has a desire to be in the public eye. With his completely unfounded accusations of cheating in the past week he has now overstepped the mark.\u201d BSH said its bagged and bagless cleaners performed better than Dyson\u2019s in German tests and that its machines also did better in tests by Which? in the UK. The Munich-based company said its cleaners were independently tested as well as being assessed at its research and development centre.",

    "webTitle": "Fed leaves US rates on hold but leaves door open for December rise -  as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our story on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision, by Rupert Neate in New York: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged at their record low of near-zero, but raised the likelihood of a rate hike in December by dropping previous warnings about the fragility of the global economy. Following a two-day meeting in Washington, Fed policymakers voted to leave rates at 0-0.25% \u2013 where they have been before the whole of the seven years since the financial crisis. However, the bank\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the rate, significantly raised the prospect of a historic rate rise at its next meeting in December by removing cautious statements about unstable international markets could adversely effect the US economy. The full report is here: On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Fed\u2019s comments should please the European Central Bank, says Howard Archer of IHS Economics: The Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting today is the second successive central bank meeting that has delivered a kicking to the euro. The euro fell markedly against the dollar after the ECB indicated last week that further easing is firmly on the table in December including possible interest rate cuts. That saw the euro briefly dip below $1.10 after testing $1.15 a week earlier. Now the Fed\u2019s indication that the door is open to a US interest rate hike in December has given the euro a renewed downward jolt, which is just what the ECB wants. It has plunged back through $1.10 and is currently testing $1.09 The ECB will be delighted as it clearly wants a weaker euro to help lift eurozone inflation and boost growth Next week\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers and the next set of inflation numbers could be key as to whether the Fed does indeed raise rates in December, says James Knightley of ING Bank: The Federal Reserve has played it safe and left monetary policy unchanged. Jeffrey Lacker remains the only committee member voting for an immediate 25bp rate rise. The changes to the accompanying statement are small in number, but reasonably significant. On the dovish side, the Fed acknowledges that \u201cthe pace of jobs growth has slowed\u201d versus being viewed as \u201csolid\u201d in September. However, the rest of the statement seems to try and put the most positive spin possible. Household and business spending is expanding at \u201csolid rates\u201d whereas previously it was only described as \u201cincreasing moderately\u201d. They have also removed three lines about global risks possibly restraining economic activity and depressing inflation. This seems a remarkable turnaround. Furthermore, the statement specifically adds that \u201cin determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting...\u201d This suggests that the more hawkish element will be pushing hard for a December move should the data come in reasonably firm. Nonetheless we do need to see quite a big improvement in the economic data and a rise in inflation to give us real confidence in our call of a rate rise at the December FOMC meeting. In terms of the upcoming numbers, next week\u2019s labour report will be key, but with the consensus forecasting only a 177,000 rise in payrolls and the unemployment rate remaining at 5.1%, the doves are not going to be swayed much. We would probable need to see 200,000 plus readings in that and the November report and unemployment breaking 5% to realistically shift thinking. However, there may be more support for the hawks from the CPI reports. Core inflation is rising and there are clear signs of a pick-up in service sector inflation (led by housing and medical care costs). With the negative impulse from energy prices set to shrink markedly in coming months as last year\u2019s plunge in the oil price drops out of the annual comparison, we could see headline CPI quickly reach 1%. Indeed, even if ex-energy CPI just stays at 1.9% year on year and energy prices remain stable, headline CPI will be up to 1.6% year on year in the first quarter of 2016. Here\u2019s Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief US economist: The Fed has also encouraged the thought of a December rise by inserting the phrase \u201cat its next meeting\u201d in the following phrase, In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In September it read: In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress.... The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in negative territory, down 13 points. There is some acknowledgement in the Fed statement that the US jobs situation has deteriorated since September (the recent non-farm payroll numbers were disappointing.) In September the Fed said: The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. On balance, labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year. Now the comment is: The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady. Nonetheless, labor market indicators, on balance, show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year. One member of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee - the Richmond Fed\u2019s Jeffrey Lacker - even wanted to raise rates this time round. Here is the voting: Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L. Evans; Stanley Fischer; Dennis P. Lockhart; Jerome H. Powell; Daniel K. Tarullo; and John C. Williams. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. This is the comment in September which has now been removed from the statement: Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term. So the Fed is more hawkish than the markets had been expecting, with economists becoming - up until now - convinced there would be no rise in December. Now they are not so sure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 130 points before the release of the statement but the gains have been trimmed and it is just 26 points better. The dollar has gained ground, climbing to a two and a half month high against the Swiss franc. The pound has fallen from $1.5318 before the statement to $1.5272 while the euro is at its lowest against the US currency since mid-August. But the Federal Reserve has kept the door open for a rate hike in December. It said it was still monitoring economic and financial developments abroad, but did not repeat its September comments that global risks would have a likely impact on the US economy. The full statement is here. Breaking news: As widely expected the Federal Reserve has left US interest rates on hold after this week\u2019s policy meeting. As a reminder, it\u2019s been a while since the Fed last raised rates: Ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, investors seemed in a calm mood. Gold miners rose in the expectation there would be no Fed rate rise this year, helping to support the London market, while a rise in crude prices also helped support markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 72.53 points or 1.14% higher at 6437.80 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.31% to 10,831.96 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.9% to 4890.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was up 1.41% at 22,686.24 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.96% higher at 10,421.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.3% to 727.38 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 91 points or 0.5% higher. Stock markets continue to gain ground ahead of the Fed, partly lifted by a rise in oil prices. Brent crude is up 4.6% at $48.99, helped by news that US stocks had risen by less than expected last week. The Energy Information Administration said crude inventories were 3.4m barrels higher at 479.96m, compared to forecasts of a 3.7m increase. This was less than the 4.1m rise posted by industry group the American Petroleum Institute. John Kilduff of Again Capital in New York told Reuters: Another spectacular, large crude oil inventory build seemed to get priced into the market, and all we got was a merely large one. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Oil prices rebounded strongly off two month lows as the build in US crude oil inventories slowed from last week to 3.4m barrels. The data was not confirmed by the API which yesterday reported a bigger than expected build of 4.1m barrels. Overall the US inventories stats are not overly bullish for oil prices but the market got a little overextended to the downside and is seeing a short-squeeze after two-month lows. Of course, if the Fed does by any chance raise interest rates this year after all, it will be going against the global trend. While the next move in UK rates may well be higher - albeit not yet - elsewhere the move is to cut rates. China has already done so, with a surprise move last week, while the European Central Bank hinted last week that it may consider cutting rates or expanding its QE programme in December: Today\u2019s Fed meeting is unlikely to signal much of a policy change without a press conference for the bank\u2019s members to explain themselves, sayd Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. He said: Without a press conference or official changes to the Staff Economic Projections (and dot plot likewise), today\u2019s meeting is more likely than not going to be a quieter one, at least by FOMC standards. The policy statement will carry a bit more weight, and even then, it\u2019s not like Fed officials are going to \u2018rock the boat\u2019 with a material shift in policy without being able to explain/justify/pontificate about the changes in their immediate aftermath. Instead, a focus on data dependency will be the core theme we\u2019re looking for. Given the fact that rate expectations for the Federal Reserve have been pushed back to March 2016, at this point, anything that fails to elicit a response from yields is insignificant; if rate expectations stay around March 2016 for the first rate move, then it\u2019s also likely that the US dollar continues along its current trajectory. The next major event on the agenda is the Federal Reserve policy decision, and as indicated earlier, the bank is expected to keep interest rates on hold. While there are still some who think the Fed may raise rates this year, perhaps in December, the wealth of weak data from the US and elsewhere (China anyone?) means that seems increasingly unlikely. But that does not mean this evening\u2019s announcement is not without interest. Seasoned Fed watchers will be looking for any nuances in the statement which accompanies the rate news. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: While no change is expected today the statement will be closely scrutinised for any change of tone with respect to the timing of a rate rise this year. In its last statement the Fed referred to an improving labour market with solid job gains, but since then we\u2019ve had a poor September payrolls report as well as a downward revision to the August number, raising the prospect of a softening labour market. More importantly, will the committee keep the line that \u201crisks to the outlook for economic activity and the labour market as nearly balanced,\u201d or will they soften the language in a way that reflects the concerns of Fed governor and permanent voting member Lael Brainard in comments made recently, that economic risks are \u201ctilted to the downside\u201d? In truth the window for raising rates this year appears to be getting ever smaller and was probably slammed shut last week in Beijing when the People\u2019s Bank of China cut rates again for the fifth time this year, in an attempt to help boost the slowing Chinese economy so that it doesn\u2019t miss its 7% GDP target by too much. With the potential for yet more policy easing from the ECB at its December meeting, and the effects of a stronger US dollar starting to trickle down into US earnings numbers, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the Fed would feel comfortable raising rates at a time when GDP targets are being revised lower on an almost weekly basis, with the latest Atlanta Fed model for third quarter GDP now at 0.8%. In short if the Fed weren\u2019t prepared to raise rates in September, they are hardly likely to now, or in six weeks\u2019 time, given that since that meeting the data has been shown little sign of any improvement, if anything it\u2019s been heading in the opposite direction. You would need to see a Lazarus like turnaround in the data, not only in the US, but also in China and Europe to increase the current odds on a December move which currently sit at 32.8%. A quick recap of the main points: Volkswagen has been dragged into its first quarterly loss in at least 15 years, by the cost of clearing up the emissions scandal. The German carmaker also warned that profits for this financial year will be substantially below its previous target, and revealed that sales were already below 2014\u2019s levels before it admitted cheating on emission tests. VW\u2019s new chief executive has vowed to discover exactly how the scandal occurred. Matthias M\u00fcller is now flying to China with chancellor Angela Merkel for a two-day diplomatic and trade visit. UK steelworkers have demonstrated outside the House of Commons, asking MPs to help the industry and stem the loss of jobs. Prime minister David Cameron has offered some hope, saying that the government will lift the \u2018green taxes\u2019 pushing up energy bills, once Brussels approves it. That won\u2019t end the crisis gripping the industry, though, with demand slumping at record rates: In the City, Jes Staley has played down talk that he will revive Barclays investment banking arm, after being named as the company\u2019s new CEO this morning: Sweden\u2019s central bank has boosted its quantitative easing programme, in an attempt to ward off deflation and weaken its currency. The move helped to drive shares higher across Europe, with investors speculating that the ECB will soon announce a big new stimulus package too. Here\u2019s the state of play in the main stock markets right now, as investors wait for the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates in three hours time: Shares are rallying a little in New York at the start of the day\u2019s trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 51 points, or 0.3%, to 17,632. Apple has gained 2%, as investors welcomed last night\u2019s financial results; its best year ever. The general mood on Wall Street is quite relaxed; investors are confident that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rate unchanged at today\u2019s meeting (the decision comes at 2pm Washington time, or 6pm GMT). Indeed, many economists believe that rates won\u2019t rise into March 2016, given the troubles in emerging markets and signs of slowing growth in advanced economies. Good news for America.... The US trade goods deficit has narrowed to a seven-month low of $58.6bn in September, from almost $67 in August. That\u2019s according to a provisional estimate from the US government (we get the final figure next week). It suggests that tomorrow\u2019s US growth figures, for the last quarter, could be a little better than expected. Economists had been forecasting annualised growth of 1.5% (or around +0.4% quarter-on-quarter). Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel (the industry body) has welcomed the news that steel firms will soon benefit from lower energy costs (as David Cameron just announced). The move could help could stem the recent surge in job losses that has struck the sector. Stace says: \u201cThis is a welcome commitment from the Prime Minister which reflects the urgency of the situation the sector is facing. The steel sector had asked for a full commitment to help offset the cost of high energy costs and, it now appears this will be given over the lifetime of the Parliament. This will give much needed confidence to the sector in terms of future investment. \u201cIt is now essential that we seek state aid as soon as possible so that payments can begin immediately as promised. This will help provide the breathing space to help the sector through the current crisis.\u201d Back in Westminster, the government has offered the beleaguered steel industry some help, as workers continued to demonstrate outside parliament. Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs that steel firms will soon be compensated for the green taxes that have pushed up their energy costs. It just needs the EU\u2019s approval. Cameron said: On energy costs, I can announce today that we will refund the energy intensive industries for the full amount of the policy cost they face as soon as we get the state aid judgment from Brussels. And I can confirm that payment will be made immediately and that payment will be made throughout this Parliament - far more generous than what has been proposed by Labour. (via my colleague Rowena Mason) Now this is a little awkward... Matthias M\u00fcller has jumped off the conference call, to join Angela Merkel on a flight to China to drum up German exports. As flagged up this morning, Volkswagen simply doesn\u2019t know the full cost of the emissions scandal, especially when it reaches the American courts..... VW\u2019s CEO is hinting that some of the groups models could be ditched, as it tries to cut costs: It\u2019s not abandoning environmentally friendly units, though (just as well, given the noxious gases its diesel cars have been pumping out) Volkswagen is holding a conference call with analysts and journalists now, to discuss today\u2019s historic loss (the first in at least 15 years). My colleague Julia Kollewe is dialled into the call, and tweeting the key points: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told protesting steelworkers in Westminster that the Labour Party will do all it could to ensure steel workers weren\u2019t \u201cwalked all over\u201d. McDonnell also described business Secretary Sajid Javid as a \u2018waste of space\u2019 who was \u201cpassing through\u2019 in the hope of higher things, reports David Hellier in Westminster. McDonnell said: \u201cHe\u2019s [Javid] told what\u2019s needed and then completely ignores it.But there hasn\u2019t been a single day when steel hasn\u2019t been raised by us.\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re up against it. They hold all the cards in their hands. But we have got to get them to do a u-turn - and I\u2019m an expert in u-turns.\u201d (McDonnell may still be bruised by his decision to first support, and then oppose, the government\u2019s fiscal charter). Javid, incidentally, travelled to Brussels to call for an emergency EU meeting on the state of the steel industry and unfair trade practices. He will discuss international trading of steel with the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, and meet other officials. Steelworkers from across the UK are demonstrating outside parliament right now. They are urging the government to do more to protect the industry, which has announced thousands of job losses in recent weeks. That includes the closure of the Redcar steel mill with the loss of 2,200 jobs, and 1,100 jobs at Tata Steel\u2019s sites in Scunthorpe and Scotland. The demonstration was organised by Unite, ahead of a debate on the steel crisis called by the opposition Labour party. Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke, says the government must provide more support before it\u2019s too late. \u201cWe have already seen the consequences of the government\u2019s failure to act on Teesside. Instead of intervening to keep the coke ovens burning at Redcar, ministers sat on their hands and allowed a key industrial asset to close forever taking with it the livelihoods of thousands of people. \u201cThe approach by ministers so far has been to deal with the symptoms of the steel crisis, when what steel and manufacturing communities want is action that secures UK steelmaking and secures their futures. \u201cHow many more jobs need to go and how many more communities will be devastated before the government acts? Money is also pouring into Eurozone bonds this morning, as traders anticipate more stimulus measures from the European Central Bank soon: Across Europe, stock markets are rallying this morning as investors get the catnip smell of central bank stimulus. The main indices are all in the green, and we can give the credit to Sweden\u2019s central bank. The Riksbank has announced it will ramp up its quantitative easing programme, and buy an extra 65bn krona of government bonds. That takes its QE total up to 200bn krona. It also left interest rates unchanged at the current record low of minus 0.35%. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at London Capital Group, says traders are looking forward to even more cheap money flooding into the system: The FTSE, [German] DAX and [French] CAC made a good start to the week as cheap liquidity will continue feed the market and the central banks are not ready to turn off the tap any time soon. Alastair McCaig, Senior Market Analyst at IG, explains why VW\u2019s shares have risen by 3% today: Figures from Volkswagen, which cover the period since the emissions scandal broke, have resulted in the car giant posting their first quarterly loss in 15 years. Being forward looking, investors have actually decided to focus on the positive aspects, with the shares rising so far this morning. Sales expectations for the year ahead are still quite robust, although the decision to suspend the launch of the latest diesel models in the Japanese market, a decision already taken in the US, does set a worrying precedent. I\u2019ve just received a statement from UK legal firm Leigh Day, who are representing 6,500 Volkswagen owners seeking compensation from the company. Bozena Michalowska Howells, lawyer at Leigh Day, says Volkswagen CEO Matthias M\u00fcller needs to give drivers more information about how the problem will be solved. She says: \u201cWe are nearly 6 weeks into this scandal and Volkswagen customers still do not know what is going to happen to their vehicles. \u201cIf Mr Mueller wishes to restore trust he could start by answering the specific questions we have asked him on behalf of UK drivers and start the process of setting up a compensation scheme. In our letter sent earlier this month we asked whether affected cars have valid EU type approval and what will Volkswagen be doing to compensate both owners of recently purchased vehicles, and secondhand vehicles. We have yet to receive a response. It must be surely within his power to answer these simple questions.\u201d Sales at VW are already down compared with last year, even before customers have reacted to the news that it cheated emissions tests. The company sold 7.43 million vehicles between January and September, a 1.5% decline on 2014. We can\u2019t blame that on the diesel scandal, though - as it only broke in mid-September. Instead, VW appears to be suffering from the weakening emerging markets. Sales actually rose in Western Europe and the US, but suffered a \u201cdrastic decline\u201d in South America and Eastern Europe. VW has warned shareholders that it faces legal risks from the diesel emissions scandal that cannot be assessed at present\u201d. In today\u2019s financial results, it cautions that: The ongoing investigations mean that assessment of the circumstances is subject to estimation risk. In particular, considerable financial charges may be incurred as the legal risks crystallize. The \u20ac6.7bn charge set aside to cover the cost of recalling and fixing engines with cheat software is probably not be the end of the matter..... Volkswagen has jumped to the top of the leaderboard on the Frankfurt stock exchange. After initially plunging, shares rallied by 3% in volatile trading. Investors may be reassured that things aren\u2019t even worse, even though VW posted a bigger loss that expected and warned that sales will be flat this year. However, at \u20ac108 each, shares are still around 30% below their pre-crisis levels. Porsche has warned that its profits will be lower than expected this year due to the emissions scandal. Porsche was acquired by Volkswagen in 2012, but still owns a 51% stake in VW (it\u2019s complicated...) so is clearly exposed to the crisis in Wolfsburg. Reuters has the details: Porsche SE said on Wednesday it now expects to post a 2015 profit after tax of \u20ac0.8 to \u20ac1.8bn, mainly due to the third quarter earnings slump of Volkswagen. \u201cPorsche SE\u2019s forecast is subject in particular to further findings in connection with the Diesel emissions issue,\u201d the group said in a statement. Here\u2019s Volkswagen\u2019s new chief, Matthias M\u00fcller, this morning\u2019s \u20ac3.48bn loss: \u201cThe figures show the core strength of the Volkswagen Group on the one hand, while on the other the initial impact of the current situation is becoming clear. We will do everything in our power to win back the trust we have lost.\u201d More gloom -- VW has warned that it won\u2019t achieve any sales growth this year. It says: The Volkswagen Group expects deliveries to customers in 2015 to remain on a level with the previous year in a persistently challenging market environment. And it is also warning shareholders that operating profits will tumble this year: Because of charges related to the irregularities in the software used for certain diesel engines, we expect 2015 operating profit for both the Group and the Passenger Cars Business Area to be down significantly year-on-year. Even if you ignore the huge cost of the emissions scandal, VW\u2019s profits are lower than a year ago. Operating profits after special items came in at \u20ac3.206bn, lower than the \u20ac3.23bn in Q3 2014. Volkswagen has set aside another \u20ac200m to cover the cost of the emissions scandal. Today\u2019s results include \u2018negative special items relating to diesel issue of \u20ac6.7bn\u201d. It had previously announced a charge of \u20ac6.5bn. This is the first time in at least 15 years that VW has reported a quarterly loss, according to Reuters. Breaking! Volkswagen has suffered a \u20ac3.48bn operating loss in the third quarter of 2015. As feared, the carmaker has been dragged into the red by the cost of the diesel emission scandal. That\u2019s even worse than the \u20ac3.26bn operational loss which analysts had expected (see opening post). That compares with a \u20ac3.23bn profit a year ago. This is mainly cause by the charge for recalling and fixing 11 million vehicles worldwide. And there\u2019s more bad news -- VW has cut its profit forecast for for the full year to include the impact of the crisis. It admits that earnings before interest and tax would drop \u201csignificantly.\u201d More details to follow.... Over in Tokyo, two top Volkswagen executives have said sorry for the emissions cheating scandal at the Tokyo Motor Show. Associated Press has the details: Volkswagen\u2019s new chief executive Herbert Diess apologized at the Tokyo auto show Wednesday for the automaker\u2019s emissions-cheating scandal, promising to win back customer trust, and said it will delay the launch of a diesel vehicle in Japan. The head of VW\u2019s Japan division Sven Stein, who appeared at the VW booth before Diess, bowed for several seconds in a Japanese style of apology. Diess made no bow. \u201cOn behalf of my entire company, I\u2019d like to apologize,\u201d said Diess, a recent hire from BMW, stressing that the priority is to fix the problem, uncover what happened and make sure the scandal never happens again. Diess added that VW will do everything possible to restore trust in the company. And here\u2019s Sven Stein\u2019s apologetic bow: Will it never end? Lloyds Banking Group has set aside another \u00a3500m to cover the cost of mis-selling payment protection insurance to its customers. That takes Lloyds\u2019 total PPI bill to around \u00a313.9bn (!). Volkswagen\u2019s new CEO is also heading to China this week, as part of Angela Merkel\u2019s trade delegation. Cars make up around a third of Germany\u2019s exports to China, so Matthias M\u00fcller\u2019s presence is an important signal to Beijing. The visit comes at a crucial time for Germany, given concerns that the global economy is slowing down and hurting its manufacturing sector. Merkel is also expected to seek an update on the diesel scandal from M\u00fcller during the trip. Jes Staley says it\u2019s \u201can honour\u201d to become Barclays new CEO, and has pledged to improve its reputation: He can also look forward to a fantastic pay package, if he gets the job right. Barclays has a new chief executive. The bank has just announced the appointment of Jes Staley, an American investment banker with a long career on Wall Street, to fill the top job. Staley\u2019s appointment isn\u2019t a shock - he\u2019d been rumoured to be the top candidate. By choosing him, Barclays appears to be rediscovering its love for investment banking: Our City editor Jill Treanor explains: The veteran investment banker spent more than 30 years at US bank JP Morgan before leaving in 2013 to join BlueMountain hedge fund. Staley replaces Antony Jenkins, who was ousted in July after three years attempting to restore Barclays\u2019 fortunes after the Libor rigging crisis. And here\u2019s a profile of Staley, including some fascinating detail from his brother: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. How much financial trouble is Volkswagen in? We\u2019ll get an insight this morning, when the troubled German carmaker releases financial results for the last quarter. And it could be a historic moment, for all the wrong reasons. VW is expected to announce its first quarterly loss in 15 years, due to the diesel emissions scandal. According to 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg, VW is expected to announce an operational loss of \u20ac3.26bn for the third quarter of 2015 -- a sharp reversal on the \u20ac3.23bn profit achieved a year ago. That\u2019s due to the cost of cleaning up the scandal, with VW already committed to taking a \u20ac6.5bn charge to cover the cost of recalling 11 million vehicles which contain software to cheat emission tests. And as the Wall Street Journal explains, VW faces a tough ride ahead: At a recent gathering of the company\u2019s top echelon of executives at the Porsche plant in Leipzig, Germany, Volkswagen chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller said the company has to go through a rough patch before profit returns to precrisis levels. \u201cWe have good prospects to shine again in two to three years,\u201d he said. Investors will want more details, given the slump in VW\u2019s share price since the scandal broke: Also coming up today.... The City will watching financial results from Lloyds, as the UK banking season kicks off. We\u2019ll have an eye on China, as German chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Beijing for a two-day trade mission..... ....and another eye on Brussels, as business secretary, Sajid Javid, travels to Brussels for high level talks with senior EU commissioners over the UK steel crisis. And over in America, the Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day policy meeting (at 6pm GMT). Investors don\u2019t expect the Fed to raise interest rates today, given recent weak economic data. Also, there\u2019s no press conference scheduled (although Janet Yellen could call an impromptu one if needed). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The euro fell markedly against the dollar after the ECB indicated last week that further easing is firmly on the table in December including possible interest rate cuts. That saw the euro briefly dip below $1.10 after testing $1.15 a week earlier.</p> <p>Now the Fed\u2019s indication that the door is open to a US interest rate hike in December has given the euro a renewed downward jolt, which is just what the ECB wants. It has plunged back through $1.10 and is currently testing $1.09</p> <p>The ECB will be delighted as it clearly wants a weaker euro to help lift eurozone inflation and boost growth</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-563116bee4b0be137010b818\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-28T18:41:26.998Z\">6.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Next week\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers and the next set of inflation numbers could be key as to whether the Fed does indeed raise rates in December, says James Knightley of ING Bank:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Federal Reserve has played it safe and left monetary policy unchanged. Jeffrey Lacker remains the only committee member voting for an immediate 25bp rate rise.</p> <p>The changes to the accompanying statement are small in number, but reasonably significant. On the dovish side, the Fed acknowledges that \u201cthe pace of jobs growth has slowed\u201d versus being viewed as \u201csolid\u201d in September. However, the rest of the statement seems to try and put the most positive spin possible. Household and business spending is expanding at \u201csolid rates\u201d whereas previously it was only described as \u201cincreasing moderately\u201d. They have also removed three lines about global risks possibly restraining economic activity and depressing inflation. This seems a remarkable turnaround. Furthermore, the statement specifically adds that \u201cin determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting...\u201d This suggests that the more hawkish element will be pushing hard for a December move should the data come in reasonably firm.<br></p> <p>Nonetheless we do need to see quite a big improvement in the economic data and a rise in inflation to give us real confidence in our call of a rate rise at the December FOMC meeting. In terms of the upcoming numbers, next week\u2019s labour report will be key, but with the consensus forecasting only a 177,000 rise in payrolls and the unemployment rate remaining at 5.1%, the doves are not going to be swayed much. We would probable need to see 200,000 plus readings in that and the November report and unemployment breaking 5% to realistically shift thinking.<br></p> <p>However, there may be more support for the hawks from the CPI reports. Core inflation is rising and there are clear signs of a pick-up in service sector inflation (led by housing and medical care costs). With the negative impulse from energy prices set to shrink markedly in coming months as last year\u2019s plunge in the oil price drops out of the annual comparison, we could see headline CPI quickly reach 1%. Indeed, even if ex-energy CPI just stays at 1.9% year on year and energy prices remain stable, headline CPI will be up to 1.6% year on year in the first quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-28T18:42:56.737Z\">at 6.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56311414e4b08fc9f96799ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-28T18:39:21.968Z\">6.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief US economist:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/statuses/659439347922567169\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> makes mention of tightening at the \u201cnext meeting\u201d depending on evolution of data; sounds like policymakers want to tighten</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged at their record low of near-zero, but raised the likelihood of a rate hike in December by dropping previous warnings about the fragility of the global economy. Following a two-day meeting in Washington, Fed policymakers voted to leave rates at 0-0.25% \u2013 where they have been for the seven years since the financial crisis. However, the bank\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the rate, significantly raised the prospect of a historic rate rise at its next meeting in December by removing cautious statements about unstable international markets could adversely effect the US economy. In September, following concerns about the health of the Chinese economy, the committee said: \u201cRecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.\u201d This was modified on Wednesday to: \u201cThe committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring global economic and financial developments.\u201d The committee specifically pointed towards the possibility of raising rates at its December meeting \u2013 the last of 2015. \u201cIn determining whether it will be appropriate to raise [rates] at its next meeting, the committee will assess progress \u2013 both realized and expected \u2013 toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation,\u201d it said in the statement. Nine out of 10 FOMC members voted to keep rates unchanged. That is the same proportion as in September with Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, being the only member to push for a 25 basis points increase. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chair, who did not hold a press conference on Wednesday, has previously said that she expects rates to be raised this year if the economy continues to improve. In the statement the committee said \u201ceconomic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace\u201d. \u201cHousehold spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft.\u201d But the Fed warned that the pace of job gains has \u201cslowed\u201d, while the unemployment rate held steady. It also repeated its warning that it wants to be \u201creasonably confident\u201d that currently ultra-low inflation will rise to its 2% target before it raises rates. Other central banks around the world are closely watching the Fed\u2019s process and a decision to increase rates is likely to lead to rates being raised across the world. James Knightley, a senior global economist at ING, said the changes to the language of the Fed statement were \u201csmall in number, but reasonably significant\u201d. \u201cOn the dovish side, the Fed acknowledges that \u2018the pace of jobs growth has slowed\u2019 versus being viewed as \u2018solid\u2019 in September,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the rest of the statement seems to try and put the most positive spin possible. Household and business spending is expanding at \u2018solid rates\u2019 whereas previously it was only described as \u2018increasing moderately\u2019. \u201cThey have also removed three lines about global risks possibly restraining economic activity and depressing inflation. This seems a remarkable turnaround. Furthermore, the statement specifically adds that \u2018in determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting \u2026\u2019 This suggests that the more hawkish element will be pushing hard for a December move should the data come in reasonably firm.\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expected a December rate hike if the jobs reports for October and November show the US labour market is getting stronger. \u201cSome combination of payrolls, unemployment and wages signalling continued improvement will be enough,\u201d he said. Financial markets, which are predicting a 34% chance of a rate hike in December, were virtually unchanged following the announcement. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 38.5 points (0.22%) to 17,620 points at 2.30pm ET.",

It also repeated its warning that it wants to be \u201creasonably confident\u201d that currently ultra-low inflation will rise to its 2% target before it raises rates. </p> <p>Other central banks around the world are closely watching the Fed\u2019s process and a decision to increase rates is likely to lead to rates being raised across the world. </p> <p>James Knightley, a senior global economist at ING, said the changes to the language of the Fed statement were \u201csmall in number, but reasonably significant\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cOn the dovish side, the Fed acknowledges that \u2018the pace of jobs growth has slowed\u2019 versus being viewed as \u2018solid\u2019 in September,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the rest of the statement seems to try and put the most positive spin possible. Household and business spending is expanding at \u2018solid rates\u2019 whereas previously it was only described as \u2018increasing moderately\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThey have also removed three lines about global risks possibly restraining economic activity and depressing inflation. This seems a remarkable turnaround. Furthermore, the statement specifically adds that \u2018in determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting \u2026\u2019 This suggests that the more hawkish element will be pushing hard for a December move should the data come in reasonably firm.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expected a December rate hike if the jobs reports for October and November show the US labour market is getting stronger. \u201cSome combination of payrolls, unemployment and wages signalling continued improvement will be enough,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Financial markets, which are predicting a 34% chance of a rate hike in December, were virtually unchanged following the announcement. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 38.5 points (0.22%) to 17,620 points at 2.30pm ET.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gulam Noon, Lord Noon, who has died aged 79, was the archetype of the successful immigrant businessman. He arrived in Britain with comparatively little, developed a highly successful business, unashamedly enjoyed the social, political and particularly royal contacts that his success brought, and ended up, finally, in the House of Lords. Along the way he helped to change Britain\u2019s eating habits. Known as the \u201ccurry king\u201d, he popularised Bombay mix and commercialised chicken tikka masala, helping it to supersede fish and chips as the nation\u2019s favourite dish. He gave away millions to charity in the UK and in his native India, where he financed schools and hospitals. He also donated hundreds of thousands to the Labour party, an act of generosity that led to embarrassment when he was unwittingly dragged into the cash-for-honours scandal that tarnished Tony Blair\u2019s government. Noon\u2019s commitment to the British way of life and his readiness to speak out against extremism made him a popular figure with politicians. He was an early voice warning against the influence of radical imams, and was one of the 25 Muslim leaders invited to Downing Street after 7/7. He sat on the committee that devised new procedures for becoming a British citizen. He was born Gulam Kaderbhoy in Bombay (now Mumbai), the third child of Kaderbhoy Ebrahimjee and Safiabai (nee Shirazi), but adopted as his surname the nickname, Noon, that his mother gave him. His grandfather\u2019s sweet-making business had two shops. But his indebted father died when Noon was seven and the family struggled, living in a single room while his determined mother and uncle rescued the business. Noon worked in the shops but, pretending that school started earlier than it did, regularly fitted in two hours of cricket, a lifelong passion, before lessons. At 17 he took over the shops and changed their name to Royal Sweets, which helped increase takings. Business expanded and Noon branched out, even buying an office block without his family\u2019s knowledge. In 1964 he made his first visit to Britain as a tourist, liked what he saw \u2013 \u201ca soft country\u201d he called it \u2013 and resolved to return. In the early 1970s he came back with \u00a350 (all the Indian exchange regulations permitted) and set up the Bombay Halwa sweetshop in Southall, west London. Initially he struggled, but would jokingly credit Idi Amin for his success when his wares proved popular with many of the Ugandan Asians expelled by Amin in 1972. He opened a branch in Leicester, a major centre for East African Asian settlement. Noon also became involved in aviation catering before, in partnership with an Indian hotel chain, he moved to the US to set up a factory supplying nine restaurants in New York. He described that venture as a \u201cdisaster\u201d, claiming that the US was not ready for Indian food. He sold his share in the business and returned to Britain in 1984, $1m poorer. However, his experience of food processing in the US and his rebranding of chicken tikka makhanwala as the simpler chicken tikka masala led him to establish Noon Products in 1988 to provide chilled and frozen meals for supermarkets. By 2006 the factory was employing 800 people and processing 80 tonnes of chicken a week. Noon\u2019s first order was for \u00a32.7m from Birds Eye, followed by Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose. He stayed loyal, not marketing his own brand for years, and they supported him when his factory burned down in 1994, after which Noon chose to pay his 250 workers while it was being rebuilt. In 2000 he sold out to WT Foods for \u00a350m and then bought the business back with the help of private equity before selling again to the Irish food group Kerry in 2005. By 2006 his personal fortune was estimated to be \u00a365m. Noon\u2019s blunt speaking was legendary. In 2008 he survived the terrorist siege of the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, barricading his room against gunmen in the corridor. When India refused to bury the terrorists, he described it \u201cas a good symbolic message for the rest of secular India,\u201d adding: \u201cNow Britain needs to get tough with the radical imams.\u201d In his book, Noon, With a View: Courage and Integrity (2008), he suggested a halt to immigration \u201cfor five or 10 years until all the newcomers have been properly integrated\u201d. He also defended his remark that \u201cthere is no substitute for money\u201d and enjoyed what it brought him. His London office in Queen Anne\u2019s Gate, Westminster, displayed autographed cricket bats and photographs of him with royalty and politicians. He was on the advisory council of the Prince\u2019s Trust and helped the University of East London to establish a centre for diversity in business, becoming the university\u2019s chancellor in 2013. He founded the Asian Business Association in 1995, and was president of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. His Gulam Noon charitable foundation was set up in 1995 with an initial \u00a34m in its coffers. However, it was his association with politicians that brought him into the headlines. He often sat with John Major supporting Surrey county cricket club at the Oval in London, but he was a Labour supporter and major donor who was on personal terms with Blair and Gordon Brown. When he was knighted in 2002, Jeremy Corbyn said he was \u201cvery disturbed\u201d about the way honours were given to donors. But the real row erupted in 2006 when Noon, who had lent the party \u00a3250,000, was proposed for a peerage. His nomination (along with others) was refused amid a storm of accusations that Labour party donors were being promised peerages. Noon was deeply hurt and withdrew his application, complaining that he had been let down by the party. He later claimed that he had declared his loan on his original form but had been persuaded to remove the wording. He also said he had been offered a Labour safe seat in recompense. Noon was generally regarded as not to blame, and there were no objections when he was proposed by Ed Miliband for the Lords in 2011. Noon\u2019s first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Mohini Kent, whom he married in 1998, and by two daughters, Zeenat and Zarmin, from his first marriage, to Raeka Abdulali. \u2022 Gulam Kaderbhoy Noon, businessman, born 24 January 1936; died 27 October 2015",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen boss Matthias M\u00fcller has vowed to be \u201cruthless in punishing those involved\u201d in the emissions-rigging scandal, which pushed the German carmaker \u20ac3.5bn into the red, its first quarterly loss in 15 years. Speaking before a trip to China with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, M\u00fcller apologised to shareholders and customers for the scandal. \u201cWe are leaving no stone unturned to find out what exactly happened and to make sure nothing like this ever happens again,\u201d he told analysts and investors. Volkswagen has hired professional services firm Deloitte to help with the investigation. At the Tokyo motor show, Herbert Diess, who runs the Volkswagen brand, and Sven Stein, the head of VW\u2019s Japanese division, also apologised for the scandal. Stein stood on stage and bowed for several seconds in a Japanese style apology. Setting out a five-point plan, M\u00fcller said that while Volkswagen\u2019s drive for perfection would continue, the company\u2019s mindset and culture would change. He promised a major reorganisation including decentralisation and faster decision making. A new strategy, named 2025, will be announced next summer. The carmaker wants to concentrate on quality not quantity, he said. It also plans to cut back its portfolio of more than 300 models and offer more electric cars. M\u00fcller\u2019s remarks came as Volkswagen posted an operating loss of \u20ac3.48bn in the third quarter against a profit of \u20ac3.2bn a year earlier. The loss was broadly in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts. The company expects 2015 operating profits to be down significantly on last year\u2019s \u20ac12.7bn as a result of the emissions fallout. The company took a \u20ac6.7bn charge to cover the cost of recalling 11m vehicles which contain software to cheat emission tests, up from the \u20ac6.5bn it had previously set aside. M\u00fcller was unable quantify potential penalties and litigation costs. Analysts estimate that Volkswagen\u2019s final bill could climb to \u20ac78bn as it faces regulatory fines and class-action lawsuits around the world. The company has increased cost cutting efforts and can cover part of the cost from its cash reserves. VW\u2019s chief financial officer, Frank Witter, said the financial fallout was \u201cenormous but manageable\u201d. There are no plans to cut the dividend. Volkswagen shares shrugged off the news and rose more than 4% during trading, making the firm the biggest riser on the German stock market. Nearly six weeks after Volkswagen admitted it cheated emissions tests in the US, M\u00fcller pledged: \u201cWe will do everything in our power to win back the trust we have lost.\u201d But Bozena Michalowska Howells, from UK law firm Leigh Day, who is investigating compensation claims on behalf of 6,500 British drivers, was not convinced. She said: \u201cVolkswagen customers still do not know what is going to happen to their vehicles. If Mr M\u00fcller wishes to restore trust he could start the process of setting up a compensation scheme.\u201d Moody\u2019s credit rating agency said it was reviewing the results as part of its assessment of Volkswagen\u2019s credit quality, adding that the emissions crisis had \u201cbecome an important consideration for the Volkswagen rating\u201d. Weaker prices for secondhand diesel cars pose additional risk. Group sales rose by 8.5% to \u20ac160bn in the third quarter. Volkswagen warned that deliveries to customers would be flat this year \u2013 on a par with last year\u2019s record \u20ac10.14m sales. However, sales chief Axel Kalthoff insisted that orders for diesel vehicles had not been affected by the scandal. Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche brand cut its full-year profit forecast by about \u20ac2bn as a result of the emissions scandal. It expects to post a 2015 profit after tax of \u20ac800m-1.8bn. Sebastiaan Van Doorn, assistant professor of enterprise at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cWhile VW has reported a loss, underlying sales numbers are robust. It is likely that VW, one of the largest employers in Germany, will survive this scandal \u2026 The losses associated with this scandal will be spread out over many years. \u201cThe greater worry is that VW does not seem eager to change much about its corporate policy, or change its hierarchical makeup and centralised decision-making strategies that break up the interface between the top management team and middle managers.\u201d On Monday, VW lost the coveted top spot for global car sales to Japanese rival Toyota, a few months after it achieved its longstanding ambition of becoming the world\u2019s bestselling car manufacturer. VW sales fell in China, the company\u2019s biggest export market, for the first time in a decade.",

      "bodyText": "Higher revenues from HIV drugs and flu vaccines have boosted quarterly sales and earnings at GlaxoSmithKline, more than offsetting a continued fall in sales for respiratory treatments. Sales rose by 9% to \u00a36.13bn in the three months to the end of September, the third quarter of the company\u2019s financial year. Analysts\u2019 average forecasts were for sales of \u00a36.08bn. Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company reported core earnings down by 18% to 23p a share, but higher than the 19.3p predicted by analysts. The results are for the second full quarter since GSK sold its cancer business to Novartis, bought the Swiss company\u2019s vaccines division and formed a consumer health joint venture. The deals left GSK with three big divisions: pharmaceuticals, consumer healthcare and vaccines. In pharmaceuticals, sales rose 1% as new products more than made up for a \u00a3182m fall in sales of GSK\u2019s top product, the asthma treatment Seretide, which now faces generic competition. The company said the standout performance was the 65% increase in sales of its HIV drugs, which GSK held on to in May after ditching plans to spin off the business. GSK shares rose almost 4% to \u00a314.18 and were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 index. Sir Andrew Witty, GSK\u2019s chief executive, has been under pressure to improve performance and demonstrate that the company has revenue sources to make up for the loss of exclusive rights to make Seretide. He said: \u201cThe benefits of the recent three-part transaction are becoming evident in our sales and earnings performance, and we have made good progress on our restructuring and integration programmes during the quarter. \u201cWe remain focused on delivering sustained improvements in operational performance and are confident in our outlook for the rest of this year and a return to earnings growth in 2016.\u201d Witty said GSK would unveil vaccines and drugs at an investor presentation next week that would underscore the group\u2019s long-term growth potential.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has pledged to award backdated compensation for high energy costs to struggling British steel producers as soon as the government gets clearance from Brussels. The prime minister\u2019s promise was delivered as steelworkers travelled to Westminster to make the case for political intervention in the industry. The compensation move was announced during prime minister\u2019s questions but was immediately denounced by opposition MPs as being too little too late during an emergency debate on the future of the industry. \u201cWe have been talking about the need for this compensation package for months,\u201d said the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, Andy McDonald. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the scales have just been removed from his eyes.\u201d Cameron\u2019s announcement referred to the energy-intensive industries\u2019 compensation package, which is part of a bundle of measures first announced two years ago and is designed to compensate steel producers for green levies. According to industry trade body UK Steel, the sector is paying \u00a34m a month in green levies, which is making it uncompetitive against its European rivals. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, described the prime minister\u2019s commitment as \u201csignificant\u201d. But he added: \u201cClearly there is a need to deliver this as a matter of urgency.\u201d Stace also urged the government to support using local steel in domestic contracts after reports that a multi-billion pound contract for armoured cars and ships would use Swedish steel. \u201cInsisting on a significant level of local content is one of the key ways in which government can support the steel sector, with defence being a key example,\u201d he said. Nearly 100 workers from south Wales and Rotherham watched the debate in the chamber while the business secretary, Sajid Javid, held crisis talks with EU officials in Brussels about the state of the industry. The steel industry, unions and Labour MPs have accused Javid of inaction following the closure of the Redcar steel plant on Teesside with the loss of 2,200 jobs, the administration of Caparo industries and the mothballing of Tata Steel mills in Scunthorpe and Scotland with 1,200 redundancies. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the steelworkers that Javid was a \u201cwaste of space\u201d who was \u201cpassing through\u201d in the hope of higher office. \u201cHe\u2019s told what\u2019s needed and then completely ignores it, but there hasn\u2019t been a single day when steel hasn\u2019t been raised by us,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cWe\u2019re up against it. They hold all the cards in their hands but we have to get them to do a U-turn \u2013 and I\u2019m an expert in U-turns.\u201d Andy Thompson, 29, one of the steelworkers who travelled to Westminster, said: \u201cIf this government lets the steel industry go, then industry as a whole doesn\u2019t have a future.\u201d Thompson, a section engineer for Tata Steel in Rotherham, said he would seek a new career in the NHS or at a university. But he praised his colleagues, who are working under uncertain conditions. \u201cSteelworkers are a breed apart,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stick together and there\u2019s a community spirit.\u201d Another steelworker at Westminster, who works at a four-fifths mothballed plant in Llanwern, south Wales, said that key skills were bound to drift away if the industry continued to struggle. \u201cEngineers are eminently employable and they will drift away,\u201d said Barry Hayman, a shift engineer for Tata Steel. The industry has been battered by falling steel prices, made worse by the dumping of cheap steel in Europe by China, high energy costs and the strength of the pound making exports expensive. Javid told MPs last week that the government was unable to dictate the price of steel or to get round EU restrictions on national governments supporting industries. But pressure has been building on the government to act. Unions last week attacked government pledges to help steelworkers find new jobs and support new businesses as woefully inadequate. Anna Soubry, the small business, industry and enterprise minister, told a committee of MPs on Tuesday that the government would respond to industry demands for more support.",

      "bodyText": "Meggitt lost almost a quarter of its market value after the FTSE 100 engineer warned annual profit would be well below forecasts and that it would cut about 300 jobs. Shares in the maker of parts for the aerospace, military and energy industries tumbled by 24% after a grim trading update, wiping more than \u00a3800m off the company\u2019s value. The Bournemouth-based company, which employs about 10,500 people worldwide, said revenues fell 1% in the third quarter of the year because of a sharp drop-off in business during September. Lack of demand for aircraft parts meant sales at Meggitt\u2019s civil aviation arm, which makes up almost half group revenues, were flat. Revenues from the defence industry, accounting for a third of sales, fell 2%. Sales to the energy industry, which make up a tenth of group income, dropped 16% as demand for equipment for oil rigs fell away. The company said: \u201cThese factors are expected to persist through the fourth quarter, which will result in underlying operating profit for the year being meaningfully below the current company-compiled consensus estimate of \u00a3369m. \u201cIn response to current trading conditions, we have expanded our cost reduction activity and are assessing options to reduce our global employee base by approximately 300.\u201d Analysts at the stockbroker Investec said weak trading appeared to have spread throughout the energy business. They took the profit warning to mean group profit would be about 10% less than expected this year with a bigger hit next year. Meggitt\u2019s surprise update follows a string of profit warnings from companies such as Pearson, the educational publisher, Argos owner Home Retail Group and Chemring, the military equipment maker, this month. Britain\u2019s manufacturers have suffered waning demand at home and abroad as global growth falters and China\u2019s economy slows. The steep fall in the oil price has hit companies supplying the energy sector such as Rolls-Royce, which warned on profits in July. Meggitt\u2019s warning marks an abrupt change in its fortunes. In August, the company was upbeat as it reported a 6% rise in first-half profit with higher military spending making up for weaker trading at the energy business. Debt will be higher relative to earnings as a result of the profit shortfall, the company said.",

      "bodyText": "Petra Diamonds has lost its sparkle after the company reported falling prices and said it was in talks with its bankers about debt covenants. Following the news, its shares have fallen 6.65p or more than 8% to 73.8p. It reported no revenues in the first quarter, with its first diamond sale of the financial year not until October. The sale yielded $68.9m but amid oversupply of polished stones and a slowdown in Chinese demand, Petra said diamond prices were down 8.8% in dollar terms compared to the previous quarter. The weakening of the rand helped mitigate the effect of lower dollar prices. Production during the quarter rose 1% to a record 842.796 carats, and the company said it was on track to meet its full year targets. The company has $306m of debt, up from $171m in June and it said: Petra has initiated discussions with its bankers to ensure than its senior lender covenants are appropriate for the business and will update shareholders in that regard in the near future. Shore Capital analyst Yuen Low said: Although the reported weakening in diamond prices will come as no surprise to anyone, and despite that the strong production performance and that the shares have already fallen significantly this year, we expect another red day today. Analysts at Sanlam said: Despite the recent drop in the share price there is continued uncertainty regarding the diamond price outlook and sales. Although this morning\u2019s announcement notes that on a like-for-like basis diamond prices were down 8.8%, sales were around 30% down, reflecting lower volume demand. We put our Petra Diamonds numbers under review when its 2015 results were published (September 18) and maintain this position given the uncertain outlook. Unfortunately the market will start looking at the debt position again (currently $306m). No recommendation and no forecasts for now. Canaccord Genuity kept its buy rating, saying: In early September we cut our diamond price assumptions by 10% from Petra\u2019s July guidance levels, and while we are surprised that there is no change in price guidance in this release, we believe that guidance will need to be reduced later in the financial year. Quality of stones should improve through the year, but prices achieved in the October tender are well below full-year guidance. We see value in Petra shares at the current share price (80p) as the Cullinan and Finsch mines producer increasing volumes of higher grade ROM ore, but there is no doubting the difficult trading conditions that the company faces. And FinnCap said: The company has maintained its previous diamond price guidance on the basis that it is expecting an improved product mix in the second half of the year. However, we are taking a somewhat more cautious approach in view of the continuing negative comments from elsewhere in the diamond sector. We were using diamond prices of guidance minus 5% and we now move to guidance minus 10%. As a result, our target price reduces from 210p to 191p. Investec issued a positive note, saying the share price reaction was a buying opportunity: Whilst news flow on diamonds is bearish, that management have not changed pricing guidance for now is a positive. Like-for-like diamond pricing down 8.8% quarter on quarter is a reflection of developments well known to the market from updates on De Beers auctions. Furthermore, operational guidance is unchanged and rand weakness is helping to offset weaker revenues. We concede that net debt shows a big shift from $172m to $306m, although this is in part a function of auction timings as well as rising capital expenditure as the company builds a new plant at Cullinan and continues its mine development. In some respects, undertaking this work in the context of a weakening rand is a bonus to shareholders as costs will be reduced. Petra\u2019s growth profile should outweigh concerns over the health of the diamond market as volumes ramp up toward 5m carats per annum. If future quarters reflect continued operational delivery, the stock should re-rate materially. We place our target price and forecasts under review.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group intends to lobby the City regulator for an earlier cut-off point for customers\u2019 claims on payment protection insurance compensation, as its bill for the scandal reaches almost \u00a314bn. The bailed-out bank took another \u00a3500m provision for PPI in the third quarter and admitted it was facing an additional charge of \u00a3100m for potential claims on other products sold through branches. Lloyds\u2019 PPI update came as the bank reported a 33% increase in profits to \u00a32.1bn in the first nine months of the year, after a sharp fall in bad debts negated a fall in revenue. But the market was disappointed with the performance, and shares in the bank \u2013 now less than 11% owned by taxpayers, down from 43% at the time of the 2008 crisis \u2013 were among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, dropping 4.5% to 74p. As the bank\u2019s provision for PPI hit \u00a313.9bn, the finance director, George Culmer, said a proposal by the Financial Conduct Authority to put a 2018 time bar on claims did not go far enough. \u201cWe think a shorter time bar \u2026 will get people to act more quickly,\u201d said Culmer. \u201cWe think two years is excessive,\u201d he said. Lloyds accounts for half the industry\u2019s total bill for the PPI scandal, under which the FCA is trying to draw a line by setting a time limit for claims. The regulator intends to consult on the proposal and also on the implications for a court ruling given to a customer, Susan Plevin, who received compensation because of the commission paid to the seller of her PPI policy. Lloyds also admitted it could need to take further PPI provisions \u201cif reactive complaint volumes do not decline or the decline is delayed\u201d. These are the bank\u2019s first results since George Osborne announced he would sell \u00a32bn of its shares to the public at a discount next year. Lloyds will have to foot the bill for the sale, which is likely to to amount to \u00a320m, Culmer said. They are also the first figures since the Competition and Markets Authority said it would step back from draconian measures to break up banks to bolster competition. Lloyds is the market leader with a 25% share of current accounts, although its chief executive, Anto\u0301nio Horta-Oso\u0301rio, said proposals to make it easier to switch accounts would prove costly for the industry. A year ago, Horta-Oso\u0301rio had announced plans to axe 9,000 jobs and close 200 branches as part of a new three-year strategy for the bank. The government has received \u00a315.5bn from offloading its stake in the bank through a series of stock market sales. But the shares are now trading very close to the average price at which the taxpayer\u2019s stake was acquired \u2013 73.6p. Lloyds said its effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter, higher than the corporation tax rate, in part because Osborne was no longer allowing the cost of the PPI scandal to be tax deductible.",

      "bodyText": "BT\u2019s proposed \u00a312.5bn takeover of EE, the UK\u2019s largest mobile phone operator, has been given provisional clearance by the competition watchdog after it said the deal was unlikely to damage consumers. The Competition and Markets Authority said the deal, agreed in February, was \u201cnot expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition\u201d and did not propose any changes in the terms of the deal. \u201cThe group does not provisionally believe that, in a dynamic and evolving sector, it is more likely than not that BT/EE will be able to use its position to damage competition or the interests of consumers,\u201d John Wooton, chair of the CMA inquiry, said. Shares in BT rose 4% to 470p shortly after the announcement on Wednesday morning. BT is the dominant player in broadband services in the UK, while EE is the largest mobile provider, with 27 million customers. Through its Openreach division, BT also owns the infrastructure over which much of the UK\u2019s broadband is delivered via other companies such as Sky, as well as providing capacity to mobile operators to transfer data from phone masts to other networks. However, the CMA\u2019s inquiry decided there was little overlap between BT and EE\u2019s core markets and that it would be unlikely the merged business would \u201chave both the ability and incentive\u201d to use its position as a wholesale provider of broadband to interfere with competitors. The authority said it would delay publication of its final ruling on the deal by eight weeks until 18 January to consider all responses to the decision. The chief executive of BT, Gavin Patterson, welcomed the deal: \u201cThe combined BT and EE will be good for the UK, providing investment and ensuring consumers and businesses can benefit from further innovation in a highly competitive market.\u201d BT is subject to a separate investigation by Ofcom into its position in the broadband market as part of the regulator\u2019s wider review of competition in digital communications, with some competitors calling for it to be forced to sell off Openreach. Vodafone, the UK\u2019s third-largest mobile phone operator, behind EE and O2, said it was disappointed by the CMA\u2019s decision. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe strongly believe the combination of the UK\u2019s dominant supplier of digital fixed infrastructure, upon which all other providers rely, with the largest mobile operator would have a negative impact on the market and services available to millions of UK consumers and businesses.\u201d BT has pushed into pay-TV in recent years with substantial investments in sports rights, bringing it into increasing conflict with Britain\u2019s leading pay-TV provider, Sky, which has also become a big player in UK broadband. Sky plans to offer customers mobile contracts through a deal with O2, the UK\u2019s second-largest operator. EE is joint owned by former state telecoms companies, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom and Orange in France, and both governments retain stakes in the businesses. Under the proposed deal, Deutsche Telekom and Orange would gain small stakes in BT.",

      "body": "<p>BT\u2019s proposed \u00a312.5bn takeover of EE, the UK\u2019s largest mobile phone operator, has been given provisional clearance by the competition watchdog after it said the deal was unlikely to damage consumers. </p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority said the deal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/05/bt-to-buy-ee-4g-broadband\">agreed in February</a>, was \u201cnot expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition\u201d and did not propose any changes in the terms of the deal.</p> <p>\u201cThe group does not provisionally believe that, in a dynamic and evolving sector, it is more likely than not that BT/EE will be able to use its position to damage competition or the interests of consumers,\u201d John Wooton, chair of the CMA inquiry, said. Shares in BT rose 4% to 470p shortly after the announcement on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>BT is the dominant player in broadband services in the UK, while EE is the largest mobile provider, with 27 million customers. Through its Openreach division, BT also owns the infrastructure over which much of the UK\u2019s broadband is delivered via other companies such as Sky, as well as providing capacity to mobile operators to transfer data from phone masts to other networks. </p> <p>However, the CMA\u2019s inquiry decided there was little overlap between BT and EE\u2019s core markets and that it would be unlikely the merged business would \u201chave both the ability and incentive\u201d to use its position as a wholesale provider of broadband to interfere with competitors. The authority said it would delay publication of its final ruling on the deal by eight weeks until 18 January to consider all responses to the decision.</p> <p>The chief executive of BT, Gavin Patterson, welcomed the deal: \u201cThe combined BT and EE will be good for the UK, providing investment and ensuring consumers and businesses can benefit from further innovation in a highly competitive market.\u201d</p> <p>BT is subject to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/16/bt-openreach-broadband-ofcom-review\">a separate investigation by Ofcom</a> into its position in the broadband market as part of the regulator\u2019s wider review of competition in digital communications, with some competitors calling for it to be forced to sell off Openreach. </p> <p>Vodafone, the UK\u2019s third-largest mobile phone operator, behind EE and O2, said it was disappointed by the CMA\u2019s decision. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe strongly believe the combination of the UK\u2019s dominant supplier of digital fixed infrastructure, upon which all other providers rely, with the largest mobile operator would have a negative impact on the market and services available to millions of UK consumers and businesses.\u201d</p> <p>BT has pushed into pay-TV in recent years with substantial investments in sports rights, bringing it into increasing conflict with Britain\u2019s leading pay-TV provider, Sky, which has also become a big player in UK broadband.</p> <p>Sky plans to offer customers mobile contracts through a deal with O2, the UK\u2019s second-largest operator.</p> <p>EE is joint owned by former state telecoms companies, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom and Orange in France, and both governments retain stakes in the businesses. Under the proposed deal, Deutsche Telekom and Orange would gain small stakes in BT.</p>",

BT is leading the way, up 15.75p or 3.5% at 467.75p as the Competitions and Markets Authority provisionally cleared its \u00a312.5bn purchase of mobile operator EE. The news comes a day before BT reports results, and Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Though the UK telecoms giant doesn\u2019t report until tomorrow, news that CMA has approved its EE merger is likely sweeter than anything the company can produce with its second quarter 2016 results. Analysts also believe the news could spur further takeovers in the sector. Elsewhere British American Tobacco has added 70p to 3863.5p after a reassuring update. Its revenues for the first nine months of the year fell 6.5%, thanks to currency fluctuations. Excluding this they rose 4.2%, benefitting from price rises. Rival Imperial Tobacco has risen 44p to \u00a334.98. Satellite communications group Inmarsat has climbed 14p to 983p as Credit Suisse raised its target price from \u00a310.30 to \u00a310.80 with an outperform rating. The bank lifted its revenue forecasts for 2017 to 2018 by 3% to 5% and said: We update our estimates to reflect (1) the recent successful launch of the 3rd GX satellite; (2) the recent air-to- ground deal with Deutsche Telekom/Lufthansa; (3) an Inmarsat contract win announced by the US DoD on 8 September 2015; and (4) the now assumed launch of the 4th GX satellite. With GX now global we believe Inmarsat will have a sizeable competitive advantage over its peers for at least 1-2 years. We are ~3% ahead of 2017 post-event consensus EBITDA But Meggitt has slumped 101.9p or more than 22% to 359.5p after the engineering group warned profits would be meaningfully below forecasts after a fall in defence sales, added to a weak performance from its energy business. Investec said: We expect 2015 consensus earnings per share will likely come down by around 10%, and by more in 2016. Today\u2019s warning raises questions on the timing of recent acquisitions and the cessation of the share buyback given weakness in the core businesses. We place our forecasts, target price and recommendation under review. Miners continue to come under pressure amid weak commodity prices on worries about global growth, particularly in China. Antofagasta is down 12.5p at 532p after it cut its full year production forecast for the third time this year. Lloyds Banking Group has lost 3.41p to 73.99p as it put aside a further \u00a3500m to cover claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance. Barclays is down 0.95p at 249.9p as it confirmed former JP Morgan director Jes Staley as its new chief executive on a pay package worth up to \u00a38.24m. Next has lost 80p to \u00a378.65 despite an in-line third quarter sales update and a small rise in its full year forecasts. But ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, which is unlikely to sanction a rate rise but will be scoured for evidence of the bank\u2019s thinking on policy for the rest of the year, the FTSE 100 is up 18.30 points at 6383.57.",

      "bodyText": "The American banker Jes Staley has been named as the new chief executive of Barclays on a \u00a310m pay package and immediately played down expectations of a revival of the group\u2019s troublesome investment banking arm. The 58-year-old arrives at the bank amid a restructuring that is expected to result in 19,000 job cuts, as the investment bank is scaled back. Barclays is also preparing for new rules requiring riskier investment banking businesses to be ringfenced from high-street banking operations. Staley, who will take over on 1 December, told staff he wanted to focus on bolstering returns to shareholders but also on improving behaviour that was called into question as a result of the Libor-rigging crisis. He also signalled he would pursue a collaborative relationship with regulators and pointed to a continued streamlining of the investment bank. In a memo to staff he said: \u201cI feel keenly we must continue to strengthen trust in Barclays. The trust of our customers and clients, reciprocated in our commitment and service to them, is the foundation of our success, the most valuable quality we can nurture and the key to unlocking shareholder value. \u201cWe must therefore complete the cultural transformation of the group. There can be no retreat from becoming a values-driven organisation which conducts itself with integrity at all times. My ambition is to restore Barclays to its rightful standing \u2013 successful, admired and well regarded by all.\u201d The veteran investment banker spent more than 30 years at JP Morgan before leaving in 2013 to join the hedge fund BlueMountain. To avoid a hefty payout, he is not being bought out of his stake in the hedge fund but will just become a retired partner. Barclays is, however, handing him shares expected to be worth around \u00a32m to buy him out of bonus schemes he still has from JP Morgan. Staley will be on fixed pay of \u00a32.7m a year \u2013 which includes a \u00a31.2m salary and role-based allowance to sidestep EU rules on capping bonuses \u2013 as well as annual bonuses of up to \u00a32.1m and a long-term incentive plan of \u00a33.2m. If all those bonuses are met, Staley could receive just over \u00a38m a year \u2013 but will be paid \u00a310m in his first year because of the \u00a32m JP Morgan payment. He will also a receive a relocation allowance to move from the US. He replaces Antony Jenkins, who was ousted in July after three years attempting to restore Barclays\u2019 fortunes after the Libor crisis. Staley told employees there would be a focus on personal, corporate and digital banking, as well as Africa, and Barclaycard. \u201cWe will complete the necessary transformation and repositioning of the investment bank to a less capital-intensive model,\u201d he said. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said Staley\u2019s remarks indicated a radical restructuring was possible and the bank is expected to face questions about Staley\u2019s intentions when it reports its third-quarter figures on Thursday. \u201cWe had warmed to Barclays on the basis that it was de-emphasising the relatively low-return investment banking business within the mix, and we would see a material reversal of this strategy as a negative to the investment case. However, if it is simply a case of ensuring that a smaller investment banking business generates the best possible return on equity, then we would view this as a positive,\u201d said Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital. Staley had been considered for the role at the time Jenkins was appointed to replace another US investment banker, Bob Diamond, but the bank went for the safer option at a time of heated debate about the role of bankers following the Libor-rigging crisis. Staley has resigned from a non-executive position at the Swiss bank UBS as a result of his appointment at Barclays. John McFarlane, who became chairman this year and has promised to boost returns to shareholders, had been the interim chief executive. McFarlane said he knew Staley well as a result of the recruitment process. \u201cWe are in agreement on the way forward. He is a man of enormous integrity, and someone who both understands the business, but also the importance of cultural reform and the need to conduct our business in a way that we can all be proud of,\u201d he said. Staley\u2019s recruitment was overseen by the nominations committee, chaired by non-executive Sir Mike Rake, who intends to leave the bank. Rake said the committee was unanimous in picking Staley.",

      "bodyText": "Forget retirement worries: once a fat cat, always a fat cat. The top 100 chief executive are sitting on pension pots worth $4.9bn (\u00a33.2bn) \u2013 equal to the total retirement savings of 116 million of the poorest Americans, according to a study released by the Institute of Policy Studies on Wednesday. The average of the top 100 CEO retirement funds is $49.3m, enough to generate monthly retirement cheques of $277,686. The average monthly payment works out at 16 times the amount Barack Obama is due to receive when he leaves office. According to the Government Accountability Office, nearly 29% of US households with members aged 55 or older have neither retirement savings nor a traditional pension plan. But even the top 100 CEOs will be left feeling poor next to David Novak, executive chairman of Yum Brands, which owns the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands. According to the study, Novak has the largest nest egg: $234m, which will translate to monthly retirement payments of $1.3m for the rest of his life. Most of the Yum\u2019s 537,000 staff, who work part-time in 41,000 restaurants around the world, receive nothing from the company towards their retirement. Just 8,828 of its employees in the US have any money in a 401k, according to filings with the Department of Labor. Yum said it offers every company employee a 401k retirement savings plan that includes a 6% dollar-for-dollar match with no vesting period and low fees. Novak\u2019s pension pot comes on top of annual pay of $10.5m and benefits including $300,000 worth of private jet travel. Yum declined to comment on how many of its restaurant employees are paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but a large proportion are likely to be on the minimum or only a few dollars above it. Under Novak, who recently moved to become executive chairman after 15 years as CEO, Yum has been a key player lobbying against Obama\u2019s plan to increase the minimum wage. The proposal has fallen flat and is very unlikely to become law before the end of Obama\u2019s tenure. Solo Littlejohn, who works as a cook in a KFC in Cicero, Illinois, said it was \u201cunfair\u201d that Novak will collect so much money in retirement when hundreds of thousands of Yum employees don\u2019t have enough money to adequately feed their children or heat their homes. \u201cIt is a huge amount of money, and proves that they can afford to pay us $15 an hour,\u201d said Littlejohn, who lives with his wife and three step-children. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that much money. I don\u2019t expect to make a huge amount, but I expect to be able to make a decent living wage to take care of my family.\u201d Littlejohn said he had no savings to speak of let alone a pension plan. \u201cI don\u2019t have healthcare or anything.\u201d A spokesman for Yum said Novak\u2019s pension fund was so large because of the good performance of share award bonuses over his 29 years with the company. \u201cHe chose to defer the majority of his compensation in Yum stock as he believes in the long-term growth of the company, and this has been reported in the proxy every year,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cDuring Novak\u2019s leadership, Yum\u2019s total shareholder return increased over 1100% compared to the S&amp;P 500, which increased 190%.\u201d Much of the CEOs\u2019 retirement money has been placed in accounts that allow far less tax to be paid than allowed in workers\u2019 saving plans. Sarah Anderson, one of the authors of the Institute for Policy Studies report said: \u201cThe CEO-worker retirement divide has turned our country\u2019s already extreme income divide into an even wider economic chasm. And what few realize is that the trends of expanding CEO pensions and increasing worker retirement insecurity are inextricably linked.\u201d Michael Pryce-Jones, governance director of CtW Investment Group, an arm of Change to Win which campaigns for better corporate governance on behalf of workers, said: \u201cNovak\u2019s retirement package reflects a culture of entitlement that has little to no justification in promoting shareholder value while the gulf in the retirement security of rank and file employees exposes the company\u2019s warped approach to human capital management.\u201d",
