      "bodyText": "Remember Nat Rothschild's confident boast to the Financial Times in January last year about the riches in prospect for backers of his big Indonesian coal deal? \"I wanted to do a transaction sufficiently large so that the shareholders of Vallar have a platform on which to go and build a company which is an FTSE 100 entrant. We will be,\" said Rothschild. No, you won't be. Monday's news \u2013 an investigation into \"potential financial and other irregularities in the company's Indonesian operations\" \u2013 took shares in Bumi plc, the renamed Vallar, down by almost a quarter to 148p, at which level the company is worth a miserable \u00a3300m. The price compares to the \u00a310-a-pop at which Rothschild issued shares to raise \u00a3707m in the summer of 2010. The theory in those days was that Rothschild and a collection of great and good British non-executive directors would impose London-style standards of boardroom governance on assets from emerging markets \u2013 in the first instance coalmines from the powerful Bakrie family's Indonesian empire. Nice idea, but it didn't take long for two fundamental flaws to be exposed. First, it's hard to throw your weight around when you've got only a 29% holding, which is the size of Bumi plc's stake in Bumi Resources, the heavily indebted Jakarta-listed coal group. Second, the complicated finances of the Bakrie family, Rothschild's partner in the adventure, seemed to rely on coal prices staying high. When the price of coal started to fall last year the original shareholding arrangements unravelled at speed as Samin Tan, another Indonesian businessman, bought half the Bakries' 47% stake in Bumi plc. The net result was that Rothschild himself, after calling for a \"radical cleaning up\" of Bumi Resources and a faster repayment of debts, was relegated from co-chairman of Bumi plc to join the likes of Lord Renwick and Sir Julian Horn-Smith in the ranks of ordinary non-executive directors. But Bumi Resources' towering debts, estimated to be about $4bn (\u00a32.5bn), remain as troublesome as ever. Now comes the real shocker \u2013 the allegations, via a whistleblower, of dishonesty. The backdrop here is Bumi Resources' $800m of investments in non-coal projects, including oil in Yemen. Bumi plc wrote off the value of its share of most of those stakes in last year's accounts. But \"potential irregularities,\" to be investigated by a firm of independent lawyers, obviously raise the question of whether Vallar/Bumi did sufficient due diligence in the first place. After all, most of the investments pre-date last year's all-share deal to buy the stake in Bumi Resources. If irregularities are confirmed, expect to hear the UK board members argue that extensive checks were made at the outset and that they were, in any case, dealing with a large listed company in Jakarta subject to its own auditing process from the international firm of Mazars. Well, we'll see how solid that argument looks when the investigation is complete. None of this would matter so much if the only losers were the likes of Nat Rothschild and his wealthy friends. But other victims in Bumi's sorry tale include everyday savers whose money is invested in pension funds that track stock market indices. Bumi, thankfully, never made it to the FTSE 100, where the big tracker money kicks in, but it is a member of the Mid 250 index and the All-Share index, both of which also attract tracker funds. That means London's reputation as a financial centre is affected. It is surely now time to call a halt to the rush to London of foreign natural resources companies with sub-par governance arrangements and complicated shareholding structures \u2013 or, at least, exclude such companies from indices. What the Bumi tale has exposed is that the supposed comforts for outside investors often mean little. Bumi was founded by a member of a dynamic financial dynasty, has famous directors and was advised by the pukka investment banking outfit JP Morgan. Yet original backers are sitting on a 85% loss in about 18 months because of factors that extend well beyond the decline in the price of coal. Mind you, special condemnation should be reserved for the subscribers to Vallar's fund-raising in 2010. They were putting money into nothing more than a cash shell on the promise-cum-expectation that Rothschild would find a lucrative deal; at that stage, Indonesian coalmines hadn't even been identified as a potential target. That's not investment \u2013 it's just punting blindly. Of course, subscribers to private equity funds play a similar game. But there are two critical differences. First, in private equity you get a range of investments, not just one colossal bet. Second, ordinary investors are not affected when the inevitable disasters occur.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The stock market comeback of Vince Power, the self-styled king of gigs, ended in disaster on Monday as the ailing company behind the Benicassim and Hop Farm festivals threw in the towel and prepared to call in administrators. Industry experts blamed Music Festivals Group's financial woes on the wet summer and competition from rivals \u2013 even though Glastonbury and the Big Chill took gap years \u2013 and one-off events such as the Olympics. The Mean Fiddler impresario's return to public life was high-risk. Power owns 23% and, along with relatives, the family stake adds up to more than 40%. Like other investors, they face being left with nothing. Power had also propped up the company with a \u00a3750,000 unsecured loan in July. \"Over the last three or four years there has been a growing sense that the market has become too crowded,\" said Dave Newton, director at the box office website We Got Tickets. \"There is a bit of auto-correction going on.\" The number of festivals is estimated to have mushroomed to about 700 in the past decade and this year industry figures also complained of the pressure caused by a growing number of free music events such as Radio 1's Big Weekend in Hackney, which attracted 100,000 people. With the squeeze on consumer spending hitting all age groups, many Britons thought twice about what can add up to expensive weekends away. \"Prices have accelerated too much,\" said Newton. \"People are being asked to pay \u00a3100 for a ticket that five years ago would have cost \u00a335.\" Power has been described as the father of the commercial British festival, laying claim to hosting the first legal raves as well as turning around Reading and Glastonbury. But his Midas touch eluded him this time round with Music Festivals' life on the junior stock market proving shorter than that of a boy band assembled at the judges' houses stage of the X Factor competition. The shares debuted at 66.5p last June, valuing the company at just shy of \u00a310m, but were suspended on Friday at just 2.12p, making the company worth just \u00a3310,000. The feisty Irishman had vowed never to return to the public arena after a stormy relationship with the City during his time at the helm of Mean Fiddler, the music promoter he sold for \u00a338m in 2005. But he was lured back after losing nearly \u00a38m in 2010 when his music promotions and pubs business, Vince Power Music Group, went under. The apparently flourishing festival market presented the opportunity to rebuild his depleted fortune, he said, although the initial public offering, which raised \u00a36.5m from investors including Isis Equity Partners and Axa Framlington, took longer than expected as lacklustre ticket sales for blockbuster festivals such as Reading put off some potential backers. Bad vibes started to emerge from the company at the start of the summer when it told investors that ticket sales for Benicassim and Hop Farm looked disappointing. In the end, Hop Farm, held in Kent and headlined by Bob Dylan, proved to be loss-making, while Benicassim was hammered by the recession and punishing levels of youth unemployment in Spain. Despite offering acts such as the Stone Roses and Florence + the Machine, the Valencia festival would prove to be much less profitable than in 2011. By August the picture had darkened with the company saying it expected to make a \"material loss\" for the year and admitting it was casting around for a financial lifeline from investors. Last week it said that search had proved fruitless and moved for its shares to be suspended. \"The board has in recent weeks pursued a number of different funding proposals but the company has not been able to procure the necessary funding it requires,\" it said in a statement. Last year the company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3800,000 on sales of \u00a313m and at that time had no debt. With no formal appointment of administrators it remains unclear how much money is owed to its suppliers. Claire O'Neill, of the Association of Independent Festivals, said its 40 members, who include the organisers of Womad, have reported \"mixed experiences\" this year but the overall picture was not of doom and gloom, pointing to events such as Bestival and End of the Road, which sold out, albeit later than in previous years. \"There has been a huge increase in the number of festivals and for every new one that have popped up, others have fallen by the wayside,\" said O'Neill, adding that it was the festival brands with the most distinct identities that were prospering. \"Festivals can't be carbon copied and rolled out on a production line ... a successful festival needs a unique identity that people relate to and want to go and see.\" After selling Mean Fiddler, Power vowed never to return to the public arena, signing off with \"I was never a big plc fan\". This time round the feeling is probably mutual. Rise and fall 1982 Vince Power opens the Mean Fiddler in Harlesden, north-west London. He opens many more venues and events, such as the Jazz Cafe and the Forum in London and the Reading festival, as he turns the business into the largest music promoter in Europe. 2001 Floats the company on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM). 2002 Signs three-year deal with Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis to take operational control of the festival and a 40% stake in Eavis's company. Credited with turning Glastonbury into a bigger, more successful event. 2005 Sells Mean Fiddler for \u00a338m. 2008 Starts Hop Farm festival in Kent. 2010 Loses nearly \u00a38m when music promotions and pub business Vince Power Music Group goes under. 2011 Launches Feis festival in Finsbury Park, north London \u2013 a celebration of Irish music and a restaging of his successful Fleadh festival of the 1990s. Music Festivals business also controls the Benicassim festival, held on the Costa del Azahar in eastern Spain, which attracts 150,000 people a year. 2011 Floats his promotions company Music Festivals on AIM after raising \u00a36.5m from investors.

But some seemingly startling initial successes caused some to ponder if he might become known as the richest Rothschild of them all. His frenetic deal-making prompted last year's Sunday Times Rich List to value him at more than \u00a31bn in his own right, with stakes in the then embryonic mining vehicle Vallar (now Bumi) and Chateau Lafite said to be worth around \u00a3400m alone. Meanwhile, holdings in the businesses of friends and family enlarged the pot further, with Rothschild's shares in Rusal \u2013 the aluminium giant of his Russian oligarch pal Oleg Deripaska \u2013 plus more in commodity trader Glencore and investment trust RIT Capital Partners, also valued at about \u00a3150m. This fortune was even further enhanced by stakes in electrical group Volex and money made from his hedge fund, Atticus. But a good chunk of that wealth, along with his self-styled reputation as a corporate governance guardian, is now under strain. Bumi's share price was already causing investors to ask uncomfortable questions about the financier's sales pitch even before news that has caused the shares to crash over the past two days. Meanwhile, Rothschild's stake in Genel, his oil creation founded along almost identical lines to Bumi and run by former BP boss Tony Hayward, is doing little better. Genel investors who bought shares at the flotation are currently nursing losses of around 24%.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund dropped the broadest of hints on Monday night that it would give Greece more time to implement its hardline cuts programme as it warned that Europe posed a \"critical risk\" to a weakening global economy. Christine Lagarde, the Fund's managing director, said the Washington-based institution was \"prepared to be flexible\" and said both growth and austerity were needed to put an end to a crisis which will next month again force the IMF to cut its global growth forecasts. The head of the IMF was speaking as financial markets responded nervously to Portugal's decision to dilute its deficit-reduction programme, the protracted talks over a new package of help for Greece, and mounting political pressure on the Spanish government over its package of cuts and tax increases. Pedro Passos Coelho, Portugal's prime minister, said his government was abandoning plans to raise employee social security payments from 11% to 18% of their salary following widespread public protests. In Spain, Mariano Rajoy's government was facing one of its toughest weeks since it came to power last year as it sought approval for a new wave of reforms designed to pave the way for a European rescue. Meanwhile, in Greece there was mounting suspicion among members of Antonis Samaras's government that the IMF has been deliberately blocking agreement on \u20ac11.9bn (\u00a39.5bn) of spending cuts necessary for Greece to receive the next tranche of its bailout. \"Basically they want the measures to fail so that Greece is forced to ask for another haircut [on its debt] but we know that is not the view of the EU commission or Germany which is strongly against another debt restructuring at this time,\" said one well placed insider in Athens. Samaras personally telephoned Lagarde on Friday to appeal for a cooling of tensions after the organisation's mission chief to Greece had a fiery exchange with Athens' finance minister over the spending cuts. Lagarde said that Europe's debt crisis and the projected sharp budget retrenchment in the US early next year posed critical risks, and said the Fund would show flexibility to countries in trouble. \"We continue to project a gradual recovery, but global growth will likely be a bit weaker than we had anticipated even in July, and our forecast has trended downward over the last 12 months\", she said in a speech in Washington.

Metal fencing and several rings of security manned by police were being put in place to keep demonstrators away from the building, with authorities claiming a blockade would be a direct attack on Spanish democracy. \"We will not let parliament be surrounded or taken over,\" warned Cristina Cifuentes, the interior ministry's Madrid chief, who claimed extreme left-wing and right-wing groups were both involved. It was unclear whether organisers, who define themselves on the internet as \"democratic, anti-neoliberal, anti-capitalist and anti-patriarchal\", would be able to mobilise a large number of demonstrators. The protest coincides with the beginning of a debate in the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona which threatens to see it demand that Rajoy's government formally recognise a right to self-determination for the wealthy north-eastern region. Rajoy's government will this week approve a new reform programme and next year's budget, opening the way for it to request a bailout from eurozone countries. That would allow the European Central Bank to intervene in bond markets and drive down the country's exorbitant borrowing costs. Several of Spain's most important indignado protest groups have refused to back Tuesday's attempted peaceful blockade of the Congreso de los Diputados organised by the \"On Your Feet!\" group, which says it does not intend to stop deputies going to work. a",

Last month, the company went cap in hand to investors a final time, but failed to persuade shareholders to stump up extra cash. Investors include the world's richest man, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who owns a 5% stake. Administrators at KPMG will be appointed and are expected to announce any sale in the next few weeks, the company said.",

The financial policy committee (FPC) said the outlook for the banking sector remained difficult and institutions needed to bolster their capital reserves to cushion against a possible downturn. The warning will disappoint the Treasury, which is keen for banks to increase their mortgage lending and loans to small businesses. Vince Cable said on Monday he will start a \u00a31bn government-owned investment bank to increase the amount of funds available for lending to counter restrictions on the banks, but admitted it is unlikely to be running before 2014. The government hopes its backing will be matched by a similar amount from private capital and could support up to \u00a310bn of new and additional lending, the business secretary announced. The FPC said on Monday that financial stability had not altered since June. Three months ago, it said that banks could temporarily run down some of the short-term cash set aside for future market shocks in a bid to stimulate lending and growth in the economy, but also recommended that banks should restrain payouts to shareholders and bonuses so they can build up cash reserves. Threadneedle Street is worried that UK banks are still sitting on huge losses from loans to businesses and mortgage holders dating back to the Lehman Brothers crash that have yet to be fully written down on their balance sheets. The FPC, which will publish minutes of its September meeting on Thursday, was formed as part of a wider shakeup of the UK regulatory system and is currently operating in an interim capacity.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Qinetiq</strong> was widely believed to be the inspiration for James Bond's Q, and the former ministry of defence research arm's latest trick is to buck a falling market.</p> <p>The company, floated on the stock exchange in 2006, has jumped nearly 6% - up 9.4p to 181.2p - after a better than expected first half trading update. The main boost came from its UK business and its global products division, with the delivery of two key orders for its Q-NetTM equipment - a kevlar web which protects vehicles from grenade attacks.</p> <p>But this was offset by the performance of its US business, with uncertainties over the country's defence budget leading to delays in awarding contracts. With the UK government's austerity drive, the issue of budgets is also a live one in this country too. The company said:</p> <blockquote> The degree of political and economic uncertainty in both our major markets means that forward visibility for the next six months is much lower than usual, particularly in the US. <br> However the strong performance in the first half gives the board confidence the group should at least meet its expectations for the current year, absent any material change in customer requirements. The board's view of the outlook beyond the current year remains unchanged. </blockquote> <p>Liberum Capital issued a hold recommendation following the figures and ahead of an investor at Farnborough this week:</p> <blockquote> A stronger than expected first half (notably in global products) causes us to increase our 2013 earnings per share estimate by 17% (we expect consensus to increase by around 10%).

      "bodyText": "Qinetiq was widely believed to be the inspiration for James Bond's Q, and the former ministry of defence research arm's latest trick is to buck a falling market. The company, floated on the stock exchange in 2006, has jumped nearly 6% - up 9.4p to 181.2p - after a better than expected first half trading update. The main boost came from its UK business and its global products division, with the delivery of two key orders for its Q-NetTM equipment - a kevlar web which protects vehicles from grenade attacks. But this was offset by the performance of its US business, with uncertainties over the country's defence budget leading to delays in awarding contracts. With the UK government's austerity drive, the issue of budgets is also a live one in this country too. The company said: The degree of political and economic uncertainty in both our major markets means that forward visibility for the next six months is much lower than usual, particularly in the US. However the strong performance in the first half gives the board confidence the group should at least meet its expectations for the current year, absent any material change in customer requirements. The board's view of the outlook beyond the current year remains unchanged. Liberum Capital issued a hold recommendation following the figures and ahead of an investor at Farnborough this week: A stronger than expected first half (notably in global products) causes us to increase our 2013 earnings per share estimate by 17% (we expect consensus to increase by around 10%). Visibility remains extremely limited but Qinetiq continues to perform well. We expect Wednesday's investor day to highlight the opportunities but note that the shares have already moved up significantly and now trade on a 10% premium to UK peers. Qinetiq has a portfolio of products which could create significant value in the future, most notably OptaSense. There is lots of work going on behind the scenes but nothing new at this stage.
