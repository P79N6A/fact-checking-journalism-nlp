      "bodyText": "The contest for most stupid political proposal is a toughly fought one, but on the weekend the bar was well and truly raised when the WA state Liberal party voted to \u201cexamine the option of Western Australia becoming a financially independent state within the commonwealth.\u201d While stopping short of complete secession, the proposal remains one of the kookiest you could get from a party that was once in charge of the state\u2019s finances and, presumably, would like to one day again be considered worthy of being in power. The proposal is dumb, firstly because \u201cfinancially independent\u201d and \u201cwithin the commonwealth\u201d make no sense whatsoever. It\u2019s all very well to say states should raise their own taxes and pay the federal government for services rendered, but even a half-second thought reveals the idiocy of a state paying another government to defend it. One suspects the eastern states might believe the federal government should charge a very high premium to Western Australia for its nearly 13,000km of coastline. All of this, of course, has come about because Western Australians continue to feel hard done by the break-up of the GST \u2013 it now receives only 34.4% of the GST revenue its citizens paid. GST is divided up on the basis that it furthers the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation. Essentially, this is about ensuring, as the Commonwealth Grants Commission states, \u201ceach of Australia\u2019s states has the same fiscal capacity, under average policies, to provide general government infrastructure and services.\u201d It takes into account states\u2019 ability to raise revenue and also the circumstances that affect their expenses \u2013 such as age of the population, geography, and the number of Indigenous people living within the state. The calculations are done on a rolling three-year average of these different aspects. This meant that Western Australia was hit particularly hard by the falling iron ore price after 2013 \u2013 as WA\u2019s capacity to raise mining royalties was based on an average iron ore price that was well above the amount that was actually leading to WA\u2019s revenue: Of course there are swings and roundabouts. At the start of the mining boom, the iron ore price rose very fast \u2013 meaning WA received a bigger share of GST than it would have had the Commonwealth Grants Commission determined its share of GST based on the current rate rather than a rolling three-year average. In 2015, the CGC estimated that \u201cprior to the reduction in its iron ore royalty revenues in 2014\u201315, Western Australia received around $7bn additional GST revenue than it would have if fully contemporaneous assessments had been in place.\u201d So yes, Western Australia might have a case over what gets counted as revenue raising capacity but if we\u2019re going to say it is being ripped off now, we should also remember it has also done very well out of the system. But let us ponder what a \u201cfinancially independent\u201d WA would look like. Firstly, yes it would be a hit to Australia. WA represents about 15% of Australia\u2019s economy and about 35% of its exports. Over the past 25 years, Australia\u2019s economy excluding WA has grown by 108% compared with the actual 120%: But what would a WA economy independent of Australia look like? For a start it would mean residents of Perth would go from living in a country with the 13th or 14th biggest economy in the world to roughly the 50th biggest. In 2016-17, Western Australia\u2019s annual gross state product was $239.7bn \u2013 roughly around the same size as New Zealand\u2019s GDP. The population of 2.6m would make it about the 140th biggest nation on earth. And because of a relatively large GDP, that would also see it have one of the best GDP per capita levels in the world. This is not surprising \u2013 the mining boom has seen WA gross household disposable income per capita grow faster than other states over the past decade: But while it might seem a very rich country, the economy of this new country would be very narrowly based. Over a quarter of its GDP would come from the mining industry: But to show just how all that industry earns might not necessarily flow through to the Western Australian workers, only 7% of all Western Australians would be employed in the mining industry \u2013 though still well above the 1.2% of people in the rest of Australia: It makes for a fairly precarious economy \u2013 one burdensomely dependent upon iron ore prices. Falling iron ore prices have wrecked havoc with the WA state budget and they would be just as liable to do the same with a WA federal budget. Only this time there would be no Commonwealth of Australia to come lend a hand. If WA received all of the GST it paid it would have about $4bn extra revenue. That would be enough to wipe out the state\u2019s budget deficit, but the problem with wanting to become financially independent is you don\u2019t get to choose only the good things. The Australian government currently has a debt of $500bn. That debt was raised to pay for Western Australian services as much it was for other Australians. The Australian government as it granted WA its independence would also gladly grant WA its share of the debt \u2013 let\u2019s be generous and give them 10% based on their share of the population. As the West Australian\u2019s Shane Wright has noted, this means WA\u2019s new financially independent government would be taking on an extra $50bn in debt to go with its own current $50bn of state debt. And this is for a government that has a lower credit rating than does the federal government, meaning it would need to pay a much higher rate of interest on that debt. Given its level of debt would be double that of the similar sized economy of New Zealand, most likely credit agencies around the world would quickly downgrade the new Western Australia, meaning it would again have to pay higher interest rates. And while an independent WA economy looks quite strong given its exports, the problem for WA residents and businesses is while they have an export surplus with the rest of the world, they don\u2019t with the rest of Australia. There are estimates of trade deficit with the rest of Australia of up to $45bn a year. Financially independent WA might like to hope that Australia will allow free trade, but as Brexit has shown, the larger economy of Australia would have the whip hand in any trade deals. Western Australia also depended greatly on people moving from the rest of Australia to work during its mining boom. Without that influx of people it would not have had the skills to take advantage of the boom in iron ore prices \u2013 and the price of labour would have soared astronomically: Taking back its GST revenue and hoping like hell the companies don\u2019t relocate their businesses in a way to avoid paying company tax to WA might seem a joy to some deluded souls of the WA Liberal party, but the reality is that without the rest of Australia WA would be an economic basket case. Mining dollars would generate wealth for few and lead to rampant inequality. Saddled with massive debt, being required to renegotiate trade deals with every nation in the world, having a narrowly based economy dependent on fluctuation in iron prices, and needing to pay for its own security, WA\u2019s new currency \u2013 an important aspect of being \u201cfinancially independent\u201d \u2013 would quickly become worthless. Clearly this move to investigate financial independence is being done to give comfort to West Australians who feel ripped off by the GST share. But all it really does is demonstrate the WA Liberal party is like a dopey teenager demanding his parents give him independence without thinking that it might mean he will be asked to pay rent.",

At the start of the mining boom, the iron ore price rose very fast \u2013 meaning WA received a bigger share of GST than it would have had the Commonwealth Grants Commission determined its share of GST based on the current rate rather than a rolling three-year average. </p> <p> In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/03/wa-liberal-party-votes-to-look-into-state-seceding-from-federation\">the CGC estimated</a> that \u201cprior to the reduction in its iron ore royalty revenues in 2014\u201315, Western Australia received around $7bn additional GST revenue than it would have if fully contemporaneous assessments had been in place.\u201d</p> <p> So yes, Western Australia might have a case over what gets counted as revenue raising capacity but if we\u2019re going to say it is being ripped off now, we should also remember it has also done very well out of the system.</p> <p> But let us ponder what a \u201cfinancially independent\u201d WA would look like. </p> <p> Firstly, yes it would be a hit to Australia. WA represents about 15% of Australia\u2019s economy and about 35% of its exports. </p> <p> Over the past 25 years, Australia\u2019s economy excluding WA has grown by 108% compared with the actual 120%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3E6mR/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>  <p> But what would a WA economy independent of Australia look like?</p> <p> For a start it would mean residents of Perth would go from living in a country with the 13<sup>th</sup> or 14<sup>th</sup> biggest economy in the world to roughly the 50<sup>th</sup> biggest. </p> <p> In 2016-17, Western Australia\u2019s annual gross state product was $239.7bn \u2013 roughly around the same size as New Zealand\u2019s GDP. </p> <p> The population of 2.6m would make it about the 140<sup>th</sup> biggest nation on earth. And because of a relatively large GDP, that would also see it have one of the best GDP per capita levels in the world. </p> <p> This is not surprising \u2013 the mining boom has seen WA gross household disposable income per capita grow faster than other states over the past decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gross household income per capita\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iVOGu/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>  <p> But while it might seem a very rich country, the economy of this new country would be very narrowly based. Over a quarter of its GDP would come from the mining industry:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Western Australia's economy by industry value added\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MAVyK/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>  <p> But to show just how all that industry earns might not necessarily flow through to the Western Australian workers, only 7% of all Western Australians would be employed in the mining industry \u2013 though still well above the 1.2% of people in the rest of Australia:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Western Australia's employment by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/noFrj/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>  <p> It makes for a fairly precarious economy \u2013 one burdensomely dependent upon iron ore prices. Falling iron ore prices have wrecked havoc with the WA state budget and they would be just as liable to do the same with a WA federal budget. Only this time there would be no Commonwealth of Australia to come lend a hand.</p> <p> If WA received all of the GST it paid it would have about $4bn extra revenue. That would be enough to wipe out the state\u2019s budget deficit, but the problem with wanting to become financially independent is you don\u2019t get to choose only the good things. </p> <p> The Australian government currently has <a href=\"http://aofm.gov.au/\">a debt of $500bn</a>. That debt was raised to pay for Western Australian services as much it was for other Australians. The Australian government as it granted WA its independence would also gladly grant WA its share of the debt \u2013 let\u2019s be generous and give them 10% based on their share of the population.</p> <p> As t<a href=\"https://thewest.com.au/politics/state-politics/waxit-would-leave-western-australia-even-deeper-in-debt-ng-b88583799z\">he West Australian\u2019s Shane Wright</a> has noted, this means WA\u2019s new financially independent government would be taking on an extra $50bn in debt to go with its own current $50bn of state debt.</p> <p> And this is for a government that has a lower credit rating than does the federal government, meaning it would need to pay a much higher rate of interest on that debt. Given its level of debt would be double that of the similar sized economy of New Zealand, most likely credit agencies around the world would quickly downgrade the new Western Australia, meaning it would again have to pay higher interest rates.</p> <p> And while an independent WA economy looks quite strong given its exports, the problem for WA residents and businesses is while they have an export surplus with the rest of the world, they don\u2019t with the rest of Australia. </p> <p> There are estimates of trade deficit with the rest of Australia of up to $45bn a year. Financially independent WA might like to hope that Australia will allow free trade, but as Brexit has shown, the larger economy of Australia would have the whip hand in any trade deals. </p> <p> Western Australia also depended greatly on people moving from the rest of Australia to work during its mining boom. Without that influx of people it would not have had the skills to take advantage of the boom in iron ore prices \u2013 and the price of labour would have soared astronomically:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual net interstate arrivals to Western Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u4ifY/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>  <p> Taking back its GST revenue and hoping like hell the companies don\u2019t relocate their businesses in a way to avoid paying company tax to WA might seem a joy to some deluded souls of the WA Liberal party, but the reality is that without the rest of Australia WA would be an economic basket case.</p> <p> Mining dollars would generate wealth for few and lead to rampant inequality.</p> <p> Saddled with massive debt, being required to renegotiate trade deals with every nation in the world, having a narrowly based economy dependent on fluctuation in iron prices, and needing to pay for its own security, WA\u2019s new currency \u2013 an important aspect of being \u201cfinancially independent\u201d \u2013 would quickly become worthless. </p> <p> Clearly this move to investigate financial independence is being done to give comfort to West Australians who feel ripped off by the GST share. But all it really does is demonstrate the WA Liberal party is like a dopey teenager demanding his parents give him independence without thinking that it might mean he will be asked to pay rent. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Bell Pottinger, one of the City\u2019s leading public relations agencies, has been expelled from the industry\u2019s trade association after an investigation found its secret campaign to stir up racial tensions in South Africa to be the worst breach of ethics in its history. The Public Relations and Communications Association said Bell Pottinger was unethical and unprofessional, had brought the industry into disrepute and has banned the firm from its membership for at least five years. The punishment, unprecedented for a firm of Bell Pottinger\u2019s size, was handed down after the PRCA investigated a complaint from South Africa\u2019s main opposition party that the PR firm sought to stir up anger about \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d and the \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d in South Africa. Bell Pottinger was being paid \u00a3100,000 a month by client Oakbay Capital, the holding company of the wealthy, powerful and controversial Gupta family, who have been accused of benefiting financially from their close links to the South African president, Jacob Zuma. Both have previously denied such a relationship. \u201cBell Pottinger has brought the PR and communications industry into disrepute with its actions and has received the harshest possible sanctions,\u201d said Francis Ingham, director general of the PRCA. \u201cThe PRCA has never before passed down such a damning indictment of an agency\u2019s behaviour.\u201d The PRCA said the Bell Pottinger campaign was \u201clikely to inflame racial discord in South Africa\u201d. The pressure is set to increase with Peter Hain, the former Labour MP who became a peer in 2015, tabling a string of questions in the House of Lords on Tuesday asking the government whether Bell Pottinger\u2019s actions contravene any UK trade policies. The severity of the PRCA ruling raises questions over the future of one of the City\u2019s best-known PR firms, which was founded almost 30 years ago by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite spin doctor Lord Bell. Major shareholder Chime, owned by majority shareholder Providence and Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s WPP, is understood to have offloaded its 25% stake in the firm as the scandal reached boiling point over the summer. The buyer of the stake is unknown. The company\u2019s largest individual shareholder is James Henderson, who resigned as chief executive on Sunday. Ingham said that while firms do not have to be a member of the PRCA to operate, it is the norm for respectable companies. Expulsion from the group, which has only happened once before, could make it hard for the firm to continue. \u201cPretty much every respectable agency is a member,\u201d said Ingham. \u201cIt is seen as a requirement to trade, a stamp of ethical behaviour and professional practice. \u201cHaving it taken away will significantly hurt [Bell Pottinger]. It makes a very public statement \u2013 we do not believe it to be an ethical and professional PR agency.\u201d Richemont, the Swiss luxury company headed by South African businessman Johann Rupert and Investec, the South African investment group, have both ended ties with Bell Pottinger. The PRCA has banned Bell Pottinger for five years regardless of whether the PR company sells up or changes its name \u2013 both of which have been rumoured as possibilities \u2013 and even then its return to the fold is far from guaranteed. \u201cIt is not a given if they reapply in five years\u2019 time [we] will say yes,\u201d Ingham said. \u201cMembership needs a two-thirds majority of board approval and the board is pretty clear in its anger and indignation about this piece of work.\u201d The PRCA\u2019s professional practices committee and board voted unanimously to terminate Bell Pottinger\u2019s membership. Bell Pottinger resigned the Oakbay account in April, at the time saying it was the victim of a smear campaign involving \u201ctotally false and damaging accusations\u201d. However, in July, Henderson made a U-turn, offering an \u201cunequivocable and absolute\u201d apology for an \u201cinappropriate and offensive\u201d social media campaign. He fired the lead partner on the Gupta account and suspended two other employees. The embattled Henderson resigned on Sunday. \u201cAlthough I neither initiated nor was involved in the Oakbay work, I accept that as chief executive, I have ultimate executive responsibility for Bell Pottinger,\u201d he said. Bell Pottinger\u2019s own investigation, conducted by an independent law firm and published ahead of the PRCA report, found the PR group had created a \u201cpotentially racially divisive\u201d campaign and that senior management failed to put in place adequate policies to stop such a PR disaster. The report also found that Bell Pottinger engaged in other unethical practices \u201cincluding taking steps which might mislead or undermine journalists who were asking questions in relation to the campaign\u201d. In a statement about the PRCA ruling, Bell Pottinger said it accepted there were \u201clessons to be learned but disputes the basis on which the ruling was made\u201d. The firm said it intended to continue in business by abiding with the PRCA code of ethical conduct on a voluntary basis and that many of its staff would now apply to join the industry group as individuals. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of our partners and employees played no part in the Oakbay Capital account and have not been accused of breaching the PRCA code,\u201d it said. \u201cMany of them will now consider applying for individual membership.\u201d The PR firm has made a number of pledges to toughen up its corporate practices including creating an ethics committee, further training for employees in social media engagement, and to \u201cengender a culture whereby junior employees at Bell Pottinger feel able to challenge work with which they feel uncomfortable\u201d. Bell Pottinger\u2019s co-founder Tim Bell told BBC\u2019s Newsnight that the incident \u201calmost certainly\u201d meant the end for the firm but declined to take any responsibility for it. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility. This is 18 months ago. People write abusive stuff 18 months later, journalists write stuff 18 months later, and I\u2019m supposed to react to that? I resigned from the company in August last year. I published my resignation and I said that one of the reasons I was leaving was because of the Gupta account.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Classic cars and works of fine art tumbled in value in 2016, while photography and rare musical instruments emerged as the hottest collectors\u2019 items, according to a leading private bank. The fall in the value of classic cars \u2013 down in price by 10.4% last year \u2013 comes after years of booming demand that has made them one of the best investments over the past decade, said Coutts. Fine art has fallen out of favour among the world\u2019s billionaires, with prices down 6.2% last year. Modern and impressionist art is selling for 12% below 2007 peak, while old masters and 19th-century art are fetching 40% less at auctions than before the financial crisis. Collectors have also lost interest in rugs and carpets with 2016 prices at an 11-year low. Rare musical instruments topped the table for price increases among collectables in 2016. They rose in value by 16.4% last year, although Coutts said prices were highly volatile and had increased little in total over the last decade. Photography was probably the hottest new investment area among collectables, said Coutts. A photograph of visitors to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990 by Thomas Struth sold for $777,080 (\u00a3600,890) at Phillips London, with pictures by Gilbert &amp; George, Robert Mapplethorpe and Andreas Gurksy all making more than $400,000. \u201cIt is definitely one of our fastest-growing categories,\u201d said Brandei Estes, head of photographs at auctioneer Sotheby\u2019s in London. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the work; it is the most democratic of art forms and because of the relatively accessible price points, it\u2019s an attractive category for the growing middle market.\u201d Half the Coutts index of \u201cpassion assets\u201d is made up of items the bank rates as of interest to ultra-high net worth individuals \u2013 led by \u201ctrophy\u201d property. It said the return on \u201cbillionaire property\u201d was only 1.8% in 2016, or little more than the average saver in the UK obtained on their Isa. Coutts defines billionaire property as houses that sell for more than \u00a310m. \u201cBillionaire property prices grew rapidly from 2008 to 2012, increasing nearly 40%, but have since risen less than 6% and increased less than 2% last year,\u201d said Coutts, partly blaming stamp duty and Brexit for price falls in London. Property prices in Paris have also dipped, Coutts said, although values in Sydney have surged. \u201cBillionaire property prices in Paris have declined over 30% since 2012 while those in Sydney increased more than 70% during the same period.\u201d Classic cars have provided the healthiest returns since Coutts established its index in 2005, despite 2016\u2019s fall, with average prices rising more than fourfold. \u201cPrices at the very top end of the market remain robust ... The most coveted cars continue to go up and the gap between the very best and average only widens.\u201d The classic cars in the Coutts index all needed to sell for more than $500,000, and each of the models needed to have been sold more than 10 times at auction to capture a timeline of prices. Seven of the top 10 are different Ferrari models, with a Mercedes 300 SL, a Shelby Cobra 289 and Aston Martin DB5 making up the rest. Fine wines and classic watches are recovering in price following recent downturns. Average prices for wine rose nearly 10% in 2016 but remain 20% below their 2011 peak. Classic watches rose by 6.7% in 2016 but are still 10% lower than in 2012. Eight out of the top 10 watches sold at Sotheby\u2019s last year were made by Patek Phillipe, with a 1949 wristwatch selling for $730,000.",

      "bodyText": "With the US closed for Labor Day, let\u2019s have a recap. World stock markets have begun the week on the back foot after North Korea\u2019s nuclear test on Sunday. European equities are all in the red this afternoon, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 currently down 26 points or 0.35% at 7411. Asia also suffered, with South Korea\u2019s Kopsi closing down 1.2% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei losing almost 1%. Gold continues to benefit from the nervousness, trading at their highest levels since autumn 2016. Investors haven\u2019t taken much comfort from today\u2019s developments, including China criticising US president Trump\u2019s threat to break of trade links with countries who deal with North Korea. Although the City hopes that the crisis can be defused, there is concern that tensions could continue to rise - with South Korea carrying out a simulated attack on North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says: Another week, another provocation, as North Korea re-emerges as the key driver of market sentiment this morning. Weakness for Asian markets were provided a predictable precursor to a negative session in Europe, with the FTSE losing ground once more. Unfortunately there is unlikely to be any end in sight for this current standoff with North Korea, with few options seemingly on the table to demilitarise the regime. One thing is for sure, with North Korea testing increasingly threatening weapons, the growing threat of a nuclear war is going to continue bolstering gold prices, which today hit an almost one-year high. Meanwhile in the UK, we have seen more signs that Brexit has hit investment in the building sector. Markit\u2019s construction PMI, showing growth at a one-month low, suggests that growth prospects have weakened -- with commercial construction showing a sharp decline in August. Tomorrow, we get a flurry of service sector surveys from across the globe, which will show whether Britain\u2019s services firms also had a tough August. And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The boss of one of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chains has warned that food could be left to rot at the UK border after Brexit. Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury\u2019s, told the Press Association that it was important that supply chains kept running smoothly once Britain has left the European Union. Otherwise, new custom checks could cause delays which drive costs up -- and make it harder to get products onto the shelves. Coupe said: \u201cIf you take our fresh produce supply chains, for example, we put things on a lorry in Spain and it will arrive in a distribution centre somewhere in England, and it won\u2019t have gone through any border checks. \u201cAnything that encumbers that has two effects: it adds cost, and it also has a detrimental effect on freshness - if you\u2019re shipping fresh produce from a long distance, even a few hours of delay can make a material impact.\u201d Staff from the McDonald\u2019s fast food chain have held a rally outside parliament today, to mark the company\u2019s first ever UK strike. Here\u2019s a photo from the scene.... ...and one from the McDonald\u2019s store in Crayford, in London, where staff walked out this morning (alongside staff from Cambridge). The strikers are demanding that McDonalds\u2019 stops using zero-hours contracts by the end of the year, and raises its minimum wage to \u00a310 per hour. The company insists that it already pays more than the national living wage (\u00a37.50 per hour for those over 25), and will offer all staff the option of a permanent contract by teh end of 2017. But although the strike only affects two stores, it could be a sign that discontent among McDonalds is bubbling up. Dr Jonathan Lord, Lecturer in employment law at the University of Salford Business School, explains: \u201cIt is no coincidence that the 4th September is Labor day in the US and that for the first time McDonalds employees in the UK will take industrial action in a dispute over pay and contracted hours. \u201cThe strike has been coordinated on Labor Day in solidarity with other workers who are in dispute against fast food giants around the world. The publicity garnered from the strike, on an important date in the US companies calendar, will signify that McDonalds can no longer guarantee peaceful industrial relations with their workers who are determined to improve conditions not only in the two stores on strike but for the rest of their allies in the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU). \u201cMcDonalds themselves do not seem to be concerned about the industrial action, highlighting that only a small number of their employees who represent less than 0.01% of the workforce are intending to strike in two of their 1,270 UK restaurants. \u201cThis is dangerous rhetoric though, as we have seen from previous industrial disputes in sectors where they would not normally occur as they can manifest into potential problems for organisations if they are not addressed swiftly and satisfactorily. Industrial action has severely declined over the last 100 years with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) highlighting that only 322,000 working days were lost to strikes in 2016 compared to 29 million in 1979. Today\u2019s PMI report shows that the UK building sector risks sliding into recession, warns Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics. More here, by my colleague Richard Partington. This chart highlights how commercial building projects, and civil engineering work, both weakened last month: Get set for the working day - we\u2019ll guide you to the all the business stories you need to read in one really useful email.

Sentix\u2019s barometer of investor morale beat forecasts by rising to 28.2 for September, suggesting that Brexit isn\u2019t causing much angst across the Channel. Robert Grigg, managing director of Property Finance at Hampshire Trust Bank, blames \u201congoing economic and political uncertainty\u201d for the slowdown in Britain\u2019s building sector. Grigg adds: Though today\u2019s data shows residential housebuilding has bucked the trend, we still need to ensure SME housebuilders are given both government and financial support in order to build their businesses and increase the number of homes in the UK - which is essential to solving the ongoing housing crisis.\u201d This slowdown in Britain\u2019s building sector may be a warning signal for the wider economy, says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst. \u201cIn stark contrast to Friday\u2019s manufacturing sentiment numbers, the construction industry is looking very down in the mouth as a result of slowing government spending, uncertainty over Brexit and risks to the UK\u2019s macroeconomic landscape. While imprecise, this could be used as a microcosm of the UK investment picture in a post-EU referendum atmosphere.\u201d [Reminder: the UK factory PMI rose strongly in August, according to data released on Friday] Britain\u2019s building sector is now feeling the impact of drop in orders last year, says Noble Francis of the Construction Products Association. Simon French of City firm Panmure Gordon also points out that new construction orders have been sliding for many months. Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, believes Brexit uncertainty is hurting the UK construction sector. He writes: \u201cThe sector hit a roadblock this month as purchasing activity slowed for the third month and new business wins were hard to come by. Reduced Government spending, economic uncertainty and Brexit-delayed decision-making among clients were largely to blame. \u201cThe struggling commercial sector drove this disappointment, languishing under the pressure with the fastest drop in activity in over a year. Job creation was nothing to shout about and showed signs of a slowdown, as companies reined back additional spending. However, the \u201cstrong performance\u201d by housebuilders has helped avoid a sharper slowdown. Markit\u2019s survey shows that Britain\u2019s commercial building sector is shrinking at its fastest pace since last June\u2019s EU referendum. That\u2019s a worrying sign, suggesting that companies are cutting back on spending. Breaking! Growth in Britain\u2019s building\u2019s sector has fallen to its lowest level in a year. Markit\u2019s construction PMI, just released, has dropped to 51.1 in August - down from 51.9 in July. That\u2019s worryingly close to the 50 point mark that shows stagnation, and the weakest reading since August 2016. Commercial construction had a particularly bad month, while residential house building was stronger. Markit says that worries over the strength of the UK economy are hurting the sector. Civil engineering activity was close to stagnation and commercial work dropped at the fastest pace since July 2016. Reports from survey respondents widely suggested that concerns about the UK economic outlook had weighed on the commercial development sector, with clients opting to delay spending decisions and, in some cases, scale back planned projects. More to follow.... Although equities are down around the globe, and gold is up, we\u2019re not looking at a major rout in the markets (yet, anyway). Investors may be calculating that diplomacy might yet carry the day and military conflict can be avoided. Also, nuclear war is such a terrible outcome to consider \u2018pricing in\u2019, so traders will obviously hope it can be avoided. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, suspects that the markets may rebound soon, even though Sunday\u2019s nuclear test is the biggest one yet recorded by North Korea. Sayed says: The markets\u2019 reaction seems similar to when missile launches have taken place in the past; investors sell stock, rush to safe havens, assess the situation, and then buy the dips as tension eases. While stocks fell in Asia, the selloff was not massive, mainly because the nuclear test occurred over the weekend and there was enough time to digest the news. An H-bomb is undeniably different from the previous missile launches or nuclear tests; it\u2019s a game changer for North Korea\u2019s deterrent strategy. However, the biggest question to investors remains - what\u2019s next? Will the tensions lead to negotiations, or war? Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are defying the selloff. Both companies are up 2% this morning in London, following the jump in the gold price to a 10-month high. European stock markets have all fallen at the start of trading, as traders worry about North Korea. Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the selloff, down 0.66%. Although there\u2019s no sign of immediate military action, the rising tensions are creating a \u2018risk off\u2019 mood in the markets this morning. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: North Korea has further escalated the geopolitical tensions over the weekend and the US has called for an emergency meeting of the U.N council. For investors, this does not present a stable environment for investing. North Korea\u2019s latest missile test is overshadowing China\u2019s latest gathering of leading emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia and India. That will surely irritate China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, as the Brics summit is a key platform for Beijing\u2019s international ambitions. Yesterday, Xi warned that \u201cincessant conflicts in some parts of the world\u201d were threatening global piece. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the timing underlines Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u2018extraordinary\u2019 defiance, and could provoke a response from China. Whilst he knows the US will no doubt implement further economic sanctions, this time he risks the wrath of China, the only county that could potentially strangle North Korea\u2019s economy. North Korea carried out the nuclear test on Sunday with full knowledge that it would enrage Beijing, with the timing threatening to overshadow the BRIC summit hosted by Chinese President Xi. Yet the rogue state paid little regard to this, which is concerning as it means there appears to be little preventing Kim Jong escalating the tension further. Here\u2019s more details on the Brics summit: My colleagues around the world are live-blogging the latest developments in North Korea here. The gold price has hit its highest level in almost a year, as North Korea\u2019s latest weapons test drives investors into \u2018safe haven\u2019 assets. Bullion is changing hands at $1,337 per ounce, its highest level since last November - when Donald Trump\u2019s shock election win rattled the markets. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says gold is the \u201cmajor beneficiary\u201d from rising tensions in the Korean peninsula. Expect North Korean rhetoric to heavily influence the safe haven asset throughout the day as global leaders react to the latest provocations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s back to school in the UK after the summer break. But City workers are back to fretting about North Korea after it tested what it claimed was a powerful nuclear bomb on Sunday. Pyongyang\u2019s latest provocation comes just a few days after it fired a missile over Japan. So with the US threatening a \u2018massive military response\u2019, and South Korea simulating its own reaction, there\u2019s plenty to worry investors this morning. As Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, puts it: Financial markets are back in risk aversion mode on Monday after the latest nuclear test from North Korea on Sunday triggered the usual safe haven rush. Asian markets have already been hit; Japan\u2019s Nikkei dropped by almost 1% as nervous traders drove up the value of the yen. European stock markets are also expected to follow suit too, with falls of around 0.5% expected. Rob Carnell, ING\u2019s head of Asian research, says: \u201cLike a bad horror movie, the North Korea saga intersperses moments of calm, with occasional action to jolt you out of your chair.\u201d However, Carnell reckons it could be a good buying opportunity for investors - unless the situation really does deteriorate (via Reuters). US traders won\u2019t be able to react today, though, as New York is closed for the Labor Day holidays. Investors are also awaiting a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s building sector. Markit\u2019s construction PMI is expected to remain close to July\u2019s 11-month low of 51.9 in August. We\u2019ll also be watching McDonalds, where workers at two stores are protesting about the fast food chain\u2019s low pay and zero-hours contracts.

      "bodyText": "A leading City PR firm at the centre of a scandal over stirring up racial tensions in South Africa on behalf of one of the country\u2019s most powerful families, created a potentially racially divisive campaign, according to an independent report. The report into the events at Bell Pottinger, carried out by Herbert Smith Freehills law firm, was published a day after the PR group\u2019s chief executive, James Henderson, stood down over the scandal. It also found that senior management failed to put in place adequate policies for handling such a campaign and missed opportunities to crack down on the PR disaster. Bell Pottinger, which faces serious disciplinary action from the UK\u2019s PR trade body, called in the law firm to investigate the scandal to try to restore the tattered reputation of one of the best known names in PR. South Africa\u2019s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which is popular with many white South Africans, accused the the PR firm of orchestrating a campaign to exploit racial tensions on behalf of Oakbay Capital, the holding company of the Gupta family. Bell Pottinger, which was paid \u00a3100,000 a month by the Gupta group until resigning the account in April as the scandal broke, is accused of orchestrating the creation of fake Twitter accounts to target prominent white businesspeople in South Africa. \u201cCertain material that we have seen that was created for the campaign was negative or targeted towards wealthy white South African individuals or corporates and/or was potentially racially divisive and/or potentially offensive and was created in breach of relevant ethical principles,\u201d said the law firm. The firm is accused of stirring up anger about \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d and the \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d to draw attention away from the controversial Guptas, who run a media to mining conglomerate and have been accused of benefiting financially from their close links to the South African president, Jacob Zuma. Both have previously denied such a relationship. The report also found the PR firm employed other unethical tactics as part of the campaign. \u201cWe have seen evidence that the Bell Pottinger account team used other tactics in relation to the economic emancipation campaign which arguably breached the relevant ethical principles\u201a including taking steps which might mislead or undermine journalists who were asking questions in relation to the campaign,\u201d the report says. In July, Henderson issued an \u201cunequivocal and absolute\u201d apology for the \u201cinappropriate and offensive\u201d social media campaign; a U-turn from the company\u2019s stance when it resigned the Oakbay business in April, when it said it had been the victim of a politically motivated smear campaign involving a \u201cnumber of totally false and damaging accusations\u201d. The report said senior management did not know about the campaign, but that they had failed to put in place the appropriate safeguards that would have alerted them to what staff were doing. \u201cIn such circumstances Bell Pottinger ought to have exercised extreme care and should have closely scrutinised the creation of content for the campaign,\u201d the report says. \u201cThis does not appear to have happened. There were a series of opportunities for certain members of senior management to discover these matters which were missed. In addition, members of senior management with day-to-day supervisory responsibility failed to put in place policies and procedures to minimise the risks associated with this account, including any formal process for the ongoing monitoring of the account and the work being done.\u201d The report argued that it was not a breach of \u201crelevant ethical principles\u201d to have taken on the \u201ceconomic emancipation\u201d campaign, but Bell Pottinger\u2019s senior management \u201cshould have known that the campaign was at risk of causing offence, including on grounds of race\u201d. Henderson, the largest shareholder in Bell Pottinger, said in a statement: \u201cAlthough I neither initiated nor was involved in the Oakbay work, I accept that as CEO, I have ultimate executive responsibility for Bell Pottinger.\u201d The PR firm made a number of pledges to bolster its corporate practices including creating an ethics committee, further training for employees in social media engagement, and \u201cengender a culture whereby junior employees at Bell Pottinger feel able to challenge work with which they feel uncomfortable\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Up to 200 people rallied outside the Houses of Parliament in London to protest against poor pay and conditions at McDonald\u2019s as workers at the restaurant staged their first UK strike. Employees, union workers and members of parliament, including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, gathered on College Green as part of an international day of action on Monday. About 40 staff from McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Cambridge and Crayford, south-east London, walked out over the multibillion dollar company\u2019s use of zero-hour contracts and lack of union recognition. Addressing the crowd, McDonnell paid tribute to everyone who had come out in action or solidarity, calling them an \u201cabsolute inspiration\u201d. He told the Guardian: \u201cThese are workers who are extremely vulnerable in terms of their employment conditions. And yet at the same time they\u2019ve had the courage to come on strike. They\u2019ve said: \u2018We\u2019ve had enough and we need to negotiate.\u2019 \u201cIf I was McDonald\u2019s management I\u2019d be listening very carefully today. I\u2019d contact the union and I\u2019d get round that table.\u201d The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said the strike was being well supported. Its general secretary, Ronnie Draper, told the rally they were the \u201cheroes and heroines\u201d of their generation. Labour MP John Spellar said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-off issue. It\u2019s not just about wages \u2026 it\u2019s about being treated with respect and not being bullied.\u201d Members of other trade unions joined early-morning picket lines outside the two restaurants, while the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, offered his backing. The workers are calling for a wage of at least \u00a310 an hour and more secure working hours. McDonald\u2019s said those taking action represented 0.01% of its workforce, adding that the dispute was related to its internal grievance procedures. The company, which employs about 85,000 staff in the UK and 1 million worldwide, announced in April that workers would be offered a choice of flexible or fixed contracts with minimum guaranteed hours, saying that 86% have chosen to stay on flexible contracts. \u201cWe\u2019ve had that promise before,\u201d McDonnell said on Monday, \u201cbut it hasn\u2019t been realised. The best security we can have is them recognising trade unions so grievances can get resolved rather than strike action.\u201d Other speakers included a choir dressed up as the McDonald\u2019s mascot Ronald McDonald, who called themselves the Evil Ronalds. Lorna McKinnon, 24, and Toni Bruce, 26, both workers in the services industry in Glasgow, performed a spoken word piece and commended fast food worker\u2019s ability to organise themselves. \u201cWe think what the guys in Cambridge and Crayford are doing is utterly inspiring,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cNot just for fast food workers but for every worker.\u201d Abdi Biin, 20, left McDonald\u2019s after his hours were cut because he complained about not being allowed to wear gloves to cook. \u201cI\u2019m here to help McDonald\u2019s employees get rights and the living wage. They don\u2019t pay for overtime, there\u2019s health and safety issues, a lot of things that a trade union could help with,\u201d he said. \u201cWorkers need to be protected. All McDonald\u2019s cares about is profit. There\u2019s no middle person to help workers, no one\u2019s going to help them on the higher levels.\u201d Biin said he used to get paid around \u00a35.30 an hour. \u201cI worked long hours, it wasn\u2019t enough. I remember someone worked two jobs in a theme park and McDonald\u2019s because the pay was so bad.\u201d A McDonald\u2019s spokesman said the company was \u201cproviding our people with the option of a guaranteed hour contract, and all restaurants will have these contracts in place by the end of 2017\u201d. He said the company \u201cand its franchisees had delivered three pay rises since April 2016, increasing the average hourly pay rate by 15%. \u201cWe are proud of our people at McDonald\u2019s, they are at the heart of all we do and we work hard to ensure that our teams are treated fairly. Our internal processes underpin that commitment.\u201d",

Young people can\u2019t live like this | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Addressing the crowd, McDonnell paid tribute to everyone who had come out in action or solidarity, calling them an \u201cabsolute inspiration\u201d.</p> \n<p>He told the Guardian: \u201cThese are workers who are extremely vulnerable in terms of their employment conditions. And yet at the same time they\u2019ve had the courage to come on strike. They\u2019ve said: \u2018We\u2019ve had enough and we need to negotiate.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I was McDonald\u2019s management I\u2019d be listening very carefully today. I\u2019d contact the union and I\u2019d get round that table.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said the strike was being well supported. Its general secretary, Ronnie Draper, told the rally they were the \u201cheroes and heroines\u201d of their generation.</p> \n<p>Labour MP John Spellar said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-off issue. It\u2019s not just about wages \u2026 it\u2019s about being treated with respect and not being bullied.\u201d</p> \n<p>Members of other trade unions joined early-morning picket lines outside the two restaurants, while the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, offered his backing. </p> \n<p>The workers are calling for a wage of at least \u00a310 an hour and more secure working hours. </p> \n<p>McDonald\u2019s said those taking action represented 0.01% of its workforce, adding that the dispute was related to its internal grievance procedures. </p> \n<p>The company, which employs about 85,000 staff in the UK and 1 million worldwide, announced in April that workers would be offered a choice of flexible or fixed contracts with minimum guaranteed hours, saying that 86% have chosen to stay on flexible contracts. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had that promise before,\u201d McDonnell said on Monday, \u201cbut it hasn\u2019t been realised. The best security we can have is them recognising trade unions so grievances can get resolved rather than strike action.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other speakers included a choir dressed up as the McDonald\u2019s mascot Ronald McDonald, who called themselves the Evil Ronalds. Lorna McKinnon, 24, and Toni Bruce, 26, both workers in the services industry in Glasgow, performed a spoken word piece and commended fast food worker\u2019s ability to organise themselves.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe think what the guys in Cambridge and Crayford are doing is utterly inspiring,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cNot just for fast food workers but for every worker.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abdi Biin, 20, left McDonald\u2019s after his hours were cut because he complained about not being allowed to wear gloves to cook. \u201cI\u2019m here to help McDonald\u2019s employees get rights and the living wage. They don\u2019t pay for overtime, there\u2019s health and safety issues, a lot of things that a trade union could help with,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWorkers need to be protected. All McDonald\u2019s cares about is profit. There\u2019s no middle person to help workers, no one\u2019s going to help them on the higher levels.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biin said he used to get paid around \u00a35.30 an hour. \u201cI worked long hours, it wasn\u2019t enough. I remember someone worked two jobs in a theme park and McDonald\u2019s because the pay was so bad.\u201d</p> \n<p>A McDonald\u2019s spokesman said the company was \u201cproviding our people with the option of a guaranteed hour contract, and all restaurants will have these contracts in place by the end of 2017\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said the company \u201cand its franchisees had delivered three pay rises since April 2016, increasing the average hourly pay rate by 15%. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe are proud of our people at McDonald\u2019s, they are at the heart of all we do and we work hard to ensure that our teams are treated fairly. Our internal processes underpin that commitment.\u201d <br></p>",

Growth in the construction sector fell unexpectedly to a one-year low in August, the closely watched Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index for the industry showed on Monday. The gauge of economic activity fell to 51.1 last month from 51.9 in July, pointing to marginal expansion. fifty indicates stagnation, while anything below signals contraction. The figures show the construction sector \u201cflirting with another recession\u201d, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy. There could be a worse outlook if limited progress in the Brexit talks forced large firms to consider relocating activities to Europe. Numerous banks from HSBC to Goldman Sachs have suggested they could move staff. \u201cIf, as we expect, Brexit negotiations continue to progress slowly, more firms will activate Brexit contingency plans, freeing up office space and sapping demand for new commercial projects,\u201d Tombs said. Only robust housebuilding activity kept the industry growing in August, as civil engineering work was close to stagnation and commercial building dropped at the fastest pace since July 2016. The subdued demand was linked to a lack of new work following completed projects, as heightened economic uncertainty puts projects on hold. That has led employment numbers to rise at the slowest pace since July 2016. Duncan Brock of Cips (the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply), which helps to compile the survey, said: \u201cReduced government spending, economic uncertainty and Brexit-delayed decision-making among clients were largely to blame.\u201d The poor results suggest the construction sector will contribute little, if anything, to GDP in the three months to the end of September. Firms are also bracing for the soft patch to continue into the autumn, according to the survey, as fragile confidence among firms contributes to weaker trends for job creation. The figures come after a recent slide in the value of sterling, adding pressure to the costs of UK consumers and weakening the purchasing power of businesses reliant on products from abroad. That could push inflation higher, raising pressure on the Bank of England to consider tackling the climb through the use of higher interest rates. The weak survey also comes after the Office for National Statistics pointed to house prices moderating since the middle of last year following the Brexit vote, especially in London. The overall UK annual increase is about 5% in the first half of the year. However, there is support for house prices from low levels of unemployment \u2013 at the lowest point since the mid 1970s \u2013 and from rockbottom interest rates keeping mortgage costs low. The construction data also failed to mimic a more buoyant outlook for Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector, which showed the potential for robust production over the coming months. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at trading firm IG, said: \u201cUnfortunately, given the current trajectory, it seems like a strong possibility that we could see the construction sector move back into contraction in the coming months.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Worries about rising inflation among UK consumers are at their greatest in three and a half years, while people\u2019s confidence in Britain\u2019s financial situation has worsened, according to a survey. A monthly poll by Lloyds Bank found that 65% of people felt negative about levels of inflation in July, up from 60% in June and the highest level since January 2014. The report chimes with Markit\u2019s household finance index, which is one of the most-watched measures of household sentiment and reported in July that UK households faced intense pressures over costs after a steep rise in prices for goods and services. Inflation was 2.6% in July, and is expected to rise to 3% in coming months. Largely a result of the weaker pound pushing up import costs, inflation has outstripped growth in wages, squeezing household incomes. Lloyds said people were also less confident about the UK\u2019s financial situation, with 69% feeling negative, up from 67% in June and 60% in July 2016. Despite worries over the economy, people remain relatively upbeat about their own circumstances, with 64% feeling positive about their personal financial situation in July, unchanged from June. Nearly 80% of people felt positive about their own job security, down slightly from June. The future outlook seems more uncertain, however. The proportion of people who thought they would be saving more in six months\u2019 time fell to 20% in July from 27% in June. Fewer people also believed that they would be paying off more debt in six months\u2019 time, with the balance dropping to 15% from 20%. Analysis by Lloyds of its customer account data suggests that people are cutting back spending on essentials such as rent, mortgage payments, utility bills, food and fuel. It showed that the year-on-year growth in consumers\u2019 spending on essentials fell to 2% in from from 3% in June. Food, which accounts for 40% of essential spending, recorded a year-on-year increase of 2%, down from 4% in June. Fuel spend rose by 5%, the lowest rate of growth since last October, and down from a peak of 13% in April. Robin Bulloch, the managing director of Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cDespite a slight slowdown in the rate of essential spending growth over the summer, concerns around inflation have continued to build, which has an impact on future intentions. \u201cWith the rate of savings already at a record low, significantly fewer people now expect to be putting more money aside in six months\u2019 time. While the pressure on disposable income makes this understandable, it does mean consumers are less able to absorb any further squeeze on their finances.\u201d",

About 40 staff will go on strike on Monday at two restaurants in Cambridge and Crayford, south-east London, after a ballot in favour of industrial action amid concerns over low wages and the use of zero-hours contracts. The fast-food chain has been one of the biggest users of zero-hours contracts in Britain, although it has recently started offering workers the option of moving to fixed hours. The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, one of Britain\u2019s oldest trade unions, said staff were demanding a wage of at least \u00a310 an hour, more secure working hours and union recognition. The strike has been backed by Jeremy Corbyn. In a statement, the Labour leader said: \u201cOur party offers support and solidarity to the brave McDonald\u2019s workers, who are making history today. They are standing up for workers\u2019 rights by leading the first ever strike at McDonald\u2019s in the UK. \u201cTheir demands \u2013 an end to zero-hours contracts by the end of the year, union recognition and a \u00a310 per hour minimum wage \u2013 are just, and should be met.\u201d McDonald\u2019s said those taking action represented 0.01% of its UK workforce and said the dispute was related to its internal grievance procedures. Staff in Cambridge and Crayford will mount early morning picket lines before attending a rally in Westminster. The company said all its 115,000 staff in the UK, where it has 1,249 restaurants, would be offered the option of taking a contract with guaranteed hours by the end of the year. It said so far 86% of employees had chosen to stay on flexible contracts. More than 100 union and Labour party members along with McDonald\u2019s workers protested outside the company\u2019s headquarters in East Finchley, London, on Saturday. The company was expecting further \u201csolidarity protests\u201d outside several restaurants on Monday, but stressed that if they did not involve employees, its outlets would stay open. Ian Hodson, BFAWU\u2019s national president, told the Guardian: \u201cThis is the second-largest restaurant company in the world that makes $22bn (\u00a317bn) revenues a year, and yet its workers are living in poverty. They have been the pioneers of zero-hours contracts.\u201d He said McDonald\u2019s had started offering some staff the option of moving on to guaranteed-hours contracts two weeks ago. Hodson said the strike might spread. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s has had countless opportunities to resolve grievances by offering workers a fair wage and acceptable working conditions. This is a call for change. \u201cFor far too long, workers in fast food restaurants such as McDonald\u2019s have had to deal with poor working conditions, drastic cuts to employee hours, and even bullying in the workplace \u2013 viewed by many as a punishment for joining a union.\u201d Steve, 25, who works at the Cambridge McDonald\u2019s and gets paid \u00a37.60 an hour on a zero-hours contract, explained why he had chosen to strike. He said: \u201cI get about 35 hours a week but even so I can only afford to live because I get all my meals at McDonalds. \u201cRent is expensive in Cambridge and although I have a roof over my head, I am sleeping on a mattress on the floor. Before I moved into my current house-share four weeks ago, I was sofa-surfing while trying to save the deposit.\u201d There was also always a fear that he would get no shifts next week. \u201cIt\u2019s happened to a friend of mine who went on holiday who came back to just one shift a week instead of five,\u201d he said. \u201cNo explanation was given, because they don\u2019t have to give one.\u201d Steve said it was not only pay and contracts that were the problem. He said: \u201cWe are also striking because of the bullying and harassment that goes on. There has been some truly appalling behaviour.\u201d He admitted he was anxious about striking but had received countless messages of support from all over the world. \u201cI\u2019ve had emails from unions in South Africa and McDonald\u2019s workers in New Zealand. I\u2019ve never felt so supported in my whole life.\u201d Tyrone, 17, who also works at McDonald\u2019s in Cambridge, told the Guardian last week he was paid \u00a34.75 an hour, just above the legal minimum for a worker his age. Despite working four shifts a week of up to eight hours, he is homeless and sleeps on an airbed in a friend\u2019s flat. Hodson said Tyrone was one of the McDonald\u2019s staff involved in the dispute, after his hours were cut \u201cby a bullying manager\u201d. The internal grievance cases included claims of bullying and sexual harassment, Hodson said. The McDonald\u2019s chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, last year took home a total pay package of $15.35m (\u00a311.8m). A McDonald\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cAs announced in April this year, together with our franchisees, we are providing our people with the option of a guaranteed-hour contract, and all restaurants will have these contracts in place by the end of 2017. He said McDonald\u2019s and its franchisees had awarded staff three pay rises since April 2016, which increased the average hourly pay rate by 15%. McDonald\u2019s says all its hourly pay rates are above the national living wage. For under-18s this is \u00a35.42, for 18- to 20-year-olds it is \u00a36.84, for 21- to 24-year-olds the rate is \u00a38.13 and for over-25s it is \u00a38.31. The spokesman added: \u201cWe are proud of our people at McDonald\u2019s. They are at the heart of all we do and we work hard to ensure that our teams are treated fairly. Our internal processes underpin that commitment.\u201d",
