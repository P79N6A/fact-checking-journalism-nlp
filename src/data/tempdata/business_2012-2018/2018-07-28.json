      "bodyText": "There are those in Australia who look across the Pacific and wonder what it would be like to have a Trump-style government, and whether such a calamity could happen here. The correct answer, of course, is not only that it could but that it is happening right now. Yes, some of the more horrific aspects of the Trump presidency \u2013 the alleged collusion with Russian forces, for example \u2013 are absent, but from a policy sense there is little that would see Turnbull wishing to be separate from Trump. Tax cuts that favour the wealthy? Hell yes. The Turnbull government\u2019s key economic policy has been to bring in tax cuts which when fully completed will overwhelmingly favour the wealthy and which will exacerbate income inequality. Tax cuts for corporations? Yes please! While the Turnbull government has been unable to get the bulk of its company tax cuts through, there are few doubts that they won\u2019t occur. Pauline Hanson is expected to give the government her support once the Longman byelection is out of the way and she doesn\u2019t have to explain to voters why she supported a policy most of them do not. A willingness to hit the racial dog-whistle? Why certainly. The signs are already here that the next election is going to be a horror show of talk about migrants and crime and blaming immigration for everything from wages to housing prices to congestion, and all coated with a very thin veneer of racial anxiety. Trump has spent much of the past year talking up fears of the MS-13 gangs to such an extent that despite no evidence of any growing activity, 85% of those who voted for Trump now believe the gang is a very serious or a somewhat serious \u201cnational threat\u201d. For Malcolm Turnbull and his government, substitute MS-13 for \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d in Melbourne. Last week on 3AW Turnbull responded to Neil Mitchell\u2019s question of whether he believed \u201cpeople in Melbourne are frightened to go to restaurants because of Sudanese gangs?\u201d by saying, \u201cWell I\u2019ve heard that from people in Melbourne and Neil you\u2019re a person in Melbourne. Well I\u2019ve heard it, I\u2019ve heard people, colleagues from Melbourne say that there is a real anxiety about crime in Melbourne. It is a real issue.\u201d There was a time Turnbull might have been expected to take a stand against such fear-mongering. A time when \u201cheard it from people\u201d would not within a sentence turn into \u201ca real issue\u201d. But those days are long gone. He might not be as vulgar as Trump, but Turnbull is just as willing to appeal to the lowest common denominator. And what about thin-skinned responses to criticism? The ongoing attempts from the Turnbull government to discredit the ABC is only marginally less subtle than Trump\u2019s railing against the \u201cfake media\u201d. The Turnbull government is not content to merely seek to have the ABC remove content it finds displeasing. This week the health department sought to have the parliamentary library take down a post which highlighted just how weak are the privacy provisions surrounding the My Health Record. I suspect that censoring those who are pointing out reasons the public should not trust a government service is not the best way to have the public believe they can trust that service \u2013 or their government. And finally, how about a preference for big business? As we have seen with the company tax cuts that is certainly evident, but a perfect example of where the Turnbull government\u2019s priorities lie came this week with the announcement of Nine taking over Fairfax. The deal is a terrible one for those who value a diverse media. I suggested on Twitter that talk the new company would have \u201cplenty of Fairfax DNA\u201d was like saying the Brisbane Lions have plenty of Fitzroy DNA. But as a few people pointed out to me, at least Brisbane kept the \u201cLion\u201d name and also makes an effort to keep the Fitzroy legacy alive as best it can. That the new company couldn\u2019t even be bothered keeping \u201cFairfax\u201d in a manner similar to \u201cSeven West Media\u201d or \u201cTime Warner\u201d shows how little care there is about what Fairfax represents, and does not bode well. You can blame the Fairfax management \u2013 and it sure as heck deserves plenty \u2013 but this takeover would not have occurred had the Turnbull government not removed the cross-media ownership laws last year. That legislation \u2013 made possible with the support of One Nation, Nick Xenophon and Derryn Hinch \u2013 was designed to provoke such takeovers. It is not about competition in the free market, it is not about greater diversity of media voices or giving media companies a better ability to hold governments and corporations to account. It is about \u2013 as is inevitably all pro-business legislation \u2013 ensuring consolidation of power in the market. In defending the legislation this week Turnbull stated that \u201call the media companies strongly supported these laws\u201d. It was a view parroted by the communications minister, Mitch Fifeld, justifying the legislation because it was supported by \u201cNine, Seven, Ten, WIN, Prime, Southern Cross Austereo, News Limited, Fairfax, Free TV, Commercial Radio Australia and Fox\u201d. Yes, companies wanting to buy other companies and companies wanting to be bought by other companies liked the legislation. I am shocked. It does highlight how the government will default to doing what business wants rather than what might be best for workers, or in this case our democratic society. If business says it is what is needed, well then that is what is supplied, and that is how it is justified. It all makes for a pretty awful mix. And while those in the US are wondering whether the changes wrought by the Trump presidency can ever be undone, here too the impact of the Turnbull government will be long lived.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s interest-rate setters are expected to vote on Thursday to raise the cost of borrowing for only the second time since the 2008 crash. Most City analysts agree: the Bank\u2019s base rate will rise from 0.5% to 0.75%. That said, we\u2019ve been here before. Mortgage borrowers were told in February that a rate rise was imminent and were guided by governor Mark Carney to pencil in the May meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC) as decision day. Then, in March, the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d arrived, and the snow and wind forced large parts of the construction industry and the population at large to down tools. Carney said a delay was needed while the Bank assessed the damage to the economy. August became the next moment for a rate rise. He earned the sobriquet \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d for his trouble \u2013 an accusation first levelled at the Bank back in 2014. The only other rise since 2008 happened in November 2017, when the Bank reversed an emergency cut to 0.25% made in the wake of the Brexit vote the previous year. Of the nine-strong MPC, it looks like chief economist Andy Haldane, former City economists Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders, and Treasury adviser Sir David Ramsden will vote for a rise with Carney, Ben Broadbent and academic Silvana Tenreyro. At the moment only Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, stands opposed. And yet, as with every central bank decision, the outcome this week is unknown and there is the small possibility that policymakers will say that uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations coupled with Britain\u2019s weak recovery from the financial crash must mean borrowing rates stay low. Here we discuss the key issues that will determine the outcome. Inflation The Bank of England aims to keep the consumer prices (CPI) measure of inflation at around 2%. If it is higher or lower, policymakers must show how they intend to bring it back into line within two years. It\u2019s not an easy task. The UK economy is among the most open in the world with a high level of imports and exports. In 2011, a jump in oil and gas prices sent inflation soaring to 5%. In 2015 a dive in oil and gas prices sent CPI to below zero. Last year the collapse in the value of sterling sent inflation back up again to 3%. In none of these instances were prices changed by ordinary domestic pressures, such as wage rises. It meant that Threadneedle Street was effectively prevented from acting; even if it had, prices would have moved anyway. Central bankers will often refer to core inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as oil prices, as a better guide on how to act. Since 2008, core inflation in the developed world has remained below 2%. In response, central banks have sought to stimulate economic activity and spending by keeping interest rates low. They have also used a series of measures to make sure their policies are effective on the high street; in the UK these included credit subsidies to banks to keep mortgage rates low, and quantitative easing, which has encouraged banks to lend more funds for businesses to invest. However, the stimulative properties of QE have waned in recent years and GDP is currently running at an annual rate between 1.3% and 1.6%, well below the 2.5% average seen before the financial crash. Verdict: No rate rise Employment If employment were the only measure of economic success, then the Bank of England would have started raising interest rates in 2015. The jobs market was expanding at a fast pace and pushing back to historical highs. Inflation was low and GDP was growing fast. A minority of members of the MPC were keen to raise rates even then, namely Ian McCafferty \u2013 who will attend his last rates meeting this week \u2013 and the King\u2019s College London academic Martin Weale, who has since departed. However their colleagues, including the governor, refused to budge, arguing that wages remained low. Since then the employment rate has hit a succession of historical highs as women and older people have flooded back to the workplace. At 75.7%, the employment rate has never been higher and unemployment is at a 33-year low of 4.2%. Corporate Britain says it is desperate for skilled staff, especially now that continental European workers are more reluctant to travel to the UK. That suggests the labour market is going to tighten further. Verdict: Rate rise Wages Employment is strong and unemployment is low, but wage growth remains weak. This shouldn\u2019t happen, according to standard economic models. The Phillips curve tells us that when employment is strong, wages go up. And the logic of this is unimpeachable. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the data provider IHS Markit, says Bank officials will focus on underlying private sector earnings, which are rising by 2.9%. That is sufficient, he thinks, to argue that wage pressure is building, though he doesn\u2019t expect another rate rise until next May even if August\u2019s goes ahead. However, the standard measure of employment is flawed, argue the eminent economists David Bell of Stirling University and David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US. Their recent study found that once underemployment was taken into account, the unemployment rate jumped from 4.2% to 7.7%. That\u2019s why wages are only rising at 2.7% on average and not the 3% to 4% the Bank says is needed before wage pressures force up prices. Underemployment is important because it adds up the extra hours staff say they want to work. When a company thinks it needs to expand capacity, it doesn\u2019t need to hunt around for extra staff at higher wage rates; it just increases the hours of existing staff. As long as this is possible, wage rises, and therefore price pressures, remain muted. Verdict: No rate rise Currency The pound has played a starring role in Britain\u2019s recovery from the panic following the Brexit vote. In the six months after the vote, sterling lost more than 17% of its value against the dollar and about 10% against the euro. In 2014 the pound was worth $1.70. On the eve of the vote it stood at around $1.50. By October 2016 it was worth just $1.22. The fall in value made exports cheaper, boosting foreign demand for British goods. In response manufacturers ramped up production. But it had the side-effect of increasing the cost of imports, which pushed up the cost of food and commodities such as copper and oil. Inflation jumped to 3%. Since the Bank made it clear in autumn last year that it planned to raise rates, the pound has recovered some of its value to stand at $1.31. Higher interest rates encourage foreign investors to buy assets in the UK, for which they need pounds. This bids up the value of sterling. If the Bank backs away from a rate rise on Thursday, the pound will probably slide again, raising import prices and inflation. Verdict: Rate rise Brexit With the government encouraging consumers to stockpile baked beans and hospitals to amass enough medicines to bridge a possible customs blockade by the EU, a hard Brexit is looking like a more and more likely outcome. October, when a series of votes on the UK\u2019s final relationship with the EU are likely to rock parliament to its foundations, could be a difficult time for the economy. The MPC will wonder whether raising rates now will add to the sense of unease among consumers and business. They are expected to argue that consumer confidence has recovered and business confidence, especially as it affects hiring staff, remains strong. Business investment is weak and is likely to remain that way until after the UK leaves the EU, and a rate rise won\u2019t affect that situation, will be the thinking. Verdict: Rate rise Pride Bank forecasts of inflation, wage growth, business investment and unemployment have proved to be wayward at best and plain wrong at worst before and during Carney\u2019s tenure at Threadneedle Street. Since 2010, the Bank has forecast a return of business investment and with it higher productivity and higher wages. The combination of these three trends would lead to higher inflation. The answer was to raise interest rates. It meant that for several years the Bank threatened to increase rates, but when it found the forecasts to be a mirage, backtracked. It proved to be an embarrassing series of climbdowns and the Bank\u2019s pride was hurt. Brexit changed all that. Carney said the decision to leave the EU meant the economy was weaker and its maximum GDP growth rate without creating inflation was about 1.5%, not the 2.5% seen before the financial crash. In November, the economy was strengthening and the Bank said that justified a rate rise. The economy is weaker now, but the MPC dare not back down. Verdict: Rate rise",

He earned the sobriquet \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d for his trouble \u2013 an accusation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/24/bank-of-england-unreliable-boyfriend-interest-rates\" title=\"\">first levelled at the Bank back in 2014</a>.</p> <p>The only other rise since 2008 happened in November 2017, when the Bank reversed an emergency cut to 0.25% made in the wake of the Brexit vote the previous year.</p> <p>Of the nine-strong MPC, it looks like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/21/bank-of-england-moves-closer-to-august-interest-rate-rise\" title=\"\">chief economist Andy Haldane</a>, former City economists Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders, and Treasury adviser Sir David Ramsden will vote for a rise with Carney, Ben Broadbent and academic Silvana Tenreyro. At the moment only Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, stands opposed.</p> <p>And yet, as with every central bank decision, the outcome this week is unknown and there is the small possibility that policymakers will say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/17/no-deal-brexit-would-have-big-economic-consequences-carney\" title=\"\">uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations</a> coupled with Britain\u2019s weak recovery from the financial crash must mean borrowing rates stay low.</p> <p>Here we discuss the key issues that will determine the outcome.</p> <h2>Inflation</h2> <p>The Bank of England aims to keep the consumer prices (CPI) measure of inflation at around 2%. If it is higher or lower, policymakers must show how they intend to bring it back into line within two years.</p> <p>It\u2019s not an easy task. The UK economy is among the most open in the world with a high level of imports and exports. In 2011, a jump in oil and gas prices sent inflation soaring to 5%. In 2015 a dive in oil and gas prices sent CPI to below zero. Last year the collapse in the value of sterling sent inflation back up again to 3%. In none of these instances were prices changed by ordinary domestic pressures, such as wage rises. It meant that Threadneedle Street was effectively prevented from acting; even if it had, prices would have moved anyway.</p> <p>Central bankers will often refer to core inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as oil prices, as a better guide on how to act. Since 2008, core inflation in the developed world has remained below 2%. In response, central banks have sought to stimulate economic activity and spending by keeping interest rates low. They have also used a series of measures to make sure their policies are effective on the high street; in the UK these included credit subsidies to banks to keep mortgage rates low, and quantitative easing, which has encouraged banks to lend more funds for businesses to invest.</p> <p>However, the stimulative properties of QE have waned in recent years and GDP is currently running at an annual rate between 1.3% and 1.6%, well below the 2.5% average seen before the financial crash.<br><strong>Verdict: No rate rise</strong></p> <h2>Employment</h2> <p>If employment were the only measure of economic success, then the Bank of England would have started raising interest rates in 2015. The jobs market was expanding at a fast pace and pushing back to historical highs. Inflation was low and GDP was growing fast.</p> <p> A minority of members of the MPC were keen to raise rates even then, namely Ian McCafferty \u2013 who will attend his last rates meeting this week \u2013 and the King\u2019s College London academic Martin Weale, who has since departed. However their colleagues, including the governor, refused to budge, arguing that wages remained low.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"794aab566729dfe67a9833f00287f03c690e8730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/794aab566729dfe67a9833f00287f03c690e8730/343_0_1868_2335/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Carney\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Carney is one of the nine-member MPC who will vote in favour of a rise this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then the employment rate has hit a succession of historical highs as women and older people have flooded back to the workplace. At 75.7%, the employment rate has never been higher and unemployment is at a 33-year low of 4.2%.</p> <p>Corporate Britain says it is desperate for skilled staff, especially now that continental European workers are more reluctant to travel to the UK. That suggests the labour market is going to tighten further.<br><strong>Verdict: Rate rise</strong></p> <h2>Wages</h2> <p>Employment is strong and unemployment is low, but wage growth remains weak. This shouldn\u2019t happen, according to standard economic models. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/missing-pay-rises-the-ever-deepening-economics-mystery\" title=\"\">Phillips curve</a> tells us that when employment is strong, wages go up. And the logic of this is unimpeachable.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the data provider IHS Markit, says Bank officials will focus on underlying private sector earnings, which are rising by 2.9%. That is sufficient, he thinks, to argue that wage pressure is building, though he doesn\u2019t expect another rate rise until next May even if August\u2019s goes&#xa0;ahead.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/23/dont-wait-worried-workers-call-shorts-on-wages\" title=\"\">the standard measure of employment is flawed</a>, argue the eminent economists David Bell of Stirling University and David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US. Their recent study found that once underemployment was taken into account, the unemployment rate jumped from 4.2% to 7.7%. That\u2019s why wages are only rising at 2.7% on average and not the 3% to 4% the Bank says is needed before wage pressures force up prices.</p> <p>Underemployment is important because it adds up the extra hours staff say they want to work. When a company thinks it needs to expand capacity, it doesn\u2019t need to hunt around for extra staff at higher wage rates; it just increases the hours of existing staff. As long as this is possible, wage rises, and therefore price pressures, remain muted.<br><strong>Verdict: No rate rise</strong></p> <h2>Currency</h2> <p>The pound has played a starring role in Britain\u2019s recovery from the panic following the Brexit vote. In the six months after the vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/31/sterling-pound-slide-winners-losers-2016-uk-companies-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">sterling lost more than 17% of its value against the dollar</a> and about 10% against the euro. In 2014 the pound was worth $1.70. On the eve of the vote it stood at around $1.50. By October 2016 it was worth just $1.22.</p> <p>The fall in value made exports cheaper, boosting foreign demand for British goods. In response manufacturers ramped up production.</p> <p>But it had the side-effect of increasing the cost of imports, which pushed up the cost of food and commodities such as copper and oil. Inflation jumped to 3%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a577dd8caa204ab1551af5f84aa872f3f38afe5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a577dd8caa204ab1551af5f84aa872f3f38afe5a/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bank of England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank of England has faced criticism for some of its economic forecasting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the Bank made it clear in autumn last year that it planned to raise rates, the pound has recovered some of its value to stand at $1.31. Higher interest rates encourage foreign investors to buy assets in the UK, for which they need pounds. This bids up the value of sterling.</p> <p>If the Bank backs away from a rate rise on Thursday, the pound will probably slide again, raising import prices and inflation.<br><strong>Verdict: Rate rise</strong></p> <h2>Brexit</h2> <p>With the government encouraging consumers to stockpile baked beans and hospitals to amass enough medicines to bridge a possible customs blockade by the EU, a hard Brexit is looking like a more and more likely outcome.</p> <p>October, when a series of votes on the UK\u2019s final relationship with the EU are likely to rock parliament to its foundations, could be a difficult time for the economy. The MPC will wonder whether raising rates now will add to the sense of unease among consumers and business. They are expected to argue that consumer confidence has recovered and business confidence, especially as it affects hiring staff, remains strong. Business investment is weak and is likely to remain that way until after the UK leaves the EU, and a rate rise won\u2019t affect that situation, will be the thinking.<br><strong>Verdict: Rate rise</strong></p> <h2>Pride</h2> <p>Bank forecasts of inflation, wage growth, business investment and unemployment have proved to be wayward at best and plain wrong at worst before and during Carney\u2019s tenure at Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>Since 2010, the Bank has forecast a return of business investment and with it higher productivity and higher wages. The combination of these three trends would lead to higher inflation. The answer was to raise interest rates. It meant that for several years the Bank threatened to increase rates, but when it found the forecasts to be a mirage, backtracked. It proved to be an embarrassing series of climbdowns and the Bank\u2019s pride was hurt.</p> <p>Brexit changed all that. Carney said the decision to leave the EU meant the economy was weaker and its maximum GDP growth rate without creating inflation was about 1.5%, not the 2.5% seen before the financial crash.</p> <p>In November, the economy was strengthening and the Bank said that justified a rate rise. The economy is weaker now, but the MPC dare not back down.<br><strong>Verdict: Rate rise</strong></p>",

I think it\u2019s wonderful if companies give us golden oldies work for as long as we want.\u201d Much has changed in her four decades at the Co-op, not least the arrival of exotic fruits and avocados as some of Britain\u2019s favourite foods. One certain change in the decades to come, is that more people will, like Barbara, be working for longer. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018My God, I don\u2019t want to work till I\u2019m 70 \u2013 that\u2019s awful.\u2019 But they may have to. They won\u2019t have an option,\u201d says French. Higher living standards and better healthcare mean the number of over-65s in Britain is set to increase by almost half by the early 2030s, and official figures already show more people staying in work longer. Falling numbers of immigrants \u2013 who tend to be younger \u2013 since the EU referendum means the UK population is ageing faster than expected, which poses profound challenges for the country. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that NHS spending will need to almost double from 8% of GDP in the early 2020s to 13.8% by the mid-2060s because of the demographic shift. Without policy changes, public debt relative to the size of the economy could rise to 283% by 2067 from around 80% today. Debate about age and the economy has recently focused on the plight of millennials. However, older workers face rampant workplace discrimination, according to MPs on the women and equalities select committee, even though treating older people differently at work is illegal under the Equality Act 2010. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, recently drew angry comments when he said the UK economy was in a \u201cmenopausal\u201d phase \u2013 past its productive peak. Although he soon apologised, observers pointed out that women over 50 are the fastest-growing group of workers in the UK and are far from past their economic peak. Changes to the state pension age for women, which is gradually rising to meet the male threshold of 65, are part of the reason for the increase. Meanwhile, there are now more than 10 million over-50s in work \u2013 double the 1990s number and accounting for almost a third of the overall UK workforce. French says younger people might worry about large numbers of older workers making it harder for them to find a job, or about seeing their career progression blocked. But she argues that companies could always create more jobs: \u201cThey can put someone in my job with me \u2013 that\u2019s never going to be a problem.\u201d Economists call this idea the lump of labour fallacy, arguing that there is not a fixed amount of work in the world, and that the more jobs are added to an economy, the bigger it can become. The same argument is applied to immigration, where economists agree migrant labour stands to boost host economies rather than steal domestic workers\u2019 jobs. There are, however, fears that growing numbers of older workers could hold back the growth of productivity and wages, as the older we get the slower we become and the more outdated our skills might be. According to the Oxford Economics thinktank, ageing societies with a bigger share of over-60s workers see lower wage growth. It found eurozone wage growth depressed by as much as 0.3% annually. More funding for training in later life can help. Ben Franklin, economist at the International Longevity Centre, says: \u201cIt may well be that in 10 years\u2019 time the peak age for productivity is 60 rather than 50. Age may be a drag on per capita growth at the moment, but it doesn\u2019t have to be if you can translate health gains into productivity gains.\u201d The International Monetary Fund fears that if baby boomers continue retiring at 60-65, Britain and other advanced economies could be overwhelmed by pensioners. It reckons ageing societies have the potential to slow economic growth by as much as 3% by the middle of the century, while also increasing the strain on the welfare state. Franklin says keeping people in the workforce is the most efficient thing to do. \u201cWe need older workers, even if they\u2019re less productive. You may be less productive as a 70-year-old, but if you\u2019re not in the workforce, your output is lost altogether.\u201d",
