      "bodyText": "German discounter Aldi has underlined its UK ambitions with expansion plans that outstrip those of other supermarkets, opening almost twice as much new store space this year than its nearest rivals. Aldi, which arrived in the UK a quarter of a century ago, will add just over a million square feet of floor space, around 60 stores, in 2015. This is a bigger expansion than Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco put together. Fellow German budget supermarket Lidl will also be adding 340,000 sq ft of new space, twice Tesco\u2019s planned growth for 2015. Aldi\u2019s expansion plans underscore the changing shape of the sector, the overall growth of which will come mainly in smaller stores as the shopping habits of UK consumers shift from weekly trips to big out-of-town supermarkets to more frequent visits to mid-sized or local stores. According to the research from the commercial property industry IPD and Colliers, reported in the Sunday Telegraph, Aldi\u2019s planned extra 1.02m sq ft will dwarf the 600,000 sq ft planned by Asda. Among the rest of the big four, Sainsbury\u2019s will add 450,000 sq ft, Morrisons 220,000 sq ft and Tesco 170,000 sq ft. Marks &amp; Spencer, whose smaller Simply Food stores have been a success, will be opening 600,000 sq ft of extra retail space. The big four supermarkets have seen their domination chipped away as disappointing profits have led them to rein in planned openings, with Tesco in particular hitting troubled waters: profit warnings and accounting shortfalls last autumn were followed by news that 49 planned stores would be scrapped and that 43 existing shops would be closed. James Watson, head of UK investment at Colliers, told the Sunday Telegraph that traditional supermarkets have been undermined by shoppers\u2019 desire for smaller basket-based purchases combined with the growth of online grocery shopping. This has eroded the lucrative profits generated by big weekly trolley shops at larger stores. Analysts say the chains have been effectively subsidising customers who order via the internet, with delivery charges rarely covering the costs. However, Aldi is also considering a move into online delivery, despite its apparent conflict with the German retailer\u2019s focus on a simple, low-cost business model. The UK, whose 5% proportion of grocery shopping done via the internet is relatively high in Europe, is likely to be the first market where Aldi would introduce such a service. Lebensmittel Zeitung, a German trade journal, said Aldi South, which runs Aldi\u2019s UK and Irish businesses, might go online in other countries including Germany, while sister company Aldi North was considering a similar move in Spain and Portugal. The German incursion into the big four\u2019s territory is continuing apace, with Aldi reaching a 5% market share by the end of last month, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel, and rival Lidl growing to 3.5%. Last November, Aldi said it would create 35,000 jobs in Britain through its plans to have 1,000 UK stores by 2022, double its current number. Aldi\u2019s position as a mainstay of the UK market has been confirmed by a commercial deal announced last week, when it was named as the official supermarket sponsor for the British Olympic team for the 2016 Games in Rio, in a \u00a310m deal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US government is expected this week to give the go-ahead to a controversial plan by Shell to restart drilling for oil in the Arctic. The green light from Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, will spark protests from environmentalists who have campaigned against proposed exploration by the Anglo-Dutch group in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas off Alaska. Jewell will make a formal statement backing the decision as soon as Wednesday, the earliest point at which her department can rubber-stamp an approval given last month given by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The US Interior Department had been forced to replay the decision-making process after a US federal court ruled last year, in a case brought by environmental groups, that the government had made mistakes in assessing the environmental risks in the drilling programme. However, the BOEM, an arm of Jewell\u2019s department, has backed the drilling after going through the process again, despite revealing in its Environmental Impact Statement \u201cthere is a 75% chance of one or more large spills\u201d occurring. A leading academic, Prof Robert Bea, from the engineering faculty at the University of California in Berkeley, who made a special study of the Deepwater Horizon accident, has raised new concerns that the recent slump in oil prices could compromise safety across the industry as oil producers strive to cut costs. Bea, who has worked as a consultant to BP and Shell, told the Guardian: \u201cWe should all be concerned about tradeoffs between production and protection ... With the significant reduction in the price for oil, there are equally significant pressures to reduce costs so that acceptable profitability can be maintained.\u201d Bea was brought in by Shell in 2004 to reviewhow the group had assessed the risks associated with the proposed drilling in the Chukchi Sea. \u201cAt the end of the week\u2019s discussions, we agreed to disagree,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Greenpeace argues that drilling in extreme Arctic conditions is always risky, especially during a period when industry is trying to reduce overheads due to a price of $50 per barrel oil. \u201cPiling cost-cutting pressures onto these contractors, who already have frankly atrocious safety records, doesn\u2019t bode well for the Arctic, or the people and wildlife that call it home,\u201d said Charlie Kronick, Greenpeace\u2019s Arctic campaigner. But Kronick said the move particularly made no sense in the context of countering global warming. \u201cIf we want to avoid catastrophic climate change we can\u2019t even burn all the fossil fuels we already have; we definitely don\u2019t need to trash what\u2019s left of the melting Arctic looking for more. \u201cObama needs to show leadership ahead of the Paris climate talks; allowing Arctic drilling in Alaska will seriously undermine that leadership and US credibility.\u201d Ed Davey, the British energy and climate change secretary, has asked the Bank of England to investigate threats to the financial system due to a carbon bubble caused by fossil fuels which cannot be burned because of global warming. Shell declined to comment on the prospective Arctic go-ahead but has previously said a decision on whether to start drilling again this summer would depend on a number of factors including regulatory and legal certainty. Ben van Beurden, the chief executive, told a recent financial results conference that he was keen to proceed: \u201cWe have retained very significant capability to be ready this year to go ahead. So will we go ahead? Yes, if we can.\u201d On the issue of safety a spokesman for the company said: \u201cWe\u2019ve said clearly that our plans must meet our own high bar as well as the one set by US regulators. Both have taken unprecedented measures to ensure offshore operations and contingency plans in the US Arctic are second to none.\u201d Shell was forced to halt operations in Arctic the middle of 2012 after the failure of a key piece of safety equipment that would be used to tackle oil spills. The situation for the company became worse when the drilling rig it was using, the Kulluk, ran aground after it was being towed back to port. A US coast guard report into the incident was heavily critical of the incident and Noble Drilling, which was working for Shell, was slapped with $12m worth of fines and community payments. Shell hoped to restart in 2013 and then again in 2014 but failed after a series of legal challenges and other setbacks. Despite its determination to press ahead in the Arctic, Shell aims to confront the risk that climate change may pose to its future, backing a resolution from activist shareholders to be debated at its May annual general meeting. This requires Shell to test whether its business model is compatible with the pledge by the world\u2019s nations to limit global warming to a further rise of 2C. The group also says it has always made clear that cost cutting must never compromise safety and remains committed to the highest safety initiatives through a Goal Zero initiative. \u201cGoal Zero captures the belief that we can operate without fatalities or significant incidents despite the often difficult conditions in which we operate.\u201d",

He told the House of Lords economic affairs committee that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/07/oil-price-brent-crude-falls-below-50-barrel\">low oil prices</a> would have an effect on the economy long before a cut in interest rates kicked in. </p> <p>\u201cThe impact of that extra stimulus ... would happen well after the oil price fall had moved through the economy and we would just add unnecessary volatility to inflation. That would be foolish,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed its <a href=\"http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/March2015EFO_18-03-webv1.pdf\">annual inflation forecast for 2015 down to 0.2%</a> last week.

Analysts expect the UK\u2019s consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for February, which is released on Tuesday, to fall from 0.3% in January, driven by lower energy and food prices. Some economists think the monthly update from the Office for National Statistics could already show deflation. According to analysts at the investment bank Credit Suisse, Tuesday\u2019s data is likely to show CPI at 0.1%, with energy prices falling 10% from February last year after cuts to gas prices took effect. Capital Economics thinks the rate will hit zero with Vicky Redwood, its chief UK economist, adding that the consultancy \u201cwould not rule out a negative reading\u201d. The inflation fall is likely to postpone further an increase in interest rates, which had been expected this year, with some in the Bank of England raising the possibility of a cut from the current historic low of 0.5%. Andrew Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, suggested last week that interest rates could be cut to zero in the coming months to head off the threat of deflation, saying that the monetary policy committee should worry that inflation had \u201cdropped like a stone\u201d. Haldane said the committee believed inflation would remain close to zero in the near term before rebounding in the next two years. He added: \u201cThe risks to inflation at that horizon are plainly two-sided. But my personal view is that these risks are skewed to the downside. In my view, that means policy needs to stand ready to move off either foot in the period ahead.\u201d While Haldane\u2019s words helped push the stock market to new highs, with the FTSE-100 index breaking the 7,000 barrier on Friday, his intervention was at odds with the recently expressed view of Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor. Carney had warned this month that it would be \u201cextremely foolish\u201d to cut interest rates. He told the House of Lords economic affairs committee that low oil prices would have an effect on the economy long before a cut in interest rates kicked in. \u201cThe impact of that extra stimulus ... would happen well after the oil price fall had moved through the economy and we would just add unnecessary volatility to inflation. That would be foolish,\u201d he said. The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed its annual inflation forecast for 2015 down to 0.2% last week. Inflation as measured on the alternative retail price index, which includes housing costs, turned negative for a period in 2009, but this would be the first spell of deflation under CPI for 50 years.",

      "bodyText": "Hartlepool has seen better days. Its port was used to transport coal from the Durham coalfields and manufacturing thrived on the Tees estuary. Heavy industry is still important, although there is less than there was. The council has ambitious plans for regeneration. On the waterfront, there is evidence of previous attempts to turn the town\u2019s fortunes around. The empty office blocks and the shuttered outlet centre show these have not been entirely successful. George Osborne made a great play of the success of the northern regions in last week\u2019s budget speech. The chancellor rejected the idea that Britain\u2019s recovery is only happening within the M25. He boasted how the government had been successful in getting \u201cthe whole of Britain back to work in a truly national recovery\u201d. In one respect, Osborne is right. The recovery is not only taking place in London and the south-east. But that has been true of every upswing from postwar recessions. Of more relevance is whether the big gap between Britain\u2019s north and south is widening or narrowing. The chancellor gave the impression in the budget that this divide is a thing of the past. As he well knows, nothing could be further than the truth. Representatives from Britain\u2019s older industrial areas met on Friday in Hartlepool where they were presented with a report that showed how uneven the upturn has been. Whose Recovery, a report from the Industrial Communities Alliance, does not deny that growth is returning to all regions. But it provides data to show that London and the south-east are pulling away from Britain\u2019s industrial heartlands \u2013 the 96 districts that make up the alliance. Almost all are north of a line drawn from the Wash to the Severn estuary, and they have a combined population of 18.6 million, slightly more than the 17.1 million in London and the south-east. The study shows that, in 2009-13, employment in the whole of Great Britain increased by 440,000 to 28,300,000. There was a net increase in employment of 540,000 in London and the south-east, but a 70,000 decrease in older industrial Britain. The latter number would have been larger had it not been for strong employment growth in Manchester (up 26,200) and Leeds (up 8,900). The ICA study notes: \u201cTo some extent, these two northern English cities, which have been the focus of special attention in the deputy prime minister\u2019s Northern Futures initiative and as the chancellor\u2019s \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019 are now pulling away from the rest of older industrial Britain in the same way that London is pulling away from the rest of the country.\u201d Osborne might say 2014 was a better year for the north. This, though, is not really supported by the data, at least for the parts of Britain with ingrained economic problems. The evidence comes from the government\u2019s Business Register and Employment Survey until 2013, supported by statistics where available from the official Labour Force Survey for 2014. Recovery in the northern regions is patchier and far less well entrenched than in London and the home counties. The rate of growth in private-sector employment in older industrial Britain between 2009 and 2013 was one tenth of the rate in London and the south-east. A higher proportion of the growth of employment in older industrial Britain is in part-time jobs: in London and the south-east for every part-time job created between 2009 and 2014, there were 16 full-time jobs. In the older industrial regions, the ratio was one to four. What\u2019s more, between 2010 and 2014, self-employment accounted for 40% of the overall increase in employment. Self-employment grew even faster in London and the south-east, but there is a difference. Vince Cable\u2019s business department says a higher proportion of self-employment in London and the south-east is in professional and high-skilled occupations while, in the rest of the country, it tends to be more prevalent among \u201celementary or low-skilled\u201d jobs. This may help explain why the out-of-work benefit rate has fallen more sharply in older industrial Britain (down 2.5 percentage points) than in London and the south-east (down 2.1 points). Tighter benefit rules mean people are officially self-employed but, in many cases, scratching a living. \u201cEven between 2013 and 2014, as economic growth quickened to a seven-year high and London\u2019s early lead might have been expected to narrow, the rate of employment growth in London and the south-east (2.8%) continued to outstrip employment growth in older industrial Britain,\u201d the report says. \u201cDuring the recession, there were assurances that \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019. In fact, this was never the case. What is clear from this report is that, as the UK has gradually returned to growth, we are not all together in the recovery either.\u201d It adds that a higher proportion of the growth needs to be directed where it is needed most. Osborne would say he is trying to do this by the creation of his northern powerhouse, harnessing the strength of Manchester and Leeds to ensure that prosperity is spread more evenly. The chancellor plans to spend more on infrastructure and is devolving control over public services (and the money that funds them) out of Whitehall. Undoubtedly, transport matters. One reason why the number of employees increased by 4,900 between 2009 and 2013 in Bolsover is that it is next to the M1 and was attractive for retailer Sports Direct. But the fact remains that per-capita spending on transport infrastructure is higher in London than in the northern regions, while overall capital spending has been cut as part of the government\u2019s austerity programme. Cutting journey times between Manchester and Leeds is unlikely to help a town like Hartlepool. So what would make a difference? Better road and rail links, clearly. An increase in research and development spending to at least the European average, with a focus on the industries of the future. Some tender loving care for manufacturing, which is still the lifeblood of old industrial Britain but which has not recovered the ground lost in the recession. The ICA has a number of useful suggestions, including using procurement as a development tool, making the most of European funding, beefing up the enterprise zone initiative, introducing a job creation programme and cutting unemployment and low pay rather than benefits. Terry O\u2019Neill, Labour leader of Warrington council and chairman of the ICA, says he would like full financial devolution, including control over welfare budgets. \u201cPeople in London don\u2019t understand what is going on. Our areas are lagging behind. Recovery is happening in spite of the government not because of it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was as the moon hit the sails of his yacht in the Atlantic Ocean that the thought struck Perry Carroll. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a sail and you have got some sun, you must be able to find a way to put those solar sails on that fabric,\u201d he said. Little over a decade later and that idea \u2013 which first hit Carroll during a 635\u2013mile race between Rhode Island and Bermuda \u2013 has developed into a business aiming to generate solar energy from awnings over car parks and on the tops of buildings where conventional rigid panels cannot go. Carroll\u2019s Cambridge-based Solar Cloth Company makes lightweight, flexible solar panels which can be rolled and fitted onto curved and flexible structures such as domes or coverings for agricultural land, as well as on the roofs of buildings unable to sustain the weight of glass panels. \u201cSolar is moving from being a hard, inflexible and one-colour product to being soft lightweight, flexible, and maybe even multicoloured,\u201d he said. \u201cIn solar everybody only knows those glass panels going on roofs and on farmland, fields, solar farms. Why can\u2019t solar be everywhere in all different types of aspects? Why can\u2019t it be so that when you pull your car into your driveway that there is a canopy that charges the thing?\u201d Carroll has been developing the panels since that lightbulb moment on the water, eventually bringing him to the bespoke products his company produces today. The company uses thin film photovoltaics (TFPV), which are viewed as the second generation of solar technology. TFPV is light enough to be placed on plastics and weighs substantially less than conventional glass panels. Carroll claims his panels are about 20% the weight of standard panels. There are drawbacks, however: they produce 15% less power than the current generation of panels and they cost twice as much. But the company hopes to open up new markets by emphasising the weight difference and the flexibility of the plastic roll, which open up new possibilities for siting solar cells. For instance, the cells can be bonded onto structural fabrics of buildings \u2013 which would make potential sites of the dome of the O2 arena in London or the Bird\u2019s Nest National Stadium in Beijing. \u201cI didn\u2019t invent solar, I didn\u2019t invent fabric but I found a way to put them together. That is what we are, we are integrators. We are the only people in the world who can successfully do that on a commercial level,\u201d said Carroll. The rolls of TFPV can be fitted on top of a building over a few days, allowing for millions of square metres of space on structures to be converted to solar, said Carroll. In the UK, factories account for 13% of the UK\u2019s energy consumption and most of them are potential sites for solar rolls, he said. The company also intends to concentrate on fitting the panels on awnings in car parks, where the energy can then be fed directly into an electric car parked underneath. \u201cThe government, the local authority, the general populace, the press, they all don\u2019t want us to build [solar] in our countryside \u2026 so we have to use areas that we have,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cWe have got millions and millions of car parking spaces in Great Britain. According to the DVLA [Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency], there are 30m cars on the road.\u201d Carroll believes those car parking spaces \u2013 outside shopping centres, office complexes and airports \u2013 are a massive potential market for his awnings. Outside the Cambridge offices of the Solar Cloth Company is a vision of what the firm wants the future of solar to look like \u2013 15 car parking spaces with canopies fitted with their solar panels. The power which is generated from the panels is fed into the adjoining building while there is also a plug to connect to an electric car. Each of the car parking space awnings cost \u00a312,500 to build, according to Carroll. Another Solar Cloth Company product is the \u201csolar sail\u201d \u2013 a conventional sail covered with cloth panels \u2013 aimed at getting rid of the need for diesel generators on board yachts and powering the signage on petrol station forecourts. When Carroll went to banks and angel investors looking for funding to advance into new markets, he was met with a blank wall, due to what he describes as a lack of enthusiasm for the the technology. The company turned to crowdfunding, which brought in over \u00a31m. So far the company has received \u00a3700,000 worth of orders for their products. The funding round gave the company a valuation of \u00a37.5m, with Carroll remaining as the majority shareholder. The Solar Cloth Company hopes the price of its products will fall as they become more popular \u2013 a general rule for any manufacturer \u2013 but it believes more money should be poured into researching solar energy. \u201cSolar in Great Britain and in general is the poor relation in R&amp;D. We have a video games industry in Great Britain which spends hundreds of millions of pounds on developing games,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cYou can\u2019t play a video game without power. If you haven\u2019t got any power, you can\u2019t do anything, so can we not get the power right? It is like choosing the curtains for the new house before you have built it or decided where you are going to put the plot. And that is the focus that we have got to change. People are quite happy to buy a TV for \u00a32,000 and change it in 10 minutes\u2019 time for another one because it has got a bendy screen. But they are not prepared to pay for guaranteed energy? It [solar] has got to stop being sold like a cheap commodity, it has got to be sold as a solution to what your lifestyle gives you.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was as the moon hit the sails of his yacht in the Atlantic Ocean that the thought struck Perry Carroll.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a sail and you have got some sun, you must be able to find a way to put those solar sails on that fabric,\u201d he said.<br>Little over a decade later and that idea \u2013 which first hit Carroll during a 635\u2013mile race between Rhode Island and Bermuda \u2013 has developed into a business aiming to generate solar energy from awnings over car parks and on the tops of buildings where conventional rigid panels cannot go.</p> <p>Carroll\u2019s Cambridge-based <a href=\"http://www.thesolarclothcompany.com/\">Solar Cloth Company</a> makes lightweight, flexible solar panels which can be rolled and fitted onto curved and flexible structures such as domes or coverings for agricultural land, as well as on the roofs of buildings unable to sustain the weight of glass panels.</p> <p>\u201cSolar is moving from being a hard, inflexible and one-colour product to being soft lightweight, flexible, and maybe even multicoloured,\u201d he said. \u201cIn solar everybody only knows those glass panels going on roofs and on farmland, fields, solar farms. Why can\u2019t solar be everywhere in all different types of aspects?</p> <p>Why can\u2019t it be so that when you pull your car into your driveway that there is a canopy that charges the thing?\u201d</p> <p>Carroll has been developing the panels since that lightbulb moment on the water, eventually bringing him to the bespoke products his company produces today. </p> <p>The company uses thin film photovoltaics (TFPV), which are viewed as the second generation of solar technology. TFPV is light enough to be placed on plastics and weighs substantially less than conventional glass panels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d63f7731d374292e6de6e1e6a77ccf6ae03414ba\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/22/1427026655398/11fb3f07-dfe7-4411-b281-59f636525b19-460x295.jpeg\" alt=\"Perry Carroll holding a sample of his innovative, flexible solar cloth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perry Carroll holding a sample of his innovative, flexible solar cloth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carroll claims his panels are about 20% the weight of standard panels. There are drawbacks, however: they produce 15% less power than the current generation of panels and they cost twice as much. But the company hopes to open up new markets by emphasising the weight difference and the flexibility of the plastic roll, which open up new possibilities for siting solar cells. For instance, the cells can be bonded onto structural fabrics of buildings \u2013 which would make potential sites of the dome of the O2 arena in London or the Bird\u2019s Nest National Stadium in Beijing.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invent solar, I didn\u2019t invent fabric but I found a way to put them together. That is what we are, we are integrators. We are the only people in the world who can successfully do that on a commercial level,\u201d said Carroll.</p> <p>The rolls of TFPV can be fitted on top of a building over a few days, allowing for millions of square metres of space on structures to be converted to solar, said Carroll. In the UK, factories account for 13% of the UK\u2019s energy consumption and most of them are potential sites for solar rolls, he said.<br></p> <p>The company also intends to concentrate on fitting the panels on awnings in car parks, where the energy can then be fed directly into an electric car parked underneath.</p> <p>\u201cThe government, the local authority, the general populace, the press, they all don\u2019t want us to build [solar] in our countryside \u2026 so we have to use areas that we have,\u201d said Carroll.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got millions and millions of car parking spaces in Great Britain. According to the DVLA [Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency], there are 30m cars on the road.\u201d Carroll believes those car parking spaces \u2013 outside shopping centres, office complexes and airports \u2013 are a massive potential market for his awnings.<br></p> <p>Outside the Cambridge offices of the Solar Cloth Company is a vision of what the firm wants the future of solar to look like \u2013 15 car parking spaces with canopies fitted with their solar panels. The power which is generated from the panels is fed into the adjoining building while there is also a plug to connect to an electric car. Each of the car parking space awnings cost \u00a312,500 to build, according to Carroll.<br> </p> <p>Another Solar Cloth Company product is the \u201csolar sail\u201d \u2013 a conventional sail covered with cloth panels \u2013 aimed at getting rid of the need for diesel generators on board yachts and powering the signage on petrol station forecourts.</p> <p>When Carroll went to banks and angel investors looking for funding to advance into new markets, he was met with a blank wall, due to what he describes as a lack of enthusiasm for the the technology. The company turned to crowdfunding, which brought in over \u00a31m.</p> <p><br>So far the company has received \u00a3700,000 worth of orders for their products. The funding round gave the company a valuation of \u00a37.5m, with Carroll remaining as the majority shareholder. The Solar Cloth Company hopes the price of its products will fall as they become more popular \u2013 a general rule for any manufacturer \u2013 but it believes more money should be poured into researching solar energy.</p> <p>\u201cSolar in Great Britain and in general is the poor relation in R&amp;D. We have a video games industry in Great Britain which spends hundreds of millions of pounds on developing games,\u201d said Carroll. </p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t play a video game without power. If you haven\u2019t got any power, you can\u2019t do anything, so can we not get the power right? It is like choosing the curtains for the new house before you have built it or decided where you are going to put the plot. And that is the focus that we have got to change. People are quite happy to buy a TV for \u00a32,000 and change it in 10 minutes\u2019 time for another one because it has got a bendy screen. But they are not prepared to pay for guaranteed energy? It [solar] has got to stop being sold like a cheap commodity, it has got to be sold as a solution to what your lifestyle gives you.\u201d<br></p>",

It was incredibly compelling viewing that left the viewer with a tricky dilemma: ie, choosing which face they wanted to take most blows. The Gervais v Bovey fight has also proved to be a good way for City observers to explain the kind of corporate battle that is short on heroes: hence the introductions to this week\u2019s matchup, where watchers are being asked to support either a group of MPs or, er, Mike Ashley and Sports Direct. So far both groups have received bloody noses. Ashley says he\u2019s too busy to appear in front of the Scottish affairs committee \u2013 which wants him to explain his group\u2019s treatment of staff at its USC business in Scotland and the retailer\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts \u2013 so he\u2019s sending his obedient chairman, Keith Hellawell, in his stead. The MPs have been provoked by that jab and retaliated by publishing their correspondence with the retailer \u2013 which counters that it might sue. All of which sets us up nicely for Westminster v Hellawell, albeit with a caution. In 2002, the BBC\u2019s John Pienaar and Spandau Ballet frontman Tony Hadley were due to fight after Gervais v Bovey, only for the series to be cancelled. Similarly, some MPs fear Hellawell might not now show. HSBC bosses come over all talkative Last week we reported that former HSBC boss Lord Green was to appear as part of the Cambridge Theological Federation\u2019s Lent lecture series (while fully expecting him to duck the event). He had previously kept schtum regarding all the fuss over HSBC encouraging tax dodgers under his command. But to his credit he showed up \u2013 and even talked of his \u201cdismay and deep regret\u201d about what happened. Hours later, in fresh extracts from his first public comments since the scandal broke, Green was again quoted talking about how he had \u201cplainly not\u201d been asleep at the wheel . Enough already? Well, another chance to hear from one of the venerable bank\u2019s leaders will present itself this week. HSBC\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, will be trotted out to give a speech on Tuesday, but despite the assured friendly audience (a financial services conference, rather than a love-in at the Daily Telegraph) the bank has still taken the precaution of sponsoring the event. Still, does the sudden loquaciousness of HSBC bosses suggest a new communicative approach and PR strategy? The world\u2019s vocal bank, as its ads (almost) used to say. Business as usual in Cambridge While HSBC continues to explain itself over how it assisted clients to become more and more tax efficient, the remainder of the industry is getting on with business as usual. This week will see the start of the Chartered Institute of Taxation\u2019s spring conference at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge. This college spans both sides of the river Cam with, perhaps fittingly, one section referred to as the \u201clight side\u201d as the other is colloquially known as the \u201cdark side\u201d. Expect a raucous time \u2013 as those crazy number-crunchers are booking in for a residential session over three days. If you fancy popping along, it will cost you \u00a3665 (a tax-deductible expense), albeit with \u201cen suite bathrooms allocated on a first-come, first-served basis\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Cheap petrol, falling food prices\u2026 What\u2019s not to like? Quite a lot, actually", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plunging global oil prices, and the resultant drop in inflation, have so far been experienced by British consumers as an unambiguous plus. Petrol is cheaper at the pump; food prices are falling; and real wages are finally on the rise. Official figures to be released on Tuesday will reveal whether inflation fell even further in February from January\u2019s 0.3%. If so, the news is likely to be cheered by George Osborne as another of the economic \u201cmilestones\u201d he has taken great pleasure in marking over recent weeks. But a thoughtful \u2013 and troubling \u2013 speech last week from the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, suggested we should think twice about welcoming a fresh drop in inflation too enthusiastically. In his final budget before the general election, the chancellor last week highlighted the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecasts suggesting that living standards will be higher by the end of this year than when the coalition came to power in 2010. Such an increase would be partly thanks to low inflation, but it also depends on the OBR\u2019s expectation that wages will rise at a healthy clip throughout this year \u2013 something the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is also relying on to bring inflation back towards its target of 2%. In Haldane\u2019s view, that may not happen any time soon. Month after month, quarter after quarter, since the immediate financial crisis came to an end, the MPC\u2019s forecasts have shown productivity recovering, wages picking up, and inflation bouncing back. That\u2019s what is meant to happen during a recovery, as unemployment falls. Yet as Haldane points out, there may be far more slack in today\u2019s labour market than the majority view on the MPC would have us believe. Plenty of part-time workers might be willing to do more hours, for example; a growing number of over-60s are looking for work to supplement paltry pensions; and migration from lower-wage countries may pick up as the economic outlook improves. In other words, today\u2019s labour market just doesn\u2019t follow the old-fashioned recipe in which falling unemployment rapidly feeds through, via wages, to inflation. Stir in weak global demand \u2013 one of the factors explaining low inflation, Haldane suggests \u2013 and a strengthening pound, which tends to bear down on prices in the short term, and we could be looking at a more prolonged period of low inflation than the MPC has acknowledged. And if that view becomes widely shared, it could feed back into wage-setting, creating the kind of deflationary spiral that alarms economists, because it can be very difficult for policymakers to break \u2013 particularly with interest rates already close to zero. The ever-optimistic MPC is expecting wage growth of 3.5% in 2015. Haldane\u2019s analysis suggests that target is likely to be missed. His view is glaringly different from that of his boss, Mark Carney, who recently suggested it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to react to a drop in inflation that he insisted resulted from a one-off shock to global oil prices. And who wins this particular intellectual spat matters not just for bragging rights in the Bank canteen, but for whether, and when, workers up and down Britain will finally feel they are reaping the benefits of recovery. Without the sustained improvement in living standards many forecasters are still banking on, the upturn itself may prove short-lived, as growth in consumer demand fizzles out. It would have seemed inconceivable even a few months ago, but interest rates may yet have to fall further, before they go up. And as Haldane pointed out, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time economists\u2019 expectations have been confounded. When rates were first cut to 0.5%, in March 2009, financial markets expected them to remain at that level for just nine months. Games of phones could cost consumers Sky picked a good day to bury the bad news of an early price rise for its pay-TV services. The announcement came on Wednesday, just as George Osborne was presenting his pre-election budget to the nation. For Sky\u2019s 11m customers, the costs are going up from June: subscribers will pay an extra \u00a31 a month for the sports bundle \u2013 having absorbed a \u00a32.50 rise last September. The variety pack will cost \u00a32 more, and the family bundle \u00a33 extra. With a gargantuan bill to pay for three new seasons of English Premier League football, Sky is digging behind the sofa cushions for all the loose change it can find. Analysts at Liberum say net new revenue from the price increases will be \u00a3240m a year, and every little helps when the Premier League will be costing more than \u00a3625m more per season from 2016. With the new season of Game of Thrones beginning in April, Sky customers will be reluctant to seek a better deal elsewhere. An added comfort for the Murdoch-owned satellite broadcaster is that prices are expected to rise across the fast-converging TV, broadband and mobile market. Two mega-mergers are on the menu: BT is buying mobile network EE, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hutchison Whampoa has snapped up O2 to combine it with its existing Three network. Consumer groups are warning that fewer competitors could mean the UK loses its position as one of the best-value places in Europe to get online or make a call. The surest sign that consolidation will lead to what analysts euphemistically call \u201cmarket repair\u201d is the 30% increase in BT\u2019s share price since its EE deal was announced in February. Investors are salivating. Unfortunately, sports channels are one area where more competition has yet to benefit consumers. Quite the opposite, in fact. BT\u2019s turf war with Sky is good news for players and agents, but the cost of following top-flight football on TV is rising nearly as fast as property prices in areas popular with its players. Spanish banking challenge So another Spanish bank has swept on to the UK high street. Not Santander\u2019s closest rival at home, BBVA, but Banco Sabadell, the Catalan bank that has agreed a \u00a31.7bn takeover of stock market minnow TSB. Josep \u201cPepe\u201d Oliu, the boss of Sabadell, admitted he had taken his lead from his larger Spanish rival after watching the success of Santander, which over the past 15 years or so has hoovered up Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley. Sabadell has great plans to turn TSB into a proper challenger and, potentially, to buy up bits of banks being sold off by the government. But as Santander has found, it will need patience and persistence. Even after all this time, Santander\u2019s market share is still small in the UK and it does no more than nip at the heels of the big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. The challenge for Sabadell will be even bigger.",
