      "bodyText": "European politicians and central bankers were at odds on Wednesday on the eve of a crucial meeting of eurozone policymakers that has encouraged speculation about \"unlimited firepower\" for bailout funds to resolve the crisis. While Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, spoke hopefully of the eurozone's bailout fund being granted a banking licence and access to endless funding from the European Central Bank, Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, strongly opposed radical action. The 23-strong governing council of the ECB will meet on Thursday in Frankfurt for the first time since the ECB chief, Mario Draghi, declared a no-holds-barred fight to save the euro last week in London. Draghi's pledge to \"do whatever it takes\" to save the currency and the confidence he voiced that \"it will be enough\" triggered a euro rally over the past week and curbed bond market pressure on Spain and Italy. Since then European leaders have lined up to make similar pledges using virtually identical language. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, Monti, and Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, the president of the eurogroup, have all parroted Draghi, encouraging belief in the markets that the ECB is about to revive a dormant policy of intervening to buy up the bonds of distressed sovereigns, cut interest rates again from an all-time low of 0.75%, or support a more activist role for the European Stability Mechanism, the main eurozone bailout fund. Draghi and the political leaders all also committed themselves to \"the integrity\" of the eurozone, suggesting a renewed resolve not to allow any of the 17 members, most particularly Greece, to leave the currency. The Austrian government and its central bank chief have been arguing for the past 10 days that the ESM should be granted a banking licence enabling it to tap unlimited liquidity from the ECB to prop up teetering eurozone governments. \"[Draghi's] statement last week was interesting, bold and appropriate,\" Monti said in Finland on the latest leg of his tour to persuade eurozone leaders to act to bring down the costs of Italian borrowing. \"I was in particular impressed by the clarity with which the president said excessive differences between interest rates undermine the transmission of monetary policy.\" This was seen as pressure on the ECB to revive a policy, frozen since last summer because of German resistance, of buying government bonds.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "He has but one vote among the 23 on the policy-making governing council at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. But Jens Weidmann knows that some votes are more equal than others. \"I certainly would not say that we are just one of 17 central banks [in the eurozone],\" the head of Germany's Bundesbank said in an interview published on Wednesday. \"We are the largest and most important central bank and we have a greater say than many other central banks in the Eurosystem. This means we have a different role.\" Indeed, Weidmann's self-proclaimed \"different role\" has become the main brake on ECB action - and a role that may be underlined on Thursday if Mario Draghi underwhelms in delivering on last week's pledge to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the single currency. Under Draghi \u2013 and his predecessor Jean-Claude Trichet \u2013 the ECB is widely seen as the key European institution that has kept the euro afloat, whose crisis management over two years has prevented a disastrous situation turning into full-blown catastrophe. It's the sole European institution to emerge with credit. But Weidmann and the \"Buba\" take a quite different view. The ECB's interventions in the bond markets, its flooding the markets with liquidity and cheap credit, its dilution of once-strict criteria for collateral requirements have appalled the guardians of German fiscal and monetary orthodoxy. It falls to Weidmann, a 44-year-old economist who was previously Chancellor Angela Merkel's economics adviser, to embody that culture of puritan rigour, even if it puts him increasingly on a collision course with an ECB that was modelled on the Buba, and also at odds with his old boss in Berlin and the redoubtable finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble. Weidmann studied economics in Bonn and Paris, specialising in monetarist theory, worked at the French and German central banks, and became Merkel's G8 and G20 summits sherpa before moving to head the Bundesbank last year. Since then he has become discreetly critical of the policies he used to shape for the chancellor. Top German monetarist minds have been among the biggest casualties of the crisis. Axel Weber, Weidmann's predecessor and the man Merkel wanted at the ECB instead of Draghi last November, resigned in protest at the ECB's prior bond-buying sprees, stemming from the big eruption of the crisis in May 2010 when the first Greek bailouts were agreed and Trichet unveiled the ECB's Securities Markets Programme to buy up Greek bonds. Juergen Stark, the German fiscal hawk who was the ECB's chief economist, also resigned out of principle, viewing the bond-buying as illegal financing eurozone governments, proscribed by the ECB's statutes. Draghi takes a much more flexible approach, declaring in London last week that if the spreads on Spanish or Italian bonds are so wide as to jeopardise the ECB's primary function of maintaining price stability, then he is fully entitled to act. Weidmann sees this as playing politics \u2013 unwarranted, dangerous, the slippery slope. Draghi's dramatic language last week, triggering a rally in the markets, was not cleared first with other eurozone central bankers and the Bundesbank weighed in 24 hours later with criticism. The Buba is totally against the current pressure for the ECB to become a Federal Reserve-style lender of last resort, which it would be if the main bailout fund, the ESM, is given a banking license \u2013 enabling it to tap unlimited funds from the ECB. Weidmann also opposes a revival of the ECB bond-buying through reviving the SMP\u2013 which all means that Draghi's hands may be tied. The ECB \"should be aware that [its] independence requires it to respect and not overstep its own mandate,\" Weidmann said in the interview. \"What is politically desirable and what is economically prudent have often not matched up. Policymakers overestimate the central bank's possibilities assuming that it can be used not only for price stability, but also for promoting growth, reducing unemployment and stabilising the banking system. This pattern occurs again and again. This time it is perhaps even more pronounced than in the past because there is increased doubt among the general public about policymakers' ability to act, and the central bank is seen as the sole institution that is capable of doing something.\" It's a restatement of the classical outlook of a German central banker, utterly at odds with that of France and elsewhere. Weidmann, from his studies, knows the French system intimately and is refreshingly frank about the fundamental Franco-German culture clash that has characterised euro policy since before its birth and is coming to a head again. \"Two very different world views were colliding. They have continued to do so in all political debates essentially, up to the present day.\" Weidmann is in a very strong position with regard to both Draghi and Merkel. Draghi could lead the ECB to a position of inordinate power, but that is unlikely if he forfeits the support of the Bundesbank. In Germany, the two most revered institutions are the Bundesbank and the constitutional court, both independent and now the most formidable obstacles to Merkel's freedom of manoeuvre in leading Europe out of its worst-ever crisis. Much will hinge on the boyish monetarist hawk who take a hard line on the F-word \u2013 flexibility.\"When monetary union was established, we agreed on a legal framework which has to be respected,\" he said. \"A single monetary policy ensures price stability and each member state is responsible for its own fiscal policy. This is precisely what is expressed in the no bailout clause.\"",

Draghi could lead the ECB to a position of inordinate power, but that is unlikely if he forfeits the support of the Bundesbank.</p> <p>In Germany, the two most revered institutions are the Bundesbank and the constitutional court, both independent and now the most formidable obstacles to Merkel's freedom of manoeuvre in leading Europe out of its worst-ever crisis.</p> <p>Much will hinge on the boyish monetarist hawk who take a hard line on the F-word \u2013 flexibility.\"When monetary union was established, we agreed on a legal framework which has to be respected,\" he said. \"A single monetary policy ensures price stability and each member state is responsible for its own fiscal policy. This is precisely what is expressed in the no bailout clause.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The formula is familiar but it works every time. Under-promising and over-delivering is the Next way and Lord Wolfson, its chief executive, has it down to a tee. Sales in the first half of the year were up 4.5%, against the company's guidance of 1% to 4%, and the range for full-year profits has been nudged up to \u00a3575m-\u00a3620m. The improvements are not large but, given the unpromising retail climate, were enough to push Next's shares up 6% to a new high of \u00a334.30. This may be the year Next overtakes Marks &amp; Spencer at the level of after-tax profits, having already passed the supposed high-street giant in terms of market capitalisation.

      "bodyText": "Investors who held in shares in Northern Rock before it was nationalised by Labour in February 2008 have reacted angrily to a long awaited decision by the European court of human rights to dismiss their argument that they should be granted compensation by the UK government. Dennis Grainger, a former Northern Rock employee who had bought shares through the bank's save-as-you-earn scheme, said 150,000 private shareholders were \"baffled, startled and angered\" by the decision, which comes as the fifth anniversary of the run on Northern Rock approaches. Grainger is the lead plaintiff for small shareholders who have been told by the European court of human rights that the case they brought \u2013 along with hedge funds SRM and RAB \u2013 was \"inadmissible\". \"We do think the coalition should look at this,\" said Grainger after the \"good\" part of Northern Rock was sold to Virgin Money at the start of the year. The judgment concludes that \"it was entirely legitimate for the state authorities to decide that, had the Northern Rock shareholders been permitted to benefit from the value which had been created and maintained only through the provision of state support, this would encourage the managers and shareholders of other banks to seek and rely on similar support, to the detriment of the United Kingdom economy\". The decision comes as many banks across the Europe face bailouts and after an announcement in March 2010 that the Northern Rock shares were worthless when they were bought by the government. Northern Rock shares were trading at 90p just before it was nationalised, some five months after the run on the Rock began in September 2007, when it had a stock market value of just under \u00a3400m. The accountancy firm BDO, after an 18-month study, concluded the shares were worthless while investors had argued the shares were worth between \u00a32 and \u00a34. SRM became the largest shareholder in Northern Rock after buying up shares between 14 September 2007 \u2013 when the run on the Rock began \u2013 and February 2008, just before it was nationalised. It ended up with an 11.5% stake. RAB accumulated an 8% stake over a similar timescale. Grainger said pensioners who had been relying on Northern Rock shares as their retirement nest egg had died while waiting for the judgment. The run on Northern Rock began when it emerged that the former building society had turned to the Bank of England for an emergency loan when the markets dried up in the credit crunch. By time it was nationalised it had received \u00a355bn of taxpayer guarantees.",

      "bodyText": "Fashion chain Next said the Olympics has hit trading in its London stores, as tourists and locals stay away, leaving the capital a ghost town. Next is the first of the retailers to give a sense of current trading and will compound fears that the Games will fail to drag the UK out of recession. Next's chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said its 23 shops in London had been \"adversely affected\" and he does not expect any kind of retail boost from the Olympics. \"The two weeks of the Games for retail won't be good. As with any sporting event, people tend to stay in and watch them on television rather than go out shopping.\" Next provided the formal wear for technical officials and athletes for the opening and closing ceremonies, but said the contract did not affect its performance in the first half of 2012. \"It's a nice thing to be able to do, but it hasn't had a great impact either way,\" said Wolfson. Instead, it was Next's barnstorming home-shopping business that helped to drive sales up 4.5% in the first half, beating the chain's own forecasts. Despite the bleak economic environment, Next upped its targets for the year, forecasting sales growth of between 2% and 4.5% this year, and pre-tax profits of \u00a3575m to \u00a3620m, compared with previous expectations of \u00a3560m to \u00a3610m. Next Directory sales shot up 13.3% in the six months to July, as customers increasingly shop for clothes online. Wolfson said the growth in home shopping was not a result of the rain-soaked summer, and that online sales went up and down in line with sales in the shops. \"The best weeks in the Directory were the warmest weeks in May. The main thing driving sales is whether people want summer clothing or not.\" Sales in the high street stores were roughly the same as in the first half last year, with a 0.2% increase. Like-for-like sales \u2013 which strip out any boost from new shops \u2013 dropped, but were offset by new store openings. Wolfson put that down to the \"general consumer environment\". \"Virtually every retailer in the country will be planning for negative like-for-likes at the moment,\" he said. He does not expect the economy to pick up in the second half of the year, but said it feels more resilient than was suggested by estimates that GDP fell by 0.7% in the second quarter would suggest. \"I don't believe the GDP numbers. We expect the economy to tread water for some time. The UK consumer has increased borrowing for about 15 years up until the credit crunch. The process of deleveraging [reducing debt] is going to be uncomfortable, but not a disaster.\" Eithne O'Leary of Oriel Securities said: \"Even relative to heightened expectations, this morning's trading statement from Next is good.\" She praised Next's consistency and said: \"Superior execution continues to distinguish Next Directory and the internet offering.\" The news sent Next shares up 6.46% on Wednesday to \u00a334.27.",

Next is the first of the retailers to give a sense of current trading and will compound <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/31/retail-trade-london-slump-olympics?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">fears that the Games will fail to drag the UK out of recession</a>.</p> <p>Next's chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said its 23 shops in London had been \"adversely affected\" and he does not expect any kind of retail boost from the Olympics. \"The two weeks of the Games for retail won't be good. As with any sporting event, people tend to stay in and watch them on television rather than go out shopping.\"</p> <p>Next provided the formal wear for technical officials and athletes for the opening and closing ceremonies, but said the contract did not affect its performance in the first half of 2012. \"It's a nice thing to be able to do, but it hasn't had a great impact either way,\" said Wolfson.</p> <p>Instead, it was Next's barnstorming home-shopping business that helped to drive sales up 4.5% in the first half, beating the chain's own forecasts. Despite the bleak economic environment, Next upped its targets for the year, forecasting sales growth of between 2% and 4.5% this year, and pre-tax profits of \u00a3575m to \u00a3620m, compared with previous expectations of \u00a3560m to \u00a3610m.</p> <p>Next Directory sales shot up 13.3% in the six months to July, as customers increasingly shop for clothes online. Wolfson said the growth in home shopping was not a result of the rain-soaked summer, and that online sales went up and down in line with sales in the shops. \"The best weeks in the Directory were the warmest weeks in May. The main thing driving sales is whether people want summer clothing or not.\"</p> <p>Sales in the high street stores were roughly the same as in the first half last year, with a 0.2% increase. Like-for-like sales \u2013 which strip out any boost from new shops \u2013 dropped, but were offset by new store openings. Wolfson put that down to the \"general consumer environment\". \"Virtually every retailer in the country will be planning for negative like-for-likes at the moment,\" he said.</p> <p>He does not expect the economy to pick up in the second half of the year, but said it feels more resilient than was suggested by estimates that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/25/shock-gdp-fall-deepens-double-dip-recession?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">GDP fell by 0.7% in the second quarter</a> would suggest.</p> <p>\"I don't believe the GDP numbers. We expect the economy to tread water for some time. The UK consumer has increased borrowing for about 15 years up until the credit crunch. The process of deleveraging [reducing debt] is going to be uncomfortable, but not a disaster.\"</p> <p>Eithne O'Leary of Oriel Securities said: \"Even relative to heightened expectations, this morning's trading statement from Next is good.\" She praised Next's consistency and said: \"Superior execution continues to distinguish Next Directory and the internet offering.\" The news sent Next shares up 6.46% on Wednesday to \u00a334.27.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that Britain could emerge from recession this year were dealt a blow by data showing that the manufacturing sector shrank at its fastest rate in more than three years last month. The dismal picture was repeated around the world. In the eurozone, export orders plunged despite the weaker euro, the Chinese manufacturing sector continued to deteriorate, and production growth slowed in the US. The news will ratchet up pressure on central banks across the globe for a co-ordinated effort to boost market liquidity and drive an economic recovery. This week the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will hold their monthly meetings to discuss rates and stimulus programmes, such as Britain's quantitative easing programme. Britain slumped into a double-dip recession at the start of the year and the Office for National Statistics estimates the economy shrank another 0.7% in the second quarter, driven by poor weather and an extra bank holiday over the jubilee weekend. Economists have been betting that the UK will bounce back in the third quarter, but Wednesday's Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) of 45.4 for July \u2013 well below expectations of 48.4 \u2013 suggests manufacturing will continue to drag on the economy. The PMI summarises the opinions of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector, who gauge future demand and adjust orders for materials accordingly. Wednesday's shock reading means orders for materials were dramatically lower, so the outlook for the economy is much worse than previously feared. Substantial falls in new orders, export orders and backlogs of work suggest the sector may contract even more in the coming months. Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said: \"The July purchasing managers' survey is massively disappointing and worrying, indicating that the manufacturing sector's problems are currently running deep. Life is clearly hugely challenging for manufacturers at the moment. Domestic demand for manufactured goods is handicapped by current muted investment intentions, still serious headwinds facing consumers and tightening public spending. Meanwhile, eurozone economic weakness, in particular, is limiting overall foreign demand for UK manufactured goods.\" Markit said the PMI figures would not yet show the impact of recent attempts by policymakers to boost the UK economy. It is hoped that the \u00a380bn Funding for Lending scheme, launched on Wednesday, and a further \u00a350bn of quantitative easing announced in July will increase the availability of credit for small businesses and drive output. In the eurozone, manufacturing activity sank to its lowest point in more than three years. Germany and France were the worst hit as their crisis-hit trading partners cut back on orders. Only Ireland bucked the trend, with output starting to increase again owing to rising exports. Economists said the eurozone was now stuck firmly in recession, with GDP likely to fall again in the third quarter. Archer said: \"The dismal July eurozone purchasing managers' manufacturing surveys piles yet more pressure on the ECB to come up with concrete measures at its policy meeting this Thursday to help ease the eurozone sovereign debt tensions, particularly the pressure on Spain.\" He expects the central bank to cut interest rates from their record low of 0.75% in September or October. The impact of the eurozone crisis was felt around the world. In the US, the manufacturing sector grew in July at its slowest pace in nearly three years. Chris Williamson, of Markit, warned the sector could contract in the third quarter if falling export orders and weaker domestic demand persist. In China, conditions improved marginally in July, nudging the PMI up from 48.2 to 49.3, but it remained below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. Qu Hongbin, economist at HSBC, said: \"This is far from inspiring, as China's growth slowdown has not been reversed meaningfully.\"",

      "bodyText": "After all the talk of wet weather dampening consumer spirits and central London becoming a ghost town thanks to the Olympics, the City had been expecting the worst from Next.
