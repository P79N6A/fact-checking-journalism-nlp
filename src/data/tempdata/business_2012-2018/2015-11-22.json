      "bodyText": "Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Allergan are reportedly on the verge of announcing the largest healthcare merger in history, in defiance of the US government\u2019s efforts to crack down on deals that it believes are thinly disguised forms of tax avoidance. The pending merger, reported on Friday by Reuters and confirmed on Sunday by the Wall Street Journal, could be announced as early as Monday. Forming a company worth more than $150bn, the deal would allow Pfizer to re-domicile from its headquarters in New York to Ireland, where Allergan is based in Dublin. With the move, the new company would cut its corporate tax range from 15% to 39% in the US to 12.5% in Ireland. The pending fusion of the companies would be the largest so-called \u201cinversion\u201d yet, whereby corporations on paper relocate their headquarters to more favorable tax environments by appearing to be bought by much smaller entities. It comes at precisely the moment the US treasury is attempting to block such deals. Treasury secretary Jack Lew said over the weekend: \u201cUS companies are currently taking advantage of an environment that allows them to move their tax residence overseas to avoid paying taxes in the US, without making significant changes in the nature of their overall operations.\u201d Ireland is a popular destination for such inversions, or \u201creverse mergers\u201d, because of its relatively low corporate tax structure. The Irish Times reported recently that so many such deals were happening that it was starting to distort the country\u2019s foreign investment figures. In fact, if the Pfizer-Allergan merger goes ahead, it would be the second inversion concerning the increasingly gargantuan pharmaceutical company in six months. In March, Allergan switched its headquarters from the US to Ireland in a reverse merger with the Irish drug maker Actavis. The inverse nature of the pending deal is illustrated by the fact that although on paper Allergan will be buying Pfizer, the current CEO of Pfizer, Ian Read, will head up the new merged entity, with the CEO of Allergan, Brent Saunders, acting as his deputy. Allergan is much the smaller of the two companies. The new drug powerhouse would have combined revenue of more than $60bn \u2013 more than any other global drug manufacturer in terms of sales. It would have a large range of prominent products in its stable, from Allergan\u2019s anti-ageing product Botox to Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor for lowering blood cholesterol. One of the big questions now hanging over the Pfizer-Allergan deal is whether the US government will have the muscle to influence it. The Treasury Department has been scrambling to introduce restrictions designed to prevent inversions, to allow the government to continue taxing US corporations even if, technically, their headquarters move abroad. But the Obama administration has made clear that a solution to the problem can only fully be secured through new legislation. With Congress controlled by Republicans as yet unable to agree on a way forward with Democrats, the massive proposed merger may well prove too powerful to resist.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs are to look into the sale of \u00a313bn of former Northern Rock mortgages to the US private equity group Cerberus Capital, to examine whether the deal was in the public interest. The Treasury select committee of MPs, led by Andrew Tyrie, has not decided whether to launch a formal inquiry but will take advice about the sale after hearing concerns. George Osborne said he had secured a good deal for the taxpayer when he announced that Cerberus Capital had agreed to pay \u00a3280m above face value for the loans, from UKAR, the government\u2019s holding company for former Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgage assets. Tax barrister Jolyon Maugham, who advised Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour party before the last election, argues that in the longer-term the UK taxpayer may lose out because of the way the deal was structured. \u201cIf you are chasing after short-term gains as a chancellor you might take one option, which is to sell the loans to the highest bidder,\u201d says Maugham. \u201cBut if you are acting as a long-term steward of the economy, you absolutely have regard for where tax revenues are going to come from in the future.\u201d The Treasury\u2019s initial announcement of the sale lists the purchaser of the mortgage assets as affiliates of Cerberus, a US private equity group. It has since emerged that the portfolio of mortgage and other loan assets (apart from \u00a33.3bn of assets which have already been sold to TSB) have been bought by Cerberus European Residential Holdings, a company based in the Netherlands. \u201cCerberus is a US-based company and the loan book comprises UK loans. What\u2019s the reason for this transaction to go to Holland?\u201d said Maugham. Maugham reckons that \u00a313bn worth of loans would bring in an annual revenue of up to \u00a3623m a year at an interest rate of 4.79%. If that income were subject to corporation tax of 20% it would imply UK corporation tax receipts of up to \u00a3125m, which he suggests are unlikely to be received if the revenues go to Holland instead. Cerberus, named after the mythical three-headed dog that guards Hades, declined to comment on why a Dutch entity had bought the mortgages or whether it would pay the same amount of UK tax as a UK-registered entity would have done. Online requests for information about Cerberus European Residential Holdings were met by a statement from the Dutch equivalent of Companies House: \u201cNo financial statements have been filed.\u201d A spokesman for Tyrie\u2019s parliamentary committee said: \u201cSeven years after the taxpayer bailed out Northern Rock, it is good news that the chancellor has managed to sell these assets, and at a price above their face value. \u201cThe Treasury committee will be looking closely at whether the best possible deal for the taxpayer has been obtained.\u201d The Netherlands\u2019 attractiveness to foreign businesses is well-known. Starbucks has signed a deal with Dutch tax officials that was recently deemed unlawful by the European commission. In a 2014 paper for clients, accountants PwC described the Dutch taxation system as containing \u201cmany incentives that stimulate entrepreneurship, foreign investment in the Netherlands and immigration of foreign employees\u201d. Cerberus, which manages $25bn (\u00a315.4bn) in assets globally, also uses 11 companies established in Ireland to buy heavily discounted property loans from European banks. In Ireland Cerberus paid just \u20ac10,320 in tax over two years, despite combined turnover for 2013 and 2014 of \u20ac224m, according to the Irish Times. The 2014 purchase by Cerberus of \u20ac1.6bn of Northern Ireland property assets from the National Asset Management Agency \u2013 Ireland\u2019s state-owned \u201cbad bank\u201d \u2013 has been the subject of a number of investigations, including by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency and the US Department of Justice, following claims that a Northern Irish politician was due to receive \u00a37m in payments. Cerberus declined to appear before the Northern Ireland Assembly\u2019s finance committee looking into the payments in September but sent a written submission saying: \u201cTo Cerberus\u2019 best knowledge, no improper or illegal payments have been made on its behalf in connection with the Project Eagle portfolio.\u201d George Kerevan, a Scottish Nationalist party MP on the UK\u2019s parliament\u2019s Treasury select committee, is concerned about the sheer scale of the Cerberus operation in Europe, where it has built up a massive portfolio of distressed assets across many territories. \u201cGiven what happened in the last bubble I think we need to keep a watching brief on these kind of investment patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the kind of thing the Treasury select committee needs to keep an eye on.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Seven years ago, Luciana Cunha paid her first visit to the fishing village of Reg\u00eancia, in the Brazilian state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, to surf the famous waves near the mouth of the Rio Doce. She fell in love twice \u2013 with the place and her husband, Fabio Gama \u2013 and together they set up an eco-tourism business, renting out kayaks by day and offering guided tours to the nesting sites of marine turtles at night. But after the brown tide of mud and iron-ore residue oozing down the Rio Doce from a mine 300 miles away reached the outskirts of Reg\u00eancia on its destructive journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the couple now wonder how they will cope. Bookings for what should be a busy summer season have shrunk to zero after the accident. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what life in the village will be like,\u201d Gama said. \u201cWhatever happens, the magic of the place is over.\u201d This weekend, 16 days after the collapse of the Fund\u00e3o dam supporting the reservoir of the Samarco mine, the waters in the delicate ecosystem of the Rio Doce estuary began to turn brown. A crowd gathered at the village\u2019s wooden dock to watch. Behind a tape cordon, a group of technicians from Samarco, \u2013 a joint venture of the Brazilian mining company Vale and the Ango-Australian firm BHP Billiton \u2013 sat under a marquee staring at monitors. To a small village with fewer than 2,000 residents, dependent on fishing, tourism and marine conservation, the arrival of the contaminated mud represents an existential threat. \u201cI have lived here all my life, and I never thought I would leave here,\u201d said Bruna Cordeiro de Santos, a 29-year old teaching assistant. \u201cNow I have started to think where are we going to go? What are we going to do?\u201d Local fishermen, contracted by Samarco to install protective barriers along a five-mile stretch of the riverbanks, lounged at the back of the crowd in distinctive bright orange jumpsuits. Approached by the Guardian, they said they were not allowed to talk to the press. Luciano Cabral, a biologist working for the municipal environmental department, said it was too early to tell if the fine mesh barriers, anchored to the riverbed and suspended by buoys, would work. But he was cautiously optimistic that the estuary would not be as badly affected as other parts of the river. \u201cWe believe that the mud is being diluted as it travels, and that the saltwater here will help in its dispersal,\u201d he said. On one of the sandbanks out to sea, three diggers were at work attempting to widen the mouth of the river. \u201cThe best thing that can happen now is for the mud to flow out to sea as quickly as possible,\u201d said Antonio de Padua Almeida, a biologist and head of the local Comboios nature reserve. \u201cThe mud will have much greater impact on the river than on the sea.\u201d According to the latest models used by the environmental agencies studying the flow, the mud plume is expected to disperse along the coast around six miles south of Reg\u00eancia, two miles north and 1.5 miles out to sea. The area is rich in marine life, including humpback whales and La Plata dolphins, but Almeida\u2019s greatest concern is for the endangered leatherback turtle. The beach is one of the only regular nesting grounds for the creature in Brazil. \u201cIf the mud ends up on the beach, this could have a devastating effect on the population,\u201d Almeida said. With the oxygen levels in the Rio Doce drastically reduced by 50m cubic metres of mining waste, the plant and animal life along the river has been devastated in what the environment minister, Izabella Teixeira, described as \u201cthe worst environmental disaster in Brazil\u2019s history\u201d. Fears over the presence of heavy metals and other toxins in the mud have also led ANA, the national water agency, to suspend the use of the Rio Doce for human consumption. Although the water supply from the river to the city of Governador Valadares has now been restored, around 150,000 people are still reliant on deliveries of drinking water from Samarco. Poor coordination with local authorities has hampered the company\u2019s efforts. Last week, desperate residents of the city of Colatina were filmed clambering over each other to seize bottles from a water truck. Eleven bodies have been found since the dam burst on 5 November, but only seven of them have been identified. Twelve people are still missing. On Thursday fire fighters in the state of Minas Gerais found a human arm 55 miles from the site of the dam, but as yet they have not even been able to determine whether it belonged to a man or woman. That same day, Samarco\u2019s director of infrastructure, Kleber Terra, admitted that two other damsforming part of the three-tiered complex with the Fund\u00e3o reservoir have also been damaged and are at risk of collapse. Emergency work to reinforce the structures will continue for the next 90 days. At BHP\u2019s annual meeting in Perth on Friday, members of Greenpeace Australia, Get Up! and the Mineral Policy Unit held a protest calling on the company to do more to help with the clean-up efforts. Andrew Mackenzie, BHP Billiton\u2019s chief executive, struggled to hold back tears as he talked about the \u201cheartbreaking\u201d scenes he had witnessed on his trip to Brazil following the tragedy. In Rio de Janeiro, the headquarters of Vale have had regular protests since the accident on 5 November. But the government has also come in from strong criticism for the laxity of the dams\u2019 inspection regime and Brazil\u2019s weak environmental legislation. So far, Samarco has agreed to pay R$1bn (US$270m) in clean-up costs and compensation, along with a further R$250m in fines. But critics argue this is nowhere near the cost of the damage. \u201cThe economic value of the fines that have been applied so far are comical,\u201d Mario Moscatelli, a Rio-based ecologist, said. \u201cThey merely provide an incentive for big companies to continue polluting Brazil because it\u2019s worth it.\u201d In Reg\u00eancia, however, the prevailing mood is one of uncertainty and anger. Carlos Sangalia, the vice-president of a committee which monitors the Rio Doce estuary, said \u201cThe economic life of the village depends on the river. That\u2019s now under threat.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Warren East, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, will herald a new era for the engineering company this week as he presents his plans for its future. Over 10 years, East transformed the microchip maker ARM Holdings into a vital supplier to Apple and arguably Britain\u2019s most successful technology firm. But revitalising Rolls-Royce is now the biggest challenge of his career. The maker of jet engines and parts for nuclear reactors enjoyed 20 years of unprecedented success under Sir Ralph Robins and Sir John Rose. It established itself as one of the premier engine makers in the world, alongside fierce rivals General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. However, Rolls has found life far more difficult since Rose retired in 2011, and when East speaks on Tuesday, he will do so with the engine maker in crisis. Not only has Rolls issued five profit warnings in the past 18 months and seen its share price fall by almost 40% in 2015, the firm is still under the shadow of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world. The pressure on Rolls has been cranked up by the activist investor ValueAct building up a 10% stake in the business and demanding change. ValueAct wants Rolls to sell off its marine business, which makes engines and nuclear reactors for ships, submarines and the offshore oil and gas industry, to focus on making engines for passenger jets built by Boeing and Airbus. The investor is also pressing for a seat on the board of directors. When ValueAct revealed it had bought a stake in Rolls in August, East wrote a letter to staff describing the investor as \u201copportunist\u201d. However, the company\u2019s tone has notably softened since then. East and ValueAct have spoken, while the California-based investor has also held talks with other major shareholders, who have been impressed by its ideas and knowledge about Rolls. Insiders now believe it is inevitable that a ValueAct representative will eventually make their way on to the Rolls board. The Rolls boss had already made it plain before ValueAct became involved that the company needs to change, warning earlier this month that costs were simply too high. However, it is understood that Tuesday\u2019s presentation will revolve around providing analysts and investors with more information about Rolls, rather than bold proclamations about breaking the business up and cutting jobs. East is likely to save announcements regarding asset sales and job losses for the full-year results in February. It is thought that East will not put any businesses up for sale or place a number on how many posts will go among Rolls\u2019 54,000 global workforce. However, in a clear indication that it could eventually sell off businesses and move away from a strategy of diversifying across sectors, East will pick out where the company is doing well and where it is weaker. The marine business, which is expected to lose money next year, is not likely to be identified as a strength. This analysis will not be a broad sweep of each division, but an in-depth look at everything Rolls does. East will provide the City with reams of information about how the company makes money, including a breakdown of its vital aftermarket agreements with commercial airlines. These lucrative deals involve the servicing of engines already in use and mean Rolls benefits financially from its engines even after they have been sold. The public analysis might not seem revolutionary, but it will be for Rolls. Even under Rose, analysts and shareholders castigated the company for the lack of transparency about its finances, particularly those aftermarket deals with airlines. Rolls has had terrible relations with the City for years, with Rose effectively turning his nose up at those in London who had little understanding for the extraordinary work his staff were doing at its factory in Derby. This lack of communication was accepted when Rolls was flying high, but when John Rishton replaced Rose and performance took a nosedive, enough was enough. The company hopes Tuesday\u2019s insights will allow analysts to better understand Rolls and make more accurate predictions about its financial performance, avoiding the need for the string of profit warnings it has put out in recent months. No matter what East says this week or in February, it is difficult for one man to change the course of the supertanker that is Rolls, which despite its problems, still has an order book worth \u00a376.5bn. Decisions made now may not have an effect for years. For example, one of the company\u2019s biggest problems is that it is not benefiting from the boom in single-aisled, narrow-bodied commercial aircraft, having decided in 2013 to focus on larger planes, such as the A380 superjumbo. That decision backfired, because demand for the A380 is disappointing, as airlines focus on building their fleets with smaller, more fuel-efficient planes. In addition, the SFO investigation still hangs over Rolls. This could have serious ramifications \u2013 not least a big fine \u2013 and Rolls has brought in the leading law firm Slaughter &amp; May to advise it. But analysts believe Rolls can fight back, and it at least has the right person in charge in East. Howard Wheeldon, an aerospace analyst who has followed the company for years, said: \u201cThe main problem is that while they have invested huge amounts of money to improve efficiency and make themselves more competitive, they have failed to make a significant enough dent in fixed costs. \u201cThat sadly means that when revenue slips a touch, profits take a dive. Added to this is the serious oil price-related impact on marine and that while new plants are brought on stream, there is some duplication until older, less-efficient plants can be closed. \u201cEast recognises the problems and also what needs to be done \u2013 significantly reducing the fixed cost base. He also recognises that you can\u2019t do all that is needed in one year. I am very confident that not only have they now got the right man for the job, but that given the space, he will succeed.\u201d Active investment? \u201cNobody does what we do,\u201d Jeff Ubben, founder and chief executive of San Francisco-based hedge fund ValueAct Capital told his alumni magazine \u2013 at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \u201cThere are very few people in the market who want to get all the information about an underperformer and make a fully informed decision on behalf of all shareholders. It\u2019s easier to sit behind a screen and generate reasonable returns without getting on a plane all the time to meet with directors.\u201d Ubben, who this week called for a seat on the board of Rolls-Royce after ValueAct increased its stake in the aircraft engine maker to 10%, says he tries to work with companies\u2019 management when the fund takes a stake rather than forcing changes like other well-known activist investors such Dan Loeb, Paul Singer or Bill Ackman. \u201cWhen we go on a board, it means we\u2019re basically locking ourselves up, we\u2019re getting married. We see a five-year opportunity to grow our capital 20%, and we think we can be partners with management,\u201d he told CNBC in a rare public interview in 2012. Ubben, who manages more than $19bn of behalf of founders and investors, says he invests for the long-term. The fund typically holds core investments in only 10-18 companies, and likes to be the biggest single shareholder to show that it is taking a significant risk on whether it can benefit from the longer term success of the company. \u201cWe don\u2019t come in guns blazing. We basically are rooting for the chief executive,\u201d Ubben said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s missing budgets for three or four quarters then we might lead a discussion more aggressively than otherwise would have occurred.\u201d Ubben says the fund\u2019s less dramatic approach has led to a representative of the firm gaining a seat on half its core investments over the years. Other shareholders, he says, like ValueAct\u2019s in-depth approach and it can lead to better performance from bosses. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m a little more accountable as a CEO to my board because I\u2019ve got somebody in the room that has a lot of money invested and has a different sense of urgency\u2019.\u201d In September, 21st Century Fox nominated Ubben to its board to reflect ValueAct\u2019s 5.9% stake, which it began to build up after the spin-off News Corp\u2019s newspaper business last year. Ubben is a fan of James Murdoch, who took over as Fox CEO this summer. He described Murdoch\u2019s \u201cfacility for technology that we have not witnessed among other industry leaders\u201d. The Murdochs repaid the compliment by inviting Ubben to meet India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi alongside some of the biggest players in US media industry in New York in September. However, while Ubben says he generally tries to work with chief executives, ValueAct was seen as a big player in forcing Steve Ballmer out of the door as Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2013.

The investor is also pressing for a seat on the board of directors.</p> <p>When ValueAct revealed it had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/new-rolls-royce-investors-claim-good-directors-should-challenge-forceful-ceo\">bought a stake in Rolls</a> in August, East wrote a letter to staff describing the investor as \u201copportunist\u201d.</p> <p>However, the company\u2019s tone has notably softened since then. East and ValueAct have spoken, while the California-based investor has also held talks with other major shareholders, who have been impressed by its ideas and knowledge about Rolls. Insiders now believe it is inevitable that a ValueAct representative will eventually make their way on to the Rolls board.</p> <p>The Rolls boss had already made it plain before ValueAct became involved that the company needs to change, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/rolls-royce-share-price-plunges-after-latest-profit-warning\">warning earlier this month</a> that costs were simply too high.</p> <p>However, it is understood that Tuesday\u2019s presentation will revolve around providing analysts and investors with more information about Rolls, rather than bold proclamations about breaking the business up and cutting jobs.</p> <p>East is likely to save announcements regarding asset sales and job losses for the full-year results in February.</p> <p>It is thought that East will not put any businesses up for sale or place a number on how many posts will go among Rolls\u2019 54,000 global workforce.</p> <p>However, in a clear indication that it could eventually sell off businesses and move away from a strategy of diversifying across sectors, East will pick out where the company is doing well and where it is weaker. The marine business, which is expected to lose money next year, is not likely to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/rolls-royce-makes-further-400-job-cuts-at-marine-operation\">identified as a strength</a>.</p> <p>This analysis will not be a broad sweep of each division, but an in-depth look at everything Rolls does.

Even under Rose, analysts and shareholders castigated the company for the lack of transparency about its finances, particularly those aftermarket deals with airlines. Rolls has had terrible relations with the City for years, with Rose effectively turning his nose up at those in London who had little understanding for the extraordinary work his staff were doing at its factory in Derby.</p> <p>This lack of communication was accepted when Rolls was flying high, but when John Rishton replaced Rose and performance took a nosedive, enough was enough.</p> <p>The company hopes Tuesday\u2019s insights will allow analysts to better understand Rolls and make more accurate predictions about its financial performance, avoiding the need for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/06/rolls-royce-profit-warning-warren-east\">string of profit warnings</a> it has put out in recent months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/15/bae-eurofighter-rolls-royce-aircraft-manufacturers\">We hoped for a march of the makers, but even BAE is failing to produce the goods</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No matter what East says this week or in February, it is difficult for one man to change the course of the supertanker that is Rolls, which despite its problems, still has an order book worth \u00a376.5bn.</p> <p>Decisions made now may not have an effect for years.

That decision backfired, because demand for the A380 is disappointing, as airlines focus on building their fleets with smaller, more fuel-efficient planes.</p> <p>In addition, the SFO investigation still hangs over Rolls. This could have serious ramifications \u2013 not least a big fine \u2013 and Rolls has brought in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/16/rolls-royce-calls-top-law-firm-slaughters-fraud-investigation\">leading law firm Slaughter &amp; May</a> to advise it.</p> <p>But analysts believe Rolls can fight back, and it at least has the right person in charge in East.</p> <p>Howard Wheeldon, an aerospace analyst who has followed the company for years, said: \u201cThe main problem is that while they have invested huge amounts of money to improve efficiency and make themselves more competitive, they have failed to make a significant enough dent in fixed costs.</p> <p>\u201cThat sadly means that when revenue slips a touch, profits take a dive. Added to this is the serious oil price-related impact on marine and that while new plants are brought on stream, there is some duplication until older, less-efficient plants can be closed.</p> <p>\u201cEast recognises the problems and also what needs to be done \u2013 significantly reducing the fixed cost base. He also recognises that you can\u2019t do all that is needed in one year.

It\u2019s easier to sit behind a screen and generate reasonable returns without getting on a plane all the time to meet with directors.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ubben, who this week called for a seat on the board of Rolls-Royce after ValueAct increased its stake in the aircraft engine maker to 10%, says he tries to work with companies\u2019 management when the fund takes a stake rather than forcing changes like other well-known activist investors such Dan Loeb, Paul Singer or Bill Ackman.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we go on a board, it means we\u2019re basically locking ourselves up, we\u2019re getting married. We see a five-year opportunity to grow our capital 20%, and we think we can be partners with management,\u201d he <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000087268\">told CNBC in a rare public interview in 2012</a>.</p> <p>Ubben, who manages more than $19bn of behalf of founders and investors, says he invests for the long-term.</p> <p>The fund typically holds core investments in only 10-18 companies, and likes to be the biggest single shareholder to show that it is taking a significant risk on whether it can benefit from the longer term success of the company.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t come in guns blazing. We basically are rooting for the chief executive,\u201d Ubben said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s missing budgets for three or four quarters then we might lead a discussion more aggressively than otherwise would have occurred.\u201d</p> <p>Ubben says the fund\u2019s less dramatic approach has led to a representative of the firm gaining a seat on half its core investments over the years. Other shareholders, he says, like ValueAct\u2019s in-depth approach and it can lead to better performance from bosses. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m a little more accountable as a CEO to my board because I\u2019ve got somebody in the room that has a lot of money invested and has a different sense of urgency\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In September, 21st Century Fox nominated Ubben to its board to reflect ValueAct\u2019s 5.9% stake, which it began to build up after the spin-off News Corp\u2019s newspaper business last year.</p> <p>Ubben is a fan of James Murdoch, who took over as Fox CEO this summer. He described Murdoch\u2019s \u201cfacility for technology that we have not witnessed among other industry leaders\u201d.</p> <p>The Murdochs repaid the compliment by inviting Ubben to meet India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi alongside some of the biggest players in US media industry in New York in September.</p> <p>However, while Ubben says he generally tries to work with chief executives, ValueAct was seen as a big player in forcing Steve Ballmer out of the door as Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2013.</p> <p><strong>Rupert Neate in New York</strong></p>",

Supermarkets are trying to change perceptions of the much-maligned vegetable with new red sprouts, alongside the traditional green, a guacamole-style sprout dip and sprouts shredded and shaved into coleslaw and salads, inspired by the chef Mark Hix. Extra sunshine in September last year helped produce larger sprouts, growers said. But this year, the warmth has been more consistent throughout the autumn and well into November. For much of the past four weeks, temperatures in the UK have been as high as 15C and the additional heat has boosted individual sprout growth. The current cold snap could slow further growth, but in an attempt to reduce food waste, the Co-operative has changed the specification for its sprouts to acknowledge the bigger size, so growers can utilise more of their crop. It is selling what Good Housekeeping has identified as the cheapest British supermarket sprouts at 49p for 450g. Tesco brussels sprout expert Rob Hooper said: \u201cThe larger size of sprouts will be good news for customers cooking the Christmas dinner this year, as it means the vegetables will be easier to peel, without losing their sweet flavour. Nobody likes the chore of peeling sprouts, but this year, because of their size, shoppers will need fewer of them on their Christmas dinner plates and that means less work in the kitchen.\u201d Jayne Dyas, the secretary of the Brassica Growers Association, said: \u201cOverall, it\u2019s been a bumper yield in the UK and, in counties where it has been consistently warm, we are seeing larger sprouts.\u201d Last year\u2019s annual yield of 70,000 tonnes, or 50m sprouts, could be surpassed thanks to the warmer weather, she added. Tesco\u2019s sprouts are grown by one of the UK\u2019s largest brassica suppliers, TH Clements, based in Benington, Lincolnshire. Commercial manager Richard Mowbray said: \u201cIn a normal year, average sprouts are about 30mm in diameter and weigh around 15g, and the ones we are harvesting already are absolute whoppers \u2013 over 50mm in diameter and weighing over 50g.\u201d As much as 80% of total British sprout sales take place in the two weeks before Christmas and into the new year. Clements said the cooler weather forecast for next week is welcome as it will slow the growth of sprouts and help some of the leaves drop from the stalks, making harvesting easier. Waitrose sprout buyer Patrick Keane said the supermarket was \u201ccurrently seeing bigger sprouts due to the unseasonably mild weather we\u2019ve experienced in the last month. When temperatures rise, so do the size of our sprouts, although it is difficult to predict whether this larger size will continue to Christmas\u201d. The so-called Christmas rush for sprouts has already begun at Waitrose, with sales of its most popular pack up by 20%. This year, it will be selling traditional sprouts alongside flower sprouts, green sprout stalks and a red sprout stalk, all grown in the UK. Marks &amp; Spencer said its sprouts were slightly bigger due to the mild autumn this year, but that with cold weather now forecast, growth should slow. M&amp;S has this year launched what it claims to be the world\u2019s first \u201cBrusselsmole\u201d, a twist on guacamole made with pureed sprouts instead of avocado and a splash of maple syrup. It has also created the brussels sprout banger, a British pork sausage made from smoked bacon and fresh brussels sprouts, and will be serving sprout salads on its deli counters.

    "webTitle": "Spending review 2015: time for George Osborne to face tough choices", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is a lucky man. In different circumstances, the headlines in the 10 days before his autumn statement on Wednesday would have been dominated by the mess the chancellor has made for himself over tax credits. Instead, attention has been on events in Paris rather than London, allowing the chancellor to consider his options. None of them looks particularly attractive, although those already writing Osborne\u2019s political obituary should be careful. Chancellors can always conjure up money from somewhere, and this chancellor has time on his side. All that said, Osborne is in a weaker position than he was in July when he announced the \u00a34.5bn cuts to tax credits. That decision always looked a bit curious given that the chancellor had spent the election campaign trumpeting how the Conservatives, rather than Labour, were now the party of working people. It was impossible to open a paper or turn on the news without seeing a picture of Osborne in a hi-vis jacket and a hard hat chatting away on construction sites and in distribution warehouses. These are the self-same people, those dubbed strivers by the chancellor, who will be hit by the removal of tax credits. The decision was doubly curious because Osborne did not need to make the cuts. The reason he is making them is so the Treasury can run a surplus of \u00a310bn by the end of the parliament. The rhetoric was all about mending the roof while the sun was shining: the real intention was to build up a warchest that could be raided for tax cuts and spending increases in advance of the 2020 election. One option for the chancellor on Wednesday would be to say that following a change of heart, he has scrapped the changes to tax credits altogether. Judging by his appearance on the Andrew Marr show, Osborne is not going down this route for a number of reasons. Firstly, the \u00a310bn surplus penciled in for 2019-20 is already likely to be revised down by the Office for Budget Responsibility as a result of borrowing being higher this year than was expected back in the summer. The chancellor will not want to see his warchest disappear altogether. Secondly, Osborne clearly has not given up on the idea that cuts in tax credits can be offset by increases in wages. This was how he justified the \u00a34.5bn cuts in July, and it was how he justified them again on Sunday. Finally, while there is a perfectly sound economic case for scrapping the cuts to tax credits, the U-turn would be a political disaster for Osborne and a gift to his potential leadership rivals. The chancellor is more worried about Boris Johnson and Theresa May than he is about Jeremy Corbyn. Another way out involves phasing in the tax credit cuts over a number of years or only making the changes applicable to new claimants. The former doesn\u2019t solve the problem, merely pushes it down the road closer to the next general election, thus running counter to the Westminster wisdom that says unpopular decisions should be implemented as early as possible in the parliament. The latter would avoid clobbering current claimants, but would be a strange move for a government that wants to get people off welfare. There would be no incentive to work harder in the hope of no longer having to rely on tax credits, because if a claimant needed to come back into the system at a later date, they would receive less generous support from the state. Tax credits cost the exchequer about \u00a330bn a year, a fraction of the overall \u00a3250bn welfare bill. So, wouldn\u2019t it be possible for the chancellor to find the \u00a34.5bn to protect the working poor from elsewhere in the welfare budget? Yes, if he is prepared to say that pensioners should share in the pain involved in deficit reduction. Yes, if he is willing to have another look at alternative sources of savings from the welfare bill that were rejected back in the summer. But Osborne has shown absolutely no desire to upset pensioners, a group that overwhelmingly supports the Conservatives, and there is no low-hanging fruit elsewhere in the welfare budget. Housing benefit costs \u00a325bn a year, and there has been some suggestion that the chancellor might make claimants pay 10% of their rents, saving \u00a32.5bn a year and affecting 4.8m households. The IPPR thinktank notes: \u201cWhile this might incentivise households to look for cheaper properties, for households living in the private rented sector, the average impact would be a loss of income of about \u00a3570 a year, and \u00a3460 per year for social housing tenants.\u201d In other words, Osborne would be solving one problem at the expense of creating another. The same applies to employment support allowance, the replacement for incapacity benefit, the bill for which is \u00a313bn a year. According to the IPPR, the chancellor could save \u00a31.4bn a year from the \u00a313bn ESA budget by cutting the entitlements of some claimants to the lower rate paid to jobseekers. But this would cost some of the seriously disabled people in Britain \u00a31,200 a year. OK, so Osborne doesn\u2019t want to borrow more, he doesn\u2019t want to phase the tax credit changes in or make them applicable only to new claimants, and the rest of the welfare budget is off limits. What\u2019s left? In theory, he could seek bigger savings from Whitehall departments, but this looks unlikely. Cuts in tax credits were designed to spare the courts, police, and education from even even deeper cuts than they were going to suffer anyway. It was striking that the announcements made on the Marr show \u2013 extra money for counter-terrorism and planes for the MoD \u2013 involved spending more, not less. Raising tax looks easier than deeper spending cuts. Higher fuel duty \u2013 particularly on diesel following the VW scandal \u2013 is one source of revenue; a sugar tax is another. If all else fails, there is always that old chestnut: a crackdown on tax avoidance. One thing is certain: Osborne will do his utmost to dress up defeat as victory. A way of doing this would be to offer some transitional relief for those on tax credits, while taking steps to boost their take-home pay. The national living wage and a higher income tax personal allowance are possibilities, but if Osborne really wants to help the working poor, he should be thinking about raising the starting point for paying national insurance contributions (currently \u00a38,000 a year) to the same level at which people start paying income tax (\u00a310,600 a year). He would need deep pockets to fund this change, since it would cost about \u00a36.5bn a year. Then again, he has dug himself quite a deep hole.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne is a lucky man. In different circumstances, the headlines in the 10 days before his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/autumn-statement-2015\">autumn statement on Wednesday</a> would have been dominated by the mess the chancellor has made for himself over tax credits.<br></p> <p>Instead, attention has been on events in Paris rather than London, allowing the chancellor to consider his options. None of them looks particularly attractive, although those already writing Osborne\u2019s political obituary should be careful. Chancellors can always conjure up money from somewhere, and this chancellor has time on his side. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/22/police-cuts-deal-made-despite-terror-threat-says-george-osborne\">Police cuts deal made despite terror threat, says George Osborne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All that said, Osborne is in a weaker position than he was in July when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-child-tax-credit-cuts-affect-women-worse-men-labour-yvette-cooper\">announced the \u00a34.5bn cuts to tax credits</a>. That decision always looked a bit curious given that the chancellor had spent the election campaign trumpeting how the Conservatives, rather than Labour, were now the party of working people. It was impossible to open a paper or turn on the news without seeing a picture of Osborne in a hi-vis jacket and a hard hat chatting away on construction sites and in distribution warehouses. These are the self-same people, those dubbed strivers by the chancellor, who will be hit by the removal of tax credits.</p> <p>The decision was doubly curious because Osborne did not need to make the cuts. The reason he is making them is so the Treasury can run a surplus of \u00a310bn by the end of the parliament. The rhetoric was all about mending the roof while the sun was shining: the real intention was to build up a warchest that could be raided for tax cuts and spending increases in advance of the 2020 election. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One option for the chancellor on Wednesday would be to say that following a change of heart, he has scrapped the changes to tax credits altogether. Judging by his appearance on the Andrew Marr show, Osborne is not going down this route for a number of reasons. Firstly, the \u00a310bn surplus penciled in for 2019-20 is already likely to be revised down by the Office for Budget Responsibility as a result of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/20/worst-uk-deficit-figures-six-years-george-osborne\">borrowing being higher this year</a> than was expected back in the summer. The chancellor will not want to see his warchest disappear altogether.</p> <p>Secondly, Osborne clearly has not given up on the idea that cuts in tax credits can be offset by increases in wages. This was how he justified the \u00a34.5bn cuts in July, and it was how he justified them again on Sunday.</p> <p>Finally, while there is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/11/tax-credit-cuts-george-osborne-poll-tax-gordon-brown\">perfectly sound economic case</a> for scrapping the cuts to tax credits, the U-turn would be a political disaster for Osborne and a gift to his potential leadership rivals. The chancellor is more worried about Boris Johnson and Theresa May than he is about Jeremy Corbyn.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Another way out involves phasing in the tax credit cuts over a number of years or only making the changes applicable to new claimants. The former doesn\u2019t solve the problem, merely pushes it down the road closer to the next general election, thus running counter to the Westminster wisdom that says unpopular decisions should be implemented as early as possible in the parliament.</p> <p>The latter would avoid clobbering current claimants, but would be a strange move for a government that wants to get people off welfare. There would be no incentive to work harder in the hope of no longer having to rely on tax credits, because if a claimant needed to come back into the system at a later date, they would receive less generous support from the state.</p> <p>Tax credits cost the exchequer about \u00a330bn a year, a fraction of the overall \u00a3250bn welfare bill. So, wouldn\u2019t it be possible for the chancellor to find the \u00a34.5bn to protect the working poor from elsewhere in the welfare budget? Yes, if he is prepared to say that pensioners should share in the pain involved in deficit reduction. Yes, if he is willing to have another look at alternative sources of savings from the welfare bill that were rejected back in the summer. But Osborne has shown absolutely <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/nov/01/the-big-issue-generation-gap-pensioners-young-people\">no desire to upset pensioners</a>, a group that overwhelmingly supports the Conservatives, and there is no low-hanging fruit elsewhere in the welfare budget.</p> <p>Housing benefit costs \u00a325bn a year, and there has been some suggestion that the chancellor might make claimants pay 10% of their rents, saving \u00a32.5bn a year and affecting 4.8m households. The IPPR thinktank notes: \u201cWhile this might incentivise households to look for cheaper properties, for households living in the private rented sector, the average impact would be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/18/george-osborne-housing-benefit-cuts-tax-credits-500-per-year\">loss of income of about \u00a3570 a year,</a> and \u00a3460 per year for social housing tenants.\u201d In other words, Osborne would be solving one problem at the expense of creating another.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/27/charities-urge-ministers-to-drop-planned-cuts-to-work-support-allowance\">same applies to employment support allowance</a>, the replacement for incapacity benefit, the bill for which is \u00a313bn a year. According to the IPPR, the chancellor could save \u00a31.4bn a year from the \u00a313bn ESA budget by cutting the entitlements of some claimants to the lower rate paid to jobseekers. But this would cost some of the seriously disabled people in Britain \u00a31,200 a year.</p> <p>OK, so Osborne doesn\u2019t want to borrow more, he doesn\u2019t want to phase the tax credit changes in or make them applicable only to new claimants, and the rest of the welfare budget is off limits. What\u2019s left? In theory, he could seek bigger savings from Whitehall departments, but this looks unlikely. Cuts in tax credits were designed to spare the courts, police, and education from even even deeper cuts than they were going to suffer anyway. It was striking that the announcements made on the Marr show \u2013 extra money for counter-terrorism and planes for the MoD \u2013 involved spending more, not less.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Raising tax looks easier than deeper spending cuts. Higher fuel duty \u2013 particularly on diesel following the VW scandal \u2013 is one source of revenue; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/nov/11/sugar-tax-facts-need-to-know-video\">a sugar tax is another</a>. If all else fails, there is always that old chestnut: a crackdown on tax avoidance.</p> <p>One thing is certain: Osborne will do his utmost to dress up defeat as victory. A way of doing this would be to offer some transitional relief for those on tax credits, while taking steps to boost their take-home pay. The national living wage and a higher income tax personal allowance are possibilities, but if Osborne really wants to help the working poor, he should be thinking about raising the starting point for paying national insurance contributions (currently \u00a38,000 a year) to the same level at which people start paying income tax (\u00a310,600 a year). He would need deep pockets to fund this change, since it would cost about \u00a36.5bn a year. Then again, he has dug himself quite a deep hole.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jim Slater, who has died aged 86, was so successful for a few years during the 1960s financial bubble that he was nicknamed \u201cthe Master\u201d by the financial press. His mastery lasted only as long as the bubble remained inflated, however, and his swiftly built reputation plummeted just as rapidly as it had grown. The man who came from nowhere to head a huge financial empire narrowly escaped incarceration in a Singapore jail and was found guilty of UK Companies Act offences. Slater rose to prominence as head of Slater Walker, a property, banking and investment group founded with Peter Walker, who went on to become a senior member of Conservative governments in the 1970s and 80s and was ennobled in 1992. Slater Walker was the arch-exponent in the 1960s of financially driven business deals. It spawned a network of satellites run by acolytes and associates, the most successful of whom was Lord (James) Hanson. But in 1974 the empire was brought down by the London property and \u201cfringe\u201d banking crash, which exposed the frailty of the wheeler-dealing at its heart. Slater arrived in the City through a passion for share dealing, which began as a hobby. Born in Heswall, Cheshire, he was the son of a suburban London builder, Hubert Slater, and his wife, Jessica. His father died while Jim was quite young, leading him to leave Preston Manor county school, Wembley, at 16 and train to be an accountant. When he moved into industry in the early 1950s he did well, thanks to his analytical skills and a flair for selling. He ended up in 1963 as deputy sales director at the Leyland Motor Corporation (which subsequently became part of British Leyland, and then the Rover Group) and was promised that he would make it to the top. But, in the meantime, he had discovered the joy \u2013 and profit \u2013 in share dealing, a hobby he developed while incapacitated with the debilitating effects of a virus. During his enforced idleness he analysed share movements and decided he could spot shares that were undervalued. Making some handsome profits from early dealings, he began to advise friends and colleagues as well, and then to write a share-tipping column, aptly named Capitalist, for the Sunday Telegraph. The lure of running one of Britain\u2019s most crisis-ridden manufacturers soon paled by contrast with a life of high finance. He met Peter Walker at a lunch for under-40s who were tipped for the top, and in 1964 he left industry behind to become a financier. Slater was later exposed as capitalising on his newspaper column by tipping shares he owned and selling them once their prices went up after his public recommendation. But at the time he seemed the very model of the meritocratic businessman, out to shake up the sleepy establishment. And that is precisely what he did through a series of takeovers, which saw his influence spread from industry to banking and insurance. He bought and sold companies the same way he bought and sold shares. He was not interested in the operations of the companies that ranged from Solicitors\u2019 Law Stationery to the talent agency Hemdale. He was interested only in the profit to be made from buying and selling the businesses and their assets. This was the period when the term \u201casset stripping\u201d was coined to describe his knack of buying an undervalued company and selling its properties or other assets at a huge profit. It was a practice frowned on in many circles, but it shot Slater Walker to the top echelons of the business world. He always insisted there was nothing wrong with asset stripping, because it resulted in assets being used more efficiently. In the six years from 1967, Slater roared through the financial world, building an empire that at its peak was worth more than \u00a3200m, and that stood alongside some of Britain\u2019s most eminent merchant banks. It was an empire built on the sand of share dealing, however, and when the stock market and property bubble burst, the empire was doomed. Slater had seen it coming, but having sold off his industrial business he was cruelly exposed because he had nothing of substance to fall back on. Attempts to merge with a series of companies, including the merchant banks Warburg and Hill Samuel, came to nothing. The calamity was made worse by the Singapore authorities\u2019 attempts to extradite him to face charges of financial irregularities. In 1975 the edifice crumbled amid the financial crisis that almost engulfed the City. Slater escaped extradition, though he was found guilty of minor Companies Act offences and went into a premature semi-retirement at the age of 47. He continued dealing in property and shares, with the aid of Lonrho\u2019s Tiny Rowland, another maverick businessman. This quickly reversed his status as a \u201cminus-millionaire\u201d \u2013 the term he coined to describe the extent of his debts. And he turned to writing. First came an autobiography, Return to Go (1977), in which he showed no remorse for losing a lot of people a lot of money and indulging in questionable business practices. He later said he was not particularly proud of Slater Walker, because it failed, but certainly not ashamed of it. Slater wrote a short series of children\u2019s books, but this was a temporary diversion from his first true love \u2013 share dealing, which he declared he would continue with until the day he died. \u201cIt happens to be what I do best,\u201d he said. The two strands of writing and investing came together in his book The Zulu Principle (1992), which explained his strategies to small-scale investors. He returned to newspaper share tipping, in the Independent, and he lent his name to a financial publisher\u2019s series of reference books on British companies. He continued to write a column in the Daily Telegraph; the last one, published a few days before his death, recommended books on investment. He also continued to invest in a variety of business ventures, as well as being an active stock market investor. But for the most part Slater stayed in the shadows, enjoying family life in Surrey \u2013 he married his former secretary, Helen Goodwyn, in 1965 and had two sons and two daughters \u2013 and a variety of pastimes such as salmon fishing, while always playing the stock market. He gave some of his wealth to boost chess and tennis, and backed the charity Birthright (now Wellbeing of Women). But, despite his skill at public relations during his Slater Walker days, he was never the celebrity type, and mostly shunned publicity except when it suited him. He is survived by Helen and his children. \u2022 James Derrick Slater, financier, born 13 March 1929; died 18 November 2015",

      "bodyText": "As colourful fish were swimming past him off the Greek coast, Cathal Redmond was convinced he had taken some great photos with his first underwater camera. But when he looked at the results on dry land, the images were brown and murky. Having taken the pictures while holding his breath underwater, he blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots. All he needed, the industrial designer thought, was a little more time to properly capture the fish in their natural environment. He vowed to make the little extra time needed a reality, and the result is his invention of the Express Dive \u2013 a refillable air storage device, held in the mouth, that lets users swim underwater for two minutes. It is aimed at bridging the gap between snorkelling, with its limited scope, and scuba diving, which gives divers the freedom to breath underwater but at the cost of using cumbersome and expensive gear. The prototype of the invention \u2013 which is still in the initial stages of testing individual parts \u2013 looks like a cross between a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle. \u201cI wanted to enable people to do more. So rather than just get in underwater [and] spend 30 seconds holding their breath, I wanted to do a little bit more than they were able to do,\u201d says Redmond, 27. Nine years ago, the Irish designer completed a scuba diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe fish in their natural environment. Less enjoyable, however, were the fins, the weight belt, the wetsuit, air tank, mask and all the other equipment. \u201cI was very keenly aware of the fact that I had about 50kg strapped to me and getting into the water was quite foreign when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface. It was a very surreal experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThe real problem is that it is very limiting as to what you can do. Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer, you have to plan your whole day around it. You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you \u2013 you can\u2019t be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in. \u201cPlanning is a very big part of it. It demands a lot. There is a lot of relearning required.\u201d It was during a final-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive. The device has two main parts. When above the surface, the unit uses a fan to suck in air via a vent in the mouthpiece. The air, accelerated around the motor-driven turbine, is compressed through a series of valves and stored in the attached tank, which has a display light that flashes green when it is full. When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off, and as the user dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece. That display, which is in the user\u2019s eyeline, then acts as a health bar turning from green to red when the air runs low. The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be refilled. \u201cWhen you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff, the batteries and the electronics and the membranes for the scuba delivery, the big trick was to be able to get it small enough so that it would be able to be held through the teeth and out of the mouth,\u201d Redmond says. The electrics are shielded from the water in the casing and are recharged using inductive power transfer \u2013 a system using an electromagnetic field, similar to the pads which can wirelessly charge mobile phones, so that there is no need for exposed wires. Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel. He likens it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater. \u201cIt is an extension of the body\u2019s capacity to store air,\u201d he says. The prototype, made from high-density foam, aluminium and silicone, has been tested in parts. Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes\u2019 worth of air into the unit, and that the design can be effectively held in the diver\u2019s mouth. What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, fully submerged for two minutes. But with enough testing, Redmond is confident he can get a fully functioning device that will not endanger swimmers underwater. Redmond recently came runner-up for the International James Dyson award, which will give him \u00a35,000 to further develop the project. Early indications are that the device would be priced at \u00a3280, he says, and it is likely to weigh anywhere from 1kg to 3kg (2.2-6.6lbs) depending on the safety features needed. To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a minor improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make all the difference underwater. The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says. \u201cTwo minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,\u201d he says. \u2022 You can read our archive of The Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "bodyText": "The British establishment, it is often said, is capable of decisive and clear-minded action only when it is confronted by a crisis. At other times, it prefers insularity, hates self-analysis and loathes outside criticism. This character trait was seen clearly during and after the great banking crisis of 2007-09. The disaster itself arrived with the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 but only became truly dangerous in October 2008 when HBOS and then Royal Bank of Scotland were on the brink of failure. Alistair Darling, the Labour chancellor at the time, opened his memoirs by recalling how Sir Tom McKillop, chairman of RBS, phoned on 11 October to say his bank would collapse within hours. \u201cWe had to make some enormous decisions,\u201d wrote Darling. \u201cHad we got them wrong, which could easily have happened, the results would have been catastrophic.\u201d Happily, the financial establishment rose to the occasion. HBOS and RBS were bailed out, albeit at a phenomenal cost to taxpayers of \u00a350bn, a broader support package for the UK banking sector was assembled, and by the spring of 2009 a sense of relative calm was restored. Deep recession followed, but life could have been worse: cash machines could have stopped issuing banknotes in October 2008. It was a close-run thing. After such a calamity, you would have assumed the authorities would want to know every detail of what went wrong, and let the electorate know. Not a bit of it. The instinct for self-protection reasserted itself immediately, which is one reason why the official report on the failure of HBOS was published only last week. The only body to kick against the system has been the Treasury select committee. Andrew Tyrie, its chairman in the last parliament and this, was entitled to blow a self-congratulatory trumpet after the HBOS report finally appeared. \u201cThe Treasury committee has been instrumental in ensuring that the public finally gets the explanation it deserves about the twin failures of RBS and HBOS,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was persistent pressure from the committee that ensured these failures weren\u2019t swept under the carpet.\u201d Absolutely. Indeed, Tyrie reminded us that the now-defunct Financial Services Authority\u2019s first attempt at explaining RBS had been a 298-word press release concluding that no further action was necessary. The ensuing uproar ensured that a full 450-page report followed in 2011. In the case of HBOS, the struggle has been harder. Tyrie and co appointed their own special advisers to oversee the report \u2013 to guard against the obvious danger when a regulator, to a degree, is asked to mark its own homework. Those advisers also demanded that the FSA\u2019s original enforcement investigation \u2013 the one that singled out Peter Cummings, HBOS\u2019s former head of corporate lending, for a \u00a3500,000 fine and a ban \u2013 be reviewed. The latter demand led to last week\u2019s important finding that the original FSA investigation was essentially worthless. Andrew Green QC called it \u201cmaterially flawed\u201d. Andy Hornby, HBOS\u2019s former chief executive, was not investigated even though the FSA itself had thought there were grounds for doing so. Records of FSA meetings weren\u2019t kept. Green found it impossible to establish which FSA officials had taken what decisions and on what evidence. In short, the regulator\u2019s response in 2009-10 was a shambles. A fresh investigation will now happen and the net will be cast more widely among HBOS\u2019s top brass, including chairman Lord Stevenson and former chief executives James Crosby and Hornby. Some argue that the passage of time makes the HBOS report, and the new investigation, irrelevant. Rubbish. The delay has been a disgrace but a failure to examine the evidence independently would have been much worse. Cummings\u2019s bosses would have escaped proper scrutiny and the FSA\u2019s shoddy investigation would have been kept from public view. A competent report in 2010 would have been better; that goes without saying. But transparency remains a good disinfectant, even when it is applied belatedly. Well played, Tyrie and co. Twitter must turn profit into reality Jack Dorsey, a key figure in the US tech industry as chief executive of both Twitter and Square, is leading a stampede of unicorns. The \u201cunicorns\u201d are startup tech companies with putative valuations of more than $1bn, so-called because they are so rare. Now Dorsey finds himself running two of them, as listed businesses. And he had better not fail because there is a veritable herd, also hoping for successful flotations, gathering behind him. After slashing its expected float price, shares in Dorsey\u2019s Square \u2013 a system that allows small businesses to take credit card payments via a reader plugged into a smartphone or tablet \u2013 got off to a good start at their New York Stock Exchange debut last week. So, job done for Dorsey? Not at all. He has to pilot Square, which is still losing money, towards break-even. Using a float to raise money for a lossmaking business to gain scale and profit is a well-worn tactic; just look at Amazon. But Dorsey is trying to do it with two companies at once. His bigger problem is Twitter, where user growth has stalled amid hefty losses \u2013 $208m in the past 12 months, on revenue just under $2bn. A recent round of firings in the engineering team has not instilled confidence. Wall Street is even gloomier: Twitter stock has slumped from its market debut of $40.50 two years ago to about $25. That performance is dangerous for the tech sector as a whole, because investors will blanch eventually if the most exalted brands are shown to be failed bets. Today there are 82 $1bn pre-IPO startups in the US and a total of 125 worldwide, according to analysis by the Wall Street Journal. If Dorsey can\u2019t turn Twitter around, it could crash. It has $1.9bn in cash, after debt, but that could begin to be burned away. Google and Facebook are pushing it aside in the online advertising stakes, and with investors still nervy about a tech crash, Dorsey runs the risk of being the man who soured the market for tech IPOs. Is Dorsey up to it? It\u2019s a tall order. Beware the unicorns\u2019 horns. Network Rail shambles will be shunted into sidings Few might look to the austere George Osborne seeking comfort or protection. But the assembled miscreants of the British railway investment fiasco may just find a safe spot in his shadow this week. Two reviews commissioned into quite how Network Rail\u2019s \u00a338.3bn programme of works went so swiftly and staggeringly wrong are expected to be slipped out around the autumn statement. The Hendy review may shelve yet more promised improvements for the creaking railways. And the Bowe report should point fingers at the circle of shame comprising Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail and Road \u2013 the watchdog that didn\u2019t bark, and the easiest target to kick. Ministers, of course, also promised railway goodies that no one could deliver, right up to the election. But the tax credit row means the chancellor will have even bigger pre-election mis-speakings to deal with \u2013 and rail\u2019s bunglers will thank George for that.",

Two reviews commissioned into quite how<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/network-rail-funding-gap-scuppers-five-year-investment-plan\" title=\"\"> Network Rail\u2019s \u00a338.3bn programme of works went so swiftly and staggeringly wrong </a>are expected to be slipped out around the autumn statement. The Hendy review may shelve yet more promised improvements for the creaking railways. And the Bowe report should point fingers at the circle of shame comprising Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail and Road \u2013 the watchdog that didn\u2019t bark, and the easiest target to&#xa0;kick.</p> <p>Ministers, of course, also promised railway goodies that no one could deliver, right up to the election. But the tax credit row means the chancellor will have even bigger pre-election mis-speakings to deal with \u2013 and rail\u2019s bunglers will thank George for that.</p>",

Not for the first time, I was struck by how obvious it seemed to her \u2013 not just that other children shouldn\u2019t have to go without, but that we have more than enough, and that that makes others\u2019 deprivation more shocking. No child should go cold and hungry at all, but in a society where plenty is the norm, it seems peculiarly senseless. It\u2019s a naive response, of course, but many theorists, not least the great philosopher of American liberalism, John Rawls, have believed that humans have, beneath the cynicism we accumulate with age and experience a deep, innate sense of justice, of what is \u201cfair\u201d. A central part of this is that no one should be allowed to fall too far behind. To a five-year-old, a society in which some kids have a wardrobe full of party dresses and others go without a coat fails the \u201cit\u2019s not fair!\u201d test. Measures of relative poverty are a statistical way of capturing that. The 2010 Child Poverty Act, which required the government to report on how many children live in households whose income is less than 60% of the median, was a way of enshrining in law the idea that society should hold out a helping hand to economic stragglers. Labour used tax credits and benefits to systematically pursue that aim, and child poverty on this measure fell from 26% in 1998 to 17% in 2013. But with \u00a312bn of welfare cuts in the pipeline, Tony Blair\u2019s target of eradicating child poverty \u2013 defined as cutting the number of children in relative poverty to 10%, and in absolute poverty to 5% \u2013 by 2020 looks hopelessly unattainable. Rather than face up to that, the Department of Work and Pensions is moving the goalposts \u2013 or, more accurately, playing a different game altogether. The welfare reform bill, now passing through the House of Lords, will see the scrapping of income-based measures, including relative child poverty, as a yardstick by which policy can be judged. Instead, the DWP will report on GCSE results and the number of children in workless families. These are important gauges of children\u2019s life chances, and point to the importance of doing more than just shovel benefits at the needy, but given the well-documented rise of in-work poverty, they don\u2019t tell the whole story. Like many statistical constructs, measures of relative poverty are imperfect, but many of the arguments made against them are misguided. Iain Duncan Smith says income-based poverty measures are crude, and direct policy towards achieving \u201cpoverty plus a pound\u201d \u2013 as if shifting a few quid a week into parents\u2019 pockets solves society\u2019s problems (though his fist-pump in parliament when George Osborne announced his \u201cnational living wage\u201d showed that he knows very well the importance of raising incomes). In Duncan Smith\u2019s world, social mobility is more important: it doesn\u2019t matter where you start from, as long as you can get up and out. But family income really matters: evidence shows, for example, that kids from the poorest families are more likely to struggle at school and to suffer health problems. The other charge made against the child poverty target is that it\u2019s a relative, not absolute measure \u2013 so, the lazy argument goes, the bar is always rising as society gets richer. Some of the assumptions underlying that idea are just wrong (not least because the act also made the government report progress against other measures, including absolute poverty). The median income \u2013 unlike the average, or mean \u2013 is not lifted by a sharp rise in earnings at the top of the pile, for example. Think about an economy with only three families in it, earning \u00a310k, \u00a320k and \u00a330k respectively. The median income is \u00a320k, and the family at the bottom is in relative poverty because their income is less than 60% of the median. Doubling the income of the richest household makes no difference to that \u2013 the middle is still the middle. But giving the poorest family an extra \u00a32k would shift them up to the poverty line. If you imagine Britain\u2019s 20 million or so households lined up poorest to richest, the median is probably as good a measure as any of what counts for the norm. Yes, the norm shifts over time, but so it should: our understanding of the necessities for a decent standard of living change with society. My grandparents grew up without a fridge; that doesn\u2019t mean I think any family should go without one in Britain in 2015. Dickensian squalor was so morally objectionable, as that great plucker of the heartstrings knew well, because it co-existed with the Victorian splendour that should have made decent standards of living affordable. Scrooge could so easily have made Tiny Tim\u2019s Christmas, but chose not to \u2013 at first. Research by Kitty Stewart at the London School of Economics shows that almost 90% of respondents to the government\u2019s consultation thought we should retain an income-based measure of poverty. It may be crude and imperfect, but it focuses minds; and the relative poverty measure enshrines the idea that no child should be left too far behind \u2013 and everyone should be able to afford a winter coat. Duncan Smith professes to care about the causes, not just the symptoms of poverty, but as the Child Poverty Act is systematically dismantled, it\u2019s increasingly hard to believe this government cares at all.",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers keen to grab a pre-Christmas bargain are being urged to show restraint during this week\u2019s controversial Black Friday shopping frenzy, following concerns over the number and severity of physical attacks on shop workers during last year\u2019s event. The leader of Usdaw, which represents shop and retail workers, has appealed to consumers to exercise calm after reports of \u201cworryingly high\u201d levels of violence and abuse in 2014. The union has welcomed recent announcements by some stores, including Asda and Tesco, that they will scale back their activities on Friday by restricting opening hours or increasing crowd control measures. But John Hannett, Usdaw\u2019s general secretary, said shopworkers still had real concerns that the chaos and violence that marred last year\u2019s events could happen again. \u201cThe last two years have seen unprecedented scenes of mayhem in some stores, as bargain hunting turns into a frenzy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been talking to retailers on behalf of our members, who have responded positively about organising their events to maximise safety and security for staff and customers alike. We also welcome the interest of the police, who have urged retailers to organise these sales events safely.\u201d Interim results of Usdaw\u2019s \u201cFreedom from Fear\u201d survey \u2013 due to be published in full later this week \u2013 sets out the ugly side of working in retail. The survey involved face-to-face interviews with 2,536 shop workers conducted by Usdaw representatives, who asked them to recount their experiences at work over the last 12 months. More than half had been victims of verbal abuse, while nearly a third had been threatened by customers. Nearly 10% had been victims of physical violence, although 22% of them did not report it to their employers. \u201cWe know from talking to our members that, in stores where there were Black Friday events last year, the number of incidents increased, not just in frequency but also in severity,\u201d said Hannett. Black Friday is an established American phenomenon. It takes place on the day after the Thanksgiving holiday and is now the biggest shopping day on the US retail calendar. It has taken place in the UK on a small scale for the last decade but only became big business last year when hundreds of high street stores joined online retailers for the first time to offer heavily discounted items. It caused mayhem in some stores as bargain hunters stormed supermarkets in the early hours of the morning. The worst scenes were in Greater Manchester, where at least three people were arrested as fighting broke out, but police were called to keep the peace at dozens of places throughout the country. Earlier this month, Asda \u2013 which is owned by US retail giant Walmart \u2013 announced it would scale back its involvement in this Friday\u2019s event, blaming \u201cshopper fatigue\u201d. Tesco has also changed its plans, announcing that all 250 of its larger Tesco Extra stores (which are open 24 hours a day) participating in Black Friday will open at 5am rather than midnight to \u201cgive staff the chance to prepare for shoppers\u2019 arrival\u201d. The industry is keen that the event does not go the way it has over the Atlantic. In the US, shoppers have increasingly turned to violence in their fight for the best bargains and a website set up to track the number of deaths at the event in recent years reveals a total of seven fatalities and 98 injuries. The site records details of accidents caused by stampeding shoppers in search of bargains, and stabbings and \u201cbrawls\u201d in parking lots. It also records two serious injuries from the UK in 2014 \u2013 \u201cwoman with broken wrist; head injury from fallen TV during \u2018scuffle\u2019\u201d. In the US, Walmart has attempted to impose crowd control by handing out wristbands for the most popular deals with limited stock. But despite last year\u2019s ugly scenes, UK retailers are predicted to ring up a total of \u00a31.6bn in online and in-store sales on the day this year, up 20% on 2014, according to retail analysts at Conlumino. Visa Europe predicts even higher spending of \u00a31.9bn, with face-to-face spending up 4% on 2014 and 20% on 2013. Some stores have sought to slow down the rush of shoppers by launching their discounted deals early. Amazon has already done this, for example, while on Friday Argos kicked off 12 days of deals across thousands of items including toys, televisions and health products.",
