      "bodyText": "The cost to taxpayers of the Australian government\u2019s six-year legal battle with the tobacco giant Philip Morris over plain packaging laws can finally be revealed, despite the government\u2019s efforts to keep the cost secret. The commonwealth government spent nearly $40m defending its world-first plain packaging laws against Philip Morris Asia, a tobacco multinational, according to freedom of information documents. Documents say the total figure is $38,984,942.97. That is the total legal amount invoiced to the Department of Health on behalf of the commonwealth by \u201cexternal service providers\u201d, related to the bilateral-investment treaty dispute between Australia and Philip Morris Asia for the financial year 2011-12 through to October 2016. The department said some of that amount may not relate solely to the Philip Morris Asia dispute, because some service providers have worked on that dispute and other tobacco plain packaging litigation matters, and invoices for their work have not been disaggregated. However, that figure has been provided as the \u201cgrand total\u201d amount after a two-year freedom of information battle by former senator Nick Xenophon and his former staffer, now Centre Alliance senator, Rex Patrick. Xenophon and Patrick lodged their freedom of information request in 2016 because they were concerned about the way in which Philip Morris had launched its legal case. Philip Morris had taken its case to the permanent court of arbitration in 2012, using a clause in a 1993 Hong Kong-Australia trade deal to sue the Australian government. It used a so-called investor-state dispute settlement clause (ISDS). Such clauses are also contained in the new TPP-11 trade deal, currently being examined by a Senate inquiry. The new TPP has specific provisions that prevent tobacco companies from suing Australia over its tobacco control laws. Philip Morris Asia lost its multi-year case, with the court ordering the tobacco giant to pay Australia\u2019s legal costs in 2017, but the commonwealth government has resisted freedom of information requests for the past two years to reveal the full legal costs. The government was ordered to disclose the information by the information commissioner this year. The Department of Health even lodged an appeal in the administrative appeals tribunal in March to prevent the disclosure. Patrick said he was blown away by the \u201cmammoth cost\u201d to taxpayers of the legal fight. \u201cThis is exactly why Australia must stop signing up to free trade agreements with these insidious ISDS provisions in them,\u201d he said. \u201cI accept the government had to defend the matter, but if we hadn\u2019t signed up to the Hong Kong agreement with ISDS provisions in it then there would not have been a tribunal hearing. Imagine what health outcomes could have been achieved with that $39m.\u201d Patrick said the ISDS provisions in the TPP-11 could expose taxpayers to tens of millions of dollars in legal fees and potentially billions in damages in the event that federal parliament makes changes to laws that don\u2019t suit foreign companies. He said release of the information was a win for transparency, but the information should have been released immediately upon request in 2016. Last week, the commonwealth government triumphed in another major trade dispute over its plain packaging laws, with World Trade Organisation judges rejecting a complaint brought by Cuba, Indonesia, Honduras and the Dominican Republic. The challenge to Australia was seen as a test case for public health legislation globally, and its win could lead to tighter marketing rules for unhealthy foods and alcohol as well as tobacco. Honduras has indicated it is likely to appeal, saying in a statement the ruling contained legal and factual errors and appeared not to be even-handed, objective or respectful of the complainants\u2019 rights.",

      "bodyText": "The music industry and YouTube are set to go head-to-head this week in a crucial vote in Brussels that could force the digital giant to pay billions of dollars in fees to popular artists such as Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Katy Perry. For years the music industry has argued that YouTube exploits the lack of legal protection around music videos being viewed on its service to pay minimal amounts to artists and labels. Artists and labels won a key Brussels vote last month on the adoption of new copyright laws \u2013 putting them on the verge of forcing a dramatic shift in the balance of power away from the Silicon Valley giant \u2013 but on Thursday the European parliament will decide the victor. YouTube got a bloody nose in last month\u2019s vote but its supporters are expected to gather the 76 MEPs needed to challenge that decision and force a vote by all 751 members of the parliament. \u201cI think if you could pop a \u2018provisional\u2019 bottle of champagne then yes, that is what I\u2019m doing,\u201d said Martin Mills, founder of Beggars Group, which has represented artists including Adele, Radiohead and the xx. \u201cLast month\u2019s vote was a fantastic result, but I\u2019m sure there will be some push back. YouTube is the biggest music service, full stop, by some margin and [has] been a severe imbalance in what artists receive. It is righting a wrong really.\u201d Warner Music\u2019s chief, Steve Cooper, said its deal with YouTube last year was not a \u201cfree market\u201d negotiation, and that the new European copyright law would force YouTube to the table. \u201cThe record industry has thoroughly negotiated deals with Spotify and Apple and so on but the problem with YouTube is that kind of discussion has not been possible,\u201d says Mills. \u201cFor me, it is less about how much more the superstars will make than the power it will give working musicians, day-to-day artists, to strike deals to enable them to survive and be the artisan they want to be.\u201d Taylor Swift has led the fight for artists to get a better share of revenues in the age of the digital music giants. In 2014, she pulled her music from Spotify, saying artists receive a tiny royalty per song play, and has been the catalyst for the much better deals struck by record labels with Spotify in the past 18 months. The outlier has remained YouTube, which has well over 1 billion users who regularly watch music videos. Its immense scale makes it not just financially important but critical in hit-making in the same way MTV was in the 1980s and 90s. \u201cDespacito would probably not have become the global phenomenon it did without YouTube,\u201d says Mark Mulligan, analyst at MIDiA Research. Last year, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee\u2019s reggaeton hit took the world by storm, becoming the most streamed song of all time. \u201cYouTube is the number one place where young people discover music. If you are going to create global hits you need YouTube and it is becoming more important to musicians.\u201d YouTube makes money from advertising and last year paid $856m (\u00a3650m) in royalties to music companies \u2013 an estimated 67 cents from each of its 1.3 billion music lovers annually. In the UK, record labels and artists earn more than double the royalties from the sale of 4.1m vinyl records than they did from the 25bn music videos watched on YouTube last year. Musician Billy Bragg says the battle against YouTube is less about the potential financial windfall that artists might get, and more about making sure the new digital music power players play fair. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen how, with the recent data protection legislation, the European Union has shifted power to the individual online,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re seeking to do the same for artists. All we\u2019re asking for is a level playing field \u2026 rebalancing the power between artists and the internet tech giants who are making massive profits while paying tiny royalties.\u201d YouTube has made moves to mollify the industry, launching a premium subscription service two days before last month\u2019s crucial European vote, a move Jean-Michel Jarre, electro pioneer and the president of music body Cisac, has cynically called \u201cindirect lobbying\u201d to try to improve its image.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The operators of the troubled Thameslink train line may be stripped of their franchise should a revised, emergency timetable fail to stem cancellations, according to a government source. Govia Thameslink Railway, which has been backed by the Department for Transport over years of severe disruption on Southern through staff shortages and strikes, could be given notice within weeks, after the chaos resulting from the timetable change in May. GTR will introduce a redrawn timetable from 15 July to tackle disruption which so far shows little sign of abating, with about 20,000 trains cancelled or severely delayed in the last six weeks. A government source told the Guardian that if the service continued to be chaotic it would be the final straw for GTR. \u201cIf that goes wrong, that will be the final straw for them. That surely has to be enough.\u201d However, an ongoing review by Whitehall officials would also need to show GTR had breached its contract for action to be taken. The DfT review may not be concluded before parliament goes into recess, which could defer any decision. Preparations for any operator of last resort to step in, as on East Coast after Stagecoach defaulted on its franchise, would also mean a transition of several months. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, and the rail minister, Jo Johnson, held separate meetings with GTR executives and MPs last week to discuss concerns. Although reliability on Northern trains has improved since a decision to cancel 6% of services in advance at the beginning of June, Thameslink trains have remained chaotic. Enhanced compensation schemes are set to be announced for Thameslink passengers, agreed by GTR weeks ago, although the detail has been kept within the DfT. Last week the government said affected Northern passengers around Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Cumbria would receive a month\u2019s free travel for the disruption there. A similar deal is expected for parts of the GTR franchise, although Southern services within the franchise have been running comparatively well since May. A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cGTR passengers are encountering unacceptable service levels and the transport secretary and rail minister have been clear it is their priority that this is put right as soon as possible and passengers are compensated for the disruption. \u201cWe will investigate whether GTR have breached their contracts and we won\u2019t hesitate to take tough action against them if they are found negligent.\u201d Unions dismissed government threats to finally axe GTR and suggested Grayling should examine his own position. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, said: \u201cGTR has \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 badly let down passengers and staff with its inept introduction of a new timetable on 20 May. But the DfT, too, was at fault for creating the GTR super-franchise in the first place. They have been working hand in glove and are both to blame.\u201d Labour said GTR should be permanently stripped of the franchise, and the network renationalised. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: \u201cPassengers have needlessly suffered years of delayed, cancelled and overcrowded services because of Tory failure and their refusal to strip incompetent train companies of their franchises, and services be brought permanently back into public ownership, not just as a temporary measure.\u201d The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said. \u201cTelling these basket-case companies that they are drinking in the last chance solution is empty rhetoric \u2026 Chris Grayling has personally propped up Britain\u2019s failing rail franchises while RMT members have been deployed at the sharp end as human shields to bear the brunt of the public anger, threats and abuse.\u201d Although Grayling has publicly singled out GTR for criticism, and the chief executive, Charles Horton, has already resigned, the firm believes blame should be more widely shared around the rail industry \u2013 and with the DfT. Factors such as delayed electrification in the north-west, which threw Northern\u2019s timetable into disarray, and delayed train deliveries in Scotland impacted services which interact with Thameslink\u2019s on main lines to London. An independent inquiry into the timetable fiasco, carried out by the Office of Rail and Road, is expected to report in September. A GTR spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are sorry for the disruption which the rail industry is working very hard to fix. We are re-planning how we use our trains and train crew to introduce a new interim timetable on Thameslink and Great Northern which will operate from 15 July. This prioritises peak-hours services and reduces service gaps. This is a key stage in our work to provide a more reliable service to passengers over the coming months.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The trade war is getting nastier. Phase one began when Donald Trump whacked duties on imported steel and aluminium, and announced $50bn (\u00a337.8bn) worth of tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing retaliated dollar for dollar, while the EU targeted Levi\u2019s jeans, bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Harley-Davidson responded by saying it would shift production of motorbikes for the EU market out of the US. A different president might have seen this as a warning of the collateral damage likely to be caused to the US economy from a trade war, but not this one. In phase two, Trump says he will target $200bn of Chinese goods and is threatening to put a 20% duty on automotive imports from Europe. Both will inevitably provoke tit-for-tat retaliation. The White House has already signalled what phase three of the programme will involve: new investment restrictions on Chinese firms in an attempt to stop intellectual property theft; and the US leaving the World Trade Organization on the grounds that the Geneva-based body was designed by the rest of the world to screw America. Until now, the muted financial market response to Trump\u2019s protectionism agenda has been explained by three beliefs: that he doesn\u2019t really mean what he says and is using tariffs as a negotiating tool; that even if he does mean it, cooler heads in Washington will prevail; and that sooner or later the deleterious results of the trade policy will become so obvious that the president will think again. Over the past few weeks, it has become harder to believe Trump is simply bluffing. Moreover, the group in Washington making the case for free trade appears to be dwindling in both numbers and influence. The people bending the president\u2019s ear on trade are quite as committed to an America first approach as he is. That suggests that the world will have to wait for Trump to look at the incoming economic data and realise trade wars are not as easy to win as he thinks. It could, though, be some time before the penny drops. Exports are booming and on some estimates will add a full percentage point to growth in the second quarter of 2018, a period when the US was expanding at an annual rate of around 4%. That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump\u2019s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America\u2019s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama\u2019s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire. Back in September 2009, when unemployment stood at 10% and the US was only just out of recession, Obama was persuaded to put tariffs on imported Chinese tyres. These were imposed over three years on a sliding scale: 55% in year one, 45% in year two and 35% in year three. In 2012, Obama used his state of the union address to boast that the tariffs had stopped the surge in Chinese tyre imports and safeguarded 1,000 jobs. Research by the Petersen Institute, a leading Washington thinktank, found that Obama\u2019s boast was only partly true. Using what it called \u201cvery generous assumptions\u201d, Petersen said Obama\u2019s intervention saved a maximum of 1,200 jobs. But US buyers of cars and light trucks paid higher prices for their tyres, which meant they had less to spend on other things. The total cost to US consumers was around $1.1bn in 2011, which meant the cost of saving a US tyre manufacturing job was at least $900,000 in that year. What\u2019s more, the blow to consumer spending power meant the loss of 3,731 jobs in the retail sector, leaving a net loss of about 2,500 jobs. That experience helps explain why the Chinese tyre tariffs were allowed to expire in 2012. It is also why economists think the current protectionist measures will have a similar \u2013 only more pronounced \u2013 effect. Gregory Daco, head of US economics for the consultancy firm Oxford Economics, says that if Trump goes ahead with his 20% tariff on EU automotive imports it would reduce US growth by 0.1% in 2019 and 0.2% in 2020, and lead to net job losses of 100,000. \u201cImportantly, given the large supply side chain multipliers in the automotive sector, and the knock-on effects from increased business uncertainty, the total shock to the economy could be twice as large,\u201d Daco adds. The EU and China will also be hurt. Given their reliance on exports, they may suffer even more than the US does. That, though, is likely to push up the value of the dollar on the world\u2019s currency markets, which will make US exports more expensive. But for a while, the US economy is in a sweet spot. Rising interest rates have yet to bite, tax cuts are boosting spending power and inflation is bang on target. It will be at least a year, perhaps a bit longer, before the world\u2019s biggest economy slows significantly and Trump can do a lot of damage in that time. No question, the deranged threat to quit the WTO would herald a return to the 1930s. There is a final line of defence. Trump would be forced to think again if financial markets stopped being so relaxed about his trade agenda. But Wall Street needs to wake up \u2013 and soon.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco founder Jack Cohen famously said the secret of success was \u201cpile \u2018em high and sell \u2018em cheap\u201d. And despite many retailers on the high street struggling to make ends meet \u2013 Marks &amp; Spencer shutting stores, House of Fraser striking last-ditch deals with its landlords, Debenhams issuing a profit warning \u2013 it seems to be a formula that still works even in a tough environment. The proof is there at Primark, which has taken Cohen\u2019s philosophy to heart, and has attracted consumers into its stores with its cut-price fashion and makeup. The latest bargain spotted by aficionados is a \u00a32 lipstick that bears comparison with a rival product costing \u00a317.50. As other retailers mothball sites, Primark continues to successfully open new outlets: last month, there were reportedly 100 people queuing outside its Westfield store in west London on its first day well before the doors opened. Earlier this year, at its half-year presentation, John Bason, the finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods, said: \u201cThe UK high street is not remotely dead.\u201d Not for Primark, anyway. According to GlobalData, it now has around 7% of the British clothing sector, narrowly behind the 7.5% achieved by Marks &amp; Spencer (as a sign of the changing times, M&amp;S had 13.5% in 1997). On Thursday ABF delivers its latest update, and although analysts anticipate a fairly downbeat start to the spring/summer season, the addition of new stores could see third-quarter sales jump sharply. Jefferies said: \u201cWe estimate total Primark [third-quarter] sales growth of 8% as new space productivity remains very strong, the clearest possible indication of the strong expansion opportunity still available to the format globally.\u201d However, the business has had to tweak its format for the US,shrinking its store in Freehold, New Jersey, for instance. An analyst visit suggested the change could be successful.

      "bodyText": "BMW is unlikely to shut its Mini factory in Oxford next year no matter how disastrously the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations conclude. Likewise, Nissan owner Renault won\u2019t walk away from its base in the north-east \u2013 where it has built Britain\u2019s single largest car factory \u2013 the day after the UK leaves the EU, even if departure means losing access to the frictionless trade area, otherwise known as the customs union and single market. Both car companies have invested too much in these shores to close down or even mothball the UK offshoots of their sprawling empires. Airbus, which complained vociferously the other week about the potentially disastrous consequences for its British factories of a hard Brexit, is similarly over-committed. The question is, will these firms still be researching and developing their products in the UK and employing tens of thousands of people to manufacture them in five or 10 years\u2019 time? Sadly, the betting must be that these foreign-owned businesses, which have little allegiance to Britain, will have demoted the angry island in their global supply chain by the time a transition period is exhausted in 2020. Investments in new models will go to continental firms instead. If we focus on the car industry for a moment, it is clear that the Germans, the French, the Japanese and to a lesser extent the Indians and Chinese are the driving force of manufacturing in Europe. They are the owners and the decison-makers. Countries like Britain, Italy, Slovakia and Turkey have become their parts suppliers and sometimes where the final assembly takes place. It has served the political purposes of Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan, Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover and BMW to spread the load of manufacturing around Europe. It pleases governments and some consumers to know their cars are made locally. The outer limit for any location is the customs union border. There is little incentive to develop or manufacture new models in countries that lie outside. Tariffs applied by the EU are one obvious issue. More important are the non-tariff barriers that present outsiders with even more costly hurdles. Winding down their UK operations is not the central plan. Mainly because Britain has built up a skilled and flexible workforce, top universities happy to link up with industry and and strong history of engineering and design. That\u2019s why major manufacturing firms are lobbying so hard to keep Britain on the inside. They want to minimise the level of aggravation in their supply chains while the industry goes through a major overhaul, possibly the biggest in its history. It\u2019s easy to forget that car companies, which employ almost 1 million people in the UK directly and indirectly, must convert everything they do in the next few years to accommodate the switch to electric and hybrid cars. Jaguar Land Rover is tied to the diesel combustion engine in the same way Donald Trump is tied to Twitter \u2013 umbilically. The company is developing its first electric car in Austria with a Canadian partner. Will it re-tool Wolverhampton\u2019s vast diesel factory to make an electric car? With the industry suffering from an over-supply of vehicles in a period when global growth is slowing, the answer might be no. Iain Duncan Smith has railed against business leaders as venal and wrong in the Daily Mail for misunderstanding the benefits of Brexit, while Boris Johnson has used expletives to illustrate their irrelevance to his EU exit plans. Yet both have a vision of a brighter future that involves all the UK\u2019s highly integrated cross-border industries surviving intact. It doesn\u2019t add up. Worse, it\u2019s like playing roulette and thinking you can control the spinning ball. Britain has long since handed over control of its most important manufacturing industries to foreign owners. Calling their bluff is a high-risk strategy that only wealthy Brexit campaigners, shouting their nationalistic slogans, can afford to pursue. Car workers should be worried. Uber hasn\u2019t got one over on Transport for London It is a measure, perhaps, of Britain\u2019s lowered sense of its standing in the world that when London last year moved to block the ambitions of a multinational firm, it found itself cast as the mouse that roared. Or at least, when the capital refused to renew Uber\u2019s operating licence, it was the dinosaur standing in the way of progress. The eventual award of a 15-month licence to Uber last week may have confirmed for cynics that the city\u2019s transport department was always going to bow before the beasts of Silicon Valley and investors\u2019 billions. As any London black-cab driver will ruefully note, Uber\u2019s ability to fund a prolonged appeal meant its drivers never had to pause from working, and perhaps never will. Uber has without doubt already reshaped transport habits, for good or ill, undercutting taxis and giving millennials a more affordable alternative, while contributing to a drop in public transport usage that has alarmed City Hall and could threaten services. Yet it has also popularised notions of car-pooling, and pushed others to raise their game \u2013 from local minicab firms now pinpointing arrival times, to big transport companies putting similar technology to good use with on-demand buses. Such innovation was what made Transport for London welcome Uber initially, before deciding it was not a fit and proper licensee. But Uber has started to make amends, and remains on probation. Unions will justly fight for more rights for drivers, which Uber continues to resist. But it would be wrong to see this licence award as any kind of defeat for London\u2019s authorities. At a time when it can feel that too few are ever held to account, unheralded public employees have upheld norms and regulations from which Uber thought it could exempt itself. They have shone a light on the actions of a global tech firm, and helped effect change. Far may it ripple out. Pass on the claret? That\u2019s what wine buyers are doing Sales are plummeting, customers are deserting, stock lies unsold. No, this is not another dispatch from Britain\u2019s high streets but from the rather more refined banks of the Gironde \u2013 as the trade in en primeur Bordeaux wines nose-dives. According to a report last week from wine data firm Liv-ex, sales of newly produced bordeaux wines have halved this year to \u00a345m. Fine wine merchant Berry Bros &amp; Rudd told Drinks Business magazine that its sales will be worth around \u00a313m-\u00a314m, half last year\u2019s level, with volumes even lower. The en primeur system is essentially a futures market in which collectors can buy Bordeaux\u2019s finest wines up to a year before they are bottled and an official vintage released. About a third of the global trade usually goes through London. But in a Brexit-style standoff, the dealers in Bordeaux are demanding terms London will not accept. The 2017 vintage is, say experts, not bad considering the devastating frosts, but not up to the quality of 2015 and 2016. Yet the chateaux, through their negociants, have been unwilling to cut prices to match. The result? The worst en primeur market for years. The peak years of 2009 and 2010 saw unparalleled prices achieved as excellent vintages coincided with voracious demand from Chinese buyers. It helped turned vineyards such as Ch\u00e2teau Margaux into billion-dollar businesses. But those Chinese buyers who paid top dollar nearly a decade ago have seen little or no return on their investment. So the Asian buying frenzy has subsided, with the trade tilting back to the UK and US. In the decade to 2017, wine investors averaged gains of 200%, with some labels, such as Ch\u00e2teau Lafitte, making far more. Wines from Bordeaux still make up nearly 70% of the wine investment market. But the trouble with Bordeaux is that while buyers love it, they don\u2019t love it at these prices. Investors are now looking further afield. The next wine billionaire is more likely to emerge in Burgundy than Bordeaux.",
