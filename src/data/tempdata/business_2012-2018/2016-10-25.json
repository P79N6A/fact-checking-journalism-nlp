      "bodyText": "The authors of a new report forecasting that it could take 170 years to eradicate the disparity in pay and employment opportunities for men and women have called for urgent action to close the gender equality gap. The report by the World Economic Forum \u2013 best known for its high-profile gathering each year in Davos, Switzerland \u2013 found that economic disparity between women and men around the world was rising even though the gap was closing on other measures, such as education. When measured in terms of income and employment, the gender gap has widened in the past four years; at 59%, it is now at a similar level to that seen in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. Last year, the WEF predicted it would take 118 years for economic parity to be achieved. This year, the Geneva-based institution has calculated the gap would take until 2186 \u2013 170 years \u2013 to close. Now in its 11th year, the report measures the relative discrepancies between women and men across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics. The report says: \u201cMore than a decade of data has revealed that progress is still too slow for realising the full potential of one half of humanity within our lifetimes.\u201d The authors, Richard Samans and Saadia Zahidi, said they hoped the report \u201cwill serve as a call to action for governments to accelerate gender equality through bolder policymaking, to business to prioritise gender equality as a critical talent and moral imperative, and to all of us to become deeply conscious of the choices we make every day that impact gender equality globally\u201d. The economic gap is caused by a number of factors, including women being paid almost half of what men receive, working on average 50 minutes a day longer and having a much slimmer chance of reaching senior roles. Zahidi blamed slower economic growth for keeping women out of the workforce and added that, after making some progress, \u201cwe\u2019re now hitting a bit of a wall\u201d in terms of policy changes to help women in the workplace. Automation is affecting jobs in sales and administration \u2013 sectors with relatively high levels of female employment. On an overall scale, including health, education and politics, the gender gap could be closed in 83 years across the 107 countries included in the report since it was originally published in 2006 \u2013 which is \u201cjust within the statistical lifetime of the baby girls born today\u201d. Within that overall measure, the education gap could be closed in 10 years, while the inequality in politics \u2013 which has the widest gap, despite having closed by 23% \u2013 should end in 82 years because of the fast pace of improvement since 2006, when it stood at 14%. This year, 144 countries are included. Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden are in the top four, while Rwanda makes it in to the top five. The UK has risen to 20th from 18th place in the overall rankings, well below its top 10 position in 2006. The UK\u2019s rankings were compiled before Theresa May became prime minister following the vote for Brexit and are affected by a change to the way income is measured, which lifted the cap on estimated income from $40,000 (\u00a332,800) to $75,000. This pushed the UK down in the economic parity ranks by 10 places to 53. As a result, the US is also ranked as less gender equal, falling 17 places to 45.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Telecommunications giant AT&amp;T is selling access to customer data to local law enforcement in secret, new documents released on Monday reveal. The program, called Hemisphere, was previously known only as a \u201cpartnership\u201d between the company and the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) for the purposes of counter-narcotics operations. It accesses the trove of telephone metadata available to AT&amp;T, who control a large proportion of America\u2019s landline and cellphone infrastructure. Unlike other providers, who delete their stored metadata after a certain time, AT&amp;T keeps information like call time, duration, and even location data on file for years, with records dating back to 2008. But according to internal company documents revealed Monday by the Daily Beast, Hemisphere is being sold to local police departments and used to investigate everything from murder to Medicaid fraud, costing US taxpayers millions of dollars every year even while riding roughshod over privacy concerns. Access to Hemisphere costs local police between $100,000 and more than $1m a year, the documents reveal, and its use requires just an administrative subpoena \u2013 a much lower judicial bar than a search warrant because it does not need to be issued by a judge. Until Monday, Hemisphere\u2019s use was kept secret from the public \u2013 and even from judges, defense attorneys and lawmakers \u2013 by an agreement between law enforcement and AT&amp;T which means police must not risk disclosing its use in public or even in court. This means that police take leads from Hemisphere, but then construct cases around that lead so that the program can be protected from scrutiny, a practice known as \u201cparallel construction\u201d, according to the Beast. The revelations come as AT&amp;T prepares for its controversial $85bn acquisition of Time Warner, a deal which has been widely attacked as being bad for consumers, with both presidential candidates speaking out against the merger. Contacted for comment, Fletcher Cook, a spokesperson for AT&amp;T, sent the Guardian the same statement they provided the Beast: Like other communications companies, if a government agency seeks customer call records through a subpoena, court order or other mandatory legal process, we are required by law to provide this non-content information, such as the phone numbers and the date and time of calls. Asked for further details, Cook did not respond. The secrecy of Hemisphere echoes that which surrounds the use of the sophisticated surveillance devices known as Stingrays, or cell-site simulators, which are suitcase-sized devices which work by pretending to be cellphone towers in order to strip metadata and content from phones which connect to them. In 2015, a Guardian investigation revealed that police departments had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with the FBI in order to use Stingray devices which said that police must hide the program\u2019s use from defense lawyers and the public, even mandating that they abandon a case if they fear the program\u2019s use might be revealed in court. Nate Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project, said that, as with the Stingray agreement, \u201cwhat is so disturbing about these documents is the lengths to which the company and law enforcement have gone to keep this secret\u201d. \u201cThe longer these kind of surveillance programs are kept from the public, the harder it is to ensure there are appropriate checks and balances in place,\u201d Wessler said. For Wessler, an instructive part of what the documents reveal is that while the program was apparently instigated as part of the war on drugs, \u201cthis data is being used for run-of-the-mill criminal investigation at a local level\u201d. \u201cOnce law enforcement has access to this kind of data it becomes a tremendously attractive tool for everything they do.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Clydesdale Bank makes offer for 300 RBS branches", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has been thrown a potential lifeline after Clydesdale Bank made an offer for 300 branches which RBS must offload under the terms of its \u00a345bn bailout. The sale of the branches, which were due to be rebranded Williams &amp; Glyn, has been protracted and RBS has warned the City that it risks failing to meet the end of 2017 deadline imposed by the EU for extricating the network. Clydesdale\u2019s bid will be a relief for RBS, which is trying to demonstrate that potential exit routes are still being pursued for the branches, which largely comprise branches of RBS in England and Wales and NatWest in Scotland. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, warned last month that the bank would enter uncharted territory if he failed to find a solution to the branch sale, which has cost the Edinburgh-based bank \u00a31.5bn to date. He will face questions about the sales process on Friday when RBS is scheduled to report its third-quarter results, which are expected to add the \u00a352bn of losses incurred by the bank since its 2008 taxpayer rescue. Clydesdale, formally known as Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group, floated on the stock market this year after an often tricky relationship with its former owner, National Australia Bank. It has long been touted as a likely bidder for the Williams &amp; Glyn network, which has about 5,000 staff and market shares of current and small business accounts of 2% and 5% respectively. Clydesdale initially declined to comment on its offer but later said its board \u201ccan confirm [it] has engaged in discussions with RBS and has made a preliminary non-binding proposal to RBS in relation to its Williams and Glyn operations. This engagement is ongoing and there can be no certainty that any transaction will occur, nor as to the terms on which any transaction might be conclude\u201d. It is not clear if the UK division of the Spanish bank, which has been formed through the amalgamation of Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley, is ready to enter the process. Santander was initially the agreed bidder for the branches but abandoned the talks in 2012. A deal was announced in 2013 with a consortium backed by private equity investors and the Church of England to try to complete the separation through a stock market flotation under the Williams &amp; Glyn name. Any attempt at a flotation was abandoned in August when it concluded that the low interest rate environment would make it difficult for the operation to be profitable as a standalone entity. The consortium has received at least \u00a3180m from RBS for backing the aborted float. RBS would not comment when asked whether Clydesdale had entered the bidding process. In a previous statement, it said: \u201cWe continue to explore options in meeting our obligations to the European commission. We have been clear that there is interest in the business and this remains the case.\u201d The branches are thought to be valued at about \u00a31.3bn but are not expected to fetch as a high price when \u2013 or if \u2013 the deal is done. The stumbling sales process for Williams &amp; Glyn was among the reasons cited by Philip Hammond this month when he said the time had not yet arrived to sell the taxpayers\u2019 73% stake in RBS. The chancellor also pointed to the uncertainty over a long-running investigation by the US Department of Justice into the mis-selling of mortgage bonds, which could cost RBS \u00a39bn. RBS shares closed at 192p on Tuesday, well below the 502p average price at which taxpayers bought the stake and less than the 330p level at which Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, sold a 5% stake in August 2015.",

Nickolds has said she considered becoming a teacher after studying history at the University of Southampton, but instead she found herself following her father into retail, starting as a graduate trainee at John Lewis\u2019s flagship Oxford Street store in 1994. She went on to hold buying roles in clothing and furniture before taking her first senior position as head of product development in 2006. During the economic downturn, between 2009 and 2013, she led the homewares buying teams where they developed the House and Croft collections. Success there led to a promotion to overall buying and brand director where Nickolds had responsibility for the all-important Christmas ad, including 2013\u2019s bear and the hare animation, before becoming commercial director last year, with responsibility for shops and product development. Nickolds is known for her calm demeanour, a rather different character to her predecessor as managing director, the hyperactive and fiery Andy Street.

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney: politics won't affect how long I stay in my job", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has indicated that an onslaught on his performance by the Conservative party establishment will not influence whether he stays in his post beyond 2018. Asked by a House of Lords committee whether high-level interference will force him to leave, Mark Carney said he would not be swayed by political issues as he weighs up the option of departing in two years\u2019 time or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021. \u201cIt is entirely personal, and no one should read anything into that decision in terms of government policy, actual, imagined, potential, past, etc. This is a role that requires total attention, devotion, and I intend to give it for as long as I can. But those are the only factors,\u201d he said. A section of Theresa May\u2019s Tory conference speech on the impact of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy was viewed as a veiled attack on Carney\u2019s strategy - although No 10 has sought to reassure Threadneedle Street that the comments were not intended as a personal attack. Carney has also been criticised by Conservative figures including Michael Gove and William Hague, in newspaper articles that questioned his leadership. Other Tory figures, including the former chancellor Nigel Lawson, have criticised the Bank\u2019s pre-Brexit referendum warnings that a vote to leave the EU would damage the UK economy. Carney, a Canadian, initially agreed a five-year term with the then chancellor, George Osborne, and is due to say before the end of the year whether he will take up an option to stay until 2021. His comments at a House of Lords economic affairs committee hearing came after he was questioned about the prime minister\u2019s conference speech this month, when she criticised the \u201cbad side-effects\u201d of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy approach of low interest rates and a quantitative easing (QE) money-printing programme. Her criticism was followed by comments from the former foreign secretary William Hague, who attacked the Bank\u2019s low interest rates and the \u00a3435bn QE package \u2013 where the Bank buys bonds from financial institutions \u2013 for crushing returns to pension funds and ordinary savers. The former minister Michael Gove, who likened Carney to an \u201cinviolable\u201d Chinese emperor, said the governor regarded criticism as a thought crime \u201cand those who dare to question his rule are flayed in the press with dire warnings left hanging in the air to emphasise the governor will brook no challenge to his authority\u201d. Speaking to the House of Lords committee, Carney said that taking the Bank under political control would have an immediate cost to the government in the form of higher borrowing costs. He said it would spook investors, who were likely to demand a higher return for holding British assets, including government bonds used to fund state spending. He said it was up to the Bank\u2019s policymakers to achieve stable prices without interference, though based on a remit set by parliament. \u201cThat process has stood the test of time. That process is the process that the BoE is following and if it were to be called into question, one would expect to see the emergence of a risk premium around a range of UK assets, it would be most prominent around the currency, in gilt markets, in inflation expectations,\u201d he said. Carney said he did not think the passage in May\u2019s speech calling for \u201ca time for change\u201d referred to the Bank\u2019s independence and was not proposing a change in the way monetary policy is set. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, backed Carney last week, saying the Bank\u2019s independence was an essential element of Britain\u2019s financial system. But one of Hammond\u2019s Conservative predecessors, Lord Lamont, said Threadneedle Street\u2019s arms-length status was hampered by the Bank\u2019s need for permission from the Treasury for every bout of bond-buying under QE. \u201cSurely the Bank\u2019s independence is compromised when the Treasury can sanction each tranche of bond buying,\u201d he said. Earlier, in the Commons, Hammond responded to questions about the Bank\u2019s independence, saying that the Bank\u2019s bond-buying scheme has been highly effective so far, and hinted that he would not obstruct another dose if needed. \u201cNo request for quantitative easing has ever been refused, and I can\u2019t see why it would be different in future,\u201d he said. The pound had fallen below $1.21 ahead of Carney\u2019s appearance, but subsequently recovered to around $1.22 by early evening on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "Carney has now finished so here are some of the key points. In the wake of criticisms from various politicians, he said investors would want a \u201crisk premium\u201d to buy UK assets if the Bank\u2019s independence was questioned. But markets should not expect this to happen. It was up to the government to set a target for price stability which the Bank would then decide how to reach. On his own future, he said it would be a personal decision as to when he would step down from the Bank and not related to politics. Sterling\u2019s recent slump had less to do with monetary policy, he said, and more to do with the announcement of the timetable for Article 50 and the market\u2019s perception of how discussions on Brexit would unfold. He said there were various contingency plans in place for banks to leave London if they saw fit. On QE he expressed sympathy for savers who have been hit by the programme, but said the Bank was not slavishly relying on QE. He defended the Bank\u2019s purchase of corporate bonds, including McDonald\u2019s. On negative rates, he said there was something unnatural and a confidence effect. Meanwhile the pound has recovered some ground after its earlier sudden slump, which was blamed variously on the strong dollar, comments from chancellor Philip Hammond suggesting more QE and nervousness ahead of Carney\u2019s appearance at the House of Lords. It is now down 0.3% at $1.2195 after falling as low as $1.2084 - its worst level since the flash crash earlier this month. Its recovery is partly due to Carney\u2019s measured performance and his attempts to reassure on QE, his own future, and worries over the Bank\u2019s independence. With the slight recovery in the pound, the FTSE 100 has lost much of its earlier gains but still ended up 0.45% at 7017.64. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece, and the White House has confirmed that president Barack Obama will be visiting the country in November in what officials hope will be the biggest push yet to secure debt relief for the country. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Barely days after the race for the White House, the outgoing president will visit Athens on November 15 in what was described as a tour aimed at reaffirming support \u201cfor economic reforms that reduce inequality.\u201d The US president has voiced barely disguised frustration with austerity policies he has blamed for economic stagnation and slow growth in Europe. Greek officials in the leftist-led government are hoping Obama will push for debt forgiveness when he goes on to hold talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin so that the Greek economy, currently locked in its worst slump in modern times, can be put on the path to recovery. The IMF, like Washington, both believe that with a debt load in excess of \u20ac300bn the Greek economy is unsustainable. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has recently racheted up the rhetoric, saying a debt deal should be wrapped up by December when Athens completes a second review of the economy with international inspectors representing its bailout creditors at the EU and IMF. His appeals were rebuffed by both Merkel and her French counterpart when he met them on the sidelines of last week\u2019s EU summit in Brussels. Berlin, the main provider of bailout funds to date, has argued that Greece\u2019s problen is not one of debt but competitiveness. Still with Brexit, and Ireland is making a pitch to provide a home for a key regultor. Jill Treanor writes: It is not so long ago that European Banking Authority moved to new offices in London\u2019s Canary Wharf. But the vote for Brexit means the regulator which oversees banks in the remaining 27 countries of the EU is likely to need a new home. Ireland has now made a formal pitch to take on the regulator, best known for conducting its stress tests on banks. Michael Noonan, minister of finance said: \u201cWhile the UK continues to be a full member of the EU until the negotiations for their exit have been completed, preparations must be made for eventualities such as the relocation of certain European agencies such as the European Banking Authority. Ireland has a significant financial services sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity to absorb the European Banking Authority\u2019s re-location to Ireland. Our interest in hosting the EBA demonstrates the continued importance Ireland places in well regulated financial services. As a country with experience in providing links to banks and companies in the UK market, Ireland provides an ideal new home for the staff of the EBA.\u201d Ireland has made no secret of its ambitions to take any exiles from London\u2019s financial services sector. Lord Hollick ends by saying a question has been sent in during the proceedings by a pensioner who wants to know what he should invest his savings in. Carney replies that when he can have the answer sent in, he will give a reply. And with that, it\u2019s over. Question: Why are you opposed to negative interest rates? Do you feel comfortable with size of derivatives on bank bal sheets Carney says on negative rates, uncomfortable with effect on bank balance sheets and lending possibly being tempered or reversed. In UK the building societies are an important part of system and they don\u2019t have alternative supply of finance. On top of that, there is something unnatural to negative rates to some people and there is a confidence effect. In terms of derivatives, reforms put in place have substantially reduced risks. Question: If the MPC had known about fall in sterling in August would they have done same stimulus measures ? When does depreciation start becoming serious? Carney says committee always takes into account exchange rate movements and the reasons, and its effect on inflation. Prior to referendum, the way we talked remained most appropriate - we have to balance supply, demand and exchange rate. Since timing of Article 50 became clear, sterling has been influence by market perceptions of [future with EU]. If exchange rate has depreciated and UK supply capacity is weakened by Brexit, it will push up inflation. Question: What is concerning central bankers at the moment other than Brexit? Carney says the balance of monetary, fiscal and structural policy, and that monetary policy has been overburdened. Fair bit of time needs to be spent on that. In terms of biggest risk, China. It is going through a series of transitions, manufacturing to services, from bank based lending to market based finance, flexibility of exchange rate. They are all happening simultaneously. Chinese authorities have done an exemplary job in managing this, but there are challenges. In recent years the pace of growth has been faster than the speed limit, effectively a product of debt through shadow banking sector. Challenge is to sustainably and safely decelerate the rate of growth. Question: when will the recent fall in sterling affect inflation? Carney says the recent uptick in inflation is the product of a few factors but not, net, sterling. Mainly energy prices and clothing prices. Relatively quickly we will see the effects of the sterling depreciation. By the spring [inflation will be] 1.5% to 1.8% annualised with an important contribution [from currency]. We do not have a target for the exchange rate. But it is a factor which influences the stance of monetary policy, and will take into account over next week as we make our policy decision. Question: Given government can borrow at low rates and investing, shouldn\u2019t they take advantage of that? Carney says have to be careful in fiscal policy about what is temporary and what is baked in system. I agree, given interest rate, relative return on a project doesn\u2019t have to be that high when there is tax revenues and an asset alongside it. But those decisions are decisions of the government. Question: Is monetary policy now too loose and fiscal policy too tight? Carney says adjusting fiscal policy is much slower than adjusting monetary policy, it needs budget, legislation. So there is a need to understand the fiscal policy of the government and take it into account. Appropriate for chancellor and governor to discuss how the economy is and what should be done. Away from Carney and back to the pound\u2019s slide. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital said: There is no clear reason for the dip but once the run on the pound starts these days it\u2019s hard to find buyers at any natural or obvious levels...It just goes to show how bearish the sentiment is around the pound at the moment. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to send sterling south at the moment. Of course it\u2019s good news for all those dollar earners on the FTSE 100, which rallied strongly on the pound\u2019s fall before a big bought of profit taking around 15:20-30 pared the day\u2019s gains. Question: Is there too much uncertainty now for forward guidance to be useful? Carney says it is useful in certain circumstances, in the exit from unconventional policy. Lamont: Why are you now buying corporate bonds? Carney says this provides a different channel of stimulus. It is more powerful pound for pound than QE. We are buying neutrally, companies important to UK economy. [Lamot: McDonald\u2019s?] Yes, it is part of the UK economy, providing jobs. It encourages issuance in that market, also frees up bank balance sheets to lend to smaller businesses and households. Lamont: QE has been described as a mixture of fiscal and monetary policy. So independence of central banks has already gone. If Treasury has to approve each tranche of QE, then independence is surely compromised? Carney says the decision is made by the MPC, the Treasury makes decision on Bank balance sheet independently. I have to explain to chancellor the rationale, and he or she will want to be satisfied on that before putting balance sheet forward. Can\u2019t conceive of circumstance where chancellor would not provide that. Question from Lord Lamont: Back to QE, how long will it go on. Is it still effective. The distortions are becoming larger, especially in bond market. Companies are cutting dividend to fund pension liabilities. My fear, this will only end in tears. Carney says he does not share that view. The package in August had four elements, part of the reason was to provided stimulus but also to show we would not slavishly rely on QE. After the first QE programme, they tend to have less of an influence on asset prices. The August announcement has as large an impact as any, [because it was part of a package]. On side effects, we are mindful of side effects. We did look at impacts on pension funds, insurance companies, margins and profitablity of banks and building societies, to satisfy ourselves sum of side effects did not outweigh positives. Case was strong so we pursued it. On pension funds, the challenge is as much due to a lag in equity performance compared to yields elsewhere. So its a broader problem. {Lamont: QE helping that problem} Carney says its whether you think QE is responsible for low rates. [He clearly doesn\u2019t] The concerns about risks in the global environment are quite elevated. Question: is there anything to be done to make sure the City remains the pre-eminent financial centre post-Brexit? We start from a position where it is Europe\u2019s financial centre. [On euro clearing moving from London] there is no need for currency clearing to take place in the currency\u2019s jurisdiction. It is broader discussion in the political realm. From our point of view, we need to retain world class supervision and regulation. We need to ensure - issue for government and private sector - that non-euro activity continues to grow in London. We need to come to some sort of broader agreement on aspects of wholesale finance. Yes some business would migrate, but City will grow other business from elsewhere. Carney says he expects the EU to give serious consideration to equivalence of UK financial regulation. Carney says we do not want to have our hands tied to import ad infinitum financial rules made elsewhere. The pound has recovered some ground during the course of Carney\u2019s appearance so far. Having fallen as low as $1.2084 earlier, and recovering to $1.2121 as he began, it is now at $1.2135, still down 0.7% on the day. Question: is BBA irresponsible suggesting banks are ready to leave imminently? There is much uncertainty, and in an environment where profitability is stretched. Some may take decisions earlier than others. There are discussions [to be held with the EU], it would be precipitate to make decisions [before then]. Question: any evidence banks are planning to relocate out of London? Carney says as supervisor of banks, we are aware of contingency plans at various stages of readyness. Some would be in a position to adjust activities within the next year if they saw fit. Question: US rates are expected to rise, does that not depress the pound. The Bank has also failed to meet its inflation target. Carney says there were four elements to August\u2019s package, sterling barely moved, the market understood what we were doing. When does sterling move, asks Carney. When it becomes clear on the timing of Article 50 and the market\u2019s perception on the relationship between UK and EU. It\u2019s a bit early to determine that. PM says she will get best deal, there have been no discussions. But the market\u2019s perception influences a perception of the supply situation of the econmy. That perception may well be mistaken. We have to take account of where sterling is and how persistent it will be. The 6.5% movement in currency since the Conservative party conference has largely been driven by a single factor, not monetary policy. As for US, there has been an increased perception that Fed will raise rates by the end of the year. That has contributed to generalised dollar strength. But with sterling it is more the perception of that fundamental factor. [On the inflation target] in terms of the undershoot, the explanation was huge moves in oil and commodity prices. The judgement the MPC has to make, we see inflation rising above target in year\u2019s 2 and 3, due to depreciation of sterling in the first half of this year, so our judgement is how quickly we return inflation to target. Should we raise rates in August and get it to 2%, at the cost of jobs and income in the economy. Or is it wiser to look through that exchange rate move and help economy adjust. In the view of every member, it was the right course of action to provide stimulus at that point. Why cut interest rates after Brexit when suggested not beforehand? Carney says monetary policy would depend on supply, demand and the exchange rate. The balance of those forces which effect the path of policy. The MPC decision is not automatic. There were scenarios when.. appropriate response would have been to tighten. But in fact the balance was consistent with the Bank supplying more stimulus to support the economy during a period of adjustment. That stimulus has its limits. The balance can shift. We don\u2019t target exchange rate, we target inflation..but we are not indifferent. Question. There has been talk about Carney leaving. What are the factors for Carney staying or going? Carney says he needs time to reflect, it\u2019s an entirely personal decision. No one should read into it anything about government policy, past, present, intentional. Baroness Wheatcroft question: On the prime minister\u2019s comments, she said monetary policy was an effective emergency measure and a change has to come. Does that mean monetary policy? Carney says he does not think she meant a change in monetary policy. Question: how long will it take to get there (normal interest rates etc)? The framework is there, we fully understand if not welcome criticism of how we\u2019re doing our job to get to inflation target. With time as the government prosecutes its discussions with EU, uncertainties will reduce. There are broader forces in global economy which may take longer to dissipate. Carney says it is frustrating to have interest rates so low for so long. He says he has sympathy with savers, but says the Bank\u2019s focus is on its remit to get inflation where it needs to be. Change inflation target to help savers? Carney says to target a specific group is not consistent with helping widest range of people and supporting whole economy. Lord Hollick, the chair, asks about the prime minister\u2019s concerns about the effect of QE and those who have lost out, and what the Bank could do to help. Carney says since QE, jobs have been created, GDP has grown. That is not due to QE, but the stance has helped the UK economy during a difficult period. Different groups will benefit in different ways. Between 2009 and 2016, most have benefited, although some more than others. We do recognise those who rely on savings have seen lower returns. Carney says the Bank\u2019s independence has stood the test of time. If it was called into question he would expect to see a risk premium on UK assets, particularly the currency, gilts and inflation expectations. He said markets should have no reason to expect that [risk premium]. There is not a debate in parliament to change remit. If the bank\u2019s goal or remit was adjusted, the MPC would discharge that remit. He said comments by individual politicians on policy would have no effect on how it discharges its responsibility. Mark Carney is now beginning his testimony and is talking about monetary policy. He says monetary policy has been overburdened, it is the principal if not sole vehicle to provide stimulus to the UK. He welcomes the government is signalling a resetting of the balance between monetary, fiscal and structural policy. Sterling continues to fall ahead of Mark Carney\u2019s testimony shortly. It has fallen as low as $1.2082, its lowest since the flash crash earlier this month, and while the strength of the dollar and the uncertainty about what Carney will say are factors, comments from chancellor Philip Hammond earlier may also be helping to push sterling lower. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling\u2019s renewed slide seems to have stemmed from comments made by Philip Hammond, who not only warned that EU leaders may focus on political rather than economic issues when discussing the Brexit, but also that, when asked about the possibility of more QE, pointed out that no quantitative easing request has ever been rejected. This seems to have spooked the pound, which had actually been on a decent run of form in the past few trading sessions, and that is before Mark Carney gives his latest Brexit update in front of the House of Lords later today. The return of the pound\u2019s perilous trading was good news for the FTSE. The UK index had been lacking a certain spark in the last few days; now it finds itself 50 points higher, firmly above 7000 and not too far away from its all-time peak. The weak US consumer confidence figures could pose a problem for Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Mike Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: Consumers in the US could be forgiven for harbouring slight trepidations about the future, amid a controversial presidential campaign and global economic uncertainty, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be concerned to see the first signs of this mounting pessimism taking effect. Observers have long earmarked December as when the Fed will raise rates again, but 2016 has been a year of surprises and many traders may now be getting cold feet at the prospect of Yellen holding off until the new year. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade, still thinks a December rise is on the cards: Consumer confidence rose in September to its highest level in nine years, but that positivity has proven short-lived for Fed Chair Janet Yellen following a worse than expected October reading. Although the U.S. economy is performing well on the whole, Yellen has been singled out for criticism by presidential candidate Donald Trump, who claims she is keeping interest rates low for political reasons. And it seems highly unlikely that she will pull the trigger before the Presidential race in November, with a December rise more likely. The US presidential election has dented consumer confidence, according to a new survey. The University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell by 3.6% month on month to 87.9. Year on year the fall was 2.3%. This was the lowest level since last September and the second lowest in the past two years. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: It is likely that the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election had a negative impact, especially among lower income consumers, and without that added uncertainty, the confidence measures may not have weakened. Prospects for renewed gains, other than a relief rally following the election results, would require somewhat larger wage increases and continued job growth as well as the maintenance of low inflation. The fall in sterling has given a boost to the FTSE 100, which is now up around 70 points or 1%. Full as it is of exporters and dollar earners, the leading index has tended to move higher as the pound weakens. In contrast, the more domestic focused FTSE 250 is up just 0.07%. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has opened slightly lower, down around 13 points. Mark Carney\u2019s testimony could see further pressure on the pound, says Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver: Sterling has dropped, partially as a result of pressure on the pound ahead of Carney\u2019s testimony this afternoon (3:35pm) and partially due to dollar strength following above-forecast housing data. There is the risk of further sterling weakness/volatility during Carney\u2019s testimony, which will focus on the economic consequences of the Brexit vote. Cable is trading around 1.2125, near its October 11 lows, which marked its lowest levels since 1985 (excluding the flash crash drop). Sterling\u2019s down over 0.7% against the dollar and over 0.6% against the euro since 1:30pm. This afternoon\u2019s sudden drop in the pound comes ahead of an appearance by Bank of England governor Mark Carney before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee (there is a live TV link here.) A week before the Bank of England unveils its latest monetary policy decision - following the hint last time that a rate cut was possible - Carney is likely to be quizzed on the state of the economy and whether another cut is necessary. With prime minister Theresa May criticising quantitative easing and various politicians making negative comments about the Bank, Carney may also repeat his insistence that the Bank is independent in its decisions. (He must have been pleased to hear Chancellor Philip Hammond defend this very thing last week.). He is also likely to be asked about his future, given that he said he would decide by the end of the year whether to leave in 2018 or stay on longer. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: The markets will primarily be looking for any hints that Carney and co. at the BOE have plans to cut interest rates further. The market has pretty much priced out the prospect of a near-term rate cut from the BOE, but a dovish tone from Carney could see the market start to re-price the prospect of a cut, and the pound could take a hit. Mark Carney\u2019s testimony comes at an interesting time, as relations between the BOE and the government remain tense after the PM appeared to criticize QE, and threaten the Bank\u2019s independence. It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year. If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities. It could also make it more likely that Carney will quit his post in 2018, right in the middle of the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations. As a reminder, the House of Lords committee has said it expects to ask the following questions: Are ultra-low interest rates fuelling inequality and threatening the independence of central banks? Did the Bank misjudge the short-term impact of Brexit prior to the referendum? What impact will the fall in the value of the pound have on the UK\u2019s economy and the inflation target? Will a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit lead to job losses in the City of London? How and when will quantitative easing be unwound? The sudden fall in the pound may be due to other factors, some believe: And it is not just the dollar: sterling is down 0.7% against the euro at \u20ac1.116. The US currency has moved higher after a rise in house prices. The Federal Housing Finance Agency home price index climbed 0.7% in August compared to the previous month. And it has jumped 6.4% from August last year. The strength of these latest figures will add to the idea that the US Federal Reserve could hike interest rates again before the end of the year, probably in December. The news has seen the pound drop around 1% to a weekly low of $1.2116 against the dollar before recovering a little to $1.2128. The euro has hit a seven and a half month low against the dollar. Bad news from Wall Street. Caterpillar, the construction equipment and machinery maker, has cut its sales forecast. The firm, famous for its bright yellow cranes, diggers and trucks, warned that business is tough as potential customers delay purchases, amid mediocre global growth prospects. Chief executive Doug Oberhelman says: \u201cEconomic weakness throughout much of the world persists and, as a result, most of our end markets remain challenged.\u201d Caterpillar cut its projected revenues in 2016 to $39bn, down from $40.1bn. It also fears that next year will be hard to, saying: \u201cWhile we are seeing early signals of improvement in some areas, we continue to face a number of challenges.... We remain cautious as we look ahead to 2017, but are hopeful as the year unfolds we will begin to see more positive momentum.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time this year that Caterpillar has sounded gloomy. It cut its earnings forecast in July, citing Brexit as a threat to global growth. Twenty two years after joining John Lewis as a graduate trainee, Paula Nickolds has just made it to the top of the high street firm, as its first ever female chief. John Lewis has announced that Nickolds, currently their commercial director, has been promoted to one of the biggest jobs in UK retail. She will replace Andy Street, the outgoing MD who is bidding to become mayor of the West Midlands. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield says: \u201cAt a time of transformation in the retail sector, Paula\u2019s progressive and dynamic leadership is just what\u2019s needed for the next phase of modern retailing. As a partner with 22 years\u2019 service, I know just how special the John Lewis Partnership is. Driven by our unique business model, and with innovation in our DNA, I am immensely excited to lead John Lewis on the next stage of our journey.\u201d Nickolds says she got hooked on retail as child, visiting Marks &amp; Spencer stores with her father (who worked for M&amp;S). Nickolds joined John Lewis in 1994, and made it to the board in 2013 as buying and brand director. That would have included overseeing the retailers\u2019 Christmas adverts, including this classic: Hammond is asked whether he would approve another bout of quantitative easing, if the Bank of England wanted to stimulate the economy again. The chancellor says that the BoE\u2019s bond-buying scheme has been highly effective so far, and hints that he would not obstruct another dose if needed. No request for quantitative easing has ever been refused, and I can\u2019t see why it would be different in future. Worth remembering that Theresa May, the PM, criticised QE earlier this month for making the rich richer..... Philip Hammond has also been asked about the possibility that Brexit will cost London the ability to handle \u2018euro clearing\u2019 (the settling of derivative contracts priced in euros). The chancellor says that the European Central Bank has already tried, and failed, once to move euro clearing into the eurozone. He says that euro clearing is \u201cnot easily separated from other activities in London\u201d, but it also only makes up a relatively small part of total jobs and business in the City. Philip Hammond has also warned MPs that European leaders could prioritise political issues over economic ones, in the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Over in parliament, chancellor Philip Hammond has pledged to prioritise the needs of Britain\u2019s financial sector, during EU exit talks. Hammond told MPs that: \u201cI certainly have been seeking to reassure financial services businesses that we will put their needs at the heart of the negotiation with the European Union. We understand their needs for market access. We also understand their needs to be able to engage the right skilled people.\u201d Last week, the head of the British Bankers\u2019 Association warned that banks could start shifting jobs out of London early next year, because they fear losing their rights to \u2018passport\u2019 services across the EU. Some experts have suggested Britain could secure access to the customs union, in return for continuing to pay into the EU budget. That might address the passporting issue, but might alarm Brexit supporters who hoped to make a clean break with Europe.... Eurozone officials have finally given the green light to unlock Greece\u2019s next aid tranche, worth \u20ac2.8bn. This comes two weeks after finance ministers agreed that Athens had hit the milestones laid out in its 3rd bailout. Klaus Regling, the head of Europe\u2019s bailout fund, says: \u201cToday\u2019s decision to disburse 2.8 billion euros ($3.0 billion) to Greece is a sign that the Greek people are steadily making progress in reforming their country.\u201d Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has been hosting a meeting about the refugee crisis - which is putting extra strain on the country\u2019s finances. He\u2019s calling for a better system to help migrants, and a new pro-growth economic strategy for Europe. If German business chiefs are really feeling more confident, they could consider spending some of their huge cash piles. According to the Wall Street Journal, German companies are sitting on around \u20ac450bn of cash - but are proving reluctant to invest it. And there are fears that this could hamper growth, just when Europe desperately needs to boost activity and create jobs. The WSJ says: The problem isn\u2019t unique to Germany. Companies in other developed countries have also been investing less since the financial crisis. But Germany\u2019s low investment is striking given the country\u2019s relatively robust economic performance\u2014especially compared with other European countries\u2014and its record-low unemployment. Advocates of higher corporate investment say German parsimony is troubling, because the economy depends to such a large degree on research- and capital-intensive industries. It risks weakening the ability of Europe\u2019s largest industrial power to grow and create jobs in future, with negative consequences for all of Europe. \u201cWe need to be careful that Germany doesn\u2019t fall behind technologically because of persistently low investment,\u201d said Reinhold Festge, head of the German engineering-sector association VDMA, which represents over 3,100 midsize companies. Here\u2019s the full piece: After its recent wild turbulence, sterling seems to have calmed down a little. The pound is stubbornly stuck around the $1.22 mark this morning, as currency traders await Mark Carney\u2019s testimony at the House of Lords. Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: Sterling remains under substantial pressure as investors continued to expect harsh consequences amid the UK decision to leave the European Union. Eek. Shares in troubled Italian bank Monte dei Paschi have just been temporarily suspended after plunging by 23%. They had jumped in early trading, after it announced plans to sell \u20ac28bn of bad debts and shrink its operations (see earlier post). The jump in German business confidence has driven Frankfurt\u2019s main share index, the DAX, up to a new 2016 high. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: A healthy reading from the German IFO report has buoyed risk appetite. This jump in German business confidence comes a day after Markit reported that German companies are growing at their fastest rate since July. Pernille Bomholdt, senior analyst at Danske Bank, reckons Germany\u2019s economy is growing fast -- at a quarterly rate of 0.8% City analysts are welcoming the surge in German business confidence this month. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets believes it will have a positive impact on the whole eurozone: The German IFO data has provided further evidence that the economic engine of the eurozone is picking up steam. There is no doubt that there will be spill over effects of this in other eurozone countries and the economic picture will look a lot more better there. The German economic data has helped the sentiment and traders are falling more in love with equities. The news has also provided a support for the Euro. Anthony Cheung of Amplify Trading points out that it follows a strong reading in September: And data firm Markit also believes the German economy is improving. German bosses are more upbeat about current trading, and their future prospects, according to today\u2019s report from IFO. The current economic conditions index rose to 115 from 114.7. And the future expectations index jumped to 106.1 from 104.5. The jump in German business confidence this month shows that the shock of Britain\u2019s EU referendum has dissipated, according to Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe. Wohlrabe told Reuters that: \u201cThe Brexit vote has been digested.\u201d Wohlrabe added that Wallonia\u2019s decision to throw a large spanner into the EU\u2019s trade deal with Canada has not dampened Germany\u2019s economy either. Europe\u2019s largest economy is bouncing back from the shock of Britain\u2019s EU referendum vote, according to the latest healthcheck from the IFO thinktank. IFO\u2019s business climate index, which surveys 7,000 German business leaders, has hit its highest level since April 2014. That shows executives are increasingly confident about their prospects, despite the uncertainty over Brexit, and the looming US election. Ifo head Clemens Fuest says: \u201cThe upturn in the German economy is gathering impetus.\u201d IFO\u2019s business climate index hit 110.5 in October, up from 109.5 in September, beating expectations of an unchanged reading. Construction firms and manufacturers are particularly upbeat. After many months of anguish, Italy\u2019s oldest bank may finally be turning the corner \u2013 but at the cost of thousands of jobs. Monte dei Paschi has agreed a turnaround plan, that will see it sell off \u20ac28bn of bad debts and raise \u20ac5bn in fresh capital. It is also planning to cut 2,600 jobs \u2013 one in 10 workers - and close 500 branches. New CEO Marco Morelli hopes to complete the capital raising by the end of this year \u2013 although it could be disrupted if the Italian government loses a crunch referendum on constitutional reforms. The bank also posted a \u20ac1.15bn loss for the last quarter, as bad debts continue to drag it down. But investors may have faith \u2013 shares are up 2.6% this morning, and have gained almost 60% in recent weeks: The euro is hovering close to last week\u2019s seven-month low, as investors digest the breakdown of talks with Canada over a new trade deal. Mark Ostwald of ADM Investor Services agrees that Mark Carney will be quizzed about his future this afternoon: Mr Carney testifies to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, where he will doubtless resolutely defend the BoE\u2019s independence, though he may face some awkward questions about whether he will extend his term to the full eight years, and indeed whether he will complete his initial five year term. Europe\u2019s main stock markets are following Japan\u2019s lead, and are all up in early trading. Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has inched higher in early trading, gaining 25 points to 7011. Mining companies are rallying, after Chinese iron ore futures prices hit a six-year high overnight. Anglo American is leading the way, up 3%. It told shareholders this morning that its on track to hit its production targets this year (apart from coking coal, which it trimmed slightly). Whitbread are the biggest faller, though, dropping by 3%, despite posting a 5.4% rise in profits so far this year. It told the City that demand at its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee shops was solid. It\u2019s aiming to open another 3,700 new Premier Inn rooms in the UK by the end of the financial year, and 250 new Costa Coffee shops worldwide. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: It seems that Britain\u2019s appetite for average coffee and cheapish hotel rooms hasn\u2019t diminished since the referendum result, though of course it goes without saying that on the Brexit front it is still early doors. Yet investors weren\u2019t ready to send the stock any higher, however. There are two reasons why the US dollar is strengthening, according to Bloomberg. 1) America\u2019s manufacturing sector strengthened this month, according to yesterday\u2019s Markit PMI. 2) A top US central bank official has predicted that interest rates will be hiked several times in the next year. Bloomberg says The gauge of the greenback\u2019s strength remains near to its highest level since March after a preliminary U.S. purchasing managers\u2019 index rose and Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said it\u2019s likely that interest rates will be hiked three times by the end of 2017. The yen fell 0.2 percent. \u201cEvans probably had a stronger impact than the PMI on the strength of the dollar,\u201d said Kyosuke Suzuki, head of currency and money-market sales at Societe Generale SA in Tokyo. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many senior Fed officials who have come out with specific numbers of expected rate increases. That\u2019s providing a tailwind for the dollar.\u201d Japan\u2019s stock market has hit a new six-month high today, as investors drive down the yen against the US dollar. The Nikkei jumped by 0.75% today, extending recent gains, to close 130 points higher at 17,365 points. That means it has gained 16% since the slump after the Brexit referendum. It was pushed upwards by a surge of money into the US dollar, which is close to a seven month high against a basket of currencies. The dollar is benefitting from growing confidence that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. That weakened the yen, which is a big boost for Japanese exporters -- and should also help fight deflation. There was also optimism, after yesterday\u2019s data showed Eurozone companies growing at their fastest pace this year. That could bode well for global growth, and mean more demand for Japanese exports. Commodity prices are rallying too, as Reuters explains: There were also tentative hopes rising prices for steel and some industrial commodities - zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014 - could pick up the pulse of inflation globally. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brexit supporters have been gunning for Mark Carney ever since the Bank of England governor warned that voting to leave the EU would cause \u2018material\u2019 damage to the UK economy. Four months after the referendum, Carney faces a grilling from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee about the historic vote to leave the EU, starting at 3.35pm today. He\u2019ll be facing (among others) two former chancellors, Alastair Darling and Norman Lamont. Rather sportingly, the Committee have already published their key questions: Are ultra-low interest rates fuelling inequality and threatening the independence of central banks? Did the Bank misjudge the short-term impact of Brexit prior to the referendum? What impact will the fall in the value of the pound have on the UK\u2019s economy and the inflation target? Will a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit lead to job losses in the City of London? How and when will quantitative easing be unwound? Carney should feel free to cite the Guardian\u2019s Brexit dashboard, which shows how rising inflation is hitting the economy: Of course, there\u2019s another question that needs addressing....how long will Carney stay at the Bank of England? His contract runs out in summer 2018, but there\u2019s been talk of extending it until 2021. But the recent criticism from politicians, from Theresa May downwards, may have stung Carney and made him consider seeking new pastures.... Also coming up today... The latest IFO survey, due at 9am BST, will show how Germany\u2019s economy is faring this month. And we\u2019re getting financial results from transport firm National Express, hotels-to-coffee shops group Whitbread, car showrooms firm Pendragon and flooring firm Carpetright, plus a production report from mining giant Anglo American,",

Jill Treanor writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is not so long ago that European Banking Authority moved to new offices in London\u2019s Canary Wharf. But the vote for Brexit means the regulator which oversees banks in the remaining 27 countries of the EU is likely to need a new home. Ireland has now made a formal pitch to take on the regulator, best known for conducting its stress tests on banks. Michael Noonan, minister of finance said: \u201cWhile the UK continues to be a full member of the EU until the negotiations for their exit have been completed, preparations must be made for eventualities such as the relocation of certain European agencies such as the European Banking Authority. Ireland has a significant financial services sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity to absorb the European Banking Authority\u2019s re-location to Ireland.

It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year.</p> <p>If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities.

      "bodyText": "Ireland has demonstrated its determination to battle with other EU nations over any businesses shaken loose as a result of the Brexit vote, by setting out its case to provide a new home for the London-based pan-European banking regulator. Michael Noonan, the Republic\u2019s finance minister, announced that Dublin wanted to be considered an alternative location for the European Banking Authority (EBA), which oversees banks across the EU. The Irish government also gave formal approval for a proposal to relocate the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to the country. Irish politicians fear economic disaster could hit the nation, following the 23 June referendum, due to the close links between the Irish and UK economies. Noonan said: \u201cWhile the UK continues to be a full member of the EU until the negotiations for their exit have been completed, preparations must be made for eventualities such as the relocation of certain European agencies like the European Banking Authority. \u201cIreland has a significant financial services sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity to absorb the European Banking Authority\u2019s re-location to Ireland.\u201d He said Ireland was an \u201cideal new home\u201d for the EBA, which employs about 160 banking experts in its headquarters in Canary Wharf, London. The regulator moved into its new building in 2014 and its lease runs until 2020. There is stiff competition to house the EBA, which officials in Brussels had said in the immediate days after the referendum result would need to leave London. Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Milan and Paris are all regarded as possible new homes for the regulator. Dublin has also being trying to woo businesses which might be looking for a new home when the UK leaves the EU. Within hours of the EU referendum result, Martin Shanahan, the head of Ireland\u2019s Industrial Development Authority, wrote letters to 1,200 companies outlining Ireland\u2019s role as a gateway to Europe. Ireland was also quick to make clear it was interested in housing the EMA, which with a a staff of 890 oversees pan-European drug approvals since 1995 from its headquarters in Canary Wharf in London. Health minister Simon Harris will set out a detailed proposal for the medicines regulator next year. Ireland is closely linked to the UK. It is Britain\u2019s fifth biggest trading partner while Britain is Ireland\u2019s largest export partner. Irish companies sell \u00a315bn of product to the UK each year and could be hampered by the weak level of sterling. It is not clear how many banks will leave London as a result of Brexit but Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers Association. told the Observer that they could begin moving early next year.",

      "bodyText": "Paula Nickolds, the new managing director of John Lewis, will take the helm in January. The John Lewis lifer will have to address a number of major strategic questions, not least the existential threat facing department stores in an internet age. 1. Department store 2.0 Sales are falling in John Lewis\u2019s physical stores as the internet sucks purchases out of the high street. Like other department store chains, the retailer is having to worker harder than ever to get shoppers through the door amid cautious consumer spending and weak high street footfall. Its newest branch in Leeds boasts an upmarket spa and Benugo cafe but Nickolds will have to come up with other ways to reinvent its stores. 2. Rebuild profits There are lots of other moving parts affecting the employee-owned retailer\u2019s financial performance. Profits collapsed in the first six months of this year, slumping 31.2% to \u00a332.4m as it invested heavily in the back end of its online business and its Never Knowingly Undersold promise forced it to match rivals promotions. Nickolds could face an uphill struggle in this area as she battles any Brexit related hit to consumer spending. 3. Bricks v clicks More than a third of John Lewis\u2019s sales are online and Nickolds\u2019 predecessor, Andy Street, predicted they would hit 50% by 2020. This will present the business with a fresh set of challenges as each item sold online generates less profit because of the behind-the-scenes effort involved in fulfilling orders while the company simultaneously services the huge fixed costs associated with running large department stores. Nickolds will have to figure out how to balance the needs of both sides of the business. 4. Partners The John Lewis Partnership\u2019s USP is that it is owned by its staff, but at its last update in September, the chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, signalled tough times were ahead as it grappled with a rising wage bill and the need to become more efficient. It cut 1,500 jobs last year and Mayfield anticipated \u201cwe will have fewer partners over time compared with today\u201d. The prized annual staff bonus has fallen for the past three years and Nickolds will somehow have to boost morale on the shopfloor while getting staff to work harder. 5. Growth channels John Lewis has a small pipeline of stores in prospect but opening acres of new space is unlikely to appeal to Nickolds, who will have to make the 48 she has inherited pay their way. Her Waitrose counterpart, Rob Collins, has put the brakes on further supermarket openings in a tough market and she will have to look for ways to win market share from rivals in what promises to be an unforgiving retail landscape in 2017.",

All 25 staff, including the three pilots, were taken to hospital for medical checks after landing, a BA spokeswoman said, adding all personnel had been discharged. Two passengers were given a medical exam on board and found to be healthy. A BA spokesman said no passengers had felt unwell, so there was no need to take them to hospital. He described the staff checkups as a precaution. The airline declined to comment on the nature of the symptoms that forced flight BA286 to be diverted on Monday night. Laura Kohli, spokeswoman for Vancouver Coastal Health, said crew members had been assessed for smoke inhalation, adding: \u201cI can confirm we had a total of 25 crew members that were transported to local area hospitals as a precaution.\u201d The plane, an Airbus A380, took off from San Francisco on Monday evening heading east, but changed course two hours into the flight to head towards Vancouver, tracking site Flightradar shows. Liz Keller, 38, an advertising strategy director who was on board, told the Guardian the flight had seemed \u201cpretty normal\u201d for the first couple of hours. \u201cThen the captain got on the tannoy and said we were diverting to Calgary because there was a minor technical fault on the plane. Not what you want to hear, but OK.\u201d Shortly afterwards, the pilot announced that members of the crew had been taken ill. \u201cYou could tell the crew was a little distressed: they ended the dinner service early; they were spending a lot of time in the back galley,\u201d Keller said. The flight landed in Vancouver, where the captain asked passengers to remain seated so they could deal with the unwell crew members. \u201cThen firemen, fully dressed in outfits and respirators, came down the aisles, and all of a sudden it was like, what\u2019s actually going on on this plane?\u201d Keller said. The firemen were using technical equipment \u2013 \u201cI couldn\u2019t begin to guess what it was.\u201d The flight was greeted by \u201cabsolutely loads of police officers\u201d, she added. News footage showed the aircraft surrounded by emergency vehicles after landing. Keller said she and other passengers had received little information from the airline since landing, apart from being booked into hotels and given a phone number to call to rebook their flights. \u201cWith the lack of information your brain fills in the gaps \u2013 that\u2019s worse,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want clarity of information and a timeline, and BA hasn\u2019t been able to provide those things.\u201d When she woke up to call the number on Tuesday morning, the system had crashed, she said. \u201cIt feels a bit like we have been left in the lurch now that we are on the ground \u2026 This hasn\u2019t been the best 24 hours.\u201d A BA statement said: \u201cWe are sorry for the delay to our customers\u2019 flight but the safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is always our top priority. \u201cThe flight from San Francisco diverted to Vancouver after members of the cabin crew became unwell. Our ground team at Vancouver has arranged hotel accommodation for the customers and will book them on alternative flights as soon as possible.\u201d The airline has launched an investigation into the incident.",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis has promoted Paula Nickolds, who joined the company as a graduate trainee, to be the first female managing director in the department store group\u2019s 152-year history. Nickolds, 43, will take over from Andy Street in January. She has worked for the retail group for 22 years,, joining as a graduate trainee in the haberdashery of the Oxford Street store in London. Heading one of the UK\u2019s biggest and most respected retail brands, Nickolds will be one of only a handful of female bosses in an industry in which more than half of employees are women. Only V\u00e9ronique Laury, head of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, and Katie Bickerstaffe, head of Dixons Carphone\u2019s UK and Irish business, hold comparable roles. After working her way up through the ranks, Nickolds joined the John Lewis management board as buying and brand director in 2013. She is currently commercial director with responsibility for rejuvenating John Lewis\u2019s product ranges and the look and feel of its shops as well as its international partnerships. Nickolds takes over at a tricky period for the department store, where profits slumped 31% to \u00a332m in the first half of this year as it struggled to adapt to the shift to online shopping. She will have to help increase morale and find a way to maintain the group\u2019s quality and service credentials while cutting costs, particularly in stores where sales are falling. Nickolds may also have to consider pruning new store developments and finding new uses for store space that is no longer needed. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, the department store\u2019s parent group, which also owns Waitrose, said: \u201cAt a time of transformation in the retail sector, Paula\u2019s progressive and dynamic leadership is just what\u2019s needed for the next phase of modern retailing.\u201d Nickolds said: \u201cAs a partner with 22 years\u2019 service, I know just how special the John Lewis Partnership is. Driven by our unique business model, and with innovation in our DNA, I am immensely excited to lead John Lewis on the next stage of our journey.\u201d Former and current John Lewis staff, known as partners because they jointly own the business and take a share in its profits, said Nickolds was \u201cinspirational\u201d and a \u201crole model\u201d. \u201cPaula has got the partnership in her DNA. She is ferociously bright and a very good people person. She is hugely respected and a woman with outstanding taste,\u201d said one person who knows Nickolds well. Richard Hyman, the veteran retail analyst, said Nickolds was a great pick to lead the next phase of development at John Lewis because she was an \u201cold fashioned retailer\u201d who was in touch with what customers wanted and would help keep the brand relevant in a tough economic climate. \u201cAnybody can reduce costs if they compromise on quality or service. It would be a big mistake for John Lewis to jeopardise the single strongest competitive advantage it has which is customer service,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cThe next 18 months are going to be real tough, much tougher than now, and we are really going to see who\u2019s got the vision and financial strength to invest in building sales. John Lewis will need to understand what are the fundamental pillars of its DNA and reinforce those in the marketplace.\u201d Peter Ruis, the boss of the Jigsaw fashion brand who previously worked with Nickolds at John Lewis, said: \u201cPaula intuitively understands what the customers wants and she\u2019ll want to keep innovating without burning the foundations down - keeping the best of the old with the best of the new.\u201d Street, another former John Lewis graduate trainee, leaves at the end of this week after nine years as managing director to pursue his campaign to be mayor of the West Midlands. Dino Rocos, operations director, will lead the department store group until Nickolds moves to her new role. Although most of the plans are already in place, Rocos will have to shepherd the business through the all-important Christmas period when the vast majority of John Lewis\u2019s profits are made.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s richest woman, Gina Rinehart, has invested \u00a3245m in the UK\u2019s biggest potash mine on the edge of the North York Moors national park. The \u00a31.7bn mine, which was given the go-ahead last year after a protracted planning battle, has promised to restore the region\u2019s proud mining heritage and bring more than 1,000 jobs. The project received a major boost on Tuesday when Sirius Minerals, the company behind the Yorkshire mine, announced a US$300m (\u00a3245m) deal with Rinehart\u2019s Australian agricultural firm Hancock Prospecting. The mine, which sits on protected moorland overlooking Whitby and Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, aims to produce up to 20m tonnes a year of a potassium-rich mineral called polyhalite, a type of potash fertiliser described by Sirius as a \u201cfertiliser of the future\u201d. Under the deal Rinehart will purchase $50m of Sirius shares and pay $250m for a 5% royalty stream on the first 13m tonnes of fertiliser produced by the mine annually, and the right to purchase up to 20,000 tonnes of product each year for use on her expanding Australian agricultural holdings. Rinehart said: \u201cThis project delivers a new and natural product that is relevant to Hancock\u2019s focus on agriculture, and after years of field tests and across many crop types, demonstrated improved yields. \u201cSirius has a large, high-quality mineral resource and is located in a stable jurisdiction with a competitive tax rate. The project has the potential to become one of the world\u2019s leading producers of multi-nutrient fertiliser and could have a life of 100 years \u2013 this fits with my approach of investing in strategic areas for the long term.\u201d The mile-deep mine shaft was narrowly approved in June 2015, by eight votes to seven, after a protracted four-year planning wrangle that drew opposition from conservationists. The project was supported by 93% of local people who wrote to the council, 81% of whom live in the national park. But it was opposed by groups including the National Trust, Natural England, the Campaign for National Parks, the North Yorkshire Moors Association, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Campaign to Protect Rural England and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Sirius estimates that the mine will increase North Yorkshire\u2019s economy by 10%, with \u00a348m injected directly into the stagnant local area, which has never fully recovered from the loss of coalmining and fishing industries. All mined polyhalite will be transported underground on a 23-mile conveyor belt running underneath the North York Moors national park to a handling facility in Teesside. Chris Fraser, the managing director and chief executive of Sirius, said: \u201cWe are delighted to have signed this agreement with such an experienced party in the mining industry, as well as one that has very successful and strong leadership, and a long-term and growing agricultural interest.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Costa owner says wages will need to rise if Brexit shrinks worker pool", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Whitbread\u2019s boss has warned wages will be pushed up with a potential knock-on impact for prices if Brexit shrinks the pool of workers available to the owner of Costa and Premier Inn. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, said about a fifth of her 50,000 UK employees came from other EU countries , with the figureshigher in London and other cities and large towns. If there were fewer EU workers that would affect wages at Whitbread and other businesses, she said. Announcing results for the first half of the year, Brittain said: \u201cWe are a company that grows new jobs by 3,000 every year so having a good labour pool to fill those jobs remains important to us. If the pool is smaller the price of that talent pool goes up. I suspect the whole of the wage bill will go up in the UK if the labour pool is restricted.\u201d Brittain said rising wages could put pressure on prices along with the increased cost of buying coffee following the sharp fall in the value of the pound. But she said she hoped an efficiency drive, including using technology to serve customers faster, would let Whitbread keep prices stable. \u201cWe price our coffee to customers in a competitive marketplace. It\u2019s not the first lever we choose to pull. We haven\u2019t got a history of price rises in the way our competitors have raised prices pretty much every single year.\u201d Pre-tax profit rose 3.4% to \u00a3263.6m in the six months to 1 September as revenue rose 8.1% to \u00a31.56bn. At Premier Inn hotels, Whitbread\u2019s biggest business, profit increased 8.9% but Costa\u2019s profit fell 4% as it spent on IT, store revamps and paying the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Brittain said there had been no noticeable effect on her business from the vote to leave the EU but that Whitbread was prepared for the economy to slow next year, as many economists expect. Brittain said in June that Whitbread would consider slowing expansion if the UK chose to leave the EU but she said plans remain unchanged after the Brexit vote. Whitbread shares, down 15% this year, fell 3.7% to \u00a337.02. Brittain said Costa, which has 2,121 UK branches, has opportunities to expand because coffee drinking in the UK is still less popular than in other European countries and Costa is experimenting with new products and formats. Costa has opened a second \u201cfiner\u201d branch in Wandsworth, south London, after a successful trial in London\u2019s Covent Garden. The branches have later opening hours and serve wine and a wider range of food, including the hipster\u2019s favourite, avocado on toast. Brittain said the format aimed to tap into the growing market for independent coffee shops and would serve single-origin coffee alongside Costa\u2019s traditional blend. However, she said she was wary of trying to be too trendy. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are going too hipster at this stage. What happens in Bradford or Bournemouth high street is quite different from Borough Market. Some of the things we see in London might well become the trends of the future. We should be leading the way to bring some of that innovative stuff to the mass market without going too quickly for our customers.\u201d",

If there were fewer EU workers that would affect wages at Whitbread and other businesses, she said.</p> <p>Announcing results for the first half of the year, Brittain said: \u201cWe are a company that grows new jobs by 3,000 every year so having a good labour pool to fill those jobs remains important to us.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "AT&amp;T, the US\u2019s second largest wireless telecommunications company, agreed to acquire media powerhouse Time Warner over the weekend in a deal worth $85bn. One of the largest acquisitions of all time, the deal brings together Time Warner\u2019s content brands including HBO, CNN and Warner Bros with AT&amp;T\u2019s portfolio of mobile, broadband and satellite TV services \u2013 the company has more than 130 million mobile phone customers and 25 million pay-TV subscribers through DirecTV. AT&amp;T\u2019s CEO Randall Stephenson said the deal would enable the two companies to move quicker and operate better in a world where people increasingly access content on their mobile devices. \u201cThe world of distribution and content is converging, and we need to move fast, and if we want to do something truly unique, begin to curate content differently, begin to format content differently for these mobile environments, and this is all about mobility,\u201d he said. Gartner analyst Akshay Sharma said the deal was about AT&amp;T trying to become smarter. \u201cInstead of being a dumb pipe provider, now it\u2019s all about content and user experience,\u201d he said. However, critics were concerned that the deal could lead to less consumer choice, higher prices and a threat to media plurality. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that it would give the combined company \u201ctoo much concentration of power\u201d and that he would block the deal if he wins next month\u2019s election. But what does it mean for consumers? Pricing problems A key concern is whether the newly merged company might use its huge distribution network (the customers of DirecTV and its wireless and broadband services) to give an unfair advantage to its own content, delivering it in a way that is faster or more accessible than competitor content. This would, of course, violate the principle of net neutrality, whereby internet service providers should not favor or block any particular products or websites. AT&amp;T has form for this. It already offers AT&amp;T wireless customers the ability to watch DirecTV without it counting against their data plan. This \u201czero-rating\u201d strategy means it\u2019s cheaper to stream DirecTV than it is to use other services. Following the Time Warner deal, AT&amp;T could extend this zero rating to Game of Thrones, Harry Potter movies or NFL football on TNT. That\u2019s good news for AT&amp;T customers but could be seen to give its own service an unfair advantage over competitors such as Dish Network\u2019s Sling TV or on-demand services such as Netflix and Hulu, unless they pay AT&amp;T to have their own zero-rating deal. \u201cWhether it\u2019s channel position or recommendations on your home screen, the distributor certainly has the technical capability to give their own content more visibility than their competitors if they are left to do so,\u201d said analyst Jim Nail of Forrester Research. The end result is that it becomes harder for other content providers to compete for end users\u2019 attention. In the long run this could mean less competition altogether, which could lead to higher prices. Not everyone agrees. \u201cIn reality, regulatory constraints mean that it is almost impossible to use vertically owned content to the advantage of distribution, and it is equally impossible to use captive distribution to the advantage of vertically owned content,\u201d analyst Craig Moffett said. A less clunky experience between devices This type of deal should allow AT&amp;T to create a better user experience as they access content across multiple devices, whether that\u2019s their cellphone, tablet or TV \u2013 an experience that has traditionally been clunky and painful for users. \u201cThey can connect the dots as the content flows from the big screen to the laptop to smartphone or tablet,\u201d Sharma said. AT&amp;T will be able to data mine a person\u2019s location, devices and behaviour in order to provide the right content at the right time in a more efficient way. \u201cIt makes for a more holistic user experience that could lead to consumer-friendly innovations.\u201d More targeted advertising Like it or not, advertising helps fund most of the content we consume. The merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner could mean more granularity to ad targeting. AT&amp;T has already launched addressable TV advertising, where different households watching the same program will see different commercials, through DirecTV. This approach could be extended throughout all of the new company\u2019s offerings and across platforms. \u201cI know ads are painful to watch sometimes, but it\u2019s necessary because it pays the bills. More contextual advertising means the doctor might get the ad for Mercedes or BMW while the child might see Pepsi, Coca-Cola or video game ads,\u201d Sharma said.",

      "bodyText": "Mining shares are supporting the UK market despite a series of disappointing updates elsewhere putting pressure on shares. A strong production update from Anglo American has lifted its shares 4% to \u00a311.10 and also pushed Antofagasta 18p higher to 543p, Rio Tinto up 79.5p to \u00a327.55 and Glencore 6.15p better at 243.75p. Recent signs of stability in the Chinese economy has also helped sentiment. But Whitbread has fallen 98p to \u00a337.45 after the Premier Inns and Costa Coffee reported slowing sales at the drinks business. GKN is down 8.2p at 315p as the engineering group said growth rates were easing in its major markets. Meanwhile Intu Properties has dropped 2.9p to 288.3p as it said occupancy levels at its shopping centres had fallen since June by 0.6% to 95.6%. It said new lettings in the year had more than offset the 1% impact from the closure of BHS. It also agreed to sell its 63% stake in a Bromley shopping centre for \u00a3177.9m, which it said was around 1% higher than its value before the Brexit vote. The property market was one of the main victims of the turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. In a reduce note, analysts at Numis said: In a deal that we see as being a short term positive for sentiment, Intu has sold Bromley slightly ahead of book value. Trading through the third quarter did not see a material change versus the half year and management has reiterated its 3-4% like for like net rental income guidance. Our key issue is that Intu remains highly leveraged and capital consumptive, and we see better value elsewhere. Royal Bank of Scotland is under pressure on continuing concerns about fines it may be liable for, down 5.7p at 182.3p. Overall, with the rise in mining shares, the FTSE 100 has added 36.10 points to 7022.50. Among the mid-caps, Petra Diamonds continues to benefit from its recent update, 5.8p better at153.5p, but pubs group Mitchells &amp; Butlers is down 14.8p at 267.8p after Citigroup issued a sell recommendation.",
