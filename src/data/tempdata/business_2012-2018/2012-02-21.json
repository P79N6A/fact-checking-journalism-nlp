Drawing upon quotes from Bank of England executive Andy Haldane, who used a speech last month to argue that accounting rules had helped in \"both over-egging the financial upswing and elongating the financial downswing\", the chairman of the committee asked whether the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) were \"in conformity with UK law\". \"I should be grateful if you would look into the question of the conformity of IFRS with applicable British law and let me know the government's considered view.

    "webTitle": "UK public finances show biggest surplus in four years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's leading experts on tax and spending gave George Osborne the all-clear for modest budget giveaways after the latest figures for the public finances showed the biggest monthly surplus in four years. Despite the caution expressed by the Treasury, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the chancellor could provide the economy with a stimulus without impairing the government's credibility in the financial markets. The Office for National Statistics said that the public sector made a net repayment excluding financial interventions of \u00a37.75bn in January, up from \u00a35.2bn a year ago. It was the highest surplus since January 2008 and above the average forecast in a poll conducted by Reuters, which predicted a net repayment of \u00a36.3bn. January is usually a strong month for income and corporation tax receipts. Borrowing in the fiscal year to date to came in at \u00a393.45bn, down from \u00a3109.14bn in 2010/11. Britain's total public sector net debt, excluding financial sector interventions, fell back to \u00a3988.7bn having passed \u00a31 trillion for the first time in December. The figures come just a month before the budget and suggest that government borrowing is on track to meet or beat its target of \u00a3127bn in 2011-12, down from \u00a3136bn the previous year. Rowena Crawford, a research economist at the IFS, said a simple extrapolation of the trend for the first 10 months of the year pointed to net borrowing coming in at around \u00a3116bn, lower than the \u00a3124bn pencilled in by the IFS in its green budget earlier this month, but there was a risk that borrowing would be higher than expected in February and March. She added: \"The chancellor would no doubt be pleased if borrowing this year were to come in lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. However, the composition of this lower borrowing suggests that it is unlikely to feed through into lower than currently forecast borrowing in future years. Despite this caveat, the worsening economic outlook seen over the last year has increased pressure for a temporary fiscal stimulus package in next month's budget, and lower-than-expected borrowing this year may give the chancellor scope for such a policy without damaging the credibility of the government's commitment to deficit reduction.\" A Treasury spokesman said: \"Our credible deficit plan is working and bringing government borrowing down: so far this year it is \u00a316bn lower than in the same period last year. It is the deficit plan, and its successful implementation, that is keeping interest rates at record lows for families and businesses and helping to support the recovery.\" Rachel Reeves, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: \"The chancellor might claim these borrowing figures show his plans are on track, but he is only on track for targets which have already been revised up by a staggering \u00a3158bn. This is extra borrowing to pay for the costs of economic failure \u2013 slower growth and higher unemployment \u2013 rather than to support the economy through difficult times.\" City economists said Osborne would have only limited room for manoeuvre in the budget on 21 March, with sluggish growth for the rest of this year likely to make reducing borrowing harder in the near future. Official data on Friday is expected to confirm the economy shrank by 0.2% in the final three months of 2011. There have been signs of growth this year, but output could be affected again later in the year because of the public holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations. Tuesday's data showed that government receipts rose 2.8% on the year, roughly in line with growth in total government expenditure. However, local government borrowing fell in January compared with a year ago. The OBR said that borrowing in the final two months of 2011-12 would have to be \u00a37bn worse than in the same period a year earlier for the deficit to be as high as \u00a3127bn for the current year as a whole.",

Its findings are expected to be published in the spring.</p> <p>Green campaigners are still reeling from a decision last year by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) to slash solar power subsidies in a move that infuriated the industry, including many small businesses, some of which have gone bankrupt as a direct result of the clampdown. Although the high court has ruled the proposed cuts are illegal, because of botched consultation procedures, the government is drawing up emergency measures to cap the cost of solar panel subsidies.</p> <p>Analysts says Drax is in a difficult position because its future will be determined by the shape of future regulation decided in Whitehall, while at the same time the level of profit from burning coal for power generation is uncertain from 2013 with the introduction of a minimum price for carbon. But Drax says it can easily replace half its coal-fired capacity with biomass to reduce toxic emissions, if sufficient government help is forthcoming.</p> <p>The company revealed its financial results for the year to the end of December 2011, with underlying earnings falling 15% to \u00a3334m due largely to higher commodity prices. But pre-tax profits rose from \u00a3255m to \u00a3338m, thanks to a one-off tax credit and gains from hedging activities. The company cut the total dividend from 32p to 28p.</p> <p>Thompson said: \"We continue to operate at less than our installed renewable biomass capacity because of the current low level of regulatory support. However, the results of our biomass combustion trials give us full confidence in our technical capability to become predominantly biomass fuelled.\"</p> <p>Liberum Capital analyst Dominic Nash said: \"Drax has provided more clarity on its biomass trials and capital expenditure. This is significant in our view as it indicates that co-firing above 50% is a possibility \u2026 and could be an important value-driver later in the decade.\"</p>",

Ministers are currently reviewing the financial regime governing the use of renewables to meet the EU target for 15% of energy to come from renewable sources by 2015. Its findings are expected to be published in the spring. Green campaigners are still reeling from a decision last year by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) to slash solar power subsidies in a move that infuriated the industry, including many small businesses, some of which have gone bankrupt as a direct result of the clampdown. Although the high court has ruled the proposed cuts are illegal, because of botched consultation procedures, the government is drawing up emergency measures to cap the cost of solar panel subsidies. Analysts says Drax is in a difficult position because its future will be determined by the shape of future regulation decided in Whitehall, while at the same time the level of profit from burning coal for power generation is uncertain from 2013 with the introduction of a minimum price for carbon. But Drax says it can easily replace half its coal-fired capacity with biomass to reduce toxic emissions, if sufficient government help is forthcoming. The company revealed its financial results for the year to the end of December 2011, with underlying earnings falling 15% to \u00a3334m due largely to higher commodity prices. But pre-tax profits rose from \u00a3255m to \u00a3338m, thanks to a one-off tax credit and gains from hedging activities. The company cut the total dividend from 32p to 28p. Thompson said: \"We continue to operate at less than our installed renewable biomass capacity because of the current low level of regulatory support. However, the results of our biomass combustion trials give us full confidence in our technical capability to become predominantly biomass fuelled.\" Liberum Capital analyst Dominic Nash said: \"Drax has provided more clarity on its biomass trials and capital expenditure. This is significant in our view as it indicates that co-firing above 50% is a possibility \u2026 and could be an important value-driver later in the decade.\"",

      "bodyText": "A trolleyload of famous British food brands are heading for the check-out. Kitchen cupboard staples ranging from Hartley's jams to Paxo stuffing and Haywards pickles \u2013 together with the Saxa and Sarson's found on fish and chip shop counters across the country \u2013 are up for grabs and expected to change hands in the coming months. Pringles, the crisps sold in tubes, has just been gobbled up by Kellogg's, the US breakfast cereal group, for $2.7bn (\u00a31.7bn), while in Britain, debt-laden Premier Foods is busy offloading unwanted brands and hoping an advertising campaign featuring celebrity chef Loyd Grossman can secure its survival. Premier has put up for sale brands such as Hartley's \u2013 which has been making jams and jellies since 1871 and could go for \u00a3200m \u2013 to focus on eight \"power brands\". Sarson's, which is sloshed on to nine out of 10 portions of chips served up, is more than two centuries old and has a likely sale price of about \u00a330m. Saxa, Paxo, Bird's custard, Be-Ro flour, Smash and Sun-Pat are other brands in the Premier pantry that might also be under new management shortly. They could be the latest transactions in the food business where, according to Bloomberg, there have been 1,000 deals globally over the last five years: the biggest being the controversial takeover of Cadbury by Kraft in 2010 at a price of more than $20bn (\u00a312.6bn). Clare Thomas, head of food and drink at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, said: \"There have been lots of sectors where mergers and acquisitions have diminished during the downturn. While the value of deals has diminished, deals are still happening in food and it never really stopped. I think that will continue this year.\" Desperate to slash costs, and in some cases debt, companies want to focus on their most profitable lines. While different brands can reduce manufacturing costs, food producers get less buying power with supermarkets if they have brands in different aisles. Premier has begun a TV advertising campaign to push its chosen power brands \u2013 Ambrosia, Batchelors, Bisto, Hovis, Loyd Grossman, Mr Kipling, Oxo and Sharwood's. Those that have not made the cut are being unceremoniously sold off. Premier's vegetarian Quorn and meat-free sausage brand Cauldron went for \u00a3205m to a private equity consortium a year ago.

Funding from a group of lenders including HSBC hinges on the developer, Arab Investments, pre-letting a large chunk of the planned 63-storey building.</p> <p>Timing is crucial, said Simon Rawlinson, head of research at EC Harris. Land Securities and British Land, two of Britain's largest property developers, look to have timed the completion of their new skyscrapers right \u2013 both the Walkie Talkie and the Cheesegrater, designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly and Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners respectively, are due to open in 2014 when most City office leases expire. By contrast, the nearby <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/12/gerald-ronson-heads-queue-for-petrol-stations?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Heron Tower, which was completed last year</a>, is \"slightly early in the market and possibly a harder market sell than when you deliver in 2014/15,\" said Rawlinson.</p> <p>The advantage of office towers is that they tend to be occupied by several tenants, and are not reliant on one big pre-let. British Land has already signed up insurance broker AON for the lower floors of the Cheesegrater in Leadenhall Street. Land Securities is building the Walkie Talkie in Fenchurch Street in partnership with Canary Wharf Group, and both have strong client bases. Meanwhile, the Renzo Piano-designed Shard at London Bridge is backed by Qatari Diar, which has deep pockets.</p> <p>\"Tenants don't want to commit two or three years in advance,\" said Rawlinson. \"Developers that don't have a joint venture partner, are dependent on a pre-let or without alternative sources of funding will struggle most to get projects across the line.\"</p>",

At about the same time, work on the \u00a3800m Pinnacle tower on Bishopsgate stalled again. Funding from a group of lenders including HSBC hinges on the developer, Arab Investments, pre-letting a large chunk of the planned 63-storey building. Timing is crucial, said Simon Rawlinson, head of research at EC Harris. Land Securities and British Land, two of Britain's largest property developers, look to have timed the completion of their new skyscrapers right \u2013 both the Walkie Talkie and the Cheesegrater, designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly and Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners respectively, are due to open in 2014 when most City office leases expire. By contrast, the nearby Heron Tower, which was completed last year, is \"slightly early in the market and possibly a harder market sell than when you deliver in 2014/15,\" said Rawlinson. The advantage of office towers is that they tend to be occupied by several tenants, and are not reliant on one big pre-let. British Land has already signed up insurance broker AON for the lower floors of the Cheesegrater in Leadenhall Street. Land Securities is building the Walkie Talkie in Fenchurch Street in partnership with Canary Wharf Group, and both have strong client bases. Meanwhile, the Renzo Piano-designed Shard at London Bridge is backed by Qatari Diar, which has deep pockets. \"Tenants don't want to commit two or three years in advance,\" said Rawlinson. \"Developers that don't have a joint venture partner, are dependent on a pre-let or without alternative sources of funding will struggle most to get projects across the line.\"",

The mechanism for the contribution of profits on central bank holdings of Greek bonds is unnecessarily complicated and creates additional uncertainty and future potential disagreements. If haircuts had been imposed to private holdings of Greek bonds when debt restructuring was first discussed in 2010, the situation for Greece would undoubtedly have looked significantly better now.

The figures are the EU's baseline numbers but according to a 'strictly confidential' debt sustainability report, under a slightly more pessimistic 'tailored downside scenario' debt/GDP will only fall to 160% by 2020 and Greece would need considerably more bailout cash. Obviously other risks are that the Greek people turn against the austerity measures and that at some stage the Greek politicians decide that a default is the only option.\"</p>",
