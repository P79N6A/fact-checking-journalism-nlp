      "bodyText": "It was during a lecture about the ubiquitous Nespresso pods, which have sanitised coffee production down to a machine and a cartridge, that Andrew Stordy had his idea. While the multinational brand's website boasts of taking the mess and fuss out of traditional coffee making, he would turn that on its head, cutting out the elaborate supply chain and endeavouring to bring beans from the farmer direct to the consumer for roasting at home. The result, seven years later, is the Ikawa professional roasting machine, which can roast coffee beans using software to track temperature and times so that a consistent recipe is followed. It produces what Stordy says is a fresher cup of coffee and one that will eventually allow consumers to have a closer link with the farmers who produce the beans. Stordy's childhood was spent in coffee-producing countries such as Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Burundi, where his parents were missionaries and he saw the issues facing coffee farmers. Ikawa means coffee in Kirundi, the language of Burundi. The production of coffee can be likened to that of wine, but consumers largely identify with the brands on supermarket shelves rather than where the coffee comes from, meaning the farmers have little power and subsequently receive little of what the customer pays. Stordy says a system can be developed in which coffee consumers and farmers are linked. \"The idea for Ikawa is that if you can make it enjoyable for people to roast coffee themselves, then you can potentially supply people directly with unroasted coffee beans and that simplifies the supply chain considerably and gives you more money to pay producers more money for their coffee.\" Starting with a plan to make an all-in-one machine that could roast, grind and brew coffee \u2013 but which resulted in a drink that \"tasted awful\" \u2013 Stordy settled instead on a roasting machine and was joined by his business partner, Rombout Frieling. Over three years, they developed a tabletop machine in which unroasted green beans are put in an opening at the top and have hot air blown through them for between three and 15 minutes to roast them. The beans are separated from their skin, known as the chaff, and when fully roasted they are transferred into a glass jar ready to be ground. The exact length of time and temperature at which the beans are roasted is dictated by software that is connected to the machine via Bluetooth, which Stordy says marks it out from other home roasters. \"The flavour of the coffee is determined by the bean, a bit like wine, but also in the way the bean is processed and within coffee there is as much variation in flavour as with wine,\" he said. \"Particular beans, soil and the altitude they are grown at reflect the flavour.\" So far, 30 professional versions of the machine, priced at \u00a32,200 each, have been sold to the coffee industry, where they are used to test sample beans. Stordy says the typical hand-operated drum roasters the industry uses cannot guarantee the same result every time. Stordy's method seems, however, to have been met with scepticism among the old guard . \"Things just don't change very fast within the coffee industry,\" he said. In October, he plans to start bringing \"coffee geeks\" on board with a campaign for the second stage machine, priced at \u00a3500. He expects these home enthusiasts to develop and share their recipes using smartphone technology. The production cost of the machine will reduce with new investment the company has received and by using cheaper components. By next year, Stordy hopes to have a \u00a3350 household version of the machine ready. Owners would then buy beans from the company in packaging that carries information about the particular roasting in a barcode that the machine can read. The green beans bought directly from the farmer can last a year without losing their flavour, he says, while that of roasted beans deteriorates quickly when exposed to air, moisture or heat. With Ikawa, consumers get a fresher daily cup than they would buying coffee from a supermarket. So far, the company has been focused on the technology of the roasting machine and anticipates it being at least a year before they start selling coffee from farmers. Stordy says about 80% of the money consumers' pay for coffee at the moment goes to the retailer and roasting company. \"By selling coffee in its green form we think there are opportunities to create a greater emotional link between the consumer and farmer. This can be reinforced though information on the smartphone that is used to programme the machine with the ideal roast recipe,\" he said. \"Burundi, for example, produces some of the world's best coffees, but this is unknown as Burundi coffee is mixed together and sold at the same price on the commodity market. We intend to work with producers to separate their production into micro-lots to separate the best from the rest.\" Ikawa has so far attracted \u00a3400,000 from investors, among them Martin Rayner, one of the three brothers behind the Lakeland chain of stores, and Schluter, a coffee company that focuses on beans from African producers. The company expects to be in profit later this year. Ikawa quotes figures that indicate the whole bean coffee market in the US was worth $1bn (\u00a3593m) in 2011, a year in which 2m coffee grinders were sold. Stordy, however, shrugs off suggestions that his moves will be a significant concern to the corporate groups. \"We are creating a new experience in coffee. The reality is that it is not going to appeal to everyone. There will still be a massive market for pods [and] for roast coffee. The coffee market is so big, there is an opportunity to create a special business by creating this experience.I don't think everybody is going to be roasting coffee themselves, so I don't think it will be a major concern.\"",

This elite club has 104 members who share a fortune of more than \u00a3301bn. That figure compares with 30 \u2013 worth \u00a365bn \u2013 a decade ago, and gives Britain more billionaires per head of population than any other country in the G8, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Indian-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja top the list with a fortune of \u00a311.9bn. The London-based pair, who run the global conglomerate Hinduja Group, saw their wealth rise by \u00a31.3bn in the past year, knocking Russian business magnate Alisher Usmanov off the top after the Arsenal shareholder's fortune fell to \u00a310.6bn. Many of the list's members pay little or no income tax because they are not domiciled here. With a fortune of nearly \u00a34bn, Lady Green, wife of Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green, is one of 14 women on the list, but she lives in Monaco. Ann Gloag, who is listed along with her brother, Sir Brian Souter, as being worth \u00a31bn, is the only businesswoman on the list, with the rest either inheriting or gaining billionaire status through marriage. The super-rich want to live in Britain because of \"culture, financial services, nice tax regime, good education for their kids and a nice lifestyle where they meet their friends\", Philip Beresford, the study's author, told the BBC. London has more billionaires than any other city in the world with 72 \u2013 far ahead of its nearest rival, Moscow, which has 48. Only three of the top 20 are British, with Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, the publishers and property developers, the only self-made billionaires in this group. The richest Briton, the Duke of Westminster, is ranked 10th with a fortune of \u00a38.5bn. A decade ago, having \u00a3700m in the bank was enough to be among Britain's 50 wealthiest people, but today you need at least \u00a31.7bn. The combined wealth of the Britain's super-rich is now greater than 2008's pre-recession levels, when the total wealth of the UK's 75 billionaires was \u00a3201bn. The biggest risers are Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, members of the Tetra Pak dynasty, who saw their wealth surge from \u00a33.7bn to \u00a38.8bn. Usmanov was the biggest faller, down 20%. Among the new members of the club is West End producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, whose fortune increased by \u00a3175m to \u00a31bn, and Jon Hunt, the founder of estate agents Foxtons, who is now worth \u00a31.1bn. The wealthiest new entry is Carrie and Francois Perrodo and their family, who own the London-based Perenco oil and gas operation and are worth an esitmated \u00a36.1bn.",

      "bodyText": "MPs will this week demand that the US drugs company Pfizer guarantee British scientists' jobs for at least 10 years as its boss Ian Read flies in to face parliamentary scrutiny over his proposed \u00a360bn takeover of AstraZeneca. Andrew Miller, the Labour MP who chairs the science and technology select committee that will question Read this week, said a Pfizer promise to keep 20% of the research and development workforce in Britain for five years was not enough. \"Five years is no time in drug development,\" Miller said. \"A molecule that's discovered today will not be an active ingredient in a medicine that you or I take for a minimum of 10 years. Given the time frames of development in pharmaceuticals, we need very, very long-term commitments.\" Politicians, unions and scientists are concerned that the inevitable cost-cutting after a takeover by the New York-based company could eliminate thousands of highly skilled jobs and undermine Britain's long-term science base. Scottish-born Read is due to arrive in Britain on Monday for his first public appearance since launching the biggest takeover of a UK company by a foreign firm. He will face members of the business select committee, who are also investigating the takeover, on Tuesday and Miller's science committee on Wednesday. Read and Jonathan Emms, Pfizer's UK head, will appear with AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, and the business secretary, Vince Cable, at tomorrow's hearing. Sweden's finance minister Anders Borg spoke out against Pfizer last week, warning that the US company had not kept promises made when it bought Swedish drugmaker Pharmacia in 2002. AstraZeneca also has Swedish roots: it was formed in 1999 by the merger of Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca, which was itself created in 1993 by the break-up of Imperial Chemical Industries, for many years a company crucial to the British economy. AstraZeneca employs about 2,600 R&amp;D scientists in Britain and there are concerns that Pfizer's main motivation is to move its tax domicile to Britain, where the corporation tax rate is falling to 20% in 2015 compared with a US rate of up to 40%. Pfizer put a \u00a350 a share offer on the table on 2 May but the British company rejected it straight away. City insiders expect the American firm to make an improved offer this week, increasing the pressure on Soriot from AstraZeneca shareholders to enter takeover talks. Read, who is now a US citizen, launched a weekend charm offensive in a series of corporate videos that promised a combination of the two companies was \"a win-win for society, a win-win for shareholders and a win-win for stakeholders\". Labour has called for any deal to face a \"public interest test\" but David Cameron said on Sunday Britain must not \"pull up the drawbridge\" to foreign investors. \"Britain benefits massively from being an economy that is open to overseas investment,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. \"Companies like AstraZeneca have benefited massively from being able to go overseas and invest, and take over other businesses.\" Cameron said the \"power\" of Pfizer's commitments \u2013 which include going through with AstraZeneca's plans to build a research centre in Cambridge \u2013 should not be dismissed, even though the US firm has said its pledges to the UK government could be adjusted if circumstances change \"significantly\". \"I think the right thing to do is to engage early on, get stuck in with these companies as I've done and my team of ministers have done to make sure we get good guarantees and the best deal for Britain,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's largest independent Co-operative society, the Midcounties, is to throw its weight behind the urgent reforms of the Co-operative Group that Paul Myners has warned are needed if the 150-year-old mutual organisation is to survive. Midcounties and 20 other independent societies control 22% of the Co-op Group. Its backing for the reforms comes at the start of a crunch week, culminating on Saturday with a vote in Manchester on the Myners proposals. Lord Myners, who quit the Co-op board last month, has called for a new board made up of better qualified individuals together with a national membership council of 50 people who represent members' views, and a nominations committee to oversee board appointments. A month ago, Midcounties spoke out against the Myners proposals after an outline of the former City minister's ideas was rushed out after the sudden resignation of the Co-op chief executive Euan Sutherland. He quit after details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal were leaked to the Observer. Patrick Gray, president of the Midcounties, said the full 180-page report published by Myners last week had helped to address some of the concerns raised by his members. These included how the views of members were heard and how independent societies were represented. At the Midcounties annual general meeting over the weekend, more than 400 members voted for a four-pronged resolution that will be put forward at the Co-op meeting in Manchester, with no votes against. The resolution calls for the creation of a board of directors elected by members, a structure that gives members powers to oversee the board, a \"one member, one vote\" system and provisions to protect against demutualisation. The Midcounties support is not a sign that the Myners proposals are being endorsed in their entirety, but a sign that the independent societies are prepared to back change. The regional boards, which control 78% of the Co-op, will also need to support the plan. Gray said: \"The Co-operative Group owes Lord Myners a big debt because he has forced fundamental reform to the governance to the top of the agenda. The group now urgently needs to bring its level of debt down and to establish a streamlined, competent board which can swiftly and cohesively address the critical business issues.\" Member meetings were held across the country over the weekend, including in London where members are understood to have voted to reject the Myners report and backed a call to seek the views of the former boss of the Co-op, Sir Graham Melmoth, who retired in 2002. Myners, who chaired Guardian Media Group until he joined the Labour government during the 2008 banking crisis, has said that, without reform, banks could impose tighter lending conditions on the group or force sales of some of its most prized businesses. These include supermarkets and funeral homes, as well as pharmacies and farms, which are already on the block. Gray said that while a tight deadline was needed, consultation was necessary. \"It is also essential that the flawed constitution of the group is reformed from top to bottom and Lord Myners has provided an interesting model of how that can be done but there is no deus ex machina solution to this problem,\" Gray said. Myners said last week that all the independent societies (bar one, thought to be Midcounties) were lining up to back the resolutions at Saturday's special meeting. Ursula Lidbetter, who chairs the group's chair, is though to be confident that the resolutions will be backed, although the outcome will depend on the seven regions which control the overall majority of the votes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More homes have been built in Doncaster and Barnsley in the past five years than in Oxford and Cambridge. Surrey has more hectares devoted to golf courses than it does to housing. These two facts explain a lot about the UK property market. Put simply, it is a case of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object. The irresistible force is demand for real estate, driven by population growth, foreign cash, the sense that property is a better long-term investment than any of the alternatives, oodles of cheap money and government subsidies. The immovable object is the lack of supply: tough planning laws; the regional mismatch between homes and jobs; the reluctance of homeowners to sell or downshift. Put demand and supply together and what you get is a market hard-wired for above-inflation increases in house prices, with the inevitable tendency for bubbles to appear. Given Britain's history, it is hardly surprising that the Bank of England is on bubble alert. Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of Threadneedle Street's deputy governors, rightly pointed out this month that there have been more hard than soft landings for the housing market in the UK's recent history. Potential buyers should heed Cunliffe's warning. Britain is not yet experiencing a property bubble, but will if the Bank and the Treasury make a complete hash of things. Policymakers have started to use their powers to prevent a boom-bust. As a result, this is a temporary boomlet rather than a repeat of the booms of 1973 and 1988. In the long run, the housing market needs an increase in supply. Paul Cheshire, emeritus professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, says there has been a slowdown in the number of homes built: from 4.3m in the 1970s and 1980s to 2.7m in the two decades up to 2012. Planning restrictions have meant the price of land has gone up even faster than house prices, which is why new homes tend to be some of the smallest in Europe. Cheshire's solution is to ease green belt rules. It is a fallacy, he says, that the green belt \u2013 which covers one and a half times as much land as all the UK's towns and cities put together \u2013 is so precious that it must never be violated. \"Our towns and cities are far greener than green belts,\" Cheshire writes in the latest edition of Centrepiece magazine. \"Not only is the biggest land use within them parks and gardens, but they also provide far richer biodiversity than intensively farmed land. Just less than 10% of England is built up, but gardens cover nearly half that area. In contrast, the most important land use in greenbelts is intensive arable (74% in Cambridge), which generates negative net environmental benefits.\" Changing planning laws is one way of dealing with the imbalance of demand and supply in property. A rebalancing of the economy so the population moves to areas where there is an abundance of housing would be another. Both would take time to have any impact, however, even assuming politicians are prepared to countenance them, which is debatable. As a result, all the action in the short term involves bearing down on demand. The Bank has started to do this by obliging lenders to conduct mortgage market reviews for potential borrowers. These involve detailed questions about their future finances and assessing whether they could withstand a rate rise to 7%. The intention is clear: no more ninja (no income, job or assets) loans of the sort that caused many of the problems last time around. The second phase of the Bank's intervention in the property market is imminent. This involves lenders having enough capital set aside to withstand a 35% fall in house prices, something that has never happened, even after the wildest booms. Tougher capital rules will limit the amount of money banks can lend and squeeze demand still further. There are signs these policies are having an effect. A report by e.surv, a firm of chartered surveyors, found house sale approvals fell by 17% between January and April, the month that is traditionally the start of the buying season. The Halifax has reported falls in prices in each of the past two months. This could, of course, simply be the market pausing for breath before a further surge in activity and prices in the coming months. But as Richard Batley of Lombard Street Research points out, it all comes down to a question of affordability. If housing is affordable, demand will rise and \u2013 if supply remains constant or fails to keep up with demand \u2013 prices will rise. But houses are only affordable if one of two conditions apply: they are cheap relative to household incomes, or debt service payments are low relative to income. The first condition certainly does not apply in the UK. Over the past 50 years, the average ratio of house prices to income has been 3.4; it currently stands at 4.3. Houses are expensive and, with incomes now rising only slowly after more than half a decade of decline, are set to become more so. The second condition does apply, however. A prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates means that first time buyers have to put aside a far smaller proportion of their income to service mortgages than they normally would: 28% in the first year of a home loan against a 50-year average of 50%. As Batley notes, the housing market is benefiting from a Bank-imposed \"teaser\" rate that has enabled first-time buyers to pick up homes that would normally be out of their reach. In some areas, particularly the north, the assistance provided by the Bank has been supplemented by George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme: the Treasury's \u00a312bn subsidy to the housing market. The Bank has it in its gift to end the party any time it chooses. All it needs to do is whack up interest rates and it will be a case of job done. Mortgage service costs will rise, over-extended households will be financially clobbered, house sales will dry up and prices will fall. That's a last resort, so for now it could signal its intent by cutting the upper limit on Help to Buy from \u00a3600,000 to \u00a3300,000, still well above the level of the average transaction under the scheme. That would give the appearance of doing something without actually doing anything, leaving draconian measures for later should they be needed. But be clear. The Bank has enough weapons to rein in the property market. The issue is whether it does so the nice way or the nasty way.",
