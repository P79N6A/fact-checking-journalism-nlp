      "bodyText": "Before closing up for the day, let\u2019s take another look at European markets. Losses have escalated since the US confirmed a 25% tariff would be imposed on $50bn of Chinese imports. FTSE 100: -1.1% at 7,682 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.7% at 13,021 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,518 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1% at 22,272 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.2% at 9,837 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.7% at 390 Our full story on the US trade tariffs will be updated here: That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a great weekend and please join us again on Monday. The bell has gone on Wall Street and US markets are down: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 25,047 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,774 Nasdaq: -0.4% at 7,727 It hasn\u2019t taken Beijing long to respond to Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese imports. As expected, it plans to retaliate. China\u2019s commerce department has issued a statement: China is unwilling to have a trade war, but the Chinese side has no choice but to strongly oppose this, due to the United States\u2019 myopic behaviour that will harm both parties. We will immediately introduce tariff measures of the same scale and strength. All the results from the previously reached by the two parties will be invalid. US investors are feeling nervous after President Trump announced plans to slap a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese imports. China has promised to retaliate in equal measure, raising the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, and that is weighing on sentiment. Peter Cardillo, economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York: It has gotten investors nervous. It\u2019s going to probably mean a cautious and bumpy ride for the stock markets. US futures are all trading lower. The opening bell rings in less than 10 minutes. Speaking on Fox News, President Trump said that he regarded China\u2019s President Xi Jinping as a friend, but it was time to take action to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit. Look, he\u2019s my friend. He\u2019s a wonderful guy, he\u2019s a great guy. But at some point we have to straighten it out. President Trump has just made his way down to the Fox News base outside the White House for an unscheduled interview. Among the various subjects covered are the \u201cvery big tariffs\u201d the US will impose on $50bn of Chinese exports. Trump said: The trade war was started many years ago by them and the United States lost It\u2019s official. Donald Trump has given the green light to a 25% tariff on $50bn of goods imported from China. The tariffs will apply to a total of 1,102 products and will be divided into two parts, the White House has confirmed. The first set of tariffs will apply to $34bn of Chinese imports, on 818 product lines, effective from 6 July. The second set will apply to $16bn of imports, on 284 product lines. More soon. The government\u2019s decision to cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from \u00a3100 to \u00a32 will not take effect until 2020, it has emerged. Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour Party and shadow culture secretary, said the government was \u201cpathetic\u201d after bookmakers persuaded the government to delay the introduction of the new rules. He added: Capitulating to a two-year delay is a pathetic move from a fundamentally weak government. Those who praised the government when the announcement was made will feel badly let down. They are already rolling back on their promises and allowing these machines to ruin more lives. Gamblers stand to lose an extra \u00a34bn in the intervening period, based on the average \u00a31.8bn a year in revenues taken by the machines, which critics say are highly addictive and allow huge losses to rack up quickly. Read our full story here: Craig Erlam at currency firm Oanda, says the prospect of \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs\u201d are causing a market wobble. It\u2019s been a relatively mixed start to trading in Europe on Friday and the US is on course to post small losses at the open, as the focus shifts from central banks back to trade. US President Donald Trump is expected to announce tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports today that will once again stoke fears of a trade war and protectionist policies and likely trigger a response from the world\u2019s second largest economy. Trump has been picking fights with a number of countries on trade in an attempt to address the large deficit the US runs and China is clearly his primary target. Markets will always be vulnerable to trade spats between countries and while the response to the G7 meeting may have been quite muted, that is more likely a sign that such an outcome was in line with expectations than markets becoming less sensitive to it. The biggest concern here is naturally that this will continue to escalate and more and more counter-tariffs will be imposed, something that will harm all economies and weigh on investor sentiment. Investors across Europe are feeling less chirpy as they await confirmation of Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports. France is bucking the trend: FTSE 100: -0.8% at 7,707 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 13,098 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 5,541 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 22,249 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.1% at 9,844 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 392 Eurozone inflation jumped to 1.9% in May from 1.3% in April, Eurostat confirmed in its final estimate. The figures appear to add weight to the ECB\u2019s latest inflation forecasts, which were revised up on Thursday, to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019, from 1.4% previously. Here is how May annual inflation rates compare across the EU: China\u2019s foreign ministry has said this morning that Beijing will respond swiftly to any US tariffs, as Donald Trump prepares to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods. The euro is heading for its biggest weekly loss in 19 months after Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said there would be no rate hike in the eurozone until after the summer of 2019. The currency is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.1591, but on track for the worst week since November 2016. McDonald\u2019s is the latest company to ditch plastic straws, with plans to them with the paper version in all its UK and Ireland restaurants from September. The fast food giant currently uses 1.8 million straws a day in the UK, and said it was responding to what customers wanted by moving away from the single-use plastic straw. Companies are under mounting pressure to find alternatives to single use plastic products that are polluting the oceans and harming wildlife. Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK and Ireland, said: Reflecting the broader public debate, our customers told us they wanted to see a move on straws but to do so without compromising their overall experience when visiting our restaurants. Over the past few months we\u2019ve been working closely with supplier partners to find a solution that works both for our customers, and that the supply is there given the size of our business. The government\u2019s ambitious plans, combined with strong customer opinion, has helped to accelerate the move away from plastic and I\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve been able to play our part in helping to achieve this societal change. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Tesco had managed to shrug off the malaise facing the wider retail sector: Tesco had a confident start to the year, despite the Beast from the East, and maintained its sales momentum into a tenth consecutive quarter. The recently acquired Booker business flaunted a sparking performance in the first few months of the year, and is already looking like a nice little growth engine for Tesco. Booker is now benefiting from the Tesco distribution network, a good example of how [chief executive] Dave Lewis intends to wring \u00a3200 million of annual synergies out of combining the two businesses. Tesco is one of the FTSE 100\u2019s top performer this morning, at a near four-year high of 255p. Tesco shares are up 2% this morning at a near four-year high of 255p. Investors have been cheered by the news that sales at the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket rose for a 10th consecutive quarter in the 13 weeks to 26 May (Tesco\u2019s first quarter). Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 1.8%, as trading improved after the snow disruption of the beginning of the period. Tesco completed the \u00a34bn takeover of Booker, the UK\u2019s largest wholesaler, in March. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, gave his assessment: Our growth plans are on track and we are pleased with the momentum in the business. We remain well-placed to serve our customers better and deliver on our medium-term financial ambitions. We are delighted with initial progress on Booker, and are focused on delivering the synergy benefits that our merger brings. Trading is underway in Europe and it\u2019s a mixed picture so far. Markets were boosted on Thursday by the European Central Bank\u2019s revelation that it would phase out its bond-buying programme by the end of this year. Investors continue to digest the move - which came earlier than expected - this morning. As it stands, European shares are on course for their best week in more than three months. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,771 Germany\u2019s DAX: 0.3% at 13,142 France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% at 5,551 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 22,416 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,936 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 394 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The prospect of a trade world between the world\u2019s two largest economies is back in the spotlight as Donald Trump is expected to say today that he will press ahead with tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports. Trump gave the green light at a meeting of his top trade advisors on Thursday. Reuters reports: Trump is due to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday. The list will contain 800 product categories, down from 1,300 previously. Trump no longer believes that Beijing\u2019s influence over North Korea is a compelling reason to ease up on trade talks now that his administration has opened up a direct line of communication with the nuclear-armed country, [an] administration official said. Beijing has reiterated that it will respond \u201cappropriately\u201d to any measures imposed by the US. Also coming up Tesco has reported a 1oth consecutive quarter of rising sales, despite snow disruption at the beginning of the period and a gloomy consumer backdrop. More on that soon.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Govia Thameslink Railway has quit over the rail timetable fiasco, after being singled out for blame by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. Network Rail executives have also forfeited annual bonuses for their role in the timetable chaos. Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR, which includes Thameslink, Great Northern, Southern and Gatwick Express, said he recognised passengers\u2019 huge frustration, after weeks of cancellations and severe delays to services following the introduction of new timetables on 20 May. Horton, who has overseen a tumultuous few years on Britain\u2019s biggest commuter franchise, including years of strikes on Southern in the row over the future of guards, will remain in post for a short period until a temporary timetable to ease the present disruption is announced in July. GTR\u2019s owners, the Go-Ahead group, said a successor would be announced in due course. David Brown, group chief executive of Go-Ahead, said: \u201cI would like to thank Charles for his hard work with Govia for the past 15 years. Under often challenging conditions, he has built a team to deliver the largest railway change programme for decades, on a franchise that is not only the UK\u2019s biggest, but which has also the highest passenger growth. \u201cWe are committed to working with the Department for Transport and Network Rail to address recent problems and to deliver a reliable, punctual service for passengers.\u201d Horton said: \u201cI recognise that passengers have been hugely frustrated at the significant disruption caused by the introduction of new timetables. It is the right time to hand leadership of GTR to a new pair of hands. \u201cI am immensely proud of my team and I would like to thank my 7,000 colleagues at GTR for all their hard work over the past four years.\u201d Meanwhile, the chief executive and chief financial officer of Network Rail have volunteered to forego bonuses of \u00a374,000 and \u00a338,000 respectively this year. Its chairman, Sir Peter Hendy, confirmed that Mark Carne and Jeremy Westlake both wrote to him on Thursday stating they would not accept any bonus for the last year, in which delays in engineering works and confirming timetables were a large contributory factor to rail chaos, particularly for passengers on Northern. Carne, who is the highest paid public sector official in Britain with a \u00a3750,000 annual salary, was made a CBE last week, ahead of his retirement later this year. Horton is due to appear with Network Rail representatives and others at a Commons transport select committee hearing on Monday to answer questions about GTR\u2019s role in the timetable meltdown, which saw more than 8,000 trains cancelled in the first three weeks since the change on GTR, and 5,000-6,000 on Northern. Although blame has been shared by Network Rail, and many in the industry have questioned the actions of the Department for Transport, Grayling claimed Horton had assured him the timetable change would work in a meeting shortly before it was implemented. Emily Yates, of the Association of British Commuters, said Horton\u2019s resignation was overdue, given years of trouble on Southern before the current crisis: \u201cHe should have been sacked a long time ago \u2013 along with the transport secretary.\u201d The RMT union welcomed the resignation. The general secretary, Mick Cash said: \u201cFor well over two years now RMT members fighting to defend safety and access have been subjected to abuse and hostility under the regime led by Charles Horton. \u201cThe Horton resignation opens the door for this sorry chapter to be brought to a close and that means sweeping GTR away and returning the services to public ownership with safety, access and quality the guiding priorities.\u201d",

The decision by the US fast-food chain to switch from plastic to paper straws follows a trial at a number of outlets in the past two months. The firm uses around 1.8m straws a day in the UK. The switch will affect McDonald\u2019s 1,361 outlets in the UK, but not the rest of its 36,000 restaurants worldwide. The Sum of Us petition calling for the change had warned that plastic straws ended up polluting the ocean, harming seabirds and marine life. McDonald\u2019s said it had listened to customer concerns and would begin phasing out plastic straws in September, completing the process at some point in 2019. Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK and Ireland, said: \u201cReflecting the broader public debate, our customers told us they wanted to see a move on straws but to do so without compromising their overall experience when visiting our restaurants.\u201d The paper straws will be sourced from suppliers in Northern Ireland and Wales. Initially, only a limited number of the chain\u2019s restaurants will have recycling facilities for the paper straws, but the company has committed to ensuring they can be recycled at all stores by the end of 2019. The government warned earlier this year that plastic straws, along with other single-use plastic items such as cotton buds, could be banned as part of its efforts to cut marine pollution. McDonald\u2019s is the latest in a string of high street names in the process of replacing plastic straws with paper or biodegradable straws, including Costa Coffee, Wetherspoons and Pizza Express. Waitrose has said it would no longer stock them, while Pimms and other drinks at Wimbledon will be served with paper rather than plastic straws. Other parts of McDonald\u2019s global empire are experimenting with alternatives to plastic straws, and trials are due later this year in the US, France, Sweden and Norway.",

      "bodyText": "EDF Energy has agreed to pay out \u00a3350,000 for failing to fit enough smart meters in customers\u2019 houses, the first time an energy supplier has been penalised for missing domestic smart meter targets. Every large energy supplier has an annual target for rolling out smart meters, which provide consumers with real-time electricity usage data and automate readings, with a government goal of all households being offered one by the end of 2020. Having missed its target last year, EDF Energy agreed with the energy regulator, Ofgem, to pay \u00a3350,000 for consumer redress. The French state-owned company said it was disappointed it missed the target but had since caught up and was on track to hit this year\u2019s target. Jim Poole, the director of customer operations, said: \u201cDuring 2017 we doubled our smart meter installation rates and employed more people to install smart meters.\u201d No further action will be taken against EDF Energy, though Ofgem said it was \u201cclosely monitoring suppliers\u2019 approach to the roll-out of smart meters and will hold suppliers to account if they do not meet their obligations\u201d. Just over 11m smart meters have been installed in homes so far. The consumer group Which? has calculated that installers will need to fit 24 meters a minute, 24 hours a day, every day, to meet the 2020 goal. However, the head of the smart meter campaign recently insisted that progress was \u201cgetting back on track\u201d. The exact number of meters EDF had to install was not released because it was considered commercially confidential. The company has installed at least 600,000 so far. The majority of meters installed to date have been first-generation ones, known as SMETS1, which have been criticised for deterring customers from switching suppliers. In most cases, when a household with a SMETS1 meter switches supplier the meter loses its smart functionality. A software fix is due in October to make the meters work across suppliers, but some experts have raised doubts whether this will be the case. Around 1,000 next-generation, inter-operable meters, known as SMETS2, have been fitted.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has recorded its strongest growth in seven years, boosted by its acquisition of the Booker cash and carry group. The supermarket said UK and Irish sales rose 3.5% in the most recent three months, its 10th consecutive quarter of growth. Group sales \u2013 which include Asia eastern Europe \u2013 climbed 1.8%. Sales at Booker, which were included in the group for the first time this quarter, jumped 14.3% as it won new clients but growth at the main Tesco chain slipped back to 2.1% from 2.4% in the previous quarter. The company\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, said food price inflation had dropped and the company had also been affected by bad weather. The supermarket was forced to close all its stores in Ireland for a day during the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d storm in early March. Lewis said food price inflation had dropped to 1.8%-2.4% from more than 3% late last year. Tesco has cut prices on fresh food lines as it continues to try to fight off competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Lewis said the grocer had cut prices by 6%-7% over the past three years, helping it add \u00a3300m of sales in the UK, well ahead of its competitors. \u201cOur growth plan is on the track we set for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are beginning to realise the growth potential of the merger [with Booker].\u201d Tesco has begun selling 30 of Booker\u2019s best selling items in 50 of its stores and is testing a professional caterer\u2019s section, Chef Central, in two outlets. Booker is also benefiting from using space in some Tesco warehouses, helping it deliver food to clients more quickly in some areas. Lewis said the food market was proving more resilient than other retail sectors where he noted that \u201cbusiness failures this year have been unprecedented\u201d. He partly blamed the government\u2019s failure to change the business rates regime, which is weighted towards high street businesses. \u201cThree years ago I gave a speech at the CBI where I did say that the approach on business rates, minimum wage and the apprenticeship levy was potentially a lethal cocktail \u2026 three years on we start to see the impact of that,\u201d he said.",
