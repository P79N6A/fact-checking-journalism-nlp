      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s leading economic thinktanks has slashed its forecasts for 2018 following evidence that growth almost came to a halt in the first three months of the year. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it expected expansion of 1.4% in 2018 \u2013 down from the 1.9% it had been predicting three months ago \u2013 and anticipated that interest rates would not rise until August at the earliest. The NIESR economist Amit Kara said the \u201csignificant\u201d downward revision was the result of official figures showing the economy grew by only 0.1% in the first three months of the year \u2013 well below the 0.5% the thinktank had been forecasting. \u201cIt is not clear if this is just a soft patch or the start of a prolonged period of weakness\u201d Kara said, although he added that NIESR believed growth would pick up to average around 0.4% in each of the next three quarters. With the latest snapshot of the UK service sector pointing to only a modest recovery in April from the weather-related dip in activity in March, NIESR predicted the Bank of England would delay the next rise in interest rates until August and then only move if the economy was growing at 0.4%-0.5% a quarter. Services firms reported the third lowest level of business activity since the EU referendum in 2016 to defy City economists, who expected a stronger recovery from the cold weather in March. Firms that sell services to consumers were the worst affected, notably hotels and restaurants. The strongest expansion was in financial services. The balance of responses from firms across the sector left the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/IHS Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) at 53.2, up from 51.9 in March, but much lower than the 54.2 in February. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cServices growth accelerated but, after March\u2019s low, was the second-weakest for over one and a half years. \u201cThe weak services data follows news that manufacturing lost further momentum in April, with output rising at the second-slowest rate for just over a year. The brightest news came from the construction sector, which saw the largest monthly output rise since November, albeit after an especially sharp decline in March.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth, a senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the weakness of the rebound in April would \u201cdo little to assuage fears that the economy has suffered a loss of underlying momentum and makes the chances of a rate hike next week extremely slim\u201d. Threadneedle Street policymakers are scheduled to meet on 10 May to judge the state of the economy and decide whether to increase interest rates for only the second time since the 2008 financial crash. Several members of the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee indicated in the early part of the year that they were ready to increase the cost of borrowing and several mortgage lenders raised the cost of their two-year fixed rates loans in response. However, the likelihood of a rise has receded after a series of weak economic indicators, forcing lenders to revise their outlook. IHS Markit PMI, which covers about 40% of the services sector and excludes high street shops, found the rate of employment growth, sales and investment was hit by uncertainty about the economic outlook as well as sluggish domestic demand from among consumers. It said optimism about the next 12 months had increased, though. \u201cThe balance of companies expecting a rise in business activity over the year ahead reached its highest level since January. This was attributed to forthcoming product launches, new marketing plans and discounting strategies,\u201d it said. NIESR predicted the UK\u2019s growth rate would recover to 1.7% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020, provided the eventual Brexit deal guaranteed a high level of access for goods and services exports to the EU.",

      "bodyText": "More than 1,500 jobs are at risk after Virgin Media announced plans to shut a Swansea call centre, and as the company behind the fashion brands Jacques Vert and Windsmoor teeters on the edge of collapse. More than 1,000 jobs are on the line at Calvetron. Administrators are expected to be formally appointed at the parent group, Calvetron Style Holdings, on Friday for what will be the second time in a year. Virgin Media confirmed it was cutting jobs as part of a shake-up that will involve the closure of its call centre in Swansea and another site in Nottingham over the next two years. The Swansea centre employs 792 staff. Some roles are being switched to Manchester. The telecoms company said the decision was part of a \u00a340m plan to create \u201cfewer, higher-quality workplaces.\u201d Virgin Media, which has 14,000 employees across more than 100 sites, is reducing the number of customer operations centres from eight to four, creating larger regional hubs in Wythenshawe in Greater Manchester, Bellshill near Glasgow, Gateshead, Teesside and Reading. The Swansea West MP, Geraint Davies, described the job cuts as a \u201ccatastrophe for our city\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m stunned by the Virgin job losses, which is a traumatic shock for every family concerned and a body blow for Swansea,\u201d he said. Carolyn Harris, the Swansea East MP, said Virgin Media handled the situation very badly and had \u201cquestions to answer\u201d about the job losses. Virgin Media\u2019s chief executive, Tom Mockridge, said: \u201cWe have proposed the closure of a small number of our offices over the next two years, including our call centre in Swansea and our current site in Nottingham. \u201cThese changes will help deliver a more agile, digitally oriented experience, which our customers increasingly expect as standard.\u201d Last summer, Calvetron was restructured in a rescue deal that resulted in several hundred job losses. It was acquired by a group of retail investors, which at the time included the businessmen Sandeep Vyas and Haseeb Aziz. The business secured a \u00a312.5m loan from Secure Trust Bank to fund its turnaround. But since then, fashion retailers have faced an extremely tough market. The weather \u2013 an unusually warm autumn last year and miserable spring this year \u2013 has combined with the squeeze on consumers, the rising cost of labour and imported goods, a continuing switch to online shopping, and a trend for shoppers to spend more on leisure than fashion, to create the harsh retail environment. Store closures are planned at New Look and Carpetright, while Toys R Us and Maplin have collapsed. Mothercare and Homebase are also expected to close stores as they struggle to find new funding. Calvetron\u2019s problems have been magnified by difficulties at Debenhams and House of Fraser, two of its biggest retail partners. On Wednesday, House of Fraser said store closures were coming as part of a restructuring deal that will give control of the retail chain to the Chinese owner of Hamleys. Hundreds of jobs are expected to go. At the time of the 2017 rescue, Calvetron had more than 1,200 UK staff working in shops in department stores, and another 400 overseas in countries including Belgium and Canada. Calvetron was not available to comment. \u2022This article was amended on 6 May 2018. An earlier version incorrectly stated Harold Tillman was one of the business\u2019s owners. His only role was to provide strategic advice following last year sale.",

Wednesday\u2019s 36% shareholder rebellion against a pay policy that could hand bigger bonuses to the chief executive, Paul Polman, and his senior colleagues was an embarrassment for a firm that likes to think of itself as being on the side of the angels in governance matters. Unilever got the simple majority it required but the main course \u2013 the autumn vote on the proposal to become a purely Dutch company \u2013 is when the fun begins. Polman &amp; co need 75% of the plc shareholders, owners of one end of the currently Anglo-Dutch company, to sanction a switch to a single HQ in Rotterdam and a single class of share that would have its main listing in Amsterdam. Some UK fund managers hate the idea. The main problem is that Unilever shares, as things stand, would disappear from the FTSE 100 index \u2013 indeed, all FTSE indices. That would make it would it impossible for some funds, notably UK tracker funds and those with strict UK investment mandates, to own Unilever stock. A secondary listing in London, Unilever\u2019s peace offering, is not useful if FTSE inclusion is not part of the package. Fund managers fear they will be forced to ditch their holdings at depressed prices. Unilever hasn\u2019t helped itself with its sniffy attitude. Columbia Threadneedle, which complained in March about a \u201clack of engagement with shareholders\u201d, is the only public objector so far but other members of London\u2019s big long-only club are privately seething. If The Investor Forum, the new lobbying collective, has not already taken up the cause, it should to do so. This is exactly the type of situation it was created to address. Tracker fund managers, at the very least, should be up in arms. Their job is to protect the interests of end-investors and being a semi-forced seller of a top-10 FTSE 100 company would be a terrible outcome. There are signs Unilever\u2019s board realises the vote may not be the walkover it assumed. The chairman, Marijn Dekkers, told Wednesday\u2019s meeting the company is talking to the FTSE index-compilers \u201cto see if there is a possibility of inclusion\u201d. If the FTSE rules of qualification cannot be twisted to include a Dutch-incorporated company, however, Unilever needs to think again. Whatever its true reasons for choosing the Netherlands (purely commercial and nothing to do with Brexit or takeover threats, it says), the plan can\u2019t happen if 25% of plc shareholders vote no. On pay, that level was surpassed, even though greedier bonus schemes from other FTSE 100 firms have encountered less resistance. The looming poll on relocation may partly explain what happened. Maybe the 36% revolt was a warning shot. Unilever has seriously annoyed a lot of people. Give us a Gloo \u201cI would like to thank CEO Rebecca Miskin and her management team for their tireless efforts to identify and capture growth assets for Gloo,\u201d says Arnaud de Puyfontaine, chairman of an Aim-listed startup that raised \u00a330m in 2015 to hunt for digital media \u201ctransformation\u201d opportunities but found nothing worth transforming. Shareholders invested at 120p and are told to expect 47p-ish as the firm is liquidated. In the circumstances, it should be Miskin expressing thanks. She\u2019s been paid an annual salary of \u00a3235,000 for three years, so the fruitless search hasn\u2019t been entirely worthless from her point of view. Indeed, she got a bonus of \u00a3106,000 on top last year and \u00a3122,000 the year before. Colleague Bill Davis, who joined in July 2016, did better: a salary of \u00a3320,000 plus a \u00a3474,000 bonus last year. Bonuses for what? No acquisitions were made and Gloo\u2019s revenues were precisely zero. Richard Bernstein from activist fund Crystal Amber thinks the bonus criteria must have been \u201cbreathing in and breathing out.\u201d Fair comment. Gloo\u2019s recruits may have been high-flyers taking a career risk to join a startup but a performance-related bonus for trying hard but getting nowhere is nonsense. IT headache pesters Pester Another reason why the TSB chief executive, Paul Pester, may have been so tetchy at the Treasury select committee is that his bank probably expected to collect a decent slug of the money in the so-called \u201cAlternative Remedies Package\u201d fund. This is the cash that Royal Bank of Scotland had to cough up in place of spinning off 300 branches. Some \u00a3775m is earmarked to boost competition in the small business banking market. TSB will still apply for funds, the chairman, Richard Meddings, said and, given the thinness of the field, it will probably still get something.

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser\u2019s rescue restructuring faces a significant hurdle after it emerged that the department store chain may have to fund a multimillion-pound injection into its pension scheme. The ailing retailer could be required to set aside a significant sum in order to secure the support of the pension protection fund (PPF), an industry-backed body that bails out troubled schemes. The department store has approached the PPF as it plans to close stores and cut rents via a company voluntary arrangement process, a form of insolvency that must be approved by creditors. Without the support of the PPF the CVA may fail. Industry experts suggested House of Fraser will have to consider closing at least 20 sites under the CVA to ensure a viable future. C.banner, the Chinese firm that bought a 51% stake in House of Fraser\u2019s parent company this week, has pledged to buy further shares for nearly \u00a370m, some of which will help support a turnaround plan. It is thought the PPF may ask that some of these new funds are diverted to the pension scheme. The department store runs two defined benefit schemes that together are in a surplus by just under \u00a3100m on an accounting basis in the latest calculation in March this year. However, the insolvency process automatically triggers the involvement of the PPF. It will be counted as a creditor in the CVA process, partly because House of Fraser\u2019s pension schemes are understood to be tens of millions of pounds in deficit on a buyout basis, a more stringent analysis that considers the cost of passing on the liabilities to an insurance firm. John Ralfe, an independent pensions expert, said the schemes were likely to be significantly in deficit. \u201cSorting out House of Fraser\u2019s two pension schemes \u2013 with total liabilities of more than \u00a3600m in March 2018 \u2013 makes a CVA more difficult,\u201d he said. The PPF forced Toys R Us, the collapsed toy retailer, to pledge \u00a39m in additional funding to support its scheme before agreeing to back a CVA in December last year. It does not always demand cash, however. The PPF backed the recent CVA by Carpetright after being satisfied that the company\u2019s existing plan to tackle the \u00a38.5m deficit over a number of years was sufficient. The PPF said it would not comment on the circumstances of \u201congoing companies.\u201d House of Fraser is also in talks with the Pensions Regulator over the impact of the C.Banner deal on its schemes. A spokesperson for the watchdog, which can demand that companies take action to protect pensions, said: \u201cWe are in discussions with the company and the trustee of the pension scheme and will continue to monitor the situation. We will not comment further unless it becomes appropriate to do so.\u201d The C.banner buyout involves the acquisition of shares in House of Fraser\u2019s parent company from Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, which will retain a minority stake.",

      "bodyText": "With Wall Street still suffering on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the US and China, European markets have ended the day lower. Talks between Chinese and US representatives began in the first of two days of meetings, but both sides have been lowering expectations that there will be a positive outcome. So investors have been shying away from shares, with the final scores in Europe showing: The FTSE 100 finished down 40.51 points or 0.54% at 7502.69 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 12,690.15 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.5% lower at 5501.66 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.83% to 24,064.46 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.5% lower at 10,038.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.18% to 839.34 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 280 points or 1.17%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. On the market fall, Joshua Mahony at IG says: Global stocks are on the slide in the wake of a weak US open today, with trade fears and a strengthening dollar weighing on sentiment. ...Continued fears over the pathway of trade negotiations with China are sure to be playing into investor fears, and it is certainly a worry that we are seeing such unconvincing trade in the US despite a largely encouraging earnings season. [President] Trump will be boosted by the new of a massive narrowing of the US trade deficit, with the President likely to go reinvigorated into negotiations with the likes of China. With the head of the Brazilian steel association admitting that the industry will simply have to go along with US quotas, the bigger hurdles of China and the EU represent significantly bigger hurdles to overcome for Mr Trump. With US exports now standing at the highest level since records began, there is no doubt that the US economic picture is improving and that is being reflected in a stronger dollar. The latest US monthly jobs figures are out on Friday, and there could be a recovery from the weak (103,000) number seen in March: Markets continue to suffer on worries about the potential for a trade war between the US and China. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Despite a lack of news surrounding the ongoing takes between the US and China, the various aggressions reported last night \u2013 including news that China has stopped by soybeans from the US, with the latter potentially set to impose restrictions on certain Chinese telecommunication companies selling equipment in America \u2013 have reignited fears of a trade war. It\u2019s clear that investors aren\u2019t confident about the outcome of the day\u2019s delegation get-together. The Dow Jones plunged more than 250 points after the bell, diving below 23700 for the first time in a month. Granted the Dow is also dealing with a fairly hawkish Fed statement from Wednesday night, one that kept up the dollar\u2019s hopes of 3 (or even 4) more rate hikes in 2018. With little else to go on, the European indices took their cue from the US losses. The CAC slipped 0.3%, while the DAX dropped 0.6%, the latter abandoning the 12800, 3 month highs struck on Wednesday. As for the FTSE, the UK index shed 50 points, shying away from 7550 to return to 7500 for the umpteenth time this week. Two surveys of the US service sector have come to different conclusions about the state of this part of the economy. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI dropped from 58.8 in March to 56.8 in April, below expectations of a level of 58.1. The employment index dropped from 56.6 to 53.6, the lowest since April last year. But earlier the Markit service sector PMI rose from 54 in March to 54.6 in April, slightly better than the initial reading of 54.4. Even so, any reading over 50 shows expansion so these figures are unlikely to alter the future course of US interest rates. China can withstand a trade war longer than the US, says Wendy Cutler, Asia Society Policy Institute vice president and former acting deputy U.S. trade representative. She was speaking to CNBC: Worries about trade tensions as the US and Chinese delegations meet in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs have seen US markets open lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 170 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.29% and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.51%. Among the fallers is Tesla, down 7.5% after the bizarre post-results analysts call held by Elon Musk. Could Donald Trump\u2019s actions on trade and tariffs see a repeat of the 1930s slump? A group of experts certainty think it could happen: Over a thousand economists have written to Donald Trump warning his \u201ceconomic protectionism\u201d and tough rhetoric on trade threatens to repeat the mistakes the US made in the 1930s, mistakes that plunged the world into the Great Depression. The 1,414 economists, including 14 Nobel prize winners, sent the letter on Thursday amid an escalating row over trade between the US and the European Union. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports but has granted temporary reprieves to the EU, Australia and other countries. \u201cIn 1930, 1,028 economists urged Congress to reject the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,\u201d the authors write, citing a trade act that many economists argue was one of the triggers for the Great Depression. \u201cToday, Americans face a host of new protectionist activity, including threats to withdraw from trade agreements, misguided calls for new tariffs in response to trade imbalances, and the imposition of tariffs on washing machines, solar components, and even steel and aluminum used by US manufacturers. \u201cCongress did not take economists\u2019 advice in 1930, and Americans across the country paid the price. The undersigned economists and teachers of economics strongly urge you not to repeat that mistake. Much has changed since 1930 \u2013 for example, trade is now significantly more important to our economy \u2013 but the fundamental economic principles as explained at the time have not.\u201d The full story is here: With immaculate timing, as the US and Chinese delegations meet, the Commerce Department has released the latest international trade figures. Overall the trade gap narrowed in March from $57.7bn in the previous month to $48.9bn. This was better than the expected deficit of $50bn, helped by exports increasing to a record high following a surge in deliveries of commercial aircraft and, yes, soybeans. As for the deficit with China, the March figure fell from $29.26bn to $25.88bn. BUT: the year to date figure for the trade gap with China is up sharply, from $78.8bn to $91bn. By sending so many senior officials to China, the Trump administration may actually have lowered the chances of a breakthrough. That\u2019s because the delegation don\u2019t really agree with each other about trade, making it harder to reach an agreement with Beijing. For example, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has blamed \u2018evil practices\u2019 by China for the trade gap with America, and vocally backed Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. But Larry Kudlow, the newish head of Trump\u2019s economic council, has previously warned that tariffs are effectively tax rises and will hurt US companies (this was before he joined the White House). Such differences of opinion won\u2019t make negotiations with China run any smooth. As Maggie Gage, head of Washington Research at Credit Suisse, put it on Bloomberg TV: One of the key hurdles that will determine success versus non-success at these talks is whether the US team can all stay on message together. Today\u2019s trade talks come a month after the US and China both ratcheted up the tensions, by imposing tariffs on $50bn of each other\u2019s goods. The White House announced a list of 1,333 Chinese imports to be subject to punitive tariffs of 25%; China retaliated with a list of 100+ American products, including soya beans, cars and aircraft. So what is America looking to achieve at today\u2019s talks? On the trade gap, the Trump administration want China to reduce its trade surplus with the US by around $100bn (it\u2019s $375bn today). Unless US consumers start consuming less, that means opening up more Chinese markets to American imports. On intellectual property, the US Trade Representative\u2019s Office claims that American firms are forced to hand over key technology secrets in return for access to Chinese markets -- something Beijing denies. There\u2019s also the currency issue - Donald Trump\u2019s bugbear that Beijing has been unfairly weakening the yuan to help Chinese firm sell goods abroad. So far, America has resisted labelling China a \u2018currency manipulator\u2019 (something which would trigger fresh measures). But it\u2019s on the table, if negotiations get nowhere.... The EC has predicted that Britain and Italy will share the wooden spoon in the 2018 growth race, while Ireland will power ahead: Bonus mark to anyone who spots the mistake with the Irish flag..... Rather awkwardly for our purposes, there appears to be a news blackout on the US-China trade talks! Bloomberg says: China\u2019s largest news outlets have been ordered to refrain from reporting any material beyond official press releases related to trade talks in Beijing with the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. The Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department has told news websites to strictly use statements released by the official Xinhua News Agency, without any extra interpretation, according to the people, who asked not to be named as they\u2019re not authorized to speak on the matter. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswomen Hua Chunying says Beijing hopes to make progress with America - but only if there is mutual respect. Hua told reporters that: \u201cThe outcome should be mutually beneficial and win-win.\u201d The official Xinhua news agency, usually a good gauge of the Chinese government\u2019s views, has also taken a firm line by warning that China could cope with a trade war. In an editorial, it says: \u201cChina will inevitably suffer losses, but China has the political advantage of a centralised and unified leadership and support of a massive domestic market.\u201d A former trade advisor to president Obama has warned that Trump\u2019s delegation probably won\u2019t come back from Beijing with a big deal. Michael Camunez, CEO of consultancy Monarch Global Strategies, says (via CNN): \u201cI don\u2019t expect any grand bargains being struck....There is no clear strategy that can be discerned.\u201d The European Commission has fired a warning towards the US government not to plunge the world into a trade war. In its latest economic assessment, just released, the EC warns that there are \u201cincreased risks on the horizon\u201d. It singles out the threat of trade protectionism, calling it an \u201cunambiguously negative risk\u201d to the global economic outlook Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, warns that a trade war could derail Europe\u2019s recovery: Europe continues to enjoy robust growth, which has helped drive unemployment to a ten-year low. Investment is rising and public finances are improving, with the deficit in the euro area set to drop to just 0.7% of GDP this year. The biggest risk to this rosy outlook is protectionism, which must not become the new normal: that would only hurt those of our citizens we most need to protect.\u201d Newsflash: inflation across the eurozone has fallen unexpectedly. The consumer prices index rose by just 1.2% in the year to April, down from 1.3% a month earlier. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, slid to just 0.7% from 1%. It\u2019s welcome news for households, but a real headache for the European Central Bank as it ponders whether to extend its bond-buying stimulus programme beyond September. Back in the UK, we have fresh evidence that the economy has lost momentum. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly measure of service sector activity has risen, to 52.8 in April from March\u2019s 51.7. Although that shows faster growth, it\u2019s still one of the weakest readings in the last two years. It appears that sales, investment and hiring have all been hit by economic uncertainty (Brexit and trade war fears could both be blamed). Global stock markets are subdued as investors watch for developments in Beijing. The main European indices are almost all in the red, after a cautious session in Asia which saw Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng shed 1.3%. Traders are concerned that a breakdown in negotiations between the US and China could further inflame the situation, potentially leading to further retaliatory action. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy &amp; Market Research at FXTM, explains: The trade talks carry the potential to negatively impact global stocks as a result of reduced risk appetite, and could also result in reduced purchasing momentum for emerging market currencies. China appears to have raised the stakes ahead of these trade talks, by stopping buying US soybeans. That news could send a shiver through America\u2019s agriculture industry, as it has been the biggest supplier of soybeans to the Chinese market. Bloomberg has the details: The world\u2019s biggest oilseed processor just confirmed one of the soybean market\u2019s biggest fears: China has essentially stopped buying U.S. supplies amid the brewing trade war. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re buying is non-U.S.,\u201d Bunge Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder said in a telephone interview Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019re buying beans in Canada, in Brazil, mostly Brazil, but very deliberately not buying anything from the U.S.\u201d In a move that caught many in U.S. agriculture by surprise, China last month announced planned tariffs on American shipments of soybeans. As the market waited for the measure to take effect, there was some hope among traders and shippers alike that relations between the nations could ease in the meantime and the trade flow would continue. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, at least for now, according to Bunge. China is \u201cbraced for surprises\u201d at today\u2019s trade talks, says the Financial Times, especially as Donald Trump has sent seven top officials along. The FT has also picked up on Beijing\u2019s refusal to be forced into concessions: For senior Chinese officials and their policy advisers, the arrival of what they see as a large and unwieldy US delegation is just the latest twist in three months\u2019 of diplomatic exchanges that they have found to be both confusing and insulting. They are also bracing themselves for surprises from Mr Trump, who has previously issued threatening tweets and statements in the midst of delicate Sino-US negotiations. Last month, after the world\u2019s two largest economies threatened to impose punitive tariffs on $50bn worth of each other\u2019s exports, Mr Trump said he would consider targeting an additional $100bn worth of Chinese exports to the US. The Chinese then closed ranks, saying they would not negotiate in the face of such threats. \u201cChina\u2019s bottom line is that the US will not get anything through blackmail,\u201d said L\u00fc Xiang, an American affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \u201cChina is waiting to see what [requests] the US will put on the table. But if they pull out a gun and point it at us, then they can finish their tea and leave.\u201d America is likely to air a series of complaints over China\u2019s trade practices today, including allegations of intellectual property theft and unfair state subsidies Reuters explains: A breakthrough deal to fundamentally change China\u2019s economic policies is viewed as highly unlikely during the two-day visit, though a package of short-term Chinese measures could delay a U.S. decision to impose tariffs on around $50 billion worth of Chinese exports. The discussions, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, are expected to cover a wide range of U.S. complaints about China\u2019s trade practices, from allegations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin was in a cheerful mood, telling Reuters he was \u201cThrilled to be here. Thank you,\u201d as he arrived at his hotel in Beijing. And we\u2019re off.... Financial markets around the globe will be watching the trade talks in Beijing closely, says Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor: It\u2019s trade rather than interest rates or valuations that are troubling markets right now. US officials have flown into Beijing to try and deescalate a trade spat with China, but these talks won\u2019t be easy. This is the issue that markets are super sensitive about currently, and which was responsible in part for the first-quarter crash, so it\u2019s unsurprising to see investors take some money off the table.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After months of threats and tit-for-tat tariffs, America and China are actually going to sit down and talk about trade. A delegation of top US officials has landed in Beijing today for two days of negotiations. The group includes Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, economic advisor Larry Kudlow and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. They\u2019ll face off against senior Chinese officials, led by vice-premier Liu He. The hope is that the two sides can calm the recent tensions that have already seen steep tariffs slapped on each other\u2019s exports, in what could prove to be the opening shots in a damaging trade war. President Donald Trump has already raised the stakes, by tweeting that America is pushing for a \u2018level playing field\u2019. However, a breakthrough is far from guaranteed, with China already hinting that it won\u2019t be bullied by America. Our correspondent in Beijing, Lily Kuo, explains: The China Daily said China will \u201cstand up to the US\u201d if necessary while Global Times says it hopes the two sides can begin resolving trade disputes. So, it could be a lively couple of days. Also coming up today: On the economics front, a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s service sector may show that activity accelerated in April after a weak March. A weak reading, though, would put the final nail in the coffin of an interest rate rise next week. New inflation data from the eurozone will feed into the debate on whether the European Central Bank should rein in its stimulus programme. Plus, there\u2019s new jobs, trade and service sector data from America. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK service sector PMI report for April 10am BST: Eurozone CPI inflation figures for April 1.30pm BST: US trade gap figures for March 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless claims figures 3pm: US service sector PMI, and factory orders",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesla shares have fallen more than 7% after the firm posted a record $710m loss and its founder, Elon Musk, dismissed Wall St analysts for asking \u201cboring bonehead\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d questions about the company\u2019s financial health. The California-based company burned through more than $745m in cash as it again missed production targets for its Model 3, which it has billed as its first affordable electric car. Musk appeared to make light of the losses, tweeting \u201cla la la\u201d while linking to media reports of the results for the first three months of the year, and his behaviour during a bizarre results call with analysts prompted investors to turn away from Tesla. The share price dropped 5% on Wednesday and slid further on Thursday, wiping more than $3.4bn off the value of the company. During the call, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said Tesla was \u201cbest in class\u201d, only for Musk to correct him, saying the firm was simply the best. \u201cThe best in a class of one,\u201d he said. After half an hour of questioning on the company\u2019s prospects for the rest of the year and efforts to increase production at Tesla\u2019s Freemont factory, Musk appeared to lose patience. \u201cNext, next. Boring bonehead questions are not cool. Next,\u201d he said, cutting off one questioner. He was then asked what percentage of customers had chosen to personally configure their Model 3, an indicator of potential future revenues because the car\u2019s $35,000 (\u00a327,800) starting price can rise to $50,000 with options. Instead of answering, Musk said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to YouTube. Sorry, these questions are so dry, they\u2019re killing me.\u201d He then answered numerous questions from the YouTube channel HyperChange, whose host said he was shocked to get on the call. Musk proceeded to take questions from the YouTuber on Tesla\u2019s ride-sharing platform, self-driving cars and charging network. Losses deepened from $675m for the final quarter of 2017 to $710m in the first quarter of this year, but the company brought in more revenue than expected. Revenue grew by 26% from a year ago to a record $3.4bn, up on analysts\u2019 estimate of $3.28bn. Tesla has, however, had production problems with the Model 3 and rlast month briefly shut its Freemont plant. It produced 9,766 vehicles during the quarter, missing its target of 10,000. More than 2,000 were made each week in April, however, and the company insisted it was on track to hit its target of 5,000 a week by the end of June. Musk said: \u201cOur focus is on the Model 3. We need to get that to above 5,000 a week at a good margin. We need to become a profitable company.\u201d Tesla said it was likely to be profitable in the third quarter of 2018 as the assembly lines increase production.",

The merger of the UK\u2019s second- and third-largest supermarket chains could hand them control of about 30% of the grocery sales, a similar level to Tesco, meaning two businesses would account for 60% of the market in future. \u201cThe cost savings being promised through this merger must not come through squeezing those further down the supply chain,\u201d warned Conservative MP Neil Parish, chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee. Parish said such power could mean that suppliers were more reluctant to raise complaints about fair practices for fear of losing a big chunk of business that could not easily be replaced. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the business energy and industrial strategy committee, also called on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to look at how suppliers would be affected. \u201cThis merger threatens customer choice, hands yet more power to mighty supermarket players and heaps more pressure on small and medium suppliers. The CMA needs to be a champion of consumers and it must look closely at the impact of this merger on the supply chain as well as the effect on competition in the supermarket sector.\u201d MPs wrote the letter after questioning the farming minister, George Eustice, and the grocery code adjudicator Christine Tacon, who regulates supermarkets\u2019 relationships with direct suppliers, in parliament on Wednesday. Tacon made clear her remit did not cover the prices agreed between supermarkets and their suppliers, but only ensured that they kept to their contracts. The regulator added that she was only responsible for direct suppliers, meaning that she does not deal with many farmers and other small food producers who provide their goods to supermarkets via wholesalers or processors. Parish suggested in the meeting that the government was \u201cnot concerned at all by the scale of these two major retailers that will be totally dominant in the market place\u201d, and suggested \u201cTesco and Sainsbury\u2019s might decide to get together as the government didn\u2019t turn a hair [in relation to Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s]\u201d. Eustice said it was up to the CMA to \u201cmethodically\u201d examine the implications of the merger for consumers and the wider market and take any action necessary. He added that it was \u201copen to the CMA to consider the impact on the market as well\u201d. The CMA has already said it is likely to review Sainsbury\u2019s deal with Asda but declined to comment in advance of an inquiry opening. In the next few weeks it is expected to announce whether it will carry out a broad brush \u201cphase 1\u201d review which would last up to 40 days or go straight to a more detail \u201cphase 2\u201d, in which it will examine competition concerns at a local level around the UK and taking up to 24 weeks.",

In the next few weeks it is expected to announce whether it will carry out a broad brush \u201cphase 1\u201d review which would last up to 40 days or go straight to a more detail \u201cphase 2\u201d, in which it will examine competition concerns at a local level around the UK and taking up to 24 weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s services sector struggled to bounce back in April from the big freeze in March that brought the economy to a grinding halt, increasing the likelihood of the Bank of England holding interest rates at 0.5% next week. Services firms reported the third lowest level of business activity since the EU referendum in 2016 to defy City economists, who expected a stronger recovery from the cold weather in March. Firms that sell services to consumers were the worst affected, notably hotels and restaurants. The strongest expansion was in financial services. The balance of responses from firms across the sector left the Markit IHS purchasing managers index (PMI) at 53.2, up from 51.9 in March, but much lower than the 54.2 in February. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cServices growth accelerated but, after March\u2019s low, was the second-weakest for over one-and-a-half years.\u201d He added: \u201cThe weak services data follows news that manufacturing lost further momentum in April, with output rising at the second-slowest rate for just over a year. The brightest news came from the construction sector, which saw the largest monthly output rise since November, albeit after an especially sharp decline in March.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth, a senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the weakness of the rebound in April would \u201cdo little to assuage fears that the economy has suffered a loss of underlying momentum and makes the chances of a rate hike next week extremely slim\u201d. Threadneedle Street policymakers meet on 10 May to judge the state of the economy and decide whether to increase interest rates for only the second time since the 2008 financial crash. Several members of the central bank\u2019s rate setting committee indicated in the early part of the year that they were ready to increase the cost of borrowing and several mortgage lenders raised the cost of their two-year fixed rates loans in response. However, the likelihood of a rise has receded following a series of weak economic indicators, forcing lenders to revise their outlook. IHS Markit PMI, which covers around 40% of the services sector and excludes high street shops, found that the rate of employment growth, sales and investment were hit by uncertainty about the economic outlook as well as sluggish domestic demand from among consumers. However, it said optimism about the next 12 months had increased. \u201cThe balance of companies expecting a rise in business activity over the year ahead reached its highest level since January. This was attributed to forthcoming product launches, new marketing plans and discounting strategies,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "Global demand for gold dropped between January and March, posting its weakest first quarter since the 2008 financial crisis, as the economic outlook improved while wild swings on world stock markets drove the price higher. Demand for gold fell 7% on a year ago to 973.5 tonnes, according to the World Gold Council, which represents producers. It blamed the fall on a 15% slump in investment in gold bars to 254.9 tonnes as investors in China, Germany and the US held off from buying the precious metal. Only 32.4 tonnes of the precious metal flowed into gold-backed exchange-traded funds in the first quarter, a 66% fall on a year ago. Overall, gold investment fell 27%, cancelling out central bank purchases of gold and the increased use of the precious metal in smartphones and car electronics. John Mulligan, the head of member and market relations at the World Gold Council, said investors \u201chaven\u2019t seen a trigger to buy into the market\u201d. There was a strong demand for gold in the first quarter of 2017 as investors responded to heightened political uncertainty but at the start of this year gold traded in a range of $1,300 to $1,350 an ounce as investors lacked a clear signal and were in \u201cwait and see mode\u201d. The spot gold price rose to $1,323 at the end of March compared with $1,291 at the end of December and $1,244 at the end of March 2017. Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, pointed to relatively solid global economic growth and rising interest rates. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven investment in times of turmoil. The improving economic outlook contrasted with a sharp spike in stock market volatility. The Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high on 26 January, the last day of the Davos meeting of world leaders, but fears of higher interest rates and trade wars prompted a big sell-off on global stock markets in February, which in turn drove up gold prices. Markets are expecting two to three rate rises in the US this year. The global demand for jewellery was flat at 487.7 tonnes between January and March. In China, consumers bought more gold jewellery during the new year celebrations and the improving US economy led to more Americans splashing out on jewellery. However, in India rising gold prices, exacerbated by a weakening rupee, led to a 12% decline in jewellery purchases. In addition, there were only seven auspicious wedding days in the first quarter of this year, compared with 22 a year earlier. Central banks were strong buyers of gold. They added 116.5 tonnes of gold to their reserves, up 42% from a year earlier, led by Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan. It was the highest first-quarter total for four years. More than 82 tonnes of gold went into technology such as smartphones, games consoles and cars, up 4%. Gold is used in bonding wire in memory chips and complex sensors for smartphone features such as 3D video, virtual reality and iris and gesture recognition, as well as in gaming consoles. Such sensors are also becoming more important in cars as safety features such as collision avoidance systems. Another boost is expected from 5G network upgrades under way in the telecommunications industry: Verizon plans to roll out 5G to five cities in the US this year, and China, Japan, Taiwan and south Korea have similar plans.",

      "bodyText": "Every year the budget brings with it talk of middle Australia and a great deal of concern about those on middle incomes. The release last week of the annual taxation statistics serves as a reminder that not only do we need to watch the use of average versus median, but that both median and average incomes vary greatly depending on whether you are talking about men or women. Language is a tricky thing, and when you add data into the mix you end up with a situation where not only can the devil cite scripture for his purpose, he can also use data to support it. We see this often with the use of average and middle Australia. Politics love to talk about the need to help average income earners, or middle Australia \u2013 but those two groups are very different. The average Australian income is actually earned by much less than 50% of Australians. The average taxable income in 2015-16 of 10.15 million Australians was $74,322. But had you earned that amount, you would have actually earned more than two thirds of all Australians. The median taxable income in 2015-16 was just $55,540 \u2013 well within the $37,000 to $87,000 tax bracket. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday But at issue is not just the difference between average and median but between genders. The median taxable income earned by men in 2015-16 was $63,430, whereas for women it was just $48,690: Were you on that overall average taxable income of $74,322, you would not only be earning more than 62% of men, you would be on an income greater than 77% of all women. And just 40% of women earned more than the overall \u201cmedian income\u201d of $55,400: It means that even when politicians, journalists and commentators talk of \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d and use median rather than average income, they are still talking about a minority of women. The over-arching reason is that women are more likely to work part-time and also in less senior roles. We know from the monthly labour force data that, while 18% of men work part-time, a whopping 46% of women do. But yesterday\u2019s release of the latest Australian jobs report by the Department of Jobs shows that women not only are more likely in any occupation to be working part-time but that those occupations that have higher levels of part-time work are also more likely to employ women: Working fewer hours \u2013 even if it is at a high hourly rate \u2013 means you are less able to earn a higher annual income. This flows through into the taxation statistics which show that in 2015-16 there were more men in every income range over $49,000, while below that level, there were more women: Of the top 10% of income earners in 2015-16, just 25% were women, whereas women account for 56% of people in the bottom 10%. The situation has improved slightly this century \u2013 in 1999-00, women accounted for just 21.7% of the richest 10% of income earners: And the tax statistics show that this is common across all occupations. Women make up 48% of all income earners but just 25% of those in the top tax bracket and only 32% of those in the $80,000 to $180,000 bracket: And this imbalance occurs even in those occupations where there is an equal or greater number of women. Consider that just over half of the 155,086 accountants in 2015-16 were women, and yet they are underrepresented in the two top tax brackets, and overrepresented in the bottom three: Or to put it another way, 53% of the nearly 73,000 male accountants are in the top two tax brackets but just 34% of the 82,000 women accounts are similarly placed: In my own profession of journalism a similar situation occurs. Women make up 55% of all journalists but only 26% of those the top tax bracket, and 65% of those earning less than $18,200: Women journalists are similarly much more likely to earn less than $80,000 than are their male counterparts: And the share of journalists earning the top income who are women is actually declining. In 2014-15 women journalists accounted for 32.2% of those earning in the top tax bracket: This situation is spread from the top income occupations to the lower ones. Surgeons rank only behind anaesthetists in terms of median income, but while 71% of male surgeons were in the top tax bracket, just 49% of women were: Just 69% of all bank workers are women, and yet they make up less than a quarter of all bank workers in the top tax bracket, and just half of those are earning $80,000 to $180,000: For sale assistants \u2013 of which 69% are women \u2013 the likelihood is also that women will be among the lower income earners. Just 29% of women sales assistants earn above $37,000, compared with 37% of men: The debate over income equality is often in terms of hourly wage rates \u2013 where those who claim there is little cause for concern argue two people doing the same job, such as bank workers or sales assistants, with similar levels of experience and qualifications, will likely be earning a similar hourly rate. But when we look at annual incomes it is clear that the real issue is hours worked and level of seniority. Men and women may be on similar hourly wage rates for similar work but women clearly are less likely to be in positions with higher rates of pay and where they are working full-time. And this also means that when politicians talk of middle and average income earning Australians, they are actually talking about most men but only a minority of women. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The release last week of the annual taxation statistics serves as a reminder that not only do we need to watch the use of average versus median, but that both median and average incomes vary greatly depending on whether you are talking about men or women.</p> <p>Language is a tricky thing, and when you add data into the mix you end up with a situation where not only can the devil cite scripture for his purpose, he can also use data to support it. </p> <p>We see this often with the use of average and middle Australia. Politics love to talk about the need to help average income earners, or middle Australia \u2013 but those two groups are very different. </p> <p>The average Australian income is actually earned by much less than 50% of Australians.
