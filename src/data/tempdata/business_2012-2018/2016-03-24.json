The top end of the range would be a 4.5% increase, which is hardly catastrophic. Why did the market react so violently? Probably four reasons.

Premier passions Mr Kipling has made his shareholders exceedingly angry. The problem is not that Premier Foods, owner of Kipling, Oxo, Ambrosia and other fine British staples, has brushed off a 60p-per-share offer from McCormick of the US. That price may look rich compared to Tuesday\u2019s level of 32p but even Standard Life agrees it\u2019s not enough. Rather, the source of the aggro is Premier\u2019s side-action with Nissin, a Japanese noodle-maker. The two companies agreed a purely commercial \u201cco-operation agreement\u201d on Wednesday but that has been followed by Nissin buying a 17.3% stake in Premier from private equity outfit Warburg Pincus at 63p. Not fair, say Standard Life and Paulson &amp; Co, owners of 7% apiece of Premier: we\u2019d like to see McCormick\u2019s best offer and Nissin\u2019s arrival on the shareholder register could be unhelpful. Cue expressions of \u201cdismay\u201d and \u201cconcern\u201d, City code for seriously peeved. Has David Beever, Premier\u2019s chairman, done anything wrong, though? Strictly speaking, no. Premier can\u2019t be expected to put its business on hold while it waits to see if McCormick, owner of Schwartz spices, comes back with a proper takeover offer. And if Nissin wants to buy Warburg Pincus\u2019 stake, that\u2019s its look-out. As it happens, McCormick says it is still interested. Beever should give thanks and do as Standard Life and Paulson command and start \u201cengaging\u201d. Premier is much improved since its brush with death a few years ago but it still has \u00a3600m of debt and a \u00a3350m deficit in its pension fund. If McCormick is willing to make a decent offer \u2013 and, crucially, give the pension fund stronger backing \u2013 a board is duty-bound to take a serious look.

VW has issued the alert after internal checks found a fastener in the pedal system could become loose. The company is recalling 391,000 of its Volkswagen Touareg sports utility vehicles (SUV) and 409,477 Porsche Cayennes, which is also an SUV. This includes 14,600 Porsches in the UK, although the number of Cayennes has not been confirmed. The fault involves cars made between 2011 and 2016. The company has said it will contact customers affected by the problem, which can be fixed in less than half an hour. \u201cThis is a purely precautionary measure, as there have been no reports of accidents or injuries as a result of this concern,\u201d Porsche, which is controlled by VW, said in a statement. VW is still struggling to recover from the diesel emissions scandal that has affected sales and already cost the company billions of euros. The carmaker has admitted installing defeat devices in 11m vehicles to cheat diesel emissions tests. As a result, it faces the prospect of having to pay out fines and compensation to customers. VW has set aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a35.2bn) to cover the costs of the scandal. However, VW has warned this might not be enough and has delayed the publication of its annual results in order to establish the impact of the affair. VW is scheduled to release its annual report on April 28. US courts have given the company another month to present detailed plans about how to fix 584,000 American cars involved in the scandal. The company had initially been set a deadline of Thursday to develop a solution that was technologically feasible and acceptable to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, the senior US district court judge Charles Breyer has now extended that to 21 April, after VW updated the court on its plans. \u201cI would hope by the 21st that as many outstanding issues as possible will be wrapped up,\u201d he said in San Francisco. The defeat devices allowed VW\u2019s vehicles to limit the amount of nitrogen oxide they emitted in laboratory tests. However, once the car was on the open road it emitted up to 40 times the legal limit. The fix that VW is working on is designed to bring down the emissions to legal limits without the defeat device. The US Department of Justice is suing VW over the scandal, claiming it caused harmful air pollution and violated clean air laws. In a statement, VW said: \u201cVolkswagen is committed to resolving the US regulatory investigation into the diesel emissions matter as quickly as possible and to implementing a solution for affected vehicles, as we work to earn back the trust of our customers and dealers and the public. We continue to make progress and are co-operating fully.\u201d If VW cannot reach an agreement with regulators about a fix for the vehicles then it could be forced to buy them back from customers.",

      "bodyText": "A row has erupted during a takeover bid for Premier Foods \u2013 the company behind brands including Mr Kipling, Batchelors and Ambrosia \u2013 after two of its biggest shareholders criticised the way Premier was handling the bid approach. Standard Life, which owns 7% of Premier, urged the company to engage in talks with its suitor McCormick \u2013 a US company known for Schwartz dried spices and sauces \u2013 after it rejected its advances. Paulson &amp; Co, which owns more than 7%, also wants Premier to talk to McCormick, and other possible bidders. Edinburgh-based Standard also questioned the timing of an announcement that Nissin, which invented instant noodles in 1958 and operates in 19 countries, had taken a 17.3% stake in Premier after buying the shares owned by the US private equity firm Warburg Pincus. That holding makes Nissin \u2013 whose products include Cup Noodles, Soba and Top Ramen \u2013 Premier\u2019s biggest shareholder . The stake was purchasedjust a day after Premier announced it had won the rights to distribute Nissin products in the UK. The stake also gives Nissin an influence in the takeover approach from McCormick, which has made two offers for Premier \u2013 the first at 52p a share in cash in mid-February, which was raised to 60p on 14 March. The details of the bid only emerged on Wednesday in a stock market announcement by Premier, which pushed its shares by more than 70% to 53.75p at the close that day. The shares were up 1% on Thursday after a series of updates to investors. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, said: \u201cWe note with some dismay the timing of Nissin\u2019s acquisition of a stake in Premier Foods. In our view, this does not reflect well on the Premier Foods board\u2019s objectivity and commitment regarding its engagement with McCormick and consequently its desire to pursue maximum value for shareholders. \u201cAlthough we believe the 60p bid indicated by McCormick is too low, we remain open to a bid at a higher level. We expect the Premier Foods board, on behalf of its shareholders, to engage with McCormick and pursue this option to the full.\u201d McCormick said it was \u201cdisappointed that the board of Premier Foods is conducting itself in a way that denies Premier Foods\u2019 shareholders the opportunity to consider McCormick\u2019s highly attractive cash offer\u201d. \u201cDespite McCormick\u2019s efforts to enter into a meaningful dialogue with Premier Foods on several occasions, the board of Premier Foods has been unwilling to engage constructively with McCormick,\u201d it said. \u201cMcCormick notes recent media comments and wishes to clarify that there has only been one face-to-face meeting with Premier Foods\u2019 chairman, David Beever on 12 February 2016.\u201d Premier later clarified its position to insist that would give \u201ccareful consideration\u201d to any offer which it felt better valued its prospects.",

Paulson &amp; Co, which owns more than 7%, also wants Premier to talk to McCormick, and other possible bidders.</p> <p>Edinburgh-based Standard also questioned the timing of an announcement that Nissin, which invented instant noodles in 1958 and operates in 19 countries, had taken <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/premier-foods-plc--pfd-/rns/announcement-re-nissin-foods-holdings/201603240801401534T/\">a 17.3% stake</a> in Premier after buying the shares owned by the US private equity firm Warburg Pincus.</p> <p>That holding makes Nissin \u2013 whose products include Cup Noodles, Soba and Top Ramen \u2013 Premier\u2019s biggest shareholder .

In our view, this does not reflect well on the Premier Foods board\u2019s objectivity and commitment regarding its engagement with McCormick and consequently its desire to pursue maximum value for shareholders.</p> <p> \u201cAlthough we believe the 60p bid indicated by McCormick is too low, we remain open to a bid at a higher level.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Next has sent shockwaves though the high street, wiping more than \u00a33bn off the market value of the country\u2019s biggest clothing retailers after he predicted the toughest trading conditions since the financial crisis. Reporting the firm\u2019s annual results, Next boss Simon Wolfson said he expected to see a \u201cconsumer slowdown\u201d this year as recent economic data \u201chad been pretty much downhill\u201d. There was also evidence, he said, that Britons were choosing to spend spare cash on eating out and holidays rather than a new wardrobe. \u201cThe year ahead may well be the toughest we have faced since 2008,\u201d said Wolfson, who cut Next\u2019s sales forecast for the coming year. \u201cIt may well feel like walking up the down escalator, with a great deal of effort required to stand still. If we are going into a downturn the companies that prepare for it and manage in a realistic way are most likely to weather the storm best.\u201d Investors were alarmed by the tone of Wolfson\u2019s comments as the Conservative peer is regarded as a sage on the economy. He insisted the gloomy forecast was not linked to concerns about upheaval should the UK vote to quit the EU. He has previously indicated that he is in favour of Brexit but declined to comment further saying only it would \u201ctake a while for the consequences [of the vote] to filter through.\u201d Wolfson\u2019s comments sent Next\u2019s shares tumbling and they closed the day down 15% at \u00a356.55, wiping \u00a31.5bn off its stock market value and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 Index. His prognosis also weighed on Primark owner Associated British Foods and Marks &amp; Spencer with the shares of both companies marked down by around 5%. But analysts said Next, which had a disappointing Christmas sales period, could not hide behind the economy as behind the scenes it is grappling with the waning star of its directory catalogue business which delivered 50% of its \u00a3821.3m pre-tax profits in the year to January. The division has chalked up sales growth of more than 75% over the last five years but is stuttering as high street rivals such as Marks &amp; Spencer catch up online and the appeal of its buy now pay later accounts diminishes. Next\u2019s shares had quadrupled in the five years to early December but have now lost almost 30% of their value. The retailer suffered disappointing sales over Christmas due to warm weather but also because a lack of stock and greater competition for online sales. In the past Wolfson has struck a cautious tone before going on to deliver a stellar figures but he insisted: \u201cWe are not trying to play games with investors and the outside world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re explaining how we see the world.\u201d The company pointed to data showing real earnings growth slowing sharply since September and output across services, manufacturing and construction also weakening. His concerns were also supported by official figures which showed clothing and shoe shop sales slumped 3.4% in February, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline and the longest run of falling sales since1991. Wolfson admitted its catalogue arm had not moved with the times, having only recently launched a mobile site. After initial problems the revamped website of arch rival M&amp;S began seeing strong growth last autumn. Directory\u2019s performance has also been hit by more shoppers choosing to pay up front for goods rather than sign up to Next\u2019s lucrative credit service. Credit customers declined 4% last year despite a 2% cut to the interest rate. This year it will embark on a major marketing push and offer new services such as two-hour delivery slots. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong Bank, said: \u201cNext has been pushing the directory very hard over the past couple of years to compensate for the weakening of the credit business that has formed the basis for growth post 2010. Today sees the first real sign of unwinding of that strategy as management acknowledges that the model needs a fairly major rebuild.\u201d Shiret said overhauling the directory could take a long time and Next could find itself playing catch-up for a while. Underlying pretax profit for the year to the end of January rose 5% to \u00a3821.3m as full-price Next branded clothing sales increased 3.9%. The company predicted sales of full-price items could fall by 1% or, at best, rise by 4% this year with a mid-point of 1.5%. The forecast is a sharp reduction from January, when Next said it expected sales to rise by between 1% and 6%. Next also guided analysts down on expectations for annual profit. It said pre-tax profit could fall 4.5% to \u00a3784m with the best estimate a 4.5% rise to \u00a3858m.",

    "webTitle": "Markets hit by stronger US dollar and gloom from Next - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the detail of the rig count: The fall in oil rigs to 372 is the lowest level since 2009, while the overall count of 464 for oil and natural gas rigs together dropped for the 14th week in a row to the lowest since at least 1940, according to Reuters. But analysts expect the rig count to bottom out in a few months and then recover later in the year. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back after the Easter break. Oil prices have pared their losses after the latest US rig count showed a fall last week. The number of oil rigs dropped by 15 to 372, after a rise of 1 the previous week. Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $40.14 a barrel having earlier fallen as low as $39.22. It was a downbeat end to the shortened trading week for investors. The main damage was done by commodity companies, with metal prices hit by the stronger dollar (up on the back of hawkish comments on interest hikes by various US Federal Reserve members) and oil lower after US stocks rose on Thursday. In the UK, the FTSE 100 was also hit by the disappointing outlook statement from Next, which lost 15% of its value and helped send fellow clothing retailers Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark-owner Associated British Foods lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 1.49% or 92.63 points at 6106.48 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.71% to 9851.35 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.13% lower at 4329.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.61% to 18,165.84 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.54% lower at 8789.8 But in Greece, the Athens market ended up 1.04% at 557.04 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 80 points or 0.47% lower. As markets remain in negative territory heading towards the close, next week could see further falls, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: The shortened week is ending on a downbeat note, as markets look to register their first serious losses since mid-February. Even now, the move lower doesn\u2019t really put much of a dent in a remarkable rally off the lows of last month, but if US dollar strength and oil weakness continues, the final week of March could see the downside case accelerate. So far this week markets have been unable to make upward progress, and with Fed commentary becoming progressively more hawkish the coming slew of US data, including the vital non-farm payrolls report, could be the factor that determines whether the rally blossoms into April or withers on the vine The traditional \u2018stronger dollar, weaker commodities\u2019 trade is back in action in London today, plus a downgrade of the overall sector by Goldman Sachs is doing little for bullish sentiment. Any rally in miners in April is contingent on Chinese stimulus remaining a valid narrative, and right now the market doesn\u2019t believe that will be the case. The pound has steadied, after its earlier falls on growing fears about the repercussions if Britain votes to leave the EU in June\u2019s referendum. It fell to its weakest level for two years on a trade weighted basis, but has recovered to trade at $1.4145 and 78.87p a euro, marginally up on the day. The recovery has been helped by the 11% lead for the Remain camp in the latest Brexit poll, as well as the weak US figures denting talk of an imminent rate rise and putting pressure on the dollar. Here\u2019s more on the poor US durable goods figures: Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After impressive results in January, US durable goods orders have slumped, reflecting a manufacturing sector still in recovery. Fed Chair Janet Yellen wouldn\u2019t have been expecting another large gain by the sector, but the fall of nearly three per cent will be of a concern to some observers. Many will see today\u2019s results as just a small bump in the road to recovery, and with retail sales and inflation data coming in better than expected this month, they may well be right. Over on Wall Street, shares are down in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 82 points to 17,420. More gloomy news. America\u2019s service sector companies are suffering from the weakest growth in new orders since the depths of the financial crisis. Data firm Markit reports that activity across the sector has only risen slightly this month, after being hit by bad weather in February. Firms also reported that new orders almost stalled, which is the weakest reading since October 2009. They blamed the \u201cless favourable economic backdrop\u201d, which made some clients too nervous to launch new projects. The overall Service sector PMI crept up to 51.0 in March, up from 49.7 in February, which suggests modest growth this month. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u201cThe US economy is going through its worst growth spell for three and a half years. \u201cThe lack of a strong rebound in service sector activity in March is a big disappointment, as bad weather had been blamed for part of the weakness in the first two months of the year. \u201cCombined with the lacklustre performance seen in manufacturing, the subdued services survey points to the weakest quarterly expansion of the economy since the third quarter of 2012. The PMI surveys suggest the economy grew at a worryingly meagre 0.7% annualised rate in the first quarter. Williamson also fears that \u201cworst may be to come\u201d.... City traders have a new Brexit poll to digest, showing that the campaign to stay in the European Union has a smaller lead. According to Survation, the Remain side have 46% support, with Leave on 35%, and 19% of the population still making up their mind. That 11% gap is smaller than last month, as the WSJ\u2019s Mike Bird points out: Wall Street is expected to follow Europe and Asia lower, when trading begins in a few minutes: The European stock selloff is accelerating, sending the FTSE 100 down 106 points or 1.7% to 6092. Only a handful of share are up in London, while the mining sector continues to lead the market down. And retailer Next is on track for its biggest one-day loss in 17 years, after warning about tough conditions this morning. A flurry of US economic data is heading our way. First up, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen by 6,000, to 265,000. That\u2019s a slightly smaller drop than expected, and the 55th week in a row that it\u2019s been below the 300,000 mark. Separately, orders for durable goods at US factories have fallen by 2.8% in February. January\u2019s data has been revised down too, from a 4.7% increase to 4.2%. It\u2019s the third fall in four months, suggesting American manufacturers are experiencing softer demand. The CBI business group has issued its own healthcheck on the UK retail sector, and it\u2019s gloomier than the Office for National Statistics\u2019s report [see here]. According to the CBI, 31% of retailers reported rising sales this month, while 24% said they were down. That gives a net balance of +7, down from +10 in February and 16% in January. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics says it\u2019s a concern: European stock markets are stumbling towards the Easter long weekend. All the main bourses are in the red, with the FTSE 100 shedding 85 points or 1.4% to 6114 points. In London, Next has plunged by 12% after warning that 2016 will be a hard year. It is followed by a string of mining companies, suffering from weakening commodity prices as the US dollar rises. Investor are worried that a new bout of turbulence could be approaching, as we enter the second quarter of the financial year next week. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, chief global economist at stock brokers Charles Stanley, says \u201cThe sense of crisis has dissipated but has not completely evaporated\u201d. In a new report, he cautions: Despite the apparently benign outlook for the global economy, risks to that view remain notably elevated. Many (including Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Societe General amongst them) are all urging investors to lock in recent gains. The cost of protecting against a plunge in the value of the pound has hit new six-year highs this morning, as Brexit fears continue to stalk the City. Reuters has snapped the details: THREE-MONTH STERLING/DOLLAR IMPLIED VOLATILITY HITS 15 PERCENT FOR FIRST TIME IN ALMOST SIX YEARS THREE-MONTH EURO/STERLING IMPLIED VOLATILITY ALSO HITS SEVEN-YEAR HIGH OF 13.8 PERCENT UK chancellor George Osborne is testifying to the Treasury committee right now, about last week\u2019s budget (and the political fallout it has triggered, I suspect). It\u2019s being streamed live here Our Politics Live blog is covering it: A majority of Britain\u2019s bankers believe they\u2019d be better off if Britain stays in the European Union. That\u2019s according to the latest survey from the British Bankers\u2019 Association, which includes all the major banks. It found that: 60% of BBA members predict Brexit would have a \u201cnegative impact\u201d 26% believe the impact would be \u201csignificant\u201d BBA chief executive Anthony Browne said the surveys disproved suggestions that the City could welcome a victory for the Leave campaign. \u201cOur survey shows there is almost no appetite from banks for the UK to leave the EU... However, as the majority of our members have not expressed a position on the matter of UK membership, the BBA will adopt a neutral position in the referendum debate.\u201d The latest UK retail sales figure are out....and they show that demand for new clothes has taken a dive. Spending on textiles, clothes and footwear fell by 2.8% year-on-year in February, with consumers buying 2.4% less stuff than before (because of price deflation). This was the only sub-sector not to achieve higher spending year-on-year, the Office for National Statistics says. Britain\u2019s clothing stores appear to have endured an unlucky run of weather. It was unusually warm in the run-up to Christmas, cutting demand for winter coats. And the wet weather in early 2016 hasn\u2019t helped, as consumers have been put off from buying spring clothes. According to the ONS, clothing sales are down 3.4% in the last three months - the biggest quarterly fall since December 1990. This rather backs up Next\u2019s warning about how tough this year will be. Overall retail sales spending fell by 0.7% in February, a smaller drop than expected after the January sales surge. On an annual basis, total retail spending was 1.4% higher than a year ago. The European Central Bank has warned that the global economic recovery has weakened, meaning 2016 will be challenging - particularly in emerging markets. In its latest economic bulletin the ECB says: Global activity moderated at the turn of the year, and is expected to continue expanding at a modest pace. Low interest rates, improving labour markets and rising confidence support the outlook for advanced economies. By contrast, the medium-term outlook for emerging market economies remains more uncertain. Economic activity in China is expected to continue decelerating, with negative spillovers to other emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, while commodity exporting countries need to adjust further to lower commodity prices. The ECB also points out that global trade seems to have \u201clost momentum again\u201d at the turn of the year \u2013 a worrying sign. Earnings growth in the eurozone is another concern: The full report is online here The pound is coming under fresh pressure this morning. Sterling has dropped to a 15-month low against the euro, down 0.3% to \u20ac1.2584. That means one euro is worth 79.40p. Next\u2019s warning may have heightened concerns over the UK economy, especially with the uncertainty of the EU referendum ahead. Brexit fears have already driven traders to protect themselves against a sterling crisis, as this chart shows: UK engineering firm Renishaw has also disappointed the City this morning by slashing its profit forecasts. Renishaw, which specialises in precision engineering for jet engines, wind turbines and medical equipment, warned that it has suffered a fall in orders from Asian customers. It says: Revenue last year benefited from a number of large orders in the Far East which have not been repeated to the same extent this year, and we have now received information that indicates we are unlikely to achieve the trading levels previously anticipated at the time of our half year results announcement in January 2016. That has heightened concerns over the global economy, and sent Renishaw\u2019s shares sliding 12%. After a delayed start, shares in Next have plunged by over 10% after the retailer warned that trading conditions are the toughest he\u2019s seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In a strikingly gloomy statement, chairman Lord Wolfson told shareholders that the coming year \u201cmay well be the toughest we have faced since 2008\u201d. He cautioned: It looks as though we may be set for a challenging year, with economic and cyclical factors potentially working against us. It may well feel like walking up the down escalator, with a great deal of effort required to stand still. Next also cut its sales forecasts, warning that they could fall by 1% at worst, or grow by 4% at best. That\u2019s a sharp downgrade on its last statement, in January, when it predicted sales growth of between 1% and 6%. That has sent investors racing to sell Next shares, sending them tumbling by 690p to \u00a359.90p. European stock markets are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 60 points, dragged down by mining stocks. Glencore, Anglo American and Rio Tinto are all being thumped by the impact of the higher US dollar on their profitability, given the slump in iron ore and oil prices this week. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Global markets are moving into the Easter holiday long weekend on a more cautious note.... as a stronger US dollar following some hawkish Fed commentary weighs on the commodities space. Iron ore is also being hammered this morning. Concerns over global growth, allied with the stronger US dollar, wiped almost 6% off the price of a ton of iron ore in Singapore trading. Bloomberg has the details: The SGX AsiaClear contract for May settlement sank as much as 5.8 percent to $49.90 a ton in Singapore.... Iron ore has been on a wild ride in March as investors sought to gauge conflicting economic signals from China against still-elevated port stockpiles and shifts in the U.S. currency. Asian stock markets have hit a one-week low, as those worries over the stronger US dollar rippled through Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul and Hong Kong. The Chinese stock market led the selloff, down 1.7%, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng close behind. The sight of falling commodity prices alarmed investors, despite an optimistic speech from the Chinese premier, who claimed that the country\u2019s economy remains strong. And Japan\u2019s Nikkei dropped by 0.6%, even though a weaker yen should be good for Japanese exporters. Angus Nicholson of IG says the markets simply aren\u2019t happy by the recent dollar rally: The oil price and equity markets are teetering on the verge of a much larger pullback as hawkish Fed officials have lifted the US dollar this week. Markets in Asia look to be rolling over as the whole region suffered steady losses throughout the session. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s upbeat speech at the Bo\u2019ao Forum did little to soothe investor concerns as the Shanghai Composite had its worst day in two weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the last day before the Easter break, but there\u2019s not much springtime cheer in the City of London this morning. That\u2019s partly because it\u2019s chilly and cloudy (with rain on the way) but mainly because the financial world is getting fretful again, mainly about the US dollar. The dollar has strengthened in recent days, pushing commodity prices down and giving emerging markets fresh reasons to worry about capital flight. This move is being driven by hints from US central bankers that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more aggressively than the markets expect, to keep inflationary pressures in check. That\u2019s curious, given the Fed sounded so dovish at last week\u2019s policy meeting. But it\u2019s enough to worry traders, as a stronger dollar will not be good for global economic growth. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: A succession of Federal Reserve policymakers have come out in recent days suggesting a rate rise in April is a real possibility, which rather begs the question as to why there was so little dissent over the decision itself last week. Granted, the majority of this week\u2019s speakers haven\u2019t got a vote on the committee this year but the level of hawkishness does jar somewhat with last week\u2019s dovish message, and could present problems for Janet Yellen if the economic data shows significant signs of improvement between now and the end of April. The change of tone also undermines the credibility and consistency of the FOMC\u2019s message to the markets at a time when sentiment still remains fragile and emerging markets remain vulnerable to the strength of the greenback. And that\u2019s why the main European markets are expected to fall this morning: In the corporate world, retailer Next is reporting results right now, and warning that 2016 looks pretty challenging (more on that shortly). And there\u2019s a splurge of economic data, as statistics bodies clear the decks before Good Friday.

      "bodyText": "House prices in Shenzhen, the city which is a hub for technology hardware and known as China\u2019s Silicon Valley, soared by almost 50% last year \u2013 the fastest growth in residential property prices worldwide. A new survey puts two Chinese cities \u2013 Shenzhen and Shanghai \u2013 in the top five fastest-growing property markets despite the Chinese stock market tumbling in 2015. The research, by the estate agents Knight Frank (pdf), also shows the impact of last year\u2019s debt crisis in Greece. House prices in the two biggest Greek cities \u2013 Thessaloniki and Athens \u2013 were both ranked among the worst six in the survey of 165 cities, falling 5.9% and 4.8% respectively. There were also significant drops in some Italian cities, including Rome, Trieste and Genoa. Nicosia and Larnaca in Cyprus were also among the worst performers. The Global Residential Cities Index showed that house prices in cities worldwide went up 4.4%. Behind Shenzhen, Auckland was the second fastest growing market with rises of 25.4%, followed by Istanbul (25%) and Sydney (19.9%). Shenzhen has become a hub for the production of hardware used in electronics and has a permanent population of 10 million, rising to 15 million in the summer \u2013 autumn electronics season. Their average age is 30. The city bordering Hong Kong did not exist 30 years ago, sporting just a few fishing villages. In 1979, it was declared China\u2019s first special economic zone and surrounded by an 85-mile long, barbed wire fence. Investment and migrant workers flooded the area and factories and housing were built from scratch. By the mid-90s, the population had climbed to 3 million. In 2004, the first metro station opened and a decade later the network had grown to 131 stations. Two Turkish cities featured in the top 10 \u2013 Istanbul and Izmir \u2013 while Budapest recorded the biggest rise among European Union cities, with prices up 16.3%. Budapest is also the strongest performing capital city in the index, with demand fuelled by an investment immigration bond for Chinese nationals. Cities traditionally associated with high prices failed to feature prominently. London was ranked at 16 (11.4% growth) with New York at 89th (3.3%). The fast rising prices of Sydney, the fourth fastest rising market, has resulted in high rents and the same sort of concerns about the effects on the young population in the city as in London. In the US, Portland in Oregon and San Francisco were the highest risers, both with increases over the year of 10%. The fastest growing North American city was Vancouver, with prices up nearly 12% on an annual basis. After London, Glasgow was the highest rising city in the UK, with prices up 8.6% according to the survey. At the bottom of the league table, with the fastest falling prices, was the Indian city of Chandigarh, the capital of the north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, which has a population of 1 million and has been rated as India\u2019s wealthiest city. However, house prices in the city declined by 7.7% last year. The Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates four times last year, but the base rate still stands at 6.75% and the economy has faltered. Knight Frank said the long-term outlook for house prices in cities was of further upward price pressure. The report said: \u201cUrban and rural housing markets are increasingly polarised when it comes to price performance. According to the World Bank, 54% of the world\u2019s population currently lives in cities, and by 2045 the urban population will rise by another 2 billion to 6 billion, suggesting the pressure on urban prices looks set to intensify.\u201d The 10 fastest rising property markets Shenzhen, China Auckland, New Zealand Istanbul, Turkey Sydney, Australia Shanghai, China Izmir, Turkey Budapest, Hungary Stockholm, Sweden Gothenburg, Sweden Vancouver, Canada Source: Knight Frank",

The research, <a href=\"http://content.knightfrank.com/research/1026/documents/en/q4-2015-3653.pdf\">by the estate agents Knight Frank (pdf)</a>, also shows the impact of last year\u2019s debt crisis in Greece. </p> <p>House prices in the two biggest Greek cities \u2013 Thessaloniki and Athens \u2013 were both ranked among the worst six in the survey of 165 cities, falling 5.9% and 4.8% respectively. There were also significant drops in some Italian cities, including Rome, Trieste and Genoa.

Behind Shenzhen, Auckland was the second fastest growing market with rises of 25.4%, followed by Istanbul (25%) and Sydney (19.9%).</p> <p>Shenzhen has become a hub for the production of hardware used in electronics and has a permanent population of 10 million, rising to 15 million in the summer \u2013 autumn electronics season. Their average age is 30. </p> <p>The city bordering Hong Kong did not exist 30 years ago, sporting just a few fishing villages. In 1979, it was declared China\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21558307\">special economic zone</a> and surrounded by an 85-mile long, barbed wire fence. Investment and migrant workers flooded the area and factories and housing were built from scratch. By the mid-90s, the population had climbed to 3 million. In 2004, the first metro station opened and a decade later the network had grown to 131 stations.<br></p> <p>Two Turkish cities featured in the top 10 \u2013 Istanbul and Izmir \u2013 while Budapest recorded the biggest rise among European Union cities, with prices up 16.3%. Budapest is also the strongest performing capital city in the index, with demand fuelled by an investment immigration bond for Chinese nationals.</p> <p>Cities traditionally associated with high prices failed to feature prominently. London was ranked at 16 (11.4% growth) with New York at 89th (3.3%). The fast rising prices of Sydney, the fourth fastest rising market, has resulted in high rents and the same sort of concerns about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/13/how-sydneys-overheated-housing-market-keeps-young-people-on-the-streets\">the effects on the young population in the city</a> as in London.</p> <p> In the US, Portland in Oregon and San Francisco were the highest risers, both with increases over the year of 10%.

However, house prices in the city declined by 7.7% last year. The Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates four times last year, but the base rate still stands at 6.75% and the economy has faltered.</p> <p>Knight Frank said the long-term outlook for house prices in cities was of further upward price pressure. The report said: \u201cUrban and rural housing markets are increasingly polarised when it comes to price performance. According to the World Bank, 54% of the world\u2019s population currently lives in cities, and by 2045 the urban population will rise by another 2 billion to 6 billion, suggesting the pressure on urban prices looks set to intensify.\u201d</p> <h2>The 10 fastest rising property markets</h2> <ol> <li>Shenzhen, China</li> <li>Auckland, New Zealand</li> <li>Istanbul, Turkey</li> <li>Sydney, Australia</li> <li>Shanghai, China</li> <li>Izmir, Turkey</li> <li>Budapest, Hungary<br></li> <li>Stockholm, Sweden</li> <li>Gothenburg, Sweden</li> <li>Vancouver, Canada</li> </ol> <p><em>Source: Knight </em><em>Frank</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Two Lanarkshire steel mills have been saved from closure after metals group Liberty House bought them from Tata Steel, in a deal brokered by the Scottish government. The Clydebridge and Dalzell plants were due to be mothballed after Tata announced plans to hack back its UK business, at the cost of 1,200 jobs. They were granted a reprieve via an unusual back-to-back deal, under which the Scottish government will buy the plants from Tata before selling them on to Liberty House. The deal is understood to have been structured to avoid the lengthy due diligence process required for a transaction between two companies. The fee for the plants is understood to be \u201cnominal\u201d \u2013 potentially as little as \u00a31 \u2013 because Liberty House will take on their environmental costs and invest in them. Liberty House is not expected to employ all 270 of the plants\u2019 staff immediately but plans to increase the workforce back to former levels over time. Sanjeev Gupta, Liberty House\u2019s executive chairman, has vowed to build a profitable steel business in the UK, despite the woes affecting the sector. He said the two Lanarkshire steel mills would help Liberty House reach that goal. \u201cThis agreement saves two great facilities in Scotland,\u201d he added. \u201cNow we must turn our attention to restoring these businesses to their former glory, steadily rebuilding their skilled workforces and customer base. \u201cClydebridge and Dalzell will fit well into our vision for an integrated, flexible and sustainable steel sector, from recycled local scrap using renewable energy making green steel, to value-added downstream and engineered products.\u201d Gupta has said he plans to increase his UK workforce from 1,500 to as much as 5,000, if the government puts in place the right conditions to allow investment in steelworks. He wants to buy old plants that once made steel from raw materials and convert them to recycle scrap steel into products for use by engineering businesses. Gupta has already bought an advanced engineering firm from collapsed steel firm Caparo and is eyeing more such acquisitions to feed recycled steel. He has said this could replace the traditional industry of making steel from raw materials, a business hit hard in the UK due to the strong pound, high energy costs and Chinese firms dumping cheap steel on the European market. Bimlendra Jha, executive chairman of Tata Steel\u2019s Long Products Europe business, said: \u201cWe welcome this deal which opens the possibility of a resumption of steel processing in Scotland.\u201d Tata said it remains in talks to sell the remainder of its UK long products division, which previously included the two mills, to investment group Greybull Capital. Scotland\u2019s business minister, Fergus Ewing, said: \u201cWhen Tata Steel mothballed the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants, I said we would leave no stone unturned in the quest to find an alternative buyer. \u201cThat is why we established a Scottish steel taskforce and why I am delighted that our support for the steel industry has paid off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley once promised to finish off rival JD Sports. But after months of controversy about Sports Direct\u2019s working practices, JD has now leapfrogged its old foe to become the UK\u2019s most valuable listed sportswear chain. Sports Direct\u2019s shares have now halved since December, when the retailer issued an unexpected profit warning and a Guardian investigation revealed that temporary workers at its Derbyshire warehouse were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. The shares have also shed almost 18% over the past three days, after Ashley admitted in a media interview that the company was in trouble. Sports Direct is now valued at \u00a32.1bn by the stock exchange, while JD is worth \u00a32.2bn. As recently as the start of December, the companies were worth \u00a34.3bn and \u00a31.9bn respectively. Apart from the negative publicity afflicting Sports Direct, JD is increasingly viewed as having superior product lines. The reverse is the latest setback for Ashley who made his reputation by creating a company that obliterated its competition, such as JJB Sports.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers have suffered the biggest fall in spending on clothes and shoes for 25 years, as consumers increasingly allocate their spare cash to leisure activities and eating out instead. According to official figures, clothing and shoe shop sales fell 3.4% in February, which was the sixth consecutive month of decline, and marked the longest run of falling sales since October 1991. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said some retailers blamed the warmer weather this winter, which left jumpers and winter jackets unsold. Next, which said on Thursday that this year it faces the toughest trading conditions since 2008, is among the retailers to suffer the most. But the fall goes back to last summer and reports from Visa and loyalty card operator Nectar reveal a desire among hard-pressed consumers to spend their spare cash on going out and entertainment. The drop in clothing, textile and shoe sales dragged down overall retail sales by 0.4% and ended hopes that January\u2019s recovery would continue beyond the post-Christmas sales. There was a cheerier expectation among retailers in March, according to CBI figures, which found that clothing sellers were optimistic about the spring sales along with car distributors and supermarkets. Only wholesalers who supply the retail rade reported weakening demand. The CBI said low inflation and the healthy jobs market was giving added support to the retail industry, which was \u201cstable\u201d and had a balance of companies that expect volumes to accelerate next month. The more downbeat picture painted by the ONS showed a 0.4% month-on-month fall in February, which was better than the 0.7% drop the City expected, but well down on January\u2019s broad-based 2.3% jump in sales. Revised annual sales figures were also worse than previously estimated, showing a drop from 5.1% growth since last February to 3.8%. The ONS said average store prices, including petrol stations, fell by 2.5% in February 2016 compared with the same month a year earlier, the 20th consecutive month of year-on-year price falls. Overall, the amount spent in the retail industry increased by 1.4% compared with February 2015 and decreased by 0.7% compared with the previous month. Dennis de Jong, managing director at the currency dealer UFX.com, said the increasing intensity of the EU referendum debate may have preyed on consumers. \u201cShoppers tend to be tightfisted after the January sales but deeper concerns surrounding a possible Brexit might be making them think twice before spending.\u201d Chris Williamson, chief economist at the financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cTaken together, the first two months of the year suggest that sales are running 1.6% higher than in the fourth quarter. However, all is not quite as rosy as the headline numbers suggest. The three-month trend is the weakest since last August, the rate of increase dropping from 1.6% in January to just 0.8% when sales volumes in the latest three months are compared against the prior three-month period. \u201cSpending is also being driven by low prices, as indicated by the value of sales rising just 1.4% on a year ago in February compared to the 3.8% rise in volumes. A healthier picture, and one that the Bank of England would clearly like to see, would be one where rising demand is allowing retailers to push up prices to a greater extent.\u201d Melanie Richard, head of retail sales at the ONS, said clothing retailers reported a downturn based on unseasonal weather. \u201cSome of those stores have been telling us that sales of their new spring and summer collections were hit by the cold and wet weather last month.\u201d A report earlier this week by Nectar found that households were more likely to spend their spare cash than save it since the same time last year, but this was more likely to benefit restaurants and leisure providers than high street shops. The study also found that more than a fifth (23%) of the population believed they were worse off now compared with 2015 and a quarter planned to rein in spending in the year ahead, with plans to spend less on clothing and accessories (25%), eating out (24%) and on home improvements (26%). \u2022This article was amended on 25 March. The original headline had suggested the spending slump affected the whole retail sector.",

      "bodyText": "Whistles, the high street fashion chain, has been bought by the Foschini Group in the latest move by a South African retailer into the British market. Foschini, which last year bought Phase Eight in the UK, has acquired the 46 Whistles stores and its online business and will use the combined operations to expand in the northern hemisphere, the company said. It did not disclose the sale price. Since the launch of Whistles as a women\u2019s fashion brand in 1976 by husband-and-wife team Richard and Lucille Lewin, its fortunes have fluctuated. It was in the doldrums and perceived as frumpy in 2008 when Jane Shepherdson, formerly of Topshop, joined as chief executive with a 20% stake. Shepherdson turned Whistles into a \u201cTopshop for grownups\u201d, targeting younger customers rather than the \u201cyummy mummies\u201d who had become its staple. Shepherdson has kept her stake and will continue to run the business after the sale. Peter Davies, chairman of Whistles since 2008 and the former chairman of shoe retailer Clarks, has sold his stake. Now the brand\u2019s fans include the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron and its clothes are stocked by Bloomingdale\u2019s in the US and Harrods in the UK. Foschini said it wanted to expand the company, which added a menswear range in 2014, into new markets. Doug Murray, Foschini\u2019s chief executive, told Bloomberg News: \u201cWhistles is an iconic brand and we see enormous growth potential for the brand in the UK and also internationally. We have a management team in place on that side and will start working with the Whistles team from today.\u201d South African retailers have been buying up European companies to reduce their reliance on the rand, which has tumbled over the past year. Truworths bought Office, the UK shoe chain, for \u00a3256m in December and Steinhoff backed out of a bid for Argos last week, preferring to buy Darty, the French electronics chain, for \u00a3673m. Last year Steinhoff bought Pepkor, South Africa\u2019s biggest retailer, which has launched Pep &amp; Co as a discount clothing chain in the UK. Christo Wiese, South Africa\u2019s fourth richest man who owns a big stake in Pepkor, last year paid \u00a3780m for a majority stake in New Look, the British fashion retailer. Foschini bought Whistles from Mundur, an Icelandic investment company, Bloomberg said. Whistles was part of the retail empire controlled by Baugur, the Icelandic group that entered administration in 2009 during Iceland\u2019s banking crisis. The UK chain was refinanced and became an independent company.",

      "bodyText": "The brewer and distiller Adnams felt the effect of temperance caused by drinkers signing up to \u201cdry January\u201d, but still reported higher profits. Pretax profits were \u00a34.7m, up from \u00a34.4m in 2015, allowing for a 5.9% increase in the brewer\u2019s final dividend to \u00a31.44 per share, despite a fall in revenues from \u00a366m to \u00a365m as the UK beer market shrank by 1.5%. The sales slowdown was particularly acute at the beginning of the year, which has become increasingly popular for some post-Christmas puritanism. Adnams said it was \u201chard to escape the conclusion that a growing interest in following dry January might have had a role in this\u201d. \u201cJanuary is far from the most important month, however the trend is perhaps indicative of the growing prominence of public health messages.\u201d Chairman Jonathan Adnams said the fall in revenues was also partly down to an increasingly crowded market for craft beers and ales. \u201cThe market is ever more competitive, with more and more microbreweries starting up all the time and that impacted somewhat on the top line,\u201d he said. While beer sales in the UK fell, Adnams said he hoped the growing popularity of craft beers made by smaller brewers would help sell its own beers such as its Dry Hopped Lager. He added that takeovers of smaller brewers by multinational drinks companies \u2013 such as ABInBev\u2019s buyout of Camden Town Brewery \u2013 might help push people towards better quality beers. Adnams also produces spirits and said it had invested \u00a3500,000 during the year to treble its capacity by installing two new stills, encouraged by sales up 39%. The expenditure is part of a \u00a37m investment plan to expand the business and add more up-to-date equipment by the end of 2017. Adnams lamented the \u201csad reduction in pub numbers\u201d as customers move towards drinking at home and at other venues. However, trading within Adnams\u2019 own pubs estate was up by 3.5% on a like-for-like basis and the firm said it does not plan to sell any pubs. The brewer has also responded to changing tastes by investing in shops, so that it can capture the drink-at-home market. Adnams introduced the new national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour in October last year, ahead of a deadline of April 2016 and said it plans to increase its minimum rate to the Living Wage Foundation\u2019s \u00a38.25 an hour threshold. \u201cWe believe that paying better wages is the right approach and may be particularly important in sectors such as leisure and hospitality where pay rates have often been less good.\u201d Adnams said economic sentiment so far this year has been worse than last year, adding that the \u201cuncertainties created by the forthcoming EU referendum may have some role in this\u201d. He said that while Brexit wouldn\u2019t make a lot of difference to Adnams because it largely sells in the UK, its small exports business could suffer. \u201cWe export to the EU and being a member facilitates that trade. I\u2019m a European and I think the EU has done a lot of good things, so I\u2019d be hoping that we\u2019d stay in and try to change it from the inside.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on Telstra to ensure the outages that have blighted its network in recent weeks do not become a permanent fixture. The telecom company\u2019s chief executive, Andy Penn, has offered customers a day\u2019s free data as compensation and called in experts from around the world to examine what was behind the latest of the \u201cunacceptable\u201d outages. Each one has been caused by a different problem ranging from \u201chuman error\u201d (now changed to a processing problem) to an issue with submarine cables. But as home working becomes more widespread and more and more people rely on the network for their livelihood, patience with the service once regarded as the best in Australia is running out. Mitch Cairns, a record producer based in Yarraville, Melbourne, said the outage on Tuesday, when hundreds of thousands of customers couldn\u2019t make calls on their mobile or landline, had directly affected his business. \u201cMy phone and NBN network went down, making me unable to upload files for deadlines etc,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t call out to notify clients so it\u2019s a bit of a nightmare for such an expensive service.\u201d John Marshall from Brisbane, was affected on Tuesday and the problem continued on Thursday. He was told the issue would not be fixed until 6pm on Good Friday. Thomas Rouse, a bricklaying contractor in the Hunter Valley region of NSW, said he had lost a full day\u2019s production because he was unable to contact a supplier to confirm a delivery for the following day. \u201cIt takes a lot of time to recover that sort of money,\u201d he said. Other providers are eyeing the potential to lure disgruntled customers away from the market leader. As thousands of Telstra customers suffered during Tuesday\u2019s latest outage, Vodafone offered a month\u2019s free access for people who port their number from another provider. There are also a host of so-called virtual operators (MVNOs), such as Dodo and Amaysim, which offer all manner of deals via the Optus and Vodafone networks. Only a few such as Aldi and Woolworths are on Telstra\u2019s own network. Amaysim scored the highest in a customer satisfaction survey of mobile services conducted by the consumer group Choice. Telstra did not rank in the top five, suffering especially from a sense that its services are not good value. Its competitors can offer comparatively good value on broadband access for as little as $10 a month. Once such provider, iiNet, is similarly competitive and has now been swallowed by the fast-growing TPG Telecom. As a measure of how serious the competition might be getting for Telstra, it emerged this week that TPG is close to becoming a company worth more than $10bn, which makes it bigger than Qantas and Crown Resorts. Vodafone knows how costly network problems can be. It lost thousands of customers when its network failed to keep pace with data demand three years ago, earning it the unwanted nickname of \u201cVodafail\u201d. So could the same thing happen to the mighty Telstra? Alex Kidman from the consumer website Finder.com said: \u201cTelstra\u2019s had three outages [four if you count the prepaid outage they had in early March] in the span of two months, which is unexpected for a network that sells itself on its quality and ubiquity. \u201cGiven the premium pricing that Telstra attaches to its mobile services, I\u2019d say customers have every reason to be concerned. While no mobile network is 100% reliable with 100% coverage, Telstra\u2019s set a very high standard and, up until now, it lived up to that for most customers. \u201cWhile 2/4 outages [prepaid and this week\u2019s outage] were on the smaller scale, it\u2019s a worrying sign of how reliant so many people are on Telstra\u2019s services specifically that it caused such consternation.\u201d Tom Godfrey from Choice said that while some consumers may be happy with free data to compensate, persistent problems might make some think about switching. \u201cWe would encourage affected Telstra customers to keep detailed records of any outage they experience,\u201d he said, \u201cincluding any impact on their business operations, and seek compensation accordingly. \u201cIf it becomes clear that the problem is ongoing and that Telstra isn\u2019t providing its contracted service, consumers should be able to cancel their contract and leave Telstra without penalty. \u201cTelstra should be mindful of #vodafail. As thousands of disaffected Vodafone customers demonstrated, if a telco fails to deliver on its promises they are dialling themselves into trouble.\u201d A Telstra spokesman said the problems were being addressed by the review and that $5bn was being invested in its mobile network infrastructure but added that only 3% of customers had been affected. \u201cWhile small, we appreciate the impact this outage had on the customers affected and we apologise to them,\u201d the spokesman said. As the legacy player in the market, Telstra remains stronger in more areas, especially regional Australia where Optus and Vodafone have been slower to roll out 4G services. But the gap is narrowing and Telstra will need all of that $5bn in order to make sure that it doesn\u2019t end up with its own unfortunate nickname.",

ANZ announced to the Australian stock exchange on Thursday that over the past month, conditions have changed such that expected costs associated with lending to the mining and resources sector would increase from a projected $800m to more than $900m.

The study was covered by multiple publications, all of which extrapolated the results to all Australians. However, the original report, by salary-comparison website Glassdoor, is based on figures from a self-selected sample of users from their website, and is therefore not a representative sample of Australian workers generally (or indeed US workers, or any of the other countries surveyed). The report points this out: \u201cAn important limitation of Glassdoor data is to note that it is a sample from online employees, which is not necessarily representative of the overall labor market in the countries we examine.\u201d Glassdoor\u2019s sample for Australia, for example, skews towards high-income earning males. For the 4,044 salaries reported between 2006 and 2015 the split was 77% male and 23% female, with an average annual base salary of $96,282. According to the ABS the average annual, full-time salary in Australia is $78,000. Glassdoor\u2019s report found a general pay gap of 17.3%, and then they calculated an \u201cadjusted\u201d pay gap of 3.9% by controlling for differences due to industry, age, education, years of experience, company size, and job title. Their analysis also showed most of the overall pay gap (38%) was due to industrial and occupational segregation. So, how does this report compare with previous analyses of the wage gap? Despite the sampling bias, the overall trends are similar, but the breakdown of contributing factors differs. A recent factsheet from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency put overall pay gap at 17% in 2016. A 2009 report from Natsem examining data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey also found a similar overall gap of 17%, but found less was due to industrial segregation (25%) and the majority of the gap was due to unobserved factors or simply being a woman (60%). An analysis of the gender wage gap for recent Australian graduates found a gap of 9.4%, which dropped to 4.4% when field of education, personal, enrolment and occupational characteristics of male and female graduates were taken into account. Another study from 2010 using Hilda data to look specifically at the wage gap for managers found that \u201cwomen full-time managers earn about 27% less than their male counterparts and somewhere between 65 and 90 per cent of this pay gap cannot be explained by the characteristics of managers and is possibly due to discrimination\u201d. Although the Glassdoor report does calculate the \u201cadjusted\u201d wage gap, it\u2019s worth pointing out that this figure is of limited utility, particularly when viewed in light of broader structural discrimination. As the authors themselves note: \u201cFirst, not all of the statistical controls we\u2019ve applied represent purely voluntary choices by workers. Education is influenced by socioeconomic background, work experience is determined partly by balancing career and family, and the choice of job title and industry is heavily influenced by social and gender norms that discourage men and women from choosing freely between professions.\u201d",
