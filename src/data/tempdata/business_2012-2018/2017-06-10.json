      "bodyText": "When the latest GDP figures were released this week, media outlets around the country (including Guardian Australia) almost unanimously ran with the line celebrating that Australia had gone 26 years without a recession. It\u2019s a worthy historical marker to applaud, but for workers at the moment, the records being broken are unlikely to bring much applause. Twenty six years without two consecutive quarters of negative growth is certainly a long time (even if, like me, you think that is a daft definition of a recession). Over that period, Australia\u2019s economy has grown almost as well as any other country in the OECD. Of the 26 OECD countries that existed in 1991, only Ireland, South Korea, Turkey and Luxembourg have grown faster than Australia. Avoiding recessions is no small thing \u2013 they wreck lives. It took a decade for the percentage of Australian adults in employment to return to pre-1990s recession levels. The 1990s recession led to people in their 50s losing their jobs and not working again. If we had the level of unemployment that was reached in 1992 rather than the current number of 744,000 people unemployed, we would be talking about 1.4m people \u2013 that is a lot of families struggling to survive. For years it seemed we were destined to have recessions at least once a decade \u2013 we had one in the early 1960s, early 70s, early 80s, early 90s and a couple of others in between. And then from 1991 onwards, it appeared we had discovered the secret recipe for avoiding them. We had the central bank target low inflation, and on the government side we saw \u201cthe end of big government\u201d, privatisation of public assets, greater industrial flexibility, fewer labour disputes, lower income and company tax, higher consumption tax, greater competition and lower tariffs. For 15 years the recipe seemed to work. Then the global financial crisis happened and the world got food poisoning. And while we might have avoided a recession in technical terms, we certainly have not returned to any sense of solid economic growth since then. We don\u2019t seek GDP growth for its own sake; we seek it because it is supposed to lead to improved standards of living for people. And if you want to take credit for the good times of those 15 years from 1991 to the GFC, you need to also accept that the recipe hasn\u2019t worked in the decade since then. The talk of 26 years of uninterrupted growth is also a good time to remind us of how much the recipe has changed Australia. In 1991, about 40% of workers were in a union, now it is about 15%, and not unrelated is the fact that in 1991, 55.7% of national income went to employees; in March this year it was just 51.5% \u2013 the lowest share since 1964. We may have not experienced a recession since a time when Daryl Braithwaite was topping the charts, but the share of national income going to employees is now at the same point it was when The Beatles toured Australia. That difference in the share of income going to employees is equivalent to about $17bn in the March quarter. And while it might be all well and good to say we have avoided a recession, for nearly five years now we have also avoided any rises in real wages. The GDP figures on Wednesday revealed the biggest annual fall ever recorded in real labour costs. They also showed that nominal unit labour costs \u2013 ie the amount paid to labour to produce a unit of output \u2013 have not grown since 2012, but in that time real labour costs (which take into account inflation) have fallen nearly 6%. Such a fall should have business groups singing the praises of the system \u2013 that we are becoming \u201cmore competitive\u201d, that labour costs are falling. But no. This week the only talk about labour costs from them was the decrying of the 3.3% rise in the minimum wage by the Fair Work Commission. Such a response was not unexpected \u2013 there is never praise for labour costs falling, only complaints that they ever rise at all; no consideration that real wages have not grown for nearly five years, only a greater drive to cut actual wages through the removal of penalty rates. The Liberal party went to the last election preaching the mantra of \u201cjobs and growth\u201d and pledged to deliver that by using the same recipe. Since then growth has slowed from 2.6% to 1.7% and while the unemployment rate has remained steady at 5.7%, wages growth has fallen from a then record low of 2.1% to an even lower mark of 1.9%. Is this the bounty we receive from 26 years of uninterrupted growth? For the ALP, the moves to alter the recipe have been slow but steady. Any proposals counter to the recipe \u2013 such as keeping the top income tax rate at 47%, talking up the importance of equality over growth, or the need for greater union power \u2013 are met with conservative critics turning up their noses and crying socialism. But as the UK election showed this week, the people seem more than ready to give such a meal a go.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A decade ago it was sub-prime mortgages. Could it be sub-prime car loans this time? Cheap finance, the economic spectre of the age, has underpinned much of Britain\u2019s growth over the past three years and there has been no bigger beneficiary of this debt-fuelled largesse than the car industry. But this four-wheeled binge, which reached a record \u00a331.6bn in car loans last year, could have consequences if it veers off the road. It takes just minutes to fill in the forms for a new kind of loan that cuts the cost of financing to levels that allow people on modest incomes to show up at the supermarket on a Saturday in the latest SUV. Applying takes no time at all, but the payback threatens to last a lot longer. The car financing industry is confident that this new breed of ultra-low-cost loans, which account for 82% of all new car registrations and are known as personal contract plans (PCPs), are a safe and secure way of financing new cars. It says sub-prime lenders, who offer loans to people with erratic incomes and damaged credit ratings, account for only 3% of the market and the industry can cope with any destabilising events coming down the track. Some experts are not so sure. There are worries that the volume of lending will be vulnerable to an increase in interest rates or rise in unemployment. Bank of England economists writing in a blogpost entitled \u201cCar finance \u2013 is the industry speeding?\u201d argue that \u201cthe industry\u2019s growing reliance on PCP has made it more vulnerable to macroeconomic downturns\u201d. There is also the concern that the banking industry, which provides much of the underlying finance, is offering the same platitudes as it did before the 2008 crash. The vast majority of loans are rock solid, it says, except the industry has failed to introduce a standard way to calculate customer arrears and repossessions, which means that the 3% sub-prime figure could be bigger. The Finance &amp; Leasing Association (FLA) \u2013 a trade body for consumer-credit and car lenders \u2013 cannot provide figures to support its assertion that lenders are following conservative credit guidelines. It says PCPs are sold responsibly and only to those people with a strong credit score, yet lenders\u2019 credit scoring policies, which are relatively transparent in the US \u2013 the original home of the PCP \u2013 are secret in the UK. Officials at the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, have embarked on a review of lenders\u2019 practices, including how they credit-score customers and the amount of checking that takes place of customer incomes and credit history. Debt charities are on standby for a wave of distressed car buyers unable to honour deals that they will struggle to pay now that inflation is increasing strongly and their disposable incomes are shrinking. According to one observer, the industry is also vulnerable to the likely collapse in diesel car values, which could send many companies to the wall. Simon Empson, who runs the online car broker Broadspeed.com, predicts a government clampdown on older diesel cars as part of plans to improve air quality in cities, which he says could have dire consequences for the trade. Overall, the situation has been more than 10 years in the making, though the explosion in loans dates back to 2013 and the first signs of recovery from the 2008 crash. UK households borrowing last year to buy cars was up 12% on the year before. This year, the total borrowed is expected to exceed \u00a340bn. Cash purchases are almost unknown, and a record 2.7m new cars were sold in Britain last year \u2013 the fifth year in a row of increasing sales. Of those, 1.3 million were diesels. The British are now buying more cars per head than any other large country in Europe. PCPs have rocketed in popularity because they put in place a new way of calculating the loan. Instead of spreading the loan and interest charge over the whole cost of the car, only the cost of depreciation is taken into account. It means that some of the most expensive Mercedes, Audi, Volvo and Land Rover models, which maintain their value and depreciate the least, suddenly become affordable to those on lower incomes. Deals are commonly priced over three years and can limit the loan on a \u00a345,000 car to \u00a320,000. The catch is that the seller retains ownership of the car and that the deal is essentially a lease. Customers can pay off the difference in a car\u2019s value at the end of the deal or hand it back and start a new deal. More than 80% of PCP buyers roll over their contracts to a lease on a new car. One industry executive said: \u201cThese days \u2018ownership\u2019 has given way to \u2018usership\u2019 in the car market.\u201d And it is this facility to continually upgrade, based on a new model of ultra-cheap financing, that has provided the industry with its biggest boost. Dan Powell, editor of the specialist car website HonestJohn.co.uk, said: \u201cIt could be compared to a phone contract, in the sense that you agree to pay a set amount a month and, as long as you stick to the call plan, or in this case the mileage limits, maintenance and service schedules, there should be no unexpected bills to worry about. At the end of the contract users can just hand the car back and move on to a new model.\u201d Robert, a courier based in Sussex who has signed five PCP deals, said PCPs had reduced the cost of motoring, especially once consumers realise the lender is paying the road tax and, for a small extra fee, servicing the car. \u201cIt is a different way of thinking of your car. If the tyres or lightbulbs go, I just pull into a KwikFit garage and they sort it out. I had a Mercedes and it could be serviced anywhere across Europe in the company\u2019s 24-hours centres. \u201cI know people who have never cleaned their car or touched a thing on them. They have stopped thinking about ownership. They are more than happy to hand back the car at the end of the deal and get a new one.\u201d A mystery shopping exercise by the Observer found that Lings Cars, made famous by an appearance on Dragon\u2019s Den and one of the biggest providers of personal lease plans, will offer a pre-registered Nissan Juke 1.5 diesel for an initial upfront payment of \u00a3528 and 35 monthly payments of \u00a3176. This is a car that lists at more than \u00a318,000 and most dealers would sell new for more than \u00a316,000. In the past this would have been out of reach to someone on our declared income of \u00a319,000. The customer was asked for proof of income and was expected to undertake a credit score check, but delivery was immediately scheduled for early the next month. Incredibly, Lings will lease a new Smart ForTwo coup\u00e9 for the upfront payment of a \u00a3319 deposit and three years\u2019 worth of further payments at just \u00a3106 per month. One of the advantages of going for a dealer-arranged PCP plan is the speed of approval. Looking for a Fiat 500, we were offered an official, Fiat-backed, four-year PCP plan that required a deposit of \u00a3690 and agreement to similar monthly payments of \u00a3179. Car tax and three years\u2019 annual servicing were thrown in. A south London-based dealer contacted by the Observer told us that if our daughter couldn\u2019t pass the income checks for the Fiat 500 herself, a parent or friend could act as guarantor. And provided we passed the credit check, the whole process would take just 20 minutes. This is compares with the three-hour affordability interview that mortgage applicants are now subjected to. But even should these speedy credit tests pass the regulator\u2019s mis-selling test, the sheer volume of cars bought with credit poses other dangers. Empson of Broadspeed.com said that lenders\u2019 auditors were scrambling to calculate the hit to their finances from possible changes to government air pollution rules \u2013 which would take cars off the road \u2013 and the possible introduction of a diesel scrappage scheme. It could be a catastrophe for lenders. \u201cPCP car finance relies on the lenders\u2019 ability to realise guaranteed future values, which can only happen in a strong used car market; but if hundreds of thousands of diesel drivers were to use consumer law to return their PCP-financed cars early \u2013 passing the early-termination losses back to the lenders \u2013 the cost would be so great that many finance companies wouldn\u2019t be able to cope. It\u2019s no exaggeration to speculate whether this could become the next financial crisis,\u201d Empson said. In recent months the volume of PCP deals has spurred MPs and regulators to ask whether there is a catch. Could there be implications for consumers, the industry and the financial system, with knock-on effects to the economy? The FLA says lenders can calculate the value of depreciation on a car to within a few pounds, based on what it describes as the \u201crich data\u201d from the secondhand car market. This prevents firms underpricing loans and finding themselves left with thousands of almost worthless secondhand cars to sell. Adrian Dally, head of motor finance at the FLA, added: \u201cFar from there being a lack of transparency in the motor finance market, it is particularly data-rich \u2026 As for sub-prime lending, the FLA estimates that less than \u00a31.7bn of total outstanding UK consumer car loans provided through dealerships at the end of December 2016 was sub-prime \u2013 less than 3% of outstanding lending.\u201d Nonetheless, an attempt by the new government to curb emissions could spell the end for high-end diesel cars, millions of which have been sold through PCP plans.

According to one observer, the industry is also vulnerable to the likely collapse in diesel car values, which could send many companies to the wall.</p> <p>Simon Empson, who runs the online car broker Broadspeed.com, predicts a government clampdown on older diesel cars as part of plans to improve air quality in cities, which he says could have dire consequences for the trade.</p> <p>Overall, the situation has been more than 10 years in the making, though the explosion in loans dates back to 2013 and the first signs of recovery from the 2008 crash. UK households borrowing last year to buy cars was up 12% on the year before. This year, the total borrowed is expected to exceed \u00a340bn. Cash purchases are almost unknown, and a record 2.7m new cars were sold in Britain last year \u2013 the fifth year in a row of increasing sales. Of those, 1.3 million were diesels. The British are now buying more cars per head than any other large country in Europe.</p> <p>PCPs have rocketed in popularity because they put in place a new way of calculating the loan. Instead of spreading the loan and interest charge over the whole cost of the car, only the cost of depreciation is taken into account. It means that some of the most expensive Mercedes, Audi, Volvo and Land Rover models, which maintain their value and depreciate the least, suddenly become affordable to those on lower incomes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfe026d9389672fcb1d44d5307e9df6b8487888d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfe026d9389672fcb1d44d5307e9df6b8487888d/0_1796_2775_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Financial Conduct Authority is carrying out a review of lenders\u2019 practices within the auto trade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Financial Conduct Authority is carrying out a review of lenders\u2019 practices within the auto trade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Deals are commonly priced over three years and can limit the loan on a \u00a345,000 car to \u00a320,000. The catch is that the seller retains ownership of the car and that the deal is essentially a lease. Customers can pay off the difference in a car\u2019s value at the end of the deal or hand it back and start a new deal. More than 80% of PCP buyers roll over their contracts to a lease on a new car.</p> <p>One industry executive said: \u201cThese days \u2018ownership\u2019 has given way to \u2018usership\u2019 in the car market.\u201d</p> <p>And it is this facility to continually upgrade, based on a new model of ultra-cheap financing, that has provided the industry with its biggest boost.</p> <p>Dan Powell, editor of the specialist car website HonestJohn.co.uk, said: \u201cIt could be compared to a phone contract, in the sense that you agree to pay a set amount a month and, as long as you stick to the call plan, or in this case the mileage limits, maintenance and service schedules, there should be no unexpected bills to worry about. At the end of the contract users can just hand the car back and move on to a new model.\u201d</p> <p>Robert, a courier based in Sussex who has signed five PCP deals, said PCPs had reduced the cost of motoring, especially once consumers realise the lender is paying the road tax and, for a small extra fee, servicing the car.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a different way of thinking of your car. If the tyres or lightbulbs go, I just pull into a KwikFit garage and they sort it out. I had a Mercedes and it could be serviced anywhere across Europe in the company\u2019s 24-hours centres.</p> <p>\u201cI know people who have never cleaned their car or touched a thing on them. They have stopped thinking about ownership. They are more than happy to hand back the car at the end of the deal and get a new one.\u201d</p> <p>A mystery shopping exercise by the <em>Observer</em> found that Lings Cars, made famous by an appearance on <em>Dragon\u2019s Den</em> and one of the biggest providers of personal lease plans, will offer a pre-registered Nissan Juke 1.5 diesel for an initial upfront payment of \u00a3528 and 35 monthly payments of \u00a3176. This is a car that lists at more than \u00a318,000 and most dealers would sell new for more than \u00a316,000. In the past this would have been out of reach to someone on our declared income of \u00a319,000.</p> <p>The customer was asked for proof of income and was expected to undertake a credit score check, but delivery was immediately scheduled for early the next month. Incredibly, Lings will lease a new Smart ForTwo coup\u00e9 for the upfront payment of a \u00a3319 deposit and three years\u2019 worth of further payments at just \u00a3106 per month.</p> <p>One of the advantages of going for a dealer-arranged PCP plan is the speed of approval. Looking for a Fiat 500, we were offered an official, Fiat-backed, four-year PCP plan that required a deposit of \u00a3690 and agreement to similar monthly payments of \u00a3179. Car tax and three years\u2019 annual servicing were thrown in.</p> <p>A south London-based dealer contacted by the <em>Observer </em>told us that if our daughter couldn\u2019t pass the income checks for the Fiat 500 herself, a parent or friend could act as guarantor. And provided we passed the credit check, the whole process would take just 20 minutes. This is compares with the three-hour affordability interview that mortgage applicants are now subjected to.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One dealer said if our daughter couldn\u2019t pass income checks for the Fiat 500, a parent or friend could act as guarantor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But even should these speedy credit tests pass the regulator\u2019s mis-selling test, the sheer volume of cars bought with credit poses other dangers.</p> <p>Empson of Broadspeed.com said that lenders\u2019 auditors were scrambling to calculate the hit to their finances from possible changes to government air pollution rules \u2013 which would take cars off the road \u2013 and the possible introduction of a diesel scrappage scheme. It could be a catastrophe for lenders.</p> <p>\u201cPCP car finance relies on the lenders\u2019 ability to realise guaranteed future values, which can only happen in a strong used car market; but if hundreds of thousands of diesel drivers were to use consumer law to return their PCP-financed cars early \u2013 passing the early-termination losses back to the lenders \u2013 the cost would be so great that many finance companies wouldn\u2019t be able to cope. It\u2019s no exaggeration to speculate whether this could become the next financial crisis,\u201d Empson said.</p> <p>In recent months the volume of PCP deals has spurred MPs and regulators to ask whether there is a catch. Could there be implications for consumers, the industry and the financial system, with knock-on effects to the economy?</p> <p>The FLA says lenders can calculate the value of depreciation on a car to within a few pounds, based on what it describes as the \u201crich data\u201d from the secondhand car market. This prevents firms underpricing loans and finding themselves left with thousands of almost worthless secondhand cars to sell.</p> <p>Adrian Dally, head of motor finance at the FLA, added: \u201cFar from there being a lack of transparency in the motor finance market, it is particularly data-rich \u2026 As for sub-prime lending, the FLA estimates that less than \u00a31.7bn of total outstanding UK consumer car loans provided through dealerships at the end of December 2016 was sub-prime \u2013 less than 3% of outstanding lending.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, an attempt by the new government to curb emissions could spell the end for high-end diesel cars, millions of which have been sold through PCP plans. Fasten your seat belts.</p>",
