It is the latest round of funding made available through the \u00a32.5m music export growth scheme, established two years ago by UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) with the music industry body, the BPI, to help independent music companies make their mark in the US, Asia and Europe. The 13 music companies selected include the management company behind Catfish and the Bottlemen, winner of the BBC Introducing award. Songwriters Greig Watts, Georgie Dennis and Christopher Wortley will also benefit from the latest grants. Past recipients can count between them 13 record deals and 10 international music awards. Many of the acts that will benefit this time hail from or near London, such as electronic folk band Crystal Fighters. They also include Moulettes, an English folk rock band formed in Glastonbury in 2002, and The Twilight Sad, a post-punk indie rock band from Glasgow. This seventh round of funding brings the total grants distributed by the scheme to \u00a31.6m, helping more than 100 companies, and bringing an estimated return of \u00a38.50 on every \u00a31 invested so far, UKTI said. Music is an important component of the UK\u2019s creative industry \u2013 the fastest-growing sector in the UK. According to government figures, the music industry contributed \u00a33.8bn to the UK economy in 2013, with record companies accounting for more than one sixth of this. The UK\u2019s trade and investment minister, Lord Maude, said: \u201cThe UK has a vibrant creative sector that generated over \u00a317bn in exports during 2013. The Music Export Growth Scheme has helped a new generation of British musical talent gain international recognition and boost the sales of UK music abroad; creating jobs and growth for the UK economy.\u201d",

The two members of Congress wrote to Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, on Wednesday, saying they were concerned by the results of two separate investigations by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times, which found that ExxonMobil scientists confirmed fossil fuels were causing climate change decades ago, but publicly embarked on a campaign of denial. \u201cExxonMobil\u2019s apparent behavior is similar to cigarette companies that repeatedly denied harm from tobacco and spread uncertainty and misinformation to the public,\u201d Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier, both Democratic members of Congress from California, wrote. \u201cWe ask that the DoJ similarly investigate Exxon for organizing a sustained deception campaign disputing climate science and failing to disclose truthful information to investors and the public.\u201d They asked the Department of Justice to look into a number of statutes concerning Exxon\u2019s actions, including truth in advertising and racketeering laws. Over the last six months, Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island who has pushed for action on climate change, as well as a number of campaign groups, has raised the prospect of using anti-racketeering laws to prosecute companies and other groups for spreading disinformation about climate change. In an opinion piece for the Washington Post last May, Whitehouse wrote there was already a precedent for such legal action with the successful prosecution of tobacco companies under anti-racketeering laws. Richard Keil, a spokesman for Exxon, rejected the allegations contained in the letter. \u201cThis is complete bullshit,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe have a 30 year continuous uninterrupted history of researching climate change and the LA Times for whatever reason chose to ignore that fact.\u201d Greenpeace spent years investigating the extent of Exxon\u2019s funding for climate denial, estimating the oil company spent more than $30m funding thinktanks and front groups disputing global warming before publicly disavowing such activities. The Guardian reported last July that the oil company\u2019s scientists knew that fossil fuels caused climate change as early as 1981 \u2013 27 years before climate change became a public issue.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The ancient Silk Road, along which caravans of traders brought fine Chinese cloths and exquisite porcelain to markets across Asia, never stretched as far as chilly Britain. But George Osborne is determined that its 21st-century successor will terminate in London. China\u2019s plan to step up renminbi-denominated trading in the City is just the latest evidence of what the chancellor hopes will be a \u201cgolden era\u201d of economic and financial cooperation between China and the UK. As Beijing presses ahead with its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d policy: a strategic plan to establish a new Silk Road, through central Asia and beyond, Osborne believes he has put the UK in a good position to participate. Next week\u2019s state visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping will be the culmination of a long period of determined diplomacy, including the chancellor\u2019s recent week-long tour of the country, which included six other ministers. Gerard Lyons, an advisor to the Mayor of London and a long-time China-watcher, said that by trying to make London China\u2019s offshore financial centre of choice, the UK was playing to its strengths. While the volume of renminbi trading is relatively small at present, he said: \u201cIt makes sense for the UK to do whatever it can to facilitate the trading of renminbi in London.\u201d Mark Boleat, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, said: \u201cIn recent years, cooperation between the UK and China in the financial services sector has been particularly strong and has benefitted greatly from government support on both sides.\u201d In the earlier stages of China\u2019s economic miracle, Germany made the running in exploiting huge Chinese demand, supplying the fast-growing economy with capital goods such as machine tools, as it invested billions of dollars in infrastructure. As countries develop economically, however, they tend to shift towards consumption of more services, including the financial and business services \u2013 accountancy, consulting, law \u2013 in which the UK has long specialised. Despite the recent downturn in the Chinese economy, including its stock market crash, which sparked panic worldwide and much alarm among policymakers who fear the country will export its problems, Osborne believes that in the long run, the UK will benefit by being ready to supply China\u2019s needs. He has made it his business to befriend Beijing, even when it has meant irking the UK\u2019s other partners. Britain infuriated Washington by being the first western country to sign up for membership of China\u2019s new development lender, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for example. Kristin Forbes, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, backed Osborne\u2019s approach in a speech on Friday, urging British businesses to forge deeper links with China. The Bank\u2019s rate-setting committee member said: \u201cJust one country \u2013 China \u2013 has been responsible for over one-third of global GDP growth since 2011, and even after incorporating its recent slowing, is still expected to drive about 35% of global growth this year.\u201d She added: \u201cAny business looking at growth opportunities should be considering these regions that are responsible \u2013 by far \u2013 for the biggest contributions to global growth,\u201d Forbes told the Brighton and Hove Chamber of Commerce. Opportunities in the Chinese market for British exporters have already expanded rapidly in recent years. Jonathan Ashworth, of Morgan Stanley, said: \u201cIf you include Hong Kong, China is now the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest export market and the third-largest source of imports. Moreover, China is now the top export market for several sectors such as car manufacturing and higher education, and is growing rapidly in tourism.\u201d As well as trade links, the Treasury has made clear its enthusiasm for attracting Chinese direct investment, not just in building the next generation of UK nuclear facilities, but on some of the many projects that form part of Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse plan, including HS2 and even housing developments in Sheffield and Leeds. In recent years, Chinese companies have been busy buying up internationally renowned brands and landmarks, including New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel, the former headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank and, in the UK, the venerable Weetabix. Alex White, country analysis director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cThe broader context is that China is shifting from being a net importer of capital to a net exporter of capital,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2017, China will be investing more overseas than the rest of the world is investing in China.\u201d Labour has questioned the chancellor\u2019s approach, raising China\u2019s poor human rights record and warning of the security risks that might emerge as a result of allowing China to invest in strategic assets, such as nuclear power. But there are economic risks, too: the more closely the UK is entangled with the Chinese economy, the greater the impact if, as some analysts fear, the country is on the brink of a deep downturn. Ashworth points out that UK banks\u2019 exposure to China is already considerably higher than the banks of other major economies. White says: \u201cIt is probably reasonable for the UK to bet on China. But it\u2019s not completely out of the question that the Chinese economy might go through a very hard landing and obviously, the more interconnected you are, the greater the risks from that.\u201d But for the time being, nothing will deter Osborne from rolling out the red carpet.",

Jonathan Ashworth, of Morgan Stanley, said: \u201cIf you include Hong Kong, China is now the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest export market and the third-largest source of imports. Moreover, China is now the top export market for several sectors such as car manufacturing and higher education, and is growing rapidly in tourism.\u201d</p> <p>As well as trade links, the Treasury has made clear its enthusiasm for attracting Chinese direct investment, not just in building the next generation of UK nuclear facilities, but on some of the many projects that form part of Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse plan, including HS2 and even housing developments in Sheffield and Leeds.</p> <p>In recent years, Chinese companies have been busy buying up internationally renowned brands and landmarks, including New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel, the former headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank and, in the UK, the venerable Weetabix.</p> <p>Alex White, country analysis director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cThe broader context is that China is shifting from being a net importer of capital to a net exporter of capital,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2017, China will be investing more overseas than the rest of the world is investing in China.\u201d</p> <p>Labour has questioned the chancellor\u2019s approach, raising China\u2019s poor human rights record and warning of the security risks that might emerge as a result of allowing China to invest in strategic assets, such as nuclear power.</p> <p>But there are economic risks, too: the more closely the UK is entangled with the Chinese economy, the greater the impact if, as some analysts fear, the country is on the brink of a deep downturn. </p> <p>Ashworth points out that UK banks\u2019 exposure to China is already considerably higher than the banks of other major economies.</p> <p>White says: \u201cIt is probably reasonable for the UK to bet on China. But it\u2019s not completely out of the question that the Chinese economy might go through a very hard landing and obviously, the more interconnected you are, the greater the risks from that.\u201d </p> <p>But for the time being, nothing will deter Osborne from rolling out the red carpet.</p>",

    "webTitle": "US consumer confidence beats forecasts: worldmarkets move higher  - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Despite worries about the global economy and volatile stock markets, US consumers appear more confident than analysts had expected, but industrial production in the country fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile hopes that the US Federal reserve would decide not to raise interest rates this year after all helped stock markets end the week on a positive note. In the UK, Bank of England policy maker Kristin Forbes said in a speech in Brighton that fears about emerging markets were overdone, and the next move in UK interest rates was up - and not far off at that. Not all of her colleagues at the Bank agree, however. Meanwhile the eurozone slumped back into negative inflation, putting more pressure on the European Central Bank - which meets next week - to extend its quantitative easing programme. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. Investors have suffered another volatile week, with shares hit initially by further poor Chinese data before recovering ground on hopes that the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates this year after all. Markets ended the week on a firmer note however, with the expectation of further support from central banks outweighing - for the moment - concerns about global growth. But with Chinese GDP figures due on Monday and the latest European Central Bank meeting due on Thursday, the uncertainty is not likely to end just yet. But for the moment world markets, as measured by the MSCI world index, are at two month highs while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose to its highest level in five weeks. The final scores elsewhere showed: The FTSE 100 finished 39.37 points or 0.62% higher at 6378.04, although it fell 0.59% on the week German\u2019s Dax added 0.39% to 10,104.43 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.59% at 4702.79 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.54% to 22,337.66 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.28% better at 10,231.5 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 1.23% to 685.95 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 32 points or 0.18% higher. The day\u2019s US economic news offers a mixed message, which is not helpful in gauging when the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, sayd James Knightley of ING Bank: [The] data has been a bit of a mixed bag with industrial production falling 0.2% month on month, in line with expectations, although there was a three tenths of a percentage point upward revision to August\u2019s figure (to -0.1% from -0.4% month on month). Still, in aggregate, output is only up 0.4% year on year. Mining remains the main drag given the plunge in oil prices has resulted in a steep drilling decline while dollar strength and weak external demand are contributors to manufacturing softness. However, there was better news elsewhere with University of Michigan consumer confidence for October rising to 92.1 from 87.2, which was above the 89.0 consensus expectation. Both the current conditions and expectations components rose, which suggests that households are in decent financial shape and are willing to spend as we head towards holiday season. There was also some reasonably encouraging news from the Job openings data. While the actual number of new job openings fell, the trend is still upwards and the hiring rate and quit rate numbers suggest that job turnover is rising, which typically bodes well for higher wage growth. The key question is whether we see this materialise in the employment reports in the next couple of months. If not, the Fed doves will win the argument and there won\u2019t be a Fed rate hike this year. More data from the US, this time showing the number of job openings falling from 5.66m in July to 5.37m in August. American consumers are more confident than analysts had expected, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment survey. The preliminary index for October came in at 92.1 compared to expectations of 89 and a final September reading of 87.2. Last month\u2019s initial reading was lower at 85.7. This is the first increase in four months. Here\u2019s our report on rogue trader Kweku Adoboli, who was today banned from working in the City for a scam that cost UBS \u00a31.5bn. The Financial Conduct Authority barred Adoboli from working in the financial professions after finding he was \u201cnot a fit and proper person to perform any functions as his conduct demonstrates a serious lack of honesty, integrity and reputation\u201d. The Ghanaian citizen was released from Maidstone prison in Kent in June, halfway through his sentence, having been convicted on two counts of fraud over what was described at the time as the biggest scam in UK history. He was acquitted on four separate charges of false accounting. In a statement, he said: \u201cThis prohibition order marks the closing of a difficult chapter for me. I fully recognise the reasons for my prohibition and thank the FCA for their restraint. My hope now is to move forward in a positive way to help others learn from the mistakes I\u2019ve made.\u201d He is fighting deportation from the UK \u2013 where he was once head boy at a Quaker boarding school in Yorkshire \u2013 and hopes to give advice on preventing fraud in the future. Full story here: Ahead of the latest University of Michigan confidence survey, here\u2019s how things have been looking over the past few years, courtesy Bloomberg: Wall Street is following in the wake of other global markets and moving higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 34 points or 0.2%, continuing its strong run helped by better than expected results from industrial group\u2019s General Electric and Honeywell. The S&amp;P 500 is currently 0.16% higher. GE reported a 29% fall in earnings to $2.51bn but this was better than analysts\u2019 expectations. It saw declines in its oil and gas business but these were offset by the performance of its jet engine and power turbine operations. Every piece of US data is now watched carefully to see how it might influence the US Federal Reserve in its interest rate policy. But there is not too much to glean from the latest figures. US industrial production dipped 0.2% in September, in line with expectations. August\u2019s figure was revised to show a 0.1% decline compared to the 0.4% fall originally reported. Weakness in the oil and gas sector was mainly responsible for the fall. Later comes the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey. Now here\u2019s an admission. Credit Suisse has said its clients have no idea what is going on out there in the markets. They are \u201clost and bearish.\u201d The bank says: Never have we seen so many clients who just do not know what is happening and have cashed up. US investors, in particular, were clearly cautious. European and especially Asian investors were more constructive. Reasons for the bearishness: Global growth being at \u2018growth recession\u2019 levels, China, QE running out of steam, the rise in non-energy high yield credit spreads, the risk of the Fed policy mistake (with most clients believing, correctly in our opinion, that a December rate rise would be a policy mistake and see Yellen\u2019s communication as being poor), US equities being expensive on \u2018normalised\u2019 earnings and the 4-week moving average of earnings revisions falling close to a 4-year low. Two new concerns often cropped up: (i) the $0.5trn decline in global foreign exchange reserves, with this being likened to monetary tightening...[But] 80% of the decline is due to China, where the fall is largely being sterilised. (ii) The rising political tide against profits (living wage in the UK, the BEPS OECD initiative on corporate taxation). What was not mentioned: Eurozone politics, US debt ceiling, Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria or the UK referendum on the EU. In sum, we think clients are focused more on risks, which are abnormally high, rather than reward, which is also high, with the equity risk premium, for example, at 5.8%. We would agree, however, that visibility is abnormally low. Chinese investors appear to have regained their appetite for risk. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 6.5% this week, helped by speculation that Beijing might do more to stimulate its economy. Some bolder traders have been borrowing more money to buy shares, anticipating that markets are going to rally this autumn. Xiao Shijun, an analyst at Guodu Securities, explains (via the WSJ): \u201cSome medium- to long-term investors are betting that the market has bottomed and thus are more confident to add leverage.\u201d And there are signs that the authorities have relaxed their recent clampdown on lending, which was imposed to calm excessive speculation. China\u2019s outstanding margin financing has risen 5.6% since the start of the month and looks to have bottomed, according to IG\u2019s Angus Nicholson. Ever wondered what you have to do to get banned from the City? Well, running up losses of \u00a31.4bn through rogue trading will do the trick. The Financial Conduct Authority - Britain\u2019s City watchdog - has declared today that former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli cannot work in the industry again after demonstrating \u201ca clear and serious lack of honesty and integrity.\u201d It added: \u201cIn reaching its decision, the FCA has considered all the relevant circumstances and the severity of the risk posed by Mr Adoboli to consumers and financial institutions, and to confidence in the market generally.\u201d Adoboli was released from prison this summer, having been sentenced to seven years in 2012 for Britain\u2019s biggest ever fraud. He is now fighting efforts to deport him to Ghana, where he was born in 1980. Kristin Forbes\u2019 speech today highlights that the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate-setting committee is split into several camps, even though it voted 8-1 to leave borrowing costs unchanged last week. IHS\u2019s Howard Archer has broken them down: The current position seems to be that Ian McCafferty is already voting for interest rate hike from 0.50% to 0.75%, while Kristin Forbes and (seemingly still) Martin Weale both believe interest rates need to rise before long. In contrast, Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe are clearly far off from voting for a rate hike while Ben Broadbent has also recently indicated that he is some way off from such a move. That leaves governor Mark Carney, and deputy governors Minouche Shafik and Jon Cunliffe in the centre ground. Capping off a busy week for views out of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee, Kristin Forbes is giving a speech in Brighton. The key message for markets from Forbes is that the next move in rates is up and is not too far off. That puts her at odds with the Bank\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane who has raised the prospect of the next move being down, even further below the current record low Bank rate of 0.5%. Forbes says, however, that pessimism about the global economy is overdone. Forbes, who is also professor of Management and Global Economics at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, told the Brighton and Hove Chamber of Commerce that: \u201cAlthough the risks and uncertainties in the global economy have increased, the widespread pessimism is overstated.\u201d \u201cDespite the doom and gloom sentiment, the news on the international economy has not caused me to adjust my prior expectations that the next move in UK interest rates will be up and that it will occur sooner rather than later.\u201d \u201cOf course, if some of the potential risks to emerging markets play out \u2013 such as a sharper slowdown than expected or financial crisis of some type \u2013 then the UK economy is unlikely to be immune. But based on what has actually occurred to date, the limited direct exposure of the UK to emerging markets (even when incorporating second-round effects through other countries such as Germany), appears manageable. This is especially true when considered relative to the strength of the UK\u2019s domestic-led expansion \u2013 which shows all signs of continuing, even if at a more moderate pace than in the earlier stages of the recovery.\u201d At its last meeting, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) left rates at a record low of 0.5%. But one of the nine rate-setters, Ian McCafferty, voted for a rate rise. Perhaps Forbes will be joining him soon.... Investors who believe the Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise rates this year could be making a mistake, argues Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz. El-Erian, former CEO of bond-trading giant Pimco, believes that that Janet Yellen and colleagues could take the plunge at their meeting in December, given the strength of the US jobs market. He\u2019s written his views up for Bloomberg. Here\u2019s the conclusion: After a frustratingly slow post-crisis start, the U.S. economy has had an impressive run of job creation. But further progress is dependent on important structural issues that are not easily addressed by Fed policy. Meanwhile, wage and inflation pressures are starting to build, though in a rather modest fashion. And concerns about excessive risk-taking -- an unintended side effect of the central bank\u2019s prolonged use of unconventional monetary policy -- are far from settled. Taken together, this suggests that, even though an October rate hike can almost certainly be discounted, it would be premature to entirely rule out action by the Fed in December, let alone to predict it would be postponed until March of next year. Only a lot more signs of weakness in the domestic economy, as well as a return of global financial market instability, would make that a sure bet. World stock markets have hit their highest levels since August, driven by predictions that US interest rates are staying low for a while yet. The main European indices have all gained nearly 1% this morning, following those gains in Asia overnight and a rally on Wall Street yesterday. That has pushed the MSCI World Index up by 1.38% to levels not seen since August 21. Global markets have now gained 6% in October. So unless there\u2019s a major reverse next week, the MSCI will post its best month since 2011. That\u2019s quite a bounceback from this summer\u2019s turmoil, which saw around $11 trillion wiped off global stocks. The prospect of more ultraloose monetary policy, plus a little more calm over China\u2019s slowdown, are pushing shares up. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says traders are anticipating more stimulus in Europe and China, rather than worrying about the Fed whipping away the punchbowl with an early rate hike: Hopes of a delayed rate hike in the US and additional stimulus from Europe and China is helping global stock markets finish the week on a high. Shares across Asia have hit a two month high while the Shanghai Composite is setting up for its best weekly performance since early June. Weak US inflation data, albeit above expectations, further bruised the case for a Federal Reserve rate rise. Markets are looking ahead to next week when the ECB meeting and China\u2019s GDP report provide opportunities for the European Central Bank and the People\u2019s Bank of China to increase stimulus. Here\u2019s the situation. FTSE 100: up 0.8% or 49 points at 6,388 German DAX: up 0.86% or 86 points at 10,151 French CAC: up 0.8% or 38 points at 4,713 Japan\u2019s Nikkei: Closed up 1.1% or 194 points at 18,291 China\u2019s Shanghai Composite: Closed up 1.6% or 53 points at 3,391. Minicab-hailing app Uber has just won a victory in the high court. A judge has ruled that its GPS technology does not break violate the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 bans private hire cars from being equipped with taximeters. My colleague David Hellier explains: Had it lost the case, the company would have been forced to change its service to comply with rules that protect traditional black-cab drivers. Here\u2019s the full story: It\u2019s official, the eurozone has slumped back in negative inflation again, intensifying pressure on the European Central Bank to act. Eurostat has confirmed that prices across the euro area fell by 0.1% in September, down from an inflation rate of +0.1% in August. The decline is mainly due to weak energy prices. Cheaper oil is driving down the costs of fuel -- good news for consumers and business, but it does drag the eurozone inflation rate further from the 2% target. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explains: This marked the first deflation since March and was down from consumer price inflation of 0.1% in August and 0.3% in May. A marked relapse in oil prices and very weak commodity prices first undermined and then reversed the upward trend in Eurozone consumer prices that had seen it move from deflation of 0.6% in January to inflation of 0.3% in May. The ECB has already said it could boost its bond-buying stimulus programme if needed. And with prices falling in many eurozone countries, it could be prompted to act soon: Britain\u2019s John Lewis has reported underwhelming sales for the last week - with takings at its department store flat year-on-year. But within the figures, there\u2019s a trend of customers revising the horrors delights of the 1970s, with strong demand for knitted pouffes and platform shoes. Homeowners are even painting their rooms in brown and orange, risking terrifying flashbacks for those of a certain age. Hugo Boss shares are being bashed this morning, after it become the latest fashion chain to suffer from the Chinese slowdown. They fell by 8.5% in early trading, after the German fashion firm cuts its profit and sales outlook. It blamed a slowdown in China, echoing Burberry on Thursday. Hugo Boss also revealed that sales growth in the US has dropped too, due to weaker spending by tourists. That suggests the strengthening dollar is hurting, leaving overseas visitors with less to spend. Food giant Nestl\u00e9 is missing out on today\u2019s rally, after missing sales forecasts and cutting its outlook. Shares in Nestl\u00e9 are down 2% today, with investors disappointed that revenue has fallen by 2.1% in the first nine months of the year. The Swiss firm also cut its 2015 outlook to around 4.5%, below its long-term target of between 5% and 6%. Nestl\u00e9 suffered emerging market from weakness in China, and also a major food recall in India. In June, Indian regulators slammed its Maggi instant noodle products as \u201cunsafe and hazardous\u201d. The diesel emissions scandal appears to have cost Volkswagen some ground in the European auto sector. New figures released this morning showed that car registrations rose for the 29th month running, as the industry continued to recover from the dark days of the eurozone debt crisis. Total sales jumped by 9.8% in September, but Volkswagen only sold 8.3% more cars compared to a year ago. This cut VW\u2019s market share to 23.3%, down from 23.7%. That\u2019s not a major decline - but remember that the emissions scandal only broke in mid-September, so this could be just the start.... Back in Shanghai, the Chinese stock market has hit a seven-week high as fears over its economy recede a little. The Shanghai Composite jumped 1.4% today, suggesting traders aren\u2019t too worried about Monday\u2019s growth figures: European stock markets are putting recent turbulence behind them. The main indices are all up in early trading, with Britain\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index jumping by 34 points of 0.5%. That means the Footsie has gained over 5% in October. Here\u2019s the situation: European markets are now on track for their longest series of gains since April, points out Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He adds: This remains driven by weak/mixed macro data from China, US and Europe delaying expectations for a Fed rate hike and high hopes of additional global stimulus which is considered positive for risk appetite. Yesterday\u2019s US inflation data is also helping to push money into shares. Prices fell by 0.2% month-on-month in September, leaving the price of living unchanged year on year. \u201cMoney managers are saying it looks increasingly like the Fed will not hike because the data around the world is coming in weak,\u201d Mads Pedersen, head of global asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cLukewarm data is good for equities again, just like it has been for most of this recovery.\u201d A flurry of weak corporate data in recent days has left most economists convinced that the Fed won\u2019t raise interest rates at its monetary policy meeting later this month. This week we\u2019ve seen falling profits at Goldman Sachs, a profit warning from Walmart, and even falling demand for high end Winnebagos as US consumers cut back. And earlier this month, the US employment figures were a big disappointment - with much fewer new jobs created than expected (just 142,000). That doesn\u2019t add up to the first rise in US interest rates since the financial crisis began. David Levy, portfolio manager at Kenjol Capital Management, explains: \u201cInvestors are reacting to the increasing likelihood that the Fed rate hike, which had been expected just a month ago in September, now likely won\u2019t happen during the course of this year.\u201d There\u2019s also talk in the markets that the Chinese government could announce fresh stimulus measures soon. Pressure on Beijing could grow on Monday, when Chinese GDP figures are released. Economists predict that growth slowed to 6.8% in the last quarter, down from 7% in Q2. Asia-Pacific stock markets have hit their highest level in two months, as traders in Tokyo, Shanghai and Melbourne anticipate that the era of ultra-low global interest rates isn\u2019t over yet. Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped 1%, on hopes that the US Federal Reserve isn\u2019t going to end the party this month. Other stock markets in the region are also showing gains: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be watching the US economy closely today, for signs that the world\u2019s largest economy may be slowing. There are two pieces of economic data on the agenda: US industrial production, at 2.15pm BST The Michigan Consumer Confidence report, at 3pm BST Economists reckon the figures might be weak, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u2019s US industrial and manufacturing production data for September are expected to reinforce the disappointing narrative with declines in both of -0.3% and -0.2% respectively, both of which would be negative for the second month in succession. And negative economic data looks good for stocks right now.... ...so shares in Europe are expected to rise, as traders bet that the US Federal Reserve could leave interest rates unchanged for the rest of the year. As Hewson puts it, with the data so mixed.... .... is hard to see how policymakers can arrive at a consensus for what would be a momentous decision of being the first rise in US rates for 9 years. No-one will want to be remembered for getting a call of that magnitude wrong. There\u2019s also financial results from foodmaker Nestl\u00e9, French supermarket Carrefour, and UK retailer John Lewis (of which more shortly....).",

Still, in aggregate, output is only up 0.4% year on year. Mining remains the main drag given the plunge in oil prices has resulted in a steep drilling decline while dollar strength and weak external demand are contributors to manufacturing softness.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>However, there was better news elsewhere with University of Michigan consumer confidence for October rising to 92.1 from 87.2, which was above the 89.0 consensus expectation. Both the current conditions and expectations components rose, which suggests that households are in decent financial shape and are willing to spend as we head towards holiday season.<br></p> <p>There was also some reasonably encouraging news from the Job openings data. While the actual number of new job openings fell, the trend is still upwards and the hiring rate and quit rate numbers suggest that job turnover is rising, which typically bodes well for higher wage growth. The key question is whether we see this materialise in the employment reports in the next couple of months. If not, the Fed doves will win the argument and there won\u2019t be a Fed rate hike this year.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-16T14:58:05.506Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-562108f7e4b094f6bf347b8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-16T14:26:51.552Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bencasselman/statuses/655024088130453504\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There were 1.5 job seekers for every opening in Aug--up a hair from July but still below prerecrisis levels. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JOLTS?src=hash\">#JOLTS</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/wBKqEE8nB8\">pic.twitter.com/wBKqEE8nB8</a></p>&mdash; Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bencasselman/status/655024088130453504\">October 16, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bencasselman/statuses/655025263030464512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Job openings are up 125% since end of recession, but actual hiring up less than 40%. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JOLTS?src=hash\">#JOLTS</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/bTvTprGR8H\">pic.twitter.com/bTvTprGR8H</a></p>&mdash; Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bencasselman/status/655025263030464512\">October 16, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5621040fe4b094f6bf347b7a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-16T14:08:39.359Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More data from the US, this time showing the number of job openings falling from 5.66m in July to 5.37m in August.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bencasselman/statuses/655021220149264385\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Job openings fell in August.

US investors, in particular, were clearly cautious. European and especially Asian investors were more constructive.</p> <p>Reasons for the bearishness: Global growth being at \u2018growth recession\u2019 levels, China, QE running out of steam, the rise in non-energy high yield credit spreads, the risk of the Fed policy mistake (with most clients believing, correctly in our opinion, that a December rate rise would be a policy mistake and see Yellen\u2019s communication as being poor), US equities being expensive on \u2018normalised\u2019 earnings and the 4-week moving average of earnings revisions falling close to a 4-year low.</p> <p>Two new concerns often cropped up: (i) the $0.5trn decline in global foreign exchange reserves, with this being likened to monetary tightening...[But] 80% of the decline is due to China, where the fall is largely being sterilised. (ii) The rising political tide against profits (living wage in the UK, the BEPS OECD initiative on corporate taxation).</p> <p> What was not mentioned: Eurozone politics, US debt ceiling, Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria or the UK referendum on the EU.</p> <p>In sum, we think clients are focused more on risks, which are abnormally high, rather than reward, which is also high, with the equity risk premium, for example, at 5.8%. We would agree, however, that visibility is abnormally low.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5620e25ae4b094f6bf347af8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-16T12:38:21.848Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79f97e049c591d8e96e1da2ea9275f2546084c97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f97e049c591d8e96e1da2ea9275f2546084c97/0_0_4824_3342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese investors, 16 Oct 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Chinese investors appear to have regained their appetite for risk.</strong></p> <p>The Shanghai Composite Index gained 6.5% this week, helped by speculation that Beijing might do more to stimulate its economy.</p> <p>Some bolder traders have been borrowing more money to buy shares, anticipating that markets are going to rally this autumn.<br></p> <p><strong>Xiao Shijun</strong>, an analyst at <strong>Guodu Securities</strong>, explains (<em>via the WSJ</em>):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cSome medium- to long-term investors are betting that the market has bottomed and thus are more confident to add leverage.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And there are signs that the authorities have relaxed their recent clampdown on lending, which was imposed to calm excessive speculation.</p> <p>China\u2019s outstanding margin financing has risen 5.6% since the start of the month and looks to have bottomed, according to <strong>IG\u2019s Angus Nicholson</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d774d32ec4665db15569cdb74333a3e729996dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d774d32ec4665db15569cdb74333a3e729996dd/0_0_4770_3306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"16 Oct 2015, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China --- Chinese investors look at prices of shares (red for price rising and green for price falling) at a stock brokerage house in Nantong city, east China\u2019s Jiangsu province, 16 October 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5620e8a0e4b094f6bf347b10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-16T12:12:38.050Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ever wondered what you have to do to get banned from the City?<br></strong></p> <p>Well, running up losses of \u00a31.4bn through rogue trading will do the trick.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority - Britain\u2019s City watchdog - has declared today that former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli cannot work in the industry again after demonstrating \u201ca clear and serious lack of honesty and integrity.\u201d</p> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cIn reaching its decision, the FCA has considered all the relevant circumstances and the severity of the risk posed by Mr Adoboli to consumers and financial institutions, and to confidence in the market generally.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/kweku-adoboli-ubs-rogue-trader-released-early-prison-britains-biggest-fraud\">Adoboli was released from prison this summer</a>, having been sentenced to seven years in 2012 for Britain\u2019s biggest ever fraud.

And concerns about excessive risk-taking -- an unintended side effect of the central bank\u2019s prolonged use of unconventional monetary policy -- are far from settled.</p> <p>Taken together, this suggests that, even though an October rate hike can almost certainly be discounted, it would be premature to entirely rule out action by the Fed in December, let alone to predict it would be postponed until March of next year.

(The government\u2019s stake in RBS, though, is proving hard to shift.) Many of the rules intended to crack down on the industry are being rolled back. Clamour to make top bankers responsible for their mistakes after the Libor-rigging scandal led to legislation only two years ago that would reverse the burden of proof on bank bosses \u2013 they would have to show they had done the right thing, rather than regulators prove they broke the rules. This week George Osborne did a U-turn and put the onus back on the regulators. Requirements for banks to ringfence their high street operations from their riskier casino operations \u2013 put in place to avoid a repeat of the 2008 bailouts \u2013 are also being tweaked to offer concessions to the biggest players.

Robert Jenkins, a former fund manager and one-time policymaker at the Bank of England, has been alert for some time to the way the industry is pushing back on reforms. However, on Staley\u2019s appointment he is sanguine. \u201cSometimes it takes someone knowledgeable about investment banking to reform it. Knowing the beast means the fellow is less likely to be bamboozled by the investment bankers,\u201d he said. Customers of high street banks may also wonder if the wind has changed. The Competition and Markets Authority has been looking at how hard it has been to break the stranglehold of the big four despite the bailouts and damaged reputations. The findings of its 18-month investigation are due next week. Campaigners for banking reform hope it will not be a lost opportunity to inject more competition. It could be the last chance to rein in the big banks.",

However, on Staley\u2019s appointment he is sanguine. \u201cSometimes it takes someone knowledgeable about investment banking to reform it. Knowing the beast means the fellow is less likely to be bamboozled by the investment bankers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Customers of high street banks may also wonder if the wind has changed. The Competition and Markets Authority has been looking at how hard it has been to break the stranglehold of the big four despite the bailouts and damaged reputations. The findings of its 18-month investigation are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/competition-watchdog-could-end-dominance-of-britains-big-banks\">due next week</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/competition-watchdog-could-end-dominance-of-britains-big-banks\"> </a> Campaigners for banking reform hope it will not be a lost opportunity to inject more competition. It could be the last chance to rein in the big banks.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jes Staley is unlikely to be spending this weekend soaking up the autumn rays of sunshine aboard his luxury 91ft wenge wood yacht. Instead, Staley will be preparing for the perhaps the toughest interviews of his life. The 58-year-old American investment banker is Barclays\u2019 choice for its next chief executive, but Staley will have convince the Bank of England and City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that he\u2019s the right the man for the job. Following the 2008 banking meltdown, both the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA have the right to veto bank chief\u2019s appointments. The last American to run Barclays, \u201ccasino banker\u201d Bob Diamond, was forced to resign following a dressing down from then Bank of England governor Lord Mervyn King over Libor interest rate rigging. Before Staley has even been officially confirmed by Barclays as its choice to replace Diamond\u2019s successor, Antony Jenkins \u2013 who was sacked over the summer \u2013 politicians have lined up to call for further inquiries. Mark Garnier, a Conservative member of the Treasury select committee, called for Staley and Barclays\u2019 chairman, John McFarlane, to be hauled up before MPs to reassure them Staley\u2019s appointment does not \u201crepresent a shift in direction back to a more aggressive style of banking\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t strike me as the right person to take over a retail and commercial bank,\u201d Garnier said. \u201cThis sends out all the wrong signals.\u201d Vince Cable, the former business secretary who was instrumental in the ousting of Diamond, said Staley\u2019s appointment \u201conly reinforces\u201d the \u201cvery alien\u201d disconnect between British banks and the needs of small businesses. It\u2019s not the first time Barclays has considered hiring Staley, who lives with his Brazilian wife, Deby, in an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan and a mansion in Southampton, the Long Island playground of the Wall Street elite. The bank tapped up Staley, a Democrat who has held fundraisers at his plush apartment a stone\u2019s throw from the Guggenheim museum, in 2012 to replace Diamond but backed away due to fears of the political reaction to the vast amount of cash it would have to shell out to buy him out of his JP Morgan contract. That cost is now much reduced as Staley left JP Morgan in 2013 to join New York hedge fund BlueMountain Capital as managing partner. But he remains an investment banker at heart. He joined a forerunner of JP Morgan Chase straight from liberal Maine arts college Bowdoin in 1979, rising to become chief executive of its investment banking division. Staley, who was christened James but has been affectionately called Jes \u2013 not Jim \u2013 from childhood, was widely tipped as frontrunner to succeed Jamie Dimon as CEO of JP Morgan. Dimon describe Staley as having \u201cimpeccable character and integrity\u201d. Staley is said to have left JP Morgan after getting bored with waiting for Dimon, who has been CEO since 2005, to leave and concerns that the board might want younger blood. Dimon and Staley were both born in 1956. The banker was born in Boston, and remains an avid Red Sox fan, but moved cities every two years for most of this childhood because of his dad\u2019s job at Procter &amp; Gamble. Friends describe Staley as not your typical brash, boastful investment banker but a sensitive, reflective and respectful soul who concentrates on building strong teams around him rather than bullying subordinates. It has not always been so, according to his younger brother Peter who followed him in joining JP Morgan straight from college. Peter was shocked by his brother\u2019s attitude towards minorities when they overlapped at the bank three decades ago. \u201cHe used homophobic language,\u201d Peter, who was then a bond trader, told the Guardian. \u201cHe was just parroting the language of Wall Street \u2013 God knows I was hearing it every day on the trading floor.\u201d Peter said he was \u201cvery, very frightened\u201d about coming out to Jes as both gay and HIV-positive at the height of the Aids crisis in 1985. \u201cBack then it was pretty much a death sentence,\u201d Peter, who is now an LGBT and HIV/Aids activist, said. \u201cI was very afraid to tell him, I was coming out to the whole family and it had been my impression that he was one of the more homophobic members of my family.\u201d Peter was wrong to worry. \u201cHe became the most loving brother in the world to me,\u201d he said. While other families, particularly those with young children, spurned HIV-positive relatives due to fears about the transmission of the virus, Jes brought Peter closer into his family. \u201cI had heard so many stories over the years about people who were shunned, but I was invited to all of my nieces\u2019 birthday parties,\u201d said Peter, who is a primary figure in the Oscar-nominated Aids epidemic documentary How to Survive a Plague. \u201cIf there was any fear, they never showed it.\u201d Jes helped Peter by introducing him to the only other gay man he knew: his boss during a stint at JP Morgan in Brazil, whom Jes had previously mocked. The three of them decided it would be unwise for Peter to come out to the macho world of Wall Street, and he struggled on working before being forced to admit the truth when he became too sick to work. Later, Peter told Jes just quite how afraid he had been to come out to his brother. \u201cHe was deeply ashamed, and realised he had been using the language without realising.\u201d Without telling his brother, Jes set out on a mission to change the homophobic culture of Wall Street. He helped build up JP Morgan Pride and convinced his superiors to become a major funder of LGBT rights groups, including promoting awareness of gay and lesbian people in schools, which was very controversial at the time. When the Human Rights Campaign introduced rankings of Fortune 500 companies on LGBT issues in 2002, JP Morgan scored 100%. Staley has also been credited with mentoring some of JP Morgan\u2019s most powerful women executives. Jes, Peter and their two other siblings are still close even as they enter their sixth decades, and the four of them recently got back from a siblings-only holiday in Maine. The extended family also holiday on Jes and Deby\u2019s yacht, named Bequia after the Carribean island on which the couple spent their honeymoon. Staley describes Bequia, the interior of which was designed by Deby, who runs an interior design firm, as \u201cnot a big yacht, but it is a big boat\u201d. The company that helped the couple design it said: \u201cThey wanted not ostentation but \u2018a spirit of home\u2019.\u201d While the yacht was designed primarily for relaxed cruising, Staley has sailed her across the Atlantic to complete one of his \u201cbucket list\u201d life goals. Bequia and Staley also have race pedigree, as she won the Loro Piana Superyacht regatta in Porto Cervo, Sardinia, in 2013. As he collected the trophy, Staley shared his racing secret with the crowd: everyone on board must have at least one beer before the end of the race.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest steelmaker is set to deal a new blow to the industry by axing up to 1,200 jobs at a plant in Scunthorpe and at two sites in Scotland. A widening of the crisis in the industry came as Sajid Javid, the business secretary, promised to try to help competitiveness when he oversaw an emergency national steel summit in Rotherham, West Yorkshire. Tata Steel UK, which owns the rump of the former British Steel group, is expected to announce the Scunthorpe job losses next week. These redundancies will add to Tata\u2019s own earlier cuts and to the recent collapse of the Redcar steelworks on Teesside. SSI UK, owned by Thailand\u2019s Sahaviriya Steel Industries, went into liquidation earlier this month with the loss of 2,200 jobs after its owner said it could no longer sustain mounting losses. An industry source said the latest jobs cull at Tata, which includes the Dalzell and Clydebridge sites in Scotland \u2013 would be followed by further cuts across the company\u2019s long products division, which makes steel for the rail and construction industries. It is thought Tata, the Indian conglomerate that also owns Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley Tea, is also preparing to cut several hundred roles in operations that serve the Scunthorpe plant, mainly at its Rotherham site. However, sources suggested that if current market conditions prevail, Tata executives may opt to wind down the Scunthorpe operation over the next few years. One source said: \u201c[Tata Steel] really want to shut Scunthorpe; they want to get out of long products because to make that sort of steel in England is uncompetitive.\u201d Tata employs 3,000 people at the Scunthorpe site, with hundreds more in satellite operations within the long products division. The 151-year-old Scunthorpe plant has been on the endangered list ever since August, when Gary Klesch, the billionaire industrialist who owns the Klesch group of global industrial commodities, walked away from a deal to buy the lossmaking mill. Britain\u2019s steel industry has been battered by a toxic cocktail of cheap Chinese competition, high energy costs, a strong pound and slowing demand. CBI director general John Cridland described the job losses in Scunthorpe as devastating and said the government should work with business to develop a long-term industrial strategy. Javid said the government, which has been criticised for not intervening earlier, would set up working groups chaired by ministers which would look at how to win more contracts, learn from foreign competitors and make UK companies more competitive. \u201cThere is no straightforward solution to the complex global challenges facing the steel industry. But today was an important opportunity to bring the key players together and we now have a framework of action,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is committed to working closely with industry on both short-term and long-term issues and to doing everything we can to support both industry and the workers. A strong economy underpins everything and we will continue to focus on securing the UKs economic recovery across the UK.\u201d Losses at the country\u2019s biggest steelmaker doubled last year to \u00a3768m. Tata has responded by slashing jobs, mothballing the Llanwern works near Newport, South Wales, and embarking on the failed attempt to sell the Scunthorpe mill. Tata\u2019s Rotherham site operates within the steelmaker\u2019s long products division and specialises in making high-grade steels for the automotive, aerospace and civil engineering sectors. Tata Steel UK said: \u201cOur Long Products Europe business is working with employees and their trade union representatives on a programme to develop a future for the business. The economic conditions affecting the UK steel industry are well known. We are dealing with surging, and often unfairly traded, imports compounded by a strong pound and unhelpful policy costs.\u201d The plight of Scunthorpe comes as union leaders called on ministers to take \u201cconcrete and positive\u201d action to save Britain\u2019s steel industry at a crisis summit. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, which represents the majority of those affected, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeking further discussions with Tata Steel to understand the full detail, examine alternatives that may safeguard jobs and uphold our principle of opposing compulsory redundancies.\u201d The gathering of ministers and business and union leaders was called following the closure of SSI\u2019s plant in Redcar. Previously the government had shrugged off calls to intervene. Ministers acknowledge the industry faces terrible headwinds, but warn there is no magic bullet to solve these problems. The TUC said it was worried that the government was doing too little too late. Commenting on the potential Tata redundancies, TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThis would be a hammer-blow for British steel-making and manufacturing in the UK. Ministers have been far too slow to wake-up to the crisis facing heavy industry in Britain. Today\u2019s crisis summit should have happened months ago not at the eleventh hour.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An interest rate hike in the UK will come \u201csooner rather than later\u201d and pessimism about the state of the global economy is overdone, according to a Bank of England policymaker. Kristin Forbes, a member of the bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), was also upbeat about the domestic economy. She argued that the country had only limited exposure to emerging markets such as Russia and Brazil and that, despite signs of a slowdown in those markets, British businesses should not be deterred from building stronger links with them. Forbes\u2019s intervention, against the backdrop of a recovering UK economy, indicated that she is preparing to vote for rates to be raised from their current record low of 0.5%. \u201cDespite the doom and gloom sentiment, the news on the international economy has not caused me to adjust my prior expectations that the next move in UK interest rates will be up and that it will occur sooner rather than later,\u201d she said in a speech on Friday. Forbes conceded that if some of the potential risks to emerging markets play out \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown - \u201cthen the UK economy is unlikely to be immune\u201d. But she said the UK\u2019s exposure \u201cappears manageable\u201d. Her comments align her with fellow rate-setter Ian McCafferty, who has voted for higher rates at recent policy meetings, where the MPC has split 8-1 at recent gatherings in favour of holding rates steady. But the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said last month that rates may have to be cut further given signs of a slowdown in the UK and risks to the global economy from China. The newest member of the nine-person MPC, Jan Vlieghe, also left the door open to an interest rate cut this week when questioned by MPs. Highlighting low inflation, Vlieghe told parliament\u2019s Treasury committee that there was an option to cut rates but that the next move was \u201cmore likely to be up than down\u201d. Forbes, a US economics professor, said that on emerging markets, \u201crecent negative headlines merit a closer look\u201d. \u201cAfter considering the actual data and differences across countries, the actual news for this group is much more balanced (albeit not all bright),\u201d she said in her speech, entitled \u201cgrowing your business in the global economy: Not all doom and gloom\u201d. She was speaking a week after the International Monetary Fund warned central bankers that the world economy risks another crash unless they continue to support growth with low interest rates. Forbes referred to the IMF\u2019s latest downgrade to global growth prospects but noted that the fund had left its China forecasts unchanged. The data from China \u201chas not yet weakened by anything close to what the gloomy headlines imply\u201d, she added. More broadly, she felt the global outlook was also better than headlines suggested. \u201cAlthough the risks and uncertainties in the global economy have increased, the widespread pessimism is overstated,\u201d Forbes said. She told business leaders that they should not be deterred from trading with emerging markets by the recent negative news, which \u201cshould prove temporary\u201d. \u201cUK companies \u2013 as a whole \u2013 have been slow to expand into emerging markets. This may provide some stability over the next few months if the heightened risks in some of these countries become reality. But when viewed over a longer perspective, this limited exposure to emerging markets has caused the UK to miss out on growth opportunities in the past,\u201d Forbes said. UK interest rates were slashed to shore up the economy during the global financial crisis and they have stayed at a record low for more than six years. With inflation below zero and headwinds from overseas, economists do not expect a rate hike until well into next year. In the US, interest rates are also at a record low of near-zero. Policymakers had been signalling they could start hiking last month but then worries about China\u2019s downturn prompted them to wait. Still, the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, recently said the current global weakness will not be \u201csignificant\u201d enough to alter the central bank\u2019s plans to raise rates by December. Forbes was also optimistic that the UK could weather the turmoil and said its domestic-led expansion \u201cshows all signs of continuing, even if at a more moderate pace than in the earlier stages of the recovery.\u201d\u201d Howard Archer, an economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said Forbes\u2019 remarks reinforced the picture of a wide range of views on the rate-setting committee. \u201cThe current wide range of differing views within the MPC highlights just how uncertain the outlook for UK interest rates is \u2013 although it still seems to be very much a question of when will the Bank of England start to raise interest rates rather than will they,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Tui is among the day\u2019s main FTSE 100 fallers, following disappointment about the travel group\u2019s dividend policy. After last year\u2019s merger between Tui Travel and its parent company Tui AG, it promised that its dividends would rise by 10% more than earnings per share growth in 2014/15 and 2015/16, provided it performed in line with expectations. Analysts took that as providing a new base for dividend growth, but the company has clarified this as just a one-off bonus. Morgan Stanley said: We took the additional 10% growth in these years to be recurring, in other words to build a higher base off which future dividends would grow. This led to our previous dividend per share estimates of \u20ac0.56 in 2015 (+25%, i.e.\u20ac0.445 base plus 15% EBITA growth plus 10% boost), \u20ac0.65 in 2016 (+16%, i.e.\u20ac0.56 base plus 10% boost on \u20ac0.445 base plus 10% EBITA growth), and \u20ac0.74 in 2017 (+15%, i.e. \u20ac0.65 base plus 15% EPS growth). The company has nowclarified that the 10% increases in 2015 and 2016 are a one-off \u201cbonus\u201d, so inother words they reverse, leading to the drops in our dividend estimates, andleading to lower dividend per share growth than we had expected in 2017. We question the length of time it took for the company to clarify its dividend position, but...while disappointing, we see this as a communication issue rather than anything fundamental. Morgan Stanley believes the company could afford to pay out on the original assumptions: [Its] cash cover will exceed 2 times on our 2017 forecasts and beyond. Given investment opportunities seem relatively low returning (e.g. it has been buying aircraft, hotel and cruise assets), and the business could become even more asset light if it divested some of these assets, we think a cover below 2 times could be sustainable, suggesting a 2017 dividend per share of \u20ac0.70 or higher might be possible after all. Even so, Tui shares are down more than 2.5% or 32p to \u00a311.99.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are ending the week on a strong note, with investors buoyed by continuing hopes that the US Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates this year. The FTSE 100 is up 39.15 points at 6377.82, but is still on course for a slight loss over the whole weak (currently down 0.6%). Weak US consumer price figures added to the feeling there would not be a rate rise this year, while a fall in jobless claims also suggested the country\u2019s economy was not slowing down too dramatically. Industrial production and consumer confidence figures later could give more clues about how the US economy is progressing. But Primark owner Associated British Foods is missing out on the rally, down 20p at \u00a332.76 as Societe General reduced its recommendation from buy to hold on valuation grounds and some slight concerns about its US expansion. Analyst Warren Ackerman said: Yesterday, ABF\u2019s chief financial officer John Bason, and head of Primark Paul Marchant, hosted an analyst trip to Madrid, ahead of the opening of Primark\u2019s flagship store in Spain. Primark has been in Spain for a decade (its first European location) yet it is only now that it has opened in a prestigious high street location in Spain, illustrating just how much runway Primark still has in Continental Europe. Located on Gran Via - the Oxford Street of Madrid \u2013 it is situated next door to H&amp;M. At 132,000sq ft, it is the second largest store in the entire Primark estate and is the 41st in Spain and 6th in Madrid. Primark has been a huge success story in Spain with a 9% volume share (more than 300 basis points more than #2 player) in a very fragmented market. Cannibalisation could be a short term issue in Spain (as it has been recently in Germany and Holland) but it\u2019s not something we consider to be a fundamental concern. We are downgrading on valuation as it has hit our \u00a333 target price. ABF trades on 33 times 2016 PE which implies around 40 times for Primark and 20 times EBITDA implied in our sum of the parts. We continue to think Primark will compound with like for like growth averaging 2-3% per annum and double digit space growth, but this is now fairly reflected in valuation. We also confess to being a little nervous about its US debut. Inevitably there will be many lessons to learn as the Primark brand is not known in the US and it will take time to gain traction. We see the potential in North East US and Primark\u2019s \u2018pull model\u2019 means its learns quickly, but we think the roll-out programme beyond its initial 8 US locations is likely to be slow and steady. Early comments that it has been a little surprised by customer shopping patterns (Sundays busier than Saturdays) and the uniqueness of every location suggests it\u2019s very much in learning mode. This isn\u2019t in anyway a surprise, but does suggest there could be some \u2018growing pains\u2019 in the US. ABF will update on its debut in the US at its 2015 results in November. In terms of LFL growth, at its last trading statement it was confirmed that 2015 like for like will be 1% but with a strong final quarter up 2-3%. Comps are undemanding in the first quarter of 2016 so we would expect a further acceleration in like for like growth in the short term but currency remains a very significant headwind across the business and the key reason that 2016 is likely to see little earnings per share growth. Belatedly marking to market for foreign exchange, we downgrade 2016 earnings per share estimates by 4% which means waiting to 2017 until we see a meaningful earnings bounce-back, assuming foreign exchange headwinds don\u2019t get in the way again. We continue to like the fundamental story but 33 times PE for 2017 earnings per share recovery and some risk in Primark US means that the risk-reward is more balanced from here (in our view). Mining shares are among the gainers with Glencore up 3.5p at 121.25p and Anglo American adding 3.5p to 680.5p. Rio Tinto has risen 11p to \u00a325.24 as a strong performance in iron ore lifted its third quarter results. Bernstein analysts said: Rio unsurprisingly reported record high levels of iron ore shipments in the third quarter. Rio\u2019s competitive position remains unbeaten in iron ore due to the world-class quality of its assets, especially in the current price environment. The picture looks quite different in copper. Production fell as much as 24% year on year in the third quarter despite the ramp up at Oyu Tolgoi. Moreover, Rio has revised downwards its production guidance for this year to 510kt, from a range of 500-535kt previously. We think that the current copper prices should encourage all producers, even the low-cost miners, to curtail the highest-cost portion of their production. Overall, operational results were broadly in line with our expectations. We reiterate our outperform rating on the stock. But with gold and silver edging back as investors turn away from supposedly safer assets again, Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo has fallen 6p to 754.7p and Randgold Resources is down 6p at \u00a344.88. Among the mid-caps Icap is down 3% to 448p as Barclays downgraded the inter-dealer broker from buy to equal weight. According to Thomson Reuters, no analyst covering the stock now has a buy rating. Barclays said: The Icap share was a strong outperformer between January and May but since then has come off and is now only up 1% year to date (versus FTSE Allshare down 3%). Our analysis of Icap\u2019s electronic volumes shows weakening trends in recent months contributing to this. Volume comparisons get tougher from September 2015 onwards and the European Investment banks are continuing to shrink their FICC [Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities] divisions. With Icap management suggesting its cost response is likely to be limited to support function rationalisation and slowly lowering comp. ratios, we believe the earnings per share recovery story is stalling. We cut our rating to equal weight and target price to 500p [from 600p], reflecting lower earnings per share estimates and raised discount rate to 10.5%.",

      "bodyText": "Crank up the Demis Roussos, break out the stuffed olives and warm the Black Tower. Britain is getting its Abigail\u2019s Party started as we return to the 1970s in our shopping habits, according to John Lewis. With sales of vinyl records soaring, John Lewis\u2019 annual survey of its customers shopping habits reveals retro-technology including record players and wall clocks are returning to homes being decorated in the brown and orange tones of Mike Leigh\u2019s 1977 play about a suburban drinks party. The retailer\u2019s How We Shop, Live &amp; Look report for 2015 suggests other trends from 40 years ago are returning, including macrame pouffes, sales of platform shoes continuing to grow, and wallpapers (up 11%). Even modern technology, such as headphones and cameras, is being given a retro spin. Sales of classic Vitra Eames chairs bounced 758%. Fashions in items for the home echo similar trends in clothing. Seventies-inspired designer looks first returned to the catwalk three years ago, but are expected to reach the peak of popularity on UK high streets ahead of Christmas. \u201cFashion has gone full circle,\u201d said John Lewis chief executive Andy Street. Sales of platform shoes are up by 14% compared to last year at the department store. Cords, suede and flares are all on trend in shades of caramel and coffee. It\u2019s a continuation of a fashion flashback that drove thousands of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s shoppers to snap up its vintage-influenced suede skirt and brought flares swishing back to Gucci\u2019s catwalk this spring. John Lewis says Brits are becoming much more adventurous about how they are prepared to style themselves and their homes \u2013 thanks to the influence of social media. Inspiration from sites such as Pinterest, Instagram and Facebook is encouraging shoppers to become their own stylists, while vloggers such as Zoella and Sali Hughes are helping people create tricky hair or make-up looks. Desire for an instant fashion fix has driven an 86% rise in sales of women\u2019s clothing via mobile devices including phones and tablet computers. Street believes that very modern-day surge in online shopping will underpin a solid 2% rise in sales this Christmas. Wages are rising ahead of inflation, giving shoppers more free cash to spend. But Street warns that retailers of clothing, homewares might never enjoy as big a proportion of shoppers\u2019 spending as they had in the past as shoppers spend more on services. A quarter of John Lewis customers surveyed said they were spending more on holidays abroad this year. \u201cIt is obvious is that customers do have more disposable income than last year. Some of the things they are spending their income on \u2013 eating out and holidays have had a good run,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is interesting is whether that increase income will feed through into traditional non-food ... Food has taken a progressively smaller share of spending. The question coming is whether the same thing is happening with non-food retail.\u201d One bright light for fashion and gift retailers, is that shoppers may be prepared to go back to more traditional presents this year as a spike in sales of tablet computers comes to an end. \u201cTwo years ago it was all about technology. That\u2019s not going to be the case this Christmas. It is going to be more balanced. People have to be more thoughtful as they can\u2019t just reach for a tablet,\u201d said Street. Luxury smoothie maker the Nutribullet is currently topping shoppers\u2019 wish lists at the department store, which says healthy eating and exercise gadgets are increasingly popular. John Lewis sold one Nutribullet blender every four minutes in the past year, with thousands of spiralizers \u2013 which can be used to turn vegetables such as courgettes into an alternative to spaghetti \u2013 also selling every week. Sales of performance-monitoring devices rose 52% in the past year, with sales of leading brand FitBit more than tripling. Yoga mats, weights and men\u2019s running tights (up 64%) are also flying through the tills. Different health trends are apparent from varying customer demands in different parts of the country. Norwich recorded the highest increase in sales of treadmills \u2013 more than the 150% increase in Glasgow \u2013 while the Nutribullet was most popular in the south-west London suburb of Kingston upon Thames. Sales of beauty treatments are also on the rise \u2013 up 11% at the group over the past year. That\u2019s part of a growing trend towards spending on services \u2013 from facials to dining out and TV installations. John Lewis\u2019s opened its first in-store spa at its new Birmingham premises as a trial which might be rolled out elsewhere if deemed a success. More cafes and restaurants, including Benugo in London and Hotel Chocolat - now in Edinburgh, are also going into stores to cater to demand. Street said: \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is the customers comes for a day out to a prestige location of their choice and want to make it more of an experience.\u201d Part of the reason the shops\u2019 purpose is changing is because an increasing proportion of sales are moving online. About one-third of the department store\u2019s sales are booked online, up from just 17% five years ago. In the past year, 60% of the company\u2019s online sales came via mobile devices. Street said he expected that figure to rise again this Christmas.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen lost ground against its competitors in September in a strong month for European car sales, as the German carmaker seeks to recover from the emissions-rigging scandal. Volkswagen\u2019s share of the EU car market fell to 23.3% last month - from 23.6% a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA). Its share was down from 26.5% in August. VW remains the market leader with brands including Porsche, Audi, Skoda and Seat, but rivals increased their share in September. Europe\u2019s second largest carmaker, France\u2019s PSA Group, which includes Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, had 9.9% of the market \u2013 up from 9.7% in August but down from 10.3% a year earlier. BMW increased its market share to 7.4% from 6.9% a year earlier, while Daimler\u2019s share rose to 6.1% from 5.7%. Overall, VW sales also lagged behind the market, growing 8.4% from a year ago to 315,905 vehicles compared with 9.8% for the industry. News of the scandal broke on 18 September, when the US government ordered Volkswagen to recall almost 500,000 cars after discovering the company had deployed sophisticated software to cheat emission tests, allowing its cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. It took several days for the full extent of the scandal to become known. Eleven million diesel vehicles worldwide are affected and on Thursday VW said it would recall 8.5m of the affected cars from across Europe. David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School, said: \u201cIt is too early to see the impact of the crisis on VW. It will take a while to play out. We might see some short-term impact over coming months, but the real impact will come if testing gets tougher and the cost of diesel goes up.\u201d This would hit all diesel carmakers, in particular German manufacturers, which have \u201cmade the wrong bets\u201d on diesel, Bailey said, while Japanese carmakers led by Toyota have been developing hybrid petrol cars. Other likely winners are Renault Nissan, which launched the electric Leaf in 2010, and California\u2019s Tesla Motors, which recently unveiled its latest electric vehicle, Model X. Volkswagen itself unveiled a strategy overhaul earlier this week to focus on electric and hybrid vehicles. The next version of the luxury Phaeton saloon car will be electric. Former science minister Lord Drayson has admitted that the Labour government\u2019s support for diesel vehicles, through tax breaks, had been a mistake, and called for a scrappage scheme for old diesels. Bailey backed the idea. About half of cars on the road in the UK and Europe are diesels. European car sales in September were boosted by ongoing scrappage schemes and the economic recovery across southern Europe, the ACEA said. Demand for new passenger cars rose in all major markets, with sales up 22.5% in Spain, boosted by a scrappage scheme. Sales rose 17.2% in Italy, 9.1% in France, 8.6% in the UK and 4.8% in Germany, the slowest major market. The UK market usually gets a boost in September due to the half-yearly change in registration plate numbers. Across the EU, car sales climbed nearly 10% to 1,356,868 cars last month. Over the first nine months of this year, new passenger car registrations increased by 8.8%, breaking through the 10m mark (10,413,675). However, this is still far below the pre\u2010crisis level of almost 12m cars registered during the same period in 2007. Estonia and Luxembourg were the only two EU countries where available data showed a drop in demand.",
