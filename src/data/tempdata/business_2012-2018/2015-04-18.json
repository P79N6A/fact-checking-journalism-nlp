      "bodyText": "When Tesco releases its results on Wednesday, some in the City expect Britain\u2019s biggest retailer to cap what has already been a disastrous year by announcing a record annual loss. Analysts have forecast the supermarket chain\u2019s trading profit for the year to 15 February to more than halve to \u00a31.4bn, from \u00a33.3bn last year \u2013 but the bad news is not likely to stop there, with huge uncertainty over the amount Tesco may be forced to write down on the value of its UK stores. Figures of \u00a31bn-\u00a32bn have been pencilled in, but Barclays, Tesco\u2019s joint house broker, said it expected the property writedown to be about \u00a33bn. Together with pensions and other charges, that could take the embattled grocer to a net loss of about \u00a33bn, Barclays said. Others speculate on wider writedowns taking in the Asian business and the reduced value of stock. The only certainty is that the figures will be ugly. Big reductions in the value of Tesco\u2019s property portfolio are symptomatic of problems that became starkly clear last year when decades of expansion in Britain and overseas caught up with the chain and it released a series of profit warnings that forced the departure of chief executive Philip Clarke. The once mighty grocer had milked its core UK business to the point where cash-strapped customers defected to competitors such as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Clarke\u2019s replacement, Dave Lewis, has pledged to get back to the basics of retailing by cutting prices and improving service and products, but this means short-term pain for Tesco investors. Tesco\u2019s figures will be bad, but the real story will be what Lewis plans to do next. We examine five of the main items on his list: THE BIG STORE CONUNDRUM During the recession, shoppers economised on food waste and petrol bills and started doing smaller shops locally. This was bad news for Tesco, which has the biggest number of large, out-of-town stores of the major supermarkets. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said last year that the big grocers would need to close one in five of their stores to cope with changing shopping habits. Lewis has closed 43 shops and cancelled plans for another 49, but about half of Tesco\u2019s stores are bigger than a typical supermarket\u2019s 40,000 sq ft. Lewis could clear the decks by shutting underperforming superstores but he may have other options. Richard Clarke, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said he expected him to do deals with other retailers to set up in big stores, filling surplus space and giving customers an extra reason to make the trip. He suggested chains that could sell to Tesco customers included Sports Direct and B&amp;M, the ambitious general merchandise discounter chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy. \u201cNobody goes to the post office or their high-street bank branch every week, but everyone still goes to the supermarket and there are various retailers who would want that sort of traffic,\u201d Clarke said. David McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said that the problems posed by redundant big stores were overstated: \u201cThe top five or so stores at Tesco opened in the 1980s and they take about \u00a32m a week each. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with those stores. To sort out any problem in retail there is only one thing you have to do and that\u2019s have a compelling offer with the right mix of price, quality and service.\u201d CUTTING PRICES AND RAISING SALES Aldi and Lidl have each been operating in Britain for more than 20 years but in the past five years the hard discounters have become powerful players, causing a severe headache for the major supermarkets. Tight household budgets have played into the discounters\u2019 hands and even upmarket shoppers have warmed to the prices and the quality of their limited ranges. Along with Morrisons, Tesco has suffered the most because its customers have tended to have low disposable incomes. Some analysts say Lewis needed to wage all-out war with billions of pounds of price cuts to reassert Tesco\u2019s reputation for value, but so far he has been selective, cutting prices on everyday items such as baked beans, Diet Coke and jammy dodgers. Despite some customers being underwhelmed, the strategy appears to be paying off. Tesco was the only one of the big four supermarkets to log an increase in sales in the three months to 1 February, recent figures from data company Kantar Worldpanel showed. Edward Garner, a director at Kantar, said: \u201cIn retailing, you can\u2019t deliver a recovery by cutting costs. You have to get sales up. After 13 months showing Tesco losing sales, they have had three months of rising sales, a real improvement \u2013 because they cut prices.\u201d He said Lewis should consider scrapping the \u201ceveryday value\u201d range and reinvesting the cost of running multiple own-brands into the price of its mainstream products. Rickin Thakrar, an analyst at Espirito Santo, said Lewis was on the right track but he had to stick with his plan for shoppers to trust Tesco for value again, meaning shareholders getting used to lower margins: \u201cThey have been mispriced for some time. They need to do it for a long time, doing the right thing so that if people haven\u2019t been getting a good deal for many years they will buy more things and your margin will improve.\u201d REVIVING THE TESCO BRAND Even before its recent disasters, Tesco\u2019s reputation had taken a beating. Once seen as a provider of good value food for the masses, it became known for wringing every last penny from farmers and other suppliers, carpeting the country in identical stores and putting pressure on small local shopkeepers. The 2013 horse meat scandal was another severe blow to its reputation among customers who already doubted if Tesco still offered value for money. Many observers were surprised that Tesco chose Lewis, a non-retailer, to replace the ousted Clarke, but his career at Unilever gives him a keen sense of what consumers value. There is no particular reason for shoppers to choose Unilever\u2019s Persil over another washing powder \u2013 but millions do. Clarke at Bernstein Research, said: \u201cThere will be a lot more around the slightly softer side of improving Tesco\u2019s image, not just with customers but with the community, suppliers and the investment community because there are still people who are a bit untrusting of Tesco after the accounting scandal.\u201d Lewis has hired advertising agency BBH and reputation consultants Blue Rubicon to advise on how to restore trust. New ad campaigns will take some time \u2013 the \u201cevery little helps\u201d slogan may be for the chop. McCarthy at HSBC said the brand was dented but not ruined. The key to reviving trust was getting the basics right: \u201cThere are 20m people every week who trust Tesco with their health and their children\u2019s health. Tesco has made mistakes and more people would shop there if the brand improved, but it isn\u2019t as damaged as people think \u2013 and that\u2019s what Dave Lewis is there for. It\u2019s about price, quality and service and he\u2019s made a start on all three.\u201d DECIDING WHAT TO SELL Tesco\u2019s tentacles have crept into many aspects of UK life over the years, including banking, mobile phones and restaurants. It has expanded into Asia and Europe, but shut an ill-fated attempt to conquer the US. Part of Lewis\u2019s job is to cut back on unneeded activities to concentrate on the main UK grocery business. The Giraffe restaurants and Harris + Hoole, the coffee chain, could be surplus to requirements. Slimming down is not just about simplifying the business. Tesco is weighed down by debt and its credit rating has been cut to junk. Lewis needs to raise up to \u00a33bn to strengthen the group\u2019s finances and is listening to offers for Dunnhumby, the data analytics business that powers the store card loyalty scheme and is thought to be worth about \u00a32bn. Tesco\u2019s European businesses have not performed well, but its Asian activities promise long-term growth in emerging markets. The most attractive Asian business for prospective buyers is Tesco\u2019s Thailand operation, but it has high margins that may be of value to Tesco in the long run. Thakrar at Espirito Santo argues that instead of quitting businesses with long-term value, Lewis should capitalise on his standing with shareholders by asking them for about \u00a32bn in a rights issue. He could supplement that money with a partial sale of Dunnhumby to keep a stake in the business. \u201cThey are very cognisant of the share price and they will probably be reluctant to do a rights issue but shareholders would support it and it\u2019s probably the right decision in the long term.\u201d MANAGING EXPECTATIONS After initial doubts about Lewis\u2019s credentials for the job, he is now being viewed as someone prepared to make tough decisions to put Tesco on a sound footing. Shares are up by almost 30% this year as a result. But turning around a ship as big as Tesco takes years not months and Lewis would be wise to play down attempts to portray him as a saviour. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cDave Lewis has brought an incredible degree of calm, decisiveness and direction to Tesco amid seeming chaos. The market has understandably bought into Mr Lewis\u2019s early indications and stabilised commercial performance. However, to us there is much to do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The moment US central bank chief Janet Yellen presses the button will be a massive economic event. The prospect that higher interest rates in the world\u2019s largest economy could come this year has already sent the dollar surging against the pound and euro. It has also fuelled fears of a meltdown in countries that have borrowed heavily in the US currency. Borrowing is inherently risky, all the more so when the interest rate can change at short notice. Higher costs for those that have borrowed in dollars could cripple companies in Brazil and Turkey that were enticed by cheap credit to fund a new factory or office building, or just to pay the wages. At the International Monetary Fund\u2019s spring meeting last week, chief economist Olivier Blanchard dismissed these concerns, arguing that companies may have hedged their position, while investors and finance ministers were well prepared. But a succession of market shocks in the last two years has convinced many in the financial community that a bigger crash is coming. There have been violent movements in currencies, bonds and commodity prices, especially crude oil and metals. A rise in US interest rates could add to this already volatile situation and drag stock markets towards another sudden crash. The IMF discussed the context in which another financial crash could occur in its latest financial stability report. It highlighted how any shock can send investors fleeing; with only sellers in the market, the price keeps plunging until someone believes it has gone far enough and starts buying. The nervous state of markets these days means there is generally either a surplus of buyers or a surplus of sellers; only rarely have we seen periods of calm with roughly equal numbers. Last January, for instance, the Swiss franc soared an unprecedented 30% after the central bank conceded that tracking the ailing euro was no longer possible. The previous year, markets had been rocked by the first hint from the US that it would end the era of ultra-cheap credit. It happened after former Fed boss Ben Bernanke let slip that he might stop pumping funds into the US economy through quantitative easing. The \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d \u2013 referring to the premature \u201ctapering\u201d of QE \u2013 sent shock waves through world markets and forced a clarification from the Fed to steady the ship. The IMF\u2019s financial stability report discussed the potential for Taper Tantrum II. The scenario was worse, yet the warning was described by Larry Fink, boss of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest private investment fund, as too optimistic. He is concerned about the European insurance industry, which must pay returns on pensions and other products at a time when the European Central Bank has been driving interest rates in much short-term government debt below zero; in other words, rather than earning interest on government bonds, insurers are paying to park their money in such assets. How could they survive for long under this regime, he asked. The IMF posed the same question, but again expected everything to work out for the best, somehow. Blanchard, who runs the economic unit and was by far the most sanguine IMF forecaster, mentioned Turkey as a potential victim of a US rate rise, as it would be likely to suffer an outflow of funds to the US as well as facing higher borrowing costs. Yet it could be saved, he thought, by negative rates in the eurozone that would be likely to trigger a flight of funds from Italy, Austria and Belgium to Istanbul. But while it is almost certain Turkey, Brazil, Russia and many others that have seen their businesses and governments borrow heavily in dollars to maintain their spending will suffer higher borrowing costs courtesy of Yellen, it seems unlikely funds in Europe now would opt to send billions of euros to banks in developing world economies such as Turkey, even when the returns are higher. That is because Turkey would be a risk too far when there are safe havens such as the US starting to offer a return on totally safe investments like Treasury bonds. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, who oversees the IMF risk monitor, reserved his deepest concerns for the previously fast-developing nations that have become vulnerable to volatile financial markets. \u201cStrains in the debt repayment capacity of the energy sector may become more evident in Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria and South Africa, as well as in countries reliant on oil revenues, such as Nigeria and Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sharp dollar appreciation entails additional risks for corporates and countries with large foreign currency debts.\u201d Maybe Yellen will look at US unemployment and consumer spending data at the Fed\u2019s meetings this month and in mid-June, and decide America remains too weak to withstand a rate rise. If she does, plenty of countries will cheer. Yet all the signals point towards a rise, with potential turmoil ahead.",

There have been violent movements in currencies, bonds and commodity prices, especially crude oil and metals. A rise in US interest rates could add to this already volatile situation and drag stock markets towards another sudden crash.</p> <p>The IMF discussed the context in which another financial crash could occur in its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/15/imf-economic-recovery-risk-loans-credit-cards\" title=\"\">latest financial stability report</a>. It highlighted how any shock can send investors fleeing; with only sellers in the market, the price keeps plunging until someone believes it has gone far enough and starts buying.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Turkey would be a risk too far when there are safe havens such as the US starting to offer a return on safe investments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The nervous state of markets these days means there is generally either a surplus of buyers or a surplus of sellers; only rarely have we seen periods of calm with roughly equal numbers. Last January, for instance, the Swiss franc soared an unprecedented 30% after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jan/15/stock-markets-and-copper-price-wef-global-risks-live\" title=\"\">the central bank conceded that tracking the ailing euro was no longer possible</a>.</p> <p>The previous year, markets had been rocked by the first hint from the US that it would end the era of ultra-cheap credit. It happened after former Fed boss Ben Bernanke let slip that he might stop pumping funds into the US economy through quantitative easing. The \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d \u2013 referring to the premature \u201ctapering\u201d of QE \u2013 sent shock waves through world markets and forced a clarification from the Fed to steady the ship.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s financial stability report discussed the potential for Taper Tantrum II. The scenario was worse, yet the warning was described by Larry Fink, boss of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest private investment fund, as too optimistic. He is concerned about the European insurance industry, which must pay returns on pensions and other products at a time when the European Central Bank has been driving interest rates in much short-term government debt below zero; in other words, rather than earning interest on government bonds, insurers are paying to park their money in such assets. How could they survive for long under this regime, he asked. The IMF posed the same question, but again expected everything to work out for the best, somehow.</p> <p>Blanchard, who runs the economic unit and was by far the most sanguine IMF forecaster, mentioned Turkey as a potential victim of a US rate rise, as it would be likely to suffer an outflow of funds to the US as well as facing higher borrowing costs. Yet it could be saved, he thought, by negative rates in the eurozone that would be likely to trigger a flight of funds from Italy, Austria and Belgium to Istanbul.</p> <p>But while it is almost certain Turkey, Brazil, Russia and many others that have seen their businesses and governments borrow heavily in dollars to maintain their spending will suffer higher borrowing costs courtesy of Yellen, it seems unlikely funds in Europe now would opt to send billions of euros to banks in developing world economies such as Turkey, even when the returns are higher. That is because Turkey would be a risk too far when there are safe havens such as the US starting to offer a return on totally safe investments like Treasury bonds.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, who oversees the IMF risk monitor, reserved his deepest concerns for the previously fast-developing nations that have become vulnerable to volatile financial markets.</p> <p>\u201cStrains in the debt repayment capacity of the energy sector may become more evident in Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria and South Africa, as well as in countries reliant on oil revenues, such as Nigeria and Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sharp dollar appreciation entails additional risks for corporates and countries with large foreign currency debts.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe Yellen will look at US unemployment and consumer spending data at the Fed\u2019s meetings this month and in mid-June, and decide America remains too weak to withstand a rate rise. If she does, plenty of countries will cheer. Yet all the signals point towards a rise, with potential turmoil ahead.</p>",
