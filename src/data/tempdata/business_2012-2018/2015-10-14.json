We claimed that by routing money through Mauritius, Switzerland and the Netherlands, SABMiller was avoiding \u00a320m of African taxes every year. Though SABMiller has strongly denied these claims, it appeared to us that Marta Luttgrodt, whose tiny beer stall stands in the shadow of its Ghanaian brewery, was paying more tax than SABMiller in Ghana.

      "bodyText": "Almost nobody has a good word to say about Transport for London\u2019s ideas for regulating minicabs in the capital and Sajid Javid is the latest big name to come out to bat for Uber, the app-based service. Consumers must come first, says the business secretary, and innovation and disruptive technology should be welcomed. TfL\u2019s proposals could \u201cjeopardise our status as a country that welcomes investment, jobs and puts business first\u201d. It\u2019s a popular line and Uber no doubt will soon be able to boast that 150,000 people have signed its online petition against TfL\u2019s ideas. Some of the regulator\u2019s thoughts are indeed clumsy. Making customers wait at least five minutes for a minicab is arbitrary and would be annoying. Yet the Conservative politician talking most sense about Uber and minicab regulation is Boris Johnson, mayor of London. It fell to him last week to make the basic point that TfL is trying to uphold a law that has distinguished between black cabs and minicabs since the 1960s. The design of that law is simple: black-cab drivers have to meet certain standards \u2013 drive authorised high-quality vehicles, pass the \u201cthe knowledge\u201d exam, and so on \u2013 and in return they are granted the exclusive right to be flagged down on the street. As Johnson says, the problem with Uber is that its instant-access app \u201cis allowing private-hire vehicles to behave like black taxis: to be hailed, to ply for hire in the streets, to do exactly what the law says they are not supposed to do.\u201d And Uber drivers are behaving like that: just look at the congestion around Heathrow these days. Uber\u2019s answer is to deregulate, or \u201clevel the playing field by reducing today\u2019s burdensome black cab regulations\u201d. That\u2019s a possible solution, though the likely result would be the evaporation of the black-cab trade to the point where it becomes a curiosity for tourists. That is probably not what most Londoners want. But if parliament wants a completely deregulated market, it should vote for it \u2013 and Javid is free to make the case if he wishes. In the meantime, though, the law is the law and it is TfL\u2019s job to design rules to keep pace with new technology while preserving the old distinction between black cabs and minicabs. It\u2019s not an easy task, and to repeat, those initial proposals are far from perfect. But, as matters stand, Uber cannot expect to enjoy all the privileges of black cabs while accepting none of the obligations. It would be a good thing if the business secretary said so. If not, he risks jeopardising our status as a country that applies its laws. Staley for Barclays? We don\u2019t know yet whether the JP Morgan veteran Jes Staley will land the job of chief executive of Barclays. And we don\u2019t know whether Staley and chairman John McFarlane would wish to expand or shrink Barclays\u2019 investment bank, though the former ambition seems more likely. But hey, at least we can sleep soundly in the knowledge that the UK\u2019s ringfencing rules will protect taxpayers in the event of a future calamity, however unlikely. Well, let\u2019s hope so. The Bank of England will on Thursday publish its latest thinking on the implementation on the ringfence, which requires retail banking operations to be put into a standalone entity, thereby making it easier to wind down failed banks in a crisis and save the critical parts. The ringfencing material may sound dry and technical but do not doubt how hard some banks have lobbied for the rules to be diluted. In fact, it\u2019s been more like an open campaign. \u201cThere is a serious question as to whether these statutory and regulatory changes are really necessary,\u201d McFarlane told the Sunday Times in May. We\u2019ll discover on Thursday how closely the Bank intends to stuck to its original principles. In the meantime, Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, is right to be alert to Barclays\u2019 possible new direction. \u201cAny expansion of the investment bank would increase the importance of ensuring the ringfence is rigorously applied,\u201d he said. Quite. Exit via the market please Why does McCarthy &amp; Stone, a builder of retirement homes, want to return to the stock market? Simple: its private equity and banking owners, led by Goldman Sachs and TPG, who rescued the firm after its disastrous overleveraged HBOS-funded buyout in 2006, want an exit. No shame in that, though one assumes the financiers have done the rounds of private buyers and found nobody willing to pay a premium to the tentative \u00a31bn price-tag. But here\u2019s the surprise: McCarthy has been de-leveraged to the point where it doesn\u2019t really need new capital. Net borrowings were \u00a333m at year-end, equivalent to only a third of last year\u2019s operating profits. The company will raise \u00a370m of fresh capital anyway to buy more land, which is probably sensible given plans to spend \u00a32.5bn over the next four years. But it also suggests this industry still remembers the perils of over-leverage. It will forget again one day, but memories are still fresh now. Good.",

      "bodyText": "Cycling groups have called on Eurostar to ditch a new policy requiring passengers to dismantle and box up their bikes, claiming it will deter people from taking bicycles on cross-Channel trains. CTC, the UK\u2019s largest cycling charity, said more than 2,700 people have written to Eurostar in seven hours urging it to scrap the change which will come into force on 1 November. Users can currently hang their bikes by the front wheel in a specially designated compartment for a \u00a330 fee as part of a registered luggage system. Under the new policy, bikes have to be dismantled and boxed up, and then reassembled at the other end. Eurostar has already had to tweak the change after it was pointed out the initial dimensions for the bike box were too small. It subsequently said there would be no size limitation. But cycling groups are still up in arms. CTC, which has joined forces with cycling groups in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, say the change is more restrictive than any train operator in the UK. The European Cyclists\u2019 Federation (ECF), which represents cycling bodies across Europe, described the policy as \u201cextremely inconvenient\u201d. Paul Tuohy, the CTC chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical that an organisation with a history of sponsoring awards celebrating the achievements of pioneering travel initiatives could come up with such a barmy policy on cycle carriage. Cyclists should not be treated as third-class passengers and we urge Eurostar to reverse their planned policy.\u201d Rosemary Dooley, 68, a CTC member from Kendal, Cumbria, who recently took her assembled bike on Eurostar, said: \u201cI have to take my own bike everywhere due to arthritis in my hands, hence small adaptations. I am also not mechanical. But it seems now that I will have to learn to remove and replace the front wheel. I just hope it doesn\u2019t involve strong fingers like changing an inner tube.\u201d Nicolas Clifford, logistics manager at cycle tour specialists Blue Marble Travel, said: \u201cIn 2015 alone, close to 100 of our clients have crossed the Channel with their cycles via Eurostar \u2013 this despite the obvious failings of a poorly designed system. If Eurostar puts its plans in place, the only realistic choice for cyclists seeking to join the type of itinerant trip we offer will be short-haul air, which makes a mockery of the company\u2019s green mantra.\u201d Eurostar said its new policy was designed to use the space on its trains more flexibly, \u201cby carrying the same or more bikes depending on the demand from passengers\u201d. The company also said it had to balance the needs of cyclists with those of other passengers, who increasingly want to take registered luggage. \u201cBy changing our policy slightly we can continue to meet the needs of cyclists, whilst also helping other passengers with their registered luggage requirements,\u201d said Eurostar. A spokesman said the company intended to press ahead with the change. Eurostar has written to concerned passengers, telling them that \u201cour staff are trained and ready to assist with the new procedure\u201d. But CTC warned: \u201cWe are concerned to what degree they have been trained. Only someone properly trained to reassemble a bicycle should be involved, anything else could leave them liable to a failure of duty of care.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bankers to the two brewing giants SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev, which have just agreed the third largest takeover deal in corporate history, are set to share in a fees bonanza of up to $235m (\u00a3152m), according to estimates from Freeman Consulting Services, a New York-based group. Freeman estimates that the advisers to SABMiller, which achieved a valuation of $104bn after rejecting four informal offers, will share up to $120m. SABMiller\u2019s advisers were led by Robey Warshaw, a boutique bank employing just nine bankers, whose discreet London office was used for some of the key meetings, including a final one between the chairmen of both companies on Monday. Robey Warshaw\u2019s Simon Robey, a former senior banker at Morgan Stanley, played the lead role in the discussions with the SABMiller board, which is chaired by Jan du Plessis. The two men had worked together at the mining giant Rio Tinto, which rebuffed a takeover attempt by Glencore. The breakdown of fees has not yet been decided but bankers said they would not be surprised if Robey Warshaw received a fee of between \u00a320m and \u00a330m, a sizeable sum to share between its nine bankers. The firm earned \u00a323.9m in the 18 months to March 2015, a period in which it advised AstraZeneca to fight off a bid from the US pharmaceutical group Pfizer. Robey Warshaw, which operates from a Georgian townhouse in St James\u2019s, central London, is also set to share with Goldman Sachs fees of $90m for its role as an adviser to the gas company BG Group, which has agreed to a \u00a347bn buyout by Shell. The other advisers included JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, law firm Linklaters and PR agency Finsbury. Those who were involved in the board discussions said that Finsbury\u2019s founder, Roland Rudd, a veteran of takeover battles, played a major role in advising the SABMiller board, which was split on whether to accept earlier bids from AB InBev after major shareholder Altria agreed to to the deal. Advisers to SABMiller risked not being paid at all if AB InBev had decided to walk away after any of the four rejections. However, banking experts said SABMiller would almost certainly have paid out significant fees even if the deal had not gone ahead. The AB InBev team, which Freeman estimates could earn between $95m and $115m in fees, was led by Lazard and Deutsche, with Brunswick as the PR firm. Freshfields acted as legal advisers. The bank advisers will also scoop up a further bonanza now the takeoever is agreed, with AB InBev needing to raise funds to pay for the deal. They will also work on plans to sell SABMiller\u2019s US interests for between $10bn and $12bn to allay competition concerns, and to deal with any competition concerns the combined group has in China.",

The two men had worked together at the mining giant Rio Tinto, which rebuffed a takeover attempt by Glencore.</p> <p>The breakdown of fees has not yet been decided but bankers said they would not be surprised if Robey Warshaw received a fee of between \u00a320m and \u00a330m, a sizeable sum to share between its nine bankers. The firm earned \u00a323.9m in the 18 months to March 2015, a period in which it advised AstraZeneca to fight off a bid from the US pharmaceutical group Pfizer.</p> <p>Robey Warshaw, which operates from a Georgian townhouse in St James\u2019s, central London, is also set to share with Goldman Sachs fees of $90m for its role as an adviser to the gas company BG Group, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/shell-bg-group-47bn-takeover-oil-industry\">which has agreed to a \u00a347bn buyout by Shell</a>.</p> <p>The other advisers included JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, law firm Linklaters and PR agency Finsbury. Those who were involved in the board discussions said that Finsbury\u2019s founder, Roland Rudd, a veteran of takeover battles, played a major role in advising the SABMiller board, which was split on whether to accept earlier bids from AB InBev after major shareholder Altria agreed to to the deal.</p> <p>Advisers to SABMiller risked not being paid at all if AB InBev had decided to walk away after any of the four rejections. However, banking experts said SABMiller would almost certainly have paid out significant fees even if the deal had not gone ahead.</p> <p>The AB InBev team, which Freeman estimates could earn between $95m and $115m in fees, was led by Lazard and Deutsche, with Brunswick as the PR firm. Freshfields acted as legal advisers.</p> <p>The bank advisers will also scoop up a further bonanza now the takeoever is agreed, with AB InBev needing to raise funds to pay for the deal. They will also work on plans to sell SABMiller\u2019s US interests for between $10bn and $12bn to allay competition concerns, and to deal with any competition concerns the combined group has in China.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A bullish aviation industry seeking a new runway in south-east England has argued it can meet stringent carbon, noise and pollution limits if the government helps with incentives, provided aircraft engine and biofuel technologies improve as expected. MPs on the environmental audit committee grilled Andy Jefferson, the director of the industry body Sustainable Aviation, putting it to him that an enlarged industry would breach legal limits and force other sectors to reduce their carbon emissions disproportionately. \u201cWe accept there are challenges, but we believe we can get it right,\u201d said Jefferson. \u201cA mix of carbon [trading] and new aircraft technology could achieve a 50% reduction in [UK aviation industry] emissions by 2050. We are starting to see the A380 and Boeings which are 20% more efficient. The next technological revolution is expected 2030-2040. This is is realistic and achievable.\u201d But under questioning from the London mayoral candidate and Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who has strongly opposed expansion at Heathrow, he accepted that a reduction in carbon emissions could mean more noise. Jefferson said: \u201cWe accept the industry must grow within carbon limits. But there is a tradeoff between noise and carbon. It\u2019s the way planes are built. The challenge is to be low noise, low carbon and low emissions.\u201d Asked to clarify whether lower emissions potentially meant more noise, Jefferson said: \u201cIt would be slightly more.\u201d He said the industry also accepted there had to be strict sound limits because research showed that aircraft noise directly affected people\u2019s health. A meeting with the World Health Organisation had suggested that the problem was a mixture of the volume of noise, the time it was emitted and its tone. The industry backed a carbon trading scheme but Jefferson said he did not know what effect a strong carbon price might have on ticket prices. \u201cI don\u2019t have the figures. But it would be a dramatic change if passengers pay the fee. A strong carbon price is going to reduce emissions. But go too far and there are consequences,\u201d he said. With government support and incentives, he said that Britain could develop an important aviation biofuel industry, able to employ 4,500 people by 2030 and capable of manufacturing 4.5m tonnes of aviation fuel a year from waste gases by 2050. \u201cThat would reduce CO2 emissions by 25%. But policy incentives are not strong. Whereas the US has four plants manufacturing aviation biofuels, Britain has none. Globally over 25,000 flights have been made on sustainable fuels. It\u2019s a challenge, but a lot of great innovation is going overseas,\u201d he said. The MPs were meeting in response to the Airports Commission\u2019s recommendation in June that a third runway should be built at Heathrow. The commission, which was chaired by Howard Davies, said the expansion should only take place if the airport could meet stringent conditions on noise and air pollution. The MPs are due to question Heathrow airport officials later. The \u00a317bn expansion plan would mean 250,000 more flights a year, providing a \u00a3150bn boost to GDP over 60 years and 70,000 new jobs \u2013 but would mean demolishing 783 homes, including most of the village of Harmondsworth.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain will spend almost \u00a38bn a year on takeaways by the end of the decade as a surge in smartphone usage and time-pressed households cooking fewer meals boosts the country\u2019s predilection for takeaway food. Expenditure on pizza, curry and Chinese food is expected to grow by 28% during this decade to \u00a37.6bn a year according to figures from Euromonitor International. Domino\u2019s Pizza exemplified the trend by reporting a 21% surge in its latest quarterly sales, to \u00a3200m, with 75% of orders placed online and 61% of those made with mobile devices. The figures from Domino\u2019s were released after Just Eat, the UK\u2019s largest online takeaway group, said sales rose 54% in the first half of the year, and a survey by Nationwide found that households buy three takeaways a month on average. David Wild, chief executive of Domino\u2019s, said the company only took its first mobile order five years ago \u2013 since then smartphones and tablets have transformed the market. \u201cTo have moved so far so quickly shows customers want to go about their business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe easier you make it to order, the more you will order.\u201d Wild said that the benefits of online and mobile ordering included allowing customers to have access to up-to-date menus and offers. \u201cWe would send a menu out every month,\u201d Wild said of Domino\u2019s previous system. \u201cBut normally you [the customer] would just find one at the bottom of a drawer or on a pinboard, which wouldn\u2019t have the latest offers.\u201d Takeaway food is benefiting from its positioning in between eating out and cooking at home, according to the Domino\u2019s boss, with consumers wary of splashing out on meals but too short of time to cook. \u201cThere is gradual trend towards takeaway food, there is no doubt about that,\u201d Wild said. \u201cThe thing about being in our place is that when people don\u2019t want to go out but don\u2019t want to cook we sit neatly between fine dining and scratch cooking. It\u2019s the way people live their life today. Its convenient.\u201d However, while Domino\u2019s and its rival are enjoying a boom, Britain\u2019s leading supermarkets are under pressure, with sales falling for Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, said: \u201cThis is taking place within a wider context involving three key trends: consumer spending confidence increasing, the overall rise in \u2018food-on-the-go\u2019 \u2013 one of the few current growth areas for supermarkets \u2013 and consumers\u2019 increasing willingness to buy food online, which now accounts for 6% of grocery sales.\u201d Nicola Knight, an analyst at Horizons, which tracks the eating-out industry, said teenagers and young adults had been central to the recent growth in takeaway sales. However, as the likes of large companies such as Domino\u2019s developing mobile devices to reach more customers, independent Indian and Chinese restaurants could feel the squeeze. \u201cThe younger generation are our most frequent consumers of food prepared outside the home, so as they age we are becoming a nation used to buying takeaway foods,\u201d she said. \u201cOperators have tapped into their familiarity with technology by offering easier ways to order and pay for home delivery and takeaway food online. The growth of third-party delivery companies also mean that more outlets can tap into this sector without the cost of running their own home delivery service. \u201cThe takeaway market, particularly home delivered, will continue to grow, as group-owned operators such as Pizza Express move into the sector. Independent operators such as Indian and Chinese outlets are likely to continue to decline.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three former directors of City Link have been charged with criminal offences in relation to the collapse of the delivery company, which led to the loss of 3,000 jobs last Christmas. David Smith, the former managing director, the former finance director Robert Peto, and a non-executive director Thomas Wright, have been charged with failing to notify the business secretary of plans to make staff redundant at the firm and will go on trial in November. Wright acted as a representative of Better Capital on the board of City Link. The private equity firm, run by veteran venture capitalist Jon Moulton, owned City Link at the time of its collapse. The three men were the first former directors of any company to be charged with the offence, more than 20 years after the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act came into force. Charges were brought in June, a few weeks before Dave Forsey, the Sports Direct chief executive, was sent a summons to be charged in relation to the collapse of its USC business, as first revealed by the Guardian last week. Forsey, 49, is accused of failing to notify authorities of plans to lay off warehouse staff in Scotland, about 200 of whom were given 15 minutes notice by USC\u2019s administrator in January that they were losing their jobs. The legal actions against Forsey, whose case was heard in Chesterfield on Wednesday, and the City Link men appears to mark a new approach by the Department for Business to criminal proceedings against former directors of companies that have gone bust. The Insolvency Service (IS) declined to comment on why the department was suddenly using its powers under the act. But the action comes after the government has been forced to pay out millions in compensatory payments to staff made redundant without proper consultation. The cases have emerged amid a government investigation into the issue of redundancy consultations in insolvencies and the potentially clashing demands of employment and insolvency law. Phillip Sykes, president of R3, the insolvency trade body, said: \u201cThe insolvency profession has long called for clarity from government on what should and should not happen when business failure puts jobs at risk. We are very pleased the government has taken a closer look at this topic over the last year. \u201cWe are looking forward to the government\u2019s imminent response to a call for evidence on redundancy consultations in insolvencies. We need the government to set out what exactly should happen, and exactly who is responsible for what, whilst taking into account the unique circumstances of insolvencies. \u201cUncertainty over how the rules are applied \u2013 and what sanctions there might be for not adhering to the rules \u2013 helps no one, least of all the employees whose jobs are at risk.\u201d Under employment laws, workers should be given at least 30 days consultation before losing their jobs. The act also states that directors planning to dismiss more than 20 workers in any one establishment, such as a single shop or warehouse, are obliged to give the business secretary 30 days notice before going ahead. Failure to do so is an offence that is liable for a fine of up to \u00a35,000. The government\u2019s legal action against the City Link directors and Forsey comes as the compensation bill for workers who have not been properly consulted rises. In recent years, staff who have been let go without a company following due process have become increasingly successful in winning compensation via employment tribunals. The \u201cprotective awards\u201d are worth up to 90 days\u2019 pay. Under European legislation, IS often ends up having to pick up the bill for the award. In the case of City Link, the redundancy payments service, which is part of IS, paid out \u00a35m in statutory redundancy pay to former employees of the delivery company. The handling of the collapse of City Link and USC attracted widespread condemnation and inquiries by MPs. About 260 former City Link workers \u2013 including drivers, head office and warehouse staff \u2013 have lodged an employment tribunal claim over the company\u2019s failure to properly consult on redundancies. Lawyers at Leeds-based Morrish Solicitors, which is representing the claimants, believe each person could recover several thousand pounds. The case is not expected to be heard until next spring.",

    "webTitle": "Wal-Mart slumps on warning, dollar falls after weak US retail sales  - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investors suffered another bruising day, with shares falling sharply as global growth concerns continued to weigh on sentiment. It started off badly with weak Chinese inflation figures, adding to recent concerns about a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Then came disappointing US retail sales, followed by news of a warning on earnings from Wal-Mart, which sent US markets sharply lower and added to the generally downbeat mood. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 72.67 points or 1.15% lower at 6269.61 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.17i% to 9915.85 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.74% at 4609.03 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.95% to 21,838.20 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.77% lower at 10,037.6 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.32% at 676.13 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 116.25 points or 0.68%. Here are the main movers - with Wal-Mart the standout loser after its warning on earnings: On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s take on the Wal-Mart warning: Wal-Mart said it expects profit to fall for its next fiscal year and cut its sales outlook for this year as it works to fend off intensifying competition and perk up stores with better customer service. The world\u2019s largest retailer said it expects sales growth to be flat for this fiscal year, as it faces unfavorable currency exchange rates. The company had previously forecast sales growth of 1 to 2%. The disappointing guidance comes as Wal-Mart faces a tough economy and pressure from rivals including traditional grocers, dollar stores and Amazon.com. At its annual investor meeting in New York City on Wednesday, chief executive Doug McMillon sought to reassure [them] the company is working to transform in a rapidly changing retail landscape. \u201cWe all know that retail has changed and will continue to change at an accelerating pace,\u201d said McMillon, who took the job in February 2014. Under McMillon, Wal-Mart has accelerated the pace of smaller store openings and stepped up its e-commerce efforts. The company is spending $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in online investments for the current fiscal year, up from last year\u2019s $1 billion. Such investments are expected to take a toll on profit in the near term, the company said. For its fiscal 2017, it said it expects earnings per share to be down 6 to 12 percent. That also reflects its investment in keeping its prices low and raising wages for workers, Wal-Mart said. By fiscal 2019, it expects earnings per share to be up 5 to 10 percent from this year. The company had lowered its profit forecast for this fiscal 2016 in August, saying it expects earnings to be between $4.40 and $4.70 per share, down from $4.70 to $5.05 per share. The company also authorized a $20 billion share buyback program for the next two years. Wal-Mart shares are on track for their worst daily performance in more than 17 years. They have fallen around 9% after the company told CNBC the strong dollar was likely to knock some $15bn off its full year revenues and then warned on earnings. The world\u2019s largest retailer gets around a third of its revenue - which totalled $485bn last year - from outside the US. In a presentation to investors, it said that expenditure on its US and e-commerce businesses - including wages and training - would mean a 6% to 12% fall in earnings per share in 2017. But by 2019 it expected earnings growth of 5% to 10% compared to the year before. Analysts had been expecting earnings growth of around 4% in 2017. Another vote for a likely US rate rise in December despite the recent run of disappointing data comes from Unicredit Research. Economist Dr Harm Bandholz said: While the headline number matched our (below-consensus) forecast, the downward revision to the August figure and the unexpected decline in core retail sales were a disappointment. Against this backdrop, it might be tempting to conclude that global headwinds have finally spilled over to the US consumer and that financial market volatility has taken its toll. We, however, disagree and rather see the September data as an outlier in series of very strong consumption reports. But while today\u2019s report does not impact our fundamental outlook for consumer spending, it certainly does increase the downside risks to GDP growth in the third quarter of 2015 . We already knew that inventories and trade have most likely been significant drags on growth in the summer... But with today\u2019s weaker data the contribution from consumer spending will be smaller than hoped for... The Fed is certainly taking note of these developments, but it is not going to overemphasize them. Most Federal Open Market Committee members have already acknowledged that the third quarter of 2015 will be weaker due to the inventory correction. And...consumer spending kept its solid momentum throughout the summer. We therefore think that the upcoming two employment reports will be more important for the timing of the liftoff than the third quarter GDP number. And as we anticipate some improvement in payroll gains and a further decline in the unemployment rate, we continue to expect the first 25 basis point rate hike for December. The weak US retail sales numbers make it even more unlikely the Federal Reserve will raise rates this month, with only a strong jobs figure in November likely to prompt an increase in December, according to ING. The bank\u2019s James Knightley said: US retail sales are disappointing, rising just 0.1% month on month in September versus 0.2% consensus while August\u2019s growth rate was revised down two-tenths of a percent to flat. The control group is down 0.1% versus +0.3% consensus with another two-tenth downward revision to August. This control group supposedly better matches consumer spending numbers that feed through into GDP. We had been looking for much better numbers given the firm consumer confidence data and robust auto volume sales. Looking in the details auto sales did rise 1.8% month on month but there were falls in electronics, building materials, grocery stores and general merchandise with a substantial 3.2% decline in gasoline station sales. This latter figure is due to price falls, but even so there is very little to be positive about in this report. Meanwhile, the PPI report showed a distinct lack of inflation pressures with headline prices falling 0.5% month on month versus a -0.2% consensus prediction with the core rate \u2013 excluding food and energy \u2013 falling 0.3% versus an anticipated +0.1%. These reports reinforce the view that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t be doing anything later this month with analysts (including us) predicting a December rate hike really needing to see a very strong labour report next month to give them any confidence the Fed will hike in December. Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail consultants Conlumino, says the US retail sales figures are actually not that weak, once petrol sales are stripped out: While September cannot be described as a stellar month for retail, it is encouraging to see growth picking up after a very weak August. Across all categories sales rose by 2.5% on a year-over-year basis, this compares favorably to 1.4% in August. Overall growth was dragged down by the lower price of gas, which resulted in sales at gas stations plummeting by 20%. When these are removed from the equation, retail sales increased by a robust 5.2%, with particularly strong performances coming from the auto and foodservice segments. The numbers are all the more impressive given that the comparatives from last year are fairly tough, mostly thanks to the boost to household finances that started to filter through in September 2014 due to the lower cost of fuel. Within core retail, performance across the categories remains uneven. The home related sectors continue to forge ahead, helped by reasonable levels of activity within the housing market. However, electricals remains very sluggish with a 5.2% decline in sales over last year; that said, we expect this to reverse as new consumer electronics products are released in time for the holiday season. On a more positive note, clothing saw an upswing this month with year-over-year growth of 5%, aided by the boost to household budgets as well as a colder, wetter period of weather across many parts of the country which fuelled sales of fall collections. Without robust growth in the underlying fundamentals of the consumer economy, sales over the next few months will be dependent on the direction of gas prices: these will make the difference between a reasonable and a good holiday season for retailers.\u201d Wal-Mart\u2019s chief executive Doug McMillon said the strong dollar would reduce the company\u2019s revenues by $15bn this year. The world\u2019s largest retailer also announced that it was hiring 3,000 department managers in the US ahead of the holiday season, to improve its kerbside grocery pickup service. Today, the dollar is losing ground, however, as chances of a Fed rate hike this year receded somewhat. Retail sales barely grew in August, up 0.1%, and producer price data were also weak. Wall Street has opened flat after the weak US retail sales and produce price figures, while earnings from Bank of America and Wells Fargo came in ahead of expectations. European stock markets are still down. Royal Bank of Scotland shares are a \u201ccompelling investment\u201d and could almost double in value over the next three years, according to the co-head of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, Raanan Agus. Reuters reported that Agus told the Sohn Investment conference in Tel Aviv: From the largest bank in the world... RBS is becoming a highly focused UK retail and commercial bank in a domestic market with attractive returns.\u201d The comments failed to boost RBS shares, which are currently down 0.7% at 320.8p. GSIP manages investments more than $8bn. Guardian exclusive: Three former directors of City Link face criminal charges over the firm\u2019s collapse last Christmas, which led to the loss of 3,000 jobs. David Smith, the former managing director, the former finance director Robert Peto, and their colleague Thomas Wright, have been charged with failing to notify the business secretary of plans to make staff redundant at the firm and will go on trial in November. Read the full story here. The man lined up by Volkswagen to head its North American business has quit the German carmaker, in a further blow to the scandal-hit company. Winfried Vahland, who currently heads up VW\u2019s Czech division Skoda and previously oversaw VW\u2019s rapid expansion in China, will leave after more than 25 years at the group. Vahland had also been seen as an outside candidate for the top job at VW after Martin Winterkorn resigned over the scandal, but the carmaker\u2019s board picked Porsche boss Matthias M\u00fcller instead. Skoda said Vahland\u2019s decision to leave was \u201cnot connected to the current events around the diesel topic\u201d i.e. the emissions-rigging scandal. In the eurozone, industrial production slumped by 0.5% in August. The weak figures will put pressure on the European Central Bank to expand its stimulus programme when it meets next week in Malta. You can read the full story here. While France had a strong month, with production up 1.6%, Germany \u2013 normally the eurozone\u2019s industrial powerhouse \u2013 posted a 1.2% drop. The dollar is falling, hitting a session low of $1.14420 against the euro, after weak US retail sales figures. Retail sales edged up 0.1% in September after being flat in August. Factory gate prices fell by 0.5% last month, separate figures showed. Wells Fargo, the biggest mortgage lender in the US, has reported its first quarterly profit since last year, helped by its acquisition of commercial loans from General Electric. It made a net profit of $5.4bn in the third quarter to the end of September, better than expected. The San Francisco-based lender bought a chunk of GE\u2019s commercial real restate loans worth $9bn earlier this year. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo bought another portfolio of commercial loans and leases worth mover than $30bn from GE. The bank earnings season is in full flow on Wall Street. Bank of America made a quarterly net profit of $4.1bn in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $470m a year ago (which was caused by massive mortgage-related costs). The second-biggest US bank beat analysts\u2019 forecasts, despite falling revenues. Chief executive Brian Moynihan has been reducing costs, by slashing jobs and restructuring the business. The bank, which has paid more than $70bn in legal expenses since the height of the financial crisis in 2008, said its legal costs fell for the third quarter in a row, to $231m from $6bn a year earlier. Revenues, however fell by 2.4% to $20.9bn, with the bank pointing to turbulent markets. Moynihan said: The key drivers of our business \u2013 deposit taking and lending to both our consumer and corporate clients \u2013 moved in the right direction this quarter and our trading results on behalf of clients remained fairly stable in challenging capital markets conditions.\u201d Goldman Sachs is due to report its quarterly results on Thursday at lunchtime, followed by Citigroup. Germany has trimmed its growth forecast for this year, blaming weakness in China and other major emerging economies. Economy minister Sigmar Gabriel said Berlin now expects the German economy to grow by 1.7%, down from the 1.8% predicted in April. Next year\u2019s forecast was left unchanged at 1.8%. Gabriel said the emissions-rigging scandal at Volkswagen, which has led to fears that the \u201cMade in Germany\u201d brand could be damaged, \u201chas no enduring effect\u201d on current economic forecasts. He also said that money being pumped into education to help cope with the influx of refugees into Germany could work \u201ca bit like a stimulus programme\u201d starting next year. Let\u2019s take a look at the markets. Gold prices have hit 3 1/2 month highs as concerns over weak inflation and growth in China reinforced expectations that the long-awaited US interest rate hike is still some way off. The Fed surprised markets when it left rates unchanged at its September meeting, citing concerns about the global economy, but Fed chief Jane Yellen subsequently said the central bank was on track to increase borrowing costs later this year. However, there are signs of divisions within the Fed: Daniel Tarullo, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, told CNBC on Tuesday that it would not be \u201cappropriate\u201d to raise rates this year. Spot gold rose to $1,176.20 an ounce earlier, its highest level since the end of June. Stock markets have slipped for a second day and the dollar slid to its lowest level in nearly a month after fresh signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The FTSE 100 index is down 0.6% at 6306.45, a fall of more than 35 points. Germany\u2019s Dax has also lost 0.6% while France\u2019s CAC has slipped 0.3%. German utility E.ON has clinched a $1.6bn deal to sell its Norwegian oil and gas business to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Norway\u2019s oil and energy minister said the deal will be handled like another other \u2013 despite EU sanctions against Russia, which were imposed over the Ukraine crisis. Norway is not a member of the European Union. Tord Lien said in a statement sent to Reuters: An application for such an approval will be handled the usual way. The restrictive measures apply to activities in Russia. That international firms wish to invest on the Norwegian continental shelf is good.\u201d Shares in E.ON turned positive on the news and are now trading up 2.6%. Fridman\u2019s LetterOne fund had emerged as the frontrunner to buy the German company\u2019s Norwegian North Sea assets after the billionaire, who is of Ukrainian descent, was forced to sell his British North Sea assets due to the western sanctions. The Institute for Public Policy Research has looked at the regional disparities in the UK labour market. The think tank\u2019s new chief economist, Catherine Colebrook, said: The latest data suggests the economy is continuing to create jobs, with the employment rate at a new high, and unemployment at its lowest level since 2008. However, a closer look at the data suggests weaknesses remain: there are big regional disparities, with the employment rate in the North East a full 10 percentage points lower than that in the South West. And inactivity across the UK remains high, at just over a fifth of the working-age population. The government will have to tackle these weaknesses if it is to succeed in creating two million more jobs over the next five years.\u201d Here\u2019s Heather Stewart on today\u2019s jobs report: Here are the main points from today\u2019s labour market report, covering June to August 2015 (you can scroll back to 9.30am for full coverage) There were 31.12 million people in work, 140,000 more than for March to May 2015 and 359,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 22.77 million people working full-time, 291,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.35 million people working part-time, 68,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 73.6%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.77 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 79,000 fewer than for March to May 2015 and 198,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 970,000 unemployed men, 125,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 803,000 unemployed women, 73,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, lower than for March to May 2015 (5.6%) and for a year earlier (6.0%). It has not been lower since March to May 2008. The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force (those in work plus those unemployed) who were unemployed. There were 9.01 million people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), little changed compared with March to May 2015 but down slightly (13,000) compared with a year earlier. The inactivity rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive) was 22.1%, little changed compared with March to May 2015 and with a year earlier. Comparing June to August 2015 with a year earlier, pay for employees in Great Britain increased by 3.0% including bonuses and by 2.8% excluding bonuses. The full report is online here (as a pdf). The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s businesses, has welcomed today\u2019s labour market report - and implicitly criticised George Osborne\u2019s new National Living Wage: Matthew Fell, CBI interim chief policy director, says: \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by businesses creating more jobs, leading to rising employment. It\u2019s also good to see falling unemployment, particularly among those out of work for more than one year dropping by 44,000. \u201cWhile we want to see higher pay growth, this must go hand in hand with increases in productivity. It\u2019s crucial that the Low Pay Commission retains autonomy over future National Living Wage rises to avoid unnecessary political interference and help boost jobs.\u201d Last month, outgoing CBI chief John Cridland warned that raising the minimum wage to \u00a39 an hour by 2020 was \u201ca gamble\u201d that could cost jobs. Workers in Britain\u2019s financial sector are closest to seeing their real pay hit pre-crisis levels, according to the Resolution Foundation. The thinktank also flags up that construction workers\u2019 wage packets are lagging far behind. This chart shows how real wages (pay rises minus inflation) began to fall when the financial crisis struck. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see unemployment falling again, after a pause earlier this year. But there is significant variation in the extent to which this jobs revival has been shared across the country. Many parts of the UK remain a long way short of their pre-recession levels.\u201d \u201cPrivate sector employees are enjoying a mini pay surge that is helping to narrow the substantial wage gap that opened up after 2008. However, maintaining this momentum will prove much harder once inflation starts heading back towards its target rate next year. Whittaker also fears that the public sector pay cap will lead to problems: \u201cAs recovery builds, attention will turn to who is benefiting from it. The strong recent performance of wages in the low-paying retail sector is encouraging, but the picture is much less promising in manufacturing and construction. Meanwhile, ongoing pay constraint in the public sector is likely to translate into increasing recruitment and retention difficulties in the coming months.\u201d German bank Berenberg have produced a chart showing how real wage growth (adjusted for inflation) has picked up as the jobless rate has fallen: Kallum Pickering, Berenberg\u2019s senior UK economist, explains: Falling unemployment is boosting wages! The risk that low inflation might hamper growth in wages now looks misplaced, with wage data continuing to show stable progress (see chart 1) despite weak headline inflation. The pace of real wage growth is now broadly consistent with the pre-crisis average, though unemployment is still around 0.3pp higher. Our view is that the labour market still has some more progress to make before the unemployment rate finally settles. This further improvement however, is unlikely to bring about further real wage gains. Further slack erosion in the labour market will be consistent with higher nominal wages but, it will take place as inflation recovers. Today\u2019s labour market report also shows how Britain and the US benefitted from massive monetary stimulus programmes after the financial crisis struck: Many public sector workers are missing out on the recent increase in wages, because chancellor George Osborne has enforced a 1% pay rise freeze that could last until 2019. Perhaps someone should remind the Department of Work and Pensions.... Britain\u2019s economic productivity is still below its potential, warns Ian Brinkley, chief economic adviser at Lancaster University\u2019s The Work Foundation. Brinkley says: \u201cThe employment growth pause that we saw in the first half of 2015 is over \u2013 job growth resumed over the three months to August compared with the previous three months, driven by more young people and older workers in employment. Looking ahead, we can expect productivity to grow faster and employment to grow more slowly than they have in recent years as the labour market starts to return to normal. But a full recovery in productivity could be long and slow. Even with the recent boost we are still 15 per cent below where we would have been had the pre-recession productivity trend continued, and manufacturing productivity still gives serious cause for concern.\u201d Around four-fifths of the 359,000 jobs created last year are full time: The fall in the jobless rate indicates there\u2019s little slack in the UK labour market, which could mean borrowing costs rise in early 2016. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, explains: \u201cRising wage pressures will likely prompt the Bank of England to hike interest rates soon, most likely in the first quarter of next year. However, tighter monetary policy is unlikely to derail the UK from its current growth trajectory, as nascent signs productivity growth should keep inflation pressures in check, the consequence being that the path of rate increases will be gradual.\u201d Wages have been rising this year because companies are managing to increase their productivity, argues economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He says: One factor that seems to be limiting employment growth compared to earlier in 2015 is that UK productivity is now seeing genuine improvement \u2013 with earnings growth stronger, UK companies are likely stepping up their efforts to lift productivity by getting more out of their existing workers. Britain\u2019s public sector workforce has shrunk again to just 17.2% of the working population, the lowest since records began in 1999. Today\u2019s labour market report shows that there were 5.36 million people employed in the public sector for June 2015. This was: down 16,000 from March 2015 down 59,000 from a year earlier the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1999 In contrast, there were 25.74 million people employed in the private sector for June 2015. This was 58,000 more than for March 2015 and 472,000 more than for a year earlier. Here\u2019s where jobs were created, or destroyed, in the last year: After several years of suffering falling real wages, British pay packets have now been outpacing inflation for the last year or so. Chancellor George Osborne likes the look of today\u2019s figures: My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering all the drama around the fiscal charter vote in his Politics Live blog: The number of people claiming jobless benefits appears to have bottomed out just below 800,000, with the claimant count rising by 4,600 last month. Wage growth continues to outpace inflation, but not by as much as expected. Basic pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.8% annually in the three months to August. That\u2019s a slight fall compared to the 2.9% recorded a month earlier. Economists had expected a rise to 3%. Total earnings, including bonuses, did increased by 3%. UK inflation actually fell by -0.1% last month, so this means real wages are rising by around 3%. Britain\u2019s employment rate has risen to 73.6%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. Here we go! Britain\u2019s jobless rate has hit a new seven year low, falling to 5.4% in the three month to August. The Office for National Statistics reports that the number of people out of work fell by 79,000 in the last quarter, taking the jobless total down to 1.774 million. But the claimant count \u2013 the number of people claiming unemployment benefit \u2013 has risen by 4,600 in September. That takes the total to 796,000. That has dashed predictions of a small fall in the claimant count. More to follow.... Ahead of today\u2019s unemployment report (at 9.30am BST), the British Chambers of Commerce has urged the government to reintroduce compulsory work experience for school children. BCC director general John Longworth believes it was a mistake to stop forcing schools to offer work experience for under 16-year-olds three years ago. It would help bring down Britain\u2019s \u2018stubbornly high\u2019 youth unemployment rate, and help young people make the jump to the workplace. Longworth says: \u201cBusiness and school leaders are clear - we won\u2019t bridge the gap between the world of education and the world of work unless young people spend time in workplaces while still at school. \u201cIt was careless of Government to end compulsory work experience in 2012, but it is not too late to correct the mistake and work with companies and schools to ensure that every school pupil has the chance to feel the energy, dynamism, buzz and challenge of the workplace for themselves. Work experience is a touchy subject in the UK; those with good contacts typically get a head start at bagging the best placements. Still, even a week painting fences at a duck sanctuary can lead (eventually) to a desk in the newsroom.... Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct agrees that today\u2019s weak China inflation figures, and fresh deflation at the factory gate, are a worry for traders: Downbeat data from China \u2013 this time in the shape of weaker than expected inflation \u2013 is adding another layer of concern as to how the world\u2019s second largest economy is managing the slowdown, and as a result the base metal mining stocks once again are wearing more than their fair share of the losses. Here\u2019s the picture across Europe: Pizza chain Domino\u2019s is bucking this morning\u2019s selloff. Domino\u2019s shares have jumped by 13% to a record high of \u00a310.14, after it raised its profit forecasts and revealed that UK like-for-like sales are up by a remarkable 14.9% in the 13 weeks to September 27. CEO David Wild credited \u201cthe success of our strategic and marketing initiatives\u201d; the company is strong on social media, has a successful smartphone app, and has sponsored several popular TV shows from The Simpsons to Hollyoaks. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are both down around 1%, adding to losses earlier this week. Bloomberg TV\u2019s Carolyn Hyde flags up that more than 100 billion euros has been knocked off Europe\u2019s largest companies value this week already: Stock markets across Europe are in the red at the start of trading, and China is getting the blame. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 55 points, or 0.85%, in early trading to 6288. Mining stocks are all down, with Glencore dropping 2.5% and Anglo American shedding 2.3%. Burberry is also leading the fallers, down 2%. The fashion firm is expected to report slowing sales on Thursday, due to sliding demand for its trench coats and natty checks in China. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says today\u2019s Chinese inflation figures are a worry for investors: While Chinese consumer inflation (CPI) slowed further, Producer Prices made it a record 43rd straight month of deflation. While inflation gives the People\u2019s Bank of China room to ease monetary policy further to support the slowing economy, hopes of more stimulus are clearing failing to appease market concerns especially with Q3 GDP data only days away Chinese policymakers may get another nudge to stimulate their economy next Monday, when GDP figures for the third quarter are released. Growth is expected to slow to an annual rate of 6.8%, from 7.0% in the second quarter of this year. That would be the first sub-7% reading since the financial crisis. August and September were turbulent times for China, with wild swings in the stock market. That could also hit the growth rate, if worried firms started cutting investment. European markets are expected to fall this morning, following the weak Chinese inflation data overnight: New fears over China\u2019s economy are rippling through the markets this morning, after two piece of economic data showed that demand is weakening. The producer prices index - which measures what Chinese firms charge for their goods - slumped by 5.9% year-on-year in September. That matches August\u2019s decline, which was the biggest drop since the financial crisis in 2009. It\u2019s also the 43th month running in which producer prices have fallen. It suggests that companies are being forced to slash prices in an attempt to stimulate sales, as Beijing tries to rebalance its economy without a \u2018hard landing\u2019. Consumer price inflation also fell, with the CPI index dropping from 2% in August to 1.6% in September, partly due to slowing food prices And that hit markets in Asia, with traders worrying that the Chinese economy is in urgent need of fresh stimulus. As Chris Green, an Auckland-based strategist at First NZ Capital Ltd, told Bloomberg: \u201cIn terms of global growth, the risk is skewed towards the downside.\u201d Angus Nicholson of IG reckons Beijing will act soon, saying: Today\u2019s Chinese CPI essentially guaranteed further cuts to the interest rate and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) before the year is out. But right now, all the Asian markets are in the red - with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing down almost 2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up this morning... The latest UK unemployment report, due at 9.30am BST, will show whether or not Britain\u2019s labour market recovery lost pace over the summer. The jobless rate is expected to remain at 5.5%, while the number of people claiming unemployment benefit is tipped to fall by around two thousand. The latest UK earnings figures will also be closely scrutinised. Last month, we saw that wages were rising at their fastest rate in six years, at 2.9% year-on-year. Some in the City predict they will have risen again to around 3.1%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u2019s average earnings data could present Bank of England policymakers with a problem in the short term if they continue to trend higher as they have been doing for the past few months. Expectations for the three months to August are for an increase in wages to 3.1% from 2.9%, giving a further boost to hard pressed consumers who up until a year ago had undergone a five year fiscal squeeze in the other direction. The main concern would be if wages start to push higher in a wage/price spiral but that doesn\u2019t seem likely at this point in time We also get a healthcheck on the eurozone at 10am BST, when the eurozone industrial production figures for August are released. Economists expect a fall in output, as we\u2019ve already seen weak data from Germany for that month. And over in Greece, European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is visiting prime minister Alexis Tsipras to discuss the Greek bailout programme this afternoon. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Against this backdrop, it might be tempting to conclude that global headwinds have finally spilled over to the US consumer and that financial market volatility has taken its toll. We, however, disagree and rather see the September data as an outlier in series of very strong consumption reports. </p> <p>But while today\u2019s report does not impact our fundamental outlook for consumer spending, it certainly does increase the downside risks to GDP growth in the third quarter of 2015 . We already knew that inventories and trade have most likely been significant drags on growth in the summer... But with today\u2019s weaker data the contribution from consumer spending will be smaller than hoped for...</p> <p>The Fed is certainly taking note of these developments, but it is not going to overemphasize them. Most Federal Open Market Committee members have already acknowledged that the third quarter of 2015 will be weaker due to the inventory correction. And...consumer spending kept its solid momentum throughout the summer.</p> <p>We therefore think that the upcoming two employment reports will be more important for the timing of the liftoff than the third quarter GDP number. And as we anticipate some improvement in payroll gains and a further decline in the unemployment rate, we continue to expect the first 25 basis point rate hike for December.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff3014ce7c8d6848739bef219e4b4d8700f45ea7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3014ce7c8d6848739bef219e4b4d8700f45ea7/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed chair Janet Yellen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed chair Janet Yellen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-561e637ae4b0d07453a58fdf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-14T14:18:29.159Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The weak US retail sales numbers make it even more unlikely the Federal Reserve will raise rates this month, with only a strong jobs figure in November likely to prompt an increase in December</strong>, according to ING.

The control group is down 0.1% versus +0.3% consensus with another two-tenth downward revision to August. This control group supposedly better matches consumer spending numbers that feed through into GDP. We had been looking for much better numbers given the firm consumer confidence data and robust auto volume sales.</p> <p>Looking in the details auto sales did rise 1.8% month on month but there were falls in electronics, building materials, grocery stores and general merchandise with a substantial 3.2% decline in gasoline station sales. This latter figure is due to price falls, but even so there is very little to be positive about in this report.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the PPI report showed a distinct lack of inflation pressures with headline prices falling 0.5% month on month versus a -0.2% consensus prediction with the core rate \u2013 excluding food and energy \u2013 falling 0.3% versus an anticipated +0.1%.</p> <p>These reports reinforce the view that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t be doing anything later this month with analysts (including us) predicting a December rate hike really needing to see a very strong labour report next month to give them any confidence the Fed will hike in December.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-561e6234e4b0d07453a58fdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-14T14:12:31.760Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail consultants Conlumino, says the US retail sales figures are actually not that weak, once petrol sales are stripped out:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While September cannot be described as a stellar month for retail, it is encouraging to see growth picking up after a very weak August. Across all categories sales rose by 2.5% on a year-over-year basis, this compares favorably to 1.4% in August.</p> <p>Overall growth was dragged down by the lower price of gas, which resulted in sales at gas stations plummeting by 20%. When these are removed from the equation, retail sales increased by a robust 5.2%, with particularly strong performances coming from the auto and foodservice segments. The numbers are all the more impressive given that the comparatives from last year are fairly tough, mostly thanks to the boost to household finances that started to filter through in September 2014 due to the lower cost of fuel.</p> <p>Within core retail, performance across the categories remains uneven. The home related sectors continue to forge ahead, helped by reasonable levels of activity within the housing market. However, electricals remains very sluggish with a 5.2% decline in sales over last year; that said, we expect this to reverse as new consumer electronics products are released in time for the holiday season. On a more positive note, clothing saw an upswing this month with year-over-year growth of 5%, aided by the boost to household budgets as well as a colder, wetter period of weather across many parts of the country which fuelled sales of fall collections.</p> <p>Without robust growth in the underlying fundamentals of the consumer economy, sales over the next few months will be dependent on the direction of gas prices: these will make the difference between a reasonable and a good holiday season for retailers.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-561e60b0e4b00da8fc066e7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-14T14:06:01.951Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wal-Mart\u2019s chief executive Doug McMillon said the strong dollar would reduce the company\u2019s revenues by $15bn this year.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has seized upon news that unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in seven years to press home the message that his economic plan is bearing fruit. The latest official snapshot of the jobs market, published on Wednesday and covering June to August, showed a 79,000 decline in unemployment to 1.77 million, taking the jobless rate to 5.4%, the lowest since 2008. The employment rate, at 73.6%, was the highest since records began in 1971. The chancellor said: \u201cIt is great news that Britain\u2019s economic plan continues to create jobs and increase pay. We\u2019ve got the highest rate of employment in our history and real terms pay rising strongly.\u201d Average pay, including bonuses, increased at an annual rate of 3%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. With inflation at zero in August, before slipping to -0.1% in September, according to the latest data, many households\u2019 living standards are rising after the long post-recession squeeze. John Philpott, of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said the improvement in the labour market evident in the latest figures contrasted with the earlier months of 2015, when there was evidence that firms\u2019 appetite for hiring was waning. \u201cThe explanation for the flip in behavior is unclear, though it\u2019s possible that recruiters were cautious in the first half of the year because of political uncertainty surrounding the general election in May. What is clear is that hiring picked up strongly from June onwards,\u201d he said. Nick Palmer, an ONS labour market statistician, commenting on the data, said: \u201cToday\u2019s fall in unemployment has more than outstripped the recent rises, leaving unemployment at its lowest level since mid-2008.\u201d On the more timely claimant count basis, which measures the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, unemployment rose by 4,600 in September to 796,200. The claimant count is classed as an \u201cexperimental\u201d statistic by the ONS, however, because the changeover to the government\u2019s new universal credit system is complicating the task of data collection. There was little evidence of inflationary pressures picking up strongly in the labour market, however, something hawks on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee have been looking out for. While real wages continued to rise in August, the rate of pay growth appears to be levelling off. Excluding bonuses, whole economy average earnings increased at 2.8% in the three months to August, down from 2.9% between April and July. That 2.9% figure is the one that will be used to uprate payments of the basic state pension next April, in line with the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which promises an increase of 2.5%, average earnings growth, or inflation, whichever is highest. Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, said: \u201cToday\u2019s wage data alongside yesterday\u2019s inflation numbers may encourage MPC members with a dovish inclination to wait for stronger evidence of rising price pressures before voting for an interest rate rise.\u201d But Wells added that confirmed anti-inflation hawks, such as Ian McCafferty, who has repeatedly voted for a rate rise at recent meetings of the MPC, would not be deterred, because the renewed fall in unemployment suggested the labour market remained strong. He said: \u201cToday\u2019s labour market data were a mixed bag.\u201d Despite recent increases, average pay across the economy remains considerably below the levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis, once inflation is taken into account. The Resolution Foundation thinktank pointed out that in some sectors, particularly construction, average pay remains well below the pre-crisis peak. Matthew Whittaker, Resolution\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cAs [the] recovery builds, attention will turn to who is benefiting from it. The strong recent performance of wages in the low-paying retail sector is encouraging, but the picture is much less promising in manufacturing and construction.\u201d The details of the data also underlined the contrasting fortunes of private sector workers and those in the public sector, who have been hit by repeated pay freezes as the Treasury seeks to tackle the deficit. Private sector pay rose at an annual rate of 3.4% in the three months to August, more than three times the 1.1% rate seen in the public sector.",

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s sales fell in the second quarter of its financial year after business in China was affected by the slowing economy and a blast at the port of Tianjin which destroyed or damaged thousands of its vehicles. Sales in the three months to the end of September dropped by 1% to 110,200 vehicles despite strong trading in Europe, North America and the UK as sales in China fell 32%. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Tata Motors of India, said Chinese sales fell because of a continuing slowdown in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and planned changes to new models. In addition, about 5,800 vehicles stored at Tianjin were blown up or damaged when an explosion at a chemical warehouse killed 160 people in August. The luxury carmaker said: \u201cGiven the exceptional nature of this event, Jaguar Land Rover is still assessing the damages and it may be some time before the company knows what insurance and other recoveries will be.\u201d The company\u2019s second quarter included a period when Chinese share prices plunged and the People\u2019s Bank of China devalued the country\u2019s currency. Concerns about China\u2019s slowing economy continued to reverberate on Wednesday as data showed producer prices and consumer price inflation falling. Shares of Burberry, which sells about 40% of its products to Chinese shoppers, fell before the luxury chain\u2019s trading update due on Thursday. Prudential, the UK insurer with a big Asian business portfolio, was also among the big fallers in the FTSE 100 index. Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s sales in other emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia fell 12% in the second quarter. The company said it was confident about the future and that its new Jaguar XE and Discovery Sport vehicles were selling well. Andy Goss, the group\u2019s sales operations director, said: \u201cSales in the UK, Europe and North America have shown impressive growth year-to-date and despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, particularly in China, customer demand for both our Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles remains encouraging.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Industrial production in the eurozone slumped in August by 0.5%, according to official figures that illustrate the impact of falling demand for Europe\u2019s cars and machine tools in China and the east Asia. The latest figures showed an even bigger drop in the year-on-year growth rate to just 0.9% growth when a rise of 1.8% had been expected. The weak figures are expected to put pressure on the European Central Bank to expand its stimulus programme when it meets next week in Malta. ECB boss Mario Draghi has hinted that \u20ac60bn (\u00a344bn) a month of bond purchases under its quantitative easing plan until September 2016 could be increased in size or extended at the meeting on 22 October. A 1.1% fall in Germany was more than offset by a 1.6% rise in France, but the weight of declines among Europe\u2019s smaller countries dragged down the total for the currency bloc\u2019s 19 members. A 4.3% decline in the Czech Republic\u2019s industrial output spearheaded a long list of fallers that included the Netherlands, down 1.5%, Denmark (-1.1%) and Spain (-1.3%). The situation in Germany is unlikely to improve in the next few months, according to analysts who say recent surveys and the Volkswagen scandal will only add to Berlin\u2019s recent woes. The ZEW surveys of economic expectations among business leaders plunged from 12.1 to 1.9 points, significantly missing market consensus of a more moderate decline to 6.5 points. In response to the deteriorating situation the German government has trimmed its growth forecast for this year. The economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said on Wednesday that Berlin now expects growth of 1.7% in Europe\u2019s biggest economy, down slightly from the 1.8% it predicted in April. He left the forecast for 2016 unchanged at 1.8%. Stefan Schilbe, an economist at HSBC Trinkaus and Burkhardt, said the deterioration in emerging market growth was the main factor weighing on sentiment. \u201cThe collapse in the German index therefore likely reflects the impact of the VW emissions scandal,\u201d he said. The eurozone industrial production figures were compiled before the car firm confessed to rigging its vehicles to circumvent emissions tests, leading to fears that subsequent months will see further falls in manufacturing output Bert Colijn, an economist at ING Financial Markets, said the ECB will be disappointed that an improved situation for manufacturers, with cheap oil and a lower euro, has failed to improve industrial production. \u201cA cheap euro, improving domestic demand, decreasing inventories, an increasing trend in new orders and upbeat producers have all failed to result in growth in industrial production in 2015,\u201d he said. But he added that the outlook was broadly favourable, with new orders for manufacturing increasing at the fastest pace since 2011 on a 6-month basis in July. And business surveys indicate that output is expanding modestly in the manufacturing sector. \u201cEven though concerns about China and Volkswagen are on top of mind, the conditions for modestly improving production seem to be there,\u201d Colijn said. Dennis De Jong, managing director at currency dealer UFX.com was more pessimistic, and said Draghi may feel compelled to expand QE. \u201cWith China\u2019s economy giving off renewed signals of distress and the Volkswagen scandal hitting business hard in Germany, today\u2019s announcement of disappointing industrial production data will come as no surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cThese figures may only be the tip of the iceberg. It\u2019s going to be a very tough fourth quarter for ECB president Mario Draghi who, while remaining resolute that his QE programme is doing the trick within, will know that the health of the eurozone also relies on factors that are out of his control. \u201cDraghi can still hold hope of a silver lining to the week, with Friday\u2019s monthly inflation figures set to tick upwards.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Employment rising. Earnings growth down. Living standards up. Interest rates going nowhere fast. Those were the four big themes of the latest snapshot of the UK labour market. Let\u2019s start with jobs. After a lull in the spring and early summer, the number of people in work is going up and the number unemployed is coming down. The government boast that employment is at a record level is a bit meaningless in the light of a rising population, but more jobs are being created, the bulk of them full-time posts. Also, the unemployment rate dipped to 5.4%. All of which makes it curious that the pace of pay growth eased back. Earlier in the year a rise in unemployment was accompanied by an acceleration in earnings growth. Now the opposite is happening. The latest summary of economic conditions put together by the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents provides some clue as to what is going on. The agents say that there is some limited evidence that the drop in unemployment is making it harder for companies to find the workers they want, but that low inflation had reduced the pressure to offer high pay in order to attract staff. This is reflected in the official data from the Office for National Statistics. Yes, there has been a pick up in the rate of earnings growth over the past year, but it has been relatively modest. In the three months to January 2015, average earnings for the whole economy were rising at an annual rate of 2%. The latest figures for the three months to August show them growing at 3%, slightly down on this year\u2019s peak of 3.3% in the three months to May. In August alone, earnings were up 3.1% on a year earlier, compared with a 3.6% increase in July. Earnings are growing at a time when inflation is weak. The figures cover the period up until August, a month in which the rise in the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index stood at zero. Earnings growth of 3% coupled with no inflation means a 3% increase in living standards, which may explain why the latest surveys show consumer spending is strong. With households spending less on petrol and domestic heating bills, retailers will be looking forward to a bumper Christmas. All the more so because the lack of any real upward pressure on inflation means that an interest rate increase from the Bank of England will not be on the agenda until the credit card bills for the now traditional December spending binge start to roll in.",

It said that last year 3.5 million people were interested in buying a retirement property, butonly 128,000 purpose-built properties had been built, with demand expected to increase as the population ages. In the financial year to the end of August, revenue increased 25% to \u00a3486m and pre-tax profit, excluding exceptional items, rose 40% to \u00a388.4m. It plans to sell more than 3,000 homes a year and to invest \u00a32.5bn in new land over the next four years. Goldman and the private equity investors TPG, Anchorage Capital and Strategic Value Partners own about 57% of the company, with the remainder held by 26 unidentified smaller investors. The owners considered floating the business in 2012 and the company held talks with potential private-equity buyers including Bridgepoint Capital. Clive Fenton, McCarthy &amp; Stone\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe have been approached by a number of interested parties over the past year. [The company] did very well on the stock market and our view is that the place for this company is on the London Stock Exchange. The talks didn\u2019t develop.\u201d He said a stock market listing would give the company the ability to raise more capital to expand as well as increasing its brand recognition and credibility. The planned share offering is a turnaround for the company, which came close to collapse during the financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009. It was listed on the stock market for 22 years until December 2006 when HBOS teamed up with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish multimillionaire, to buy the company. The deal, spearheaded by the disgraced former head of HBOS\u2019s corporate bank, Peter Cummings, left McCarthy &amp; Stone with \u00a3900m of debt while struggling to sell its homes in a falling market. After HBOS was rescued by Lloyds in early 2009, Lloyds became a big shareholder in McCarthy &amp; Stone and later sold its stake to Goldman and other major investors.",

It has achieved this partly by keeping up with consumers\u2019 behaviour, launching an online service in 1999, embracing social media and unveiling a smartphone app in 2010.
