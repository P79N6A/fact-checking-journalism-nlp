      "bodyText": "Falling demand for \u201cpop-up\u201d shops has caused a sharp rise in the number of unoccupied retail units, a new survey shows. Retail vacancy rates have risen above 10% for the first time since April 2015, according to a quarterly research report published on Monday by the British Retail Consortium and research group Springboard. The rise to 10.1%, from 9.6% in April 2016, is being partly blamed on start-up retail businesses taking short term leases, but then failing to convert them into longer agreements. Diane Wehrle, a director at Springboard, said: \u201cBetween October and January vacancies went down, partly on the back of more pop-up shops. Since then, temporary lets have not become permanent lets. The key thing is to see if pop-ups start increasing again coming into Christmas.\u201d Wehrle added that because of a surge in popularity of pop-up shops in the run-up to Christmas 2015, 2016 was the first year where vacancy figures had been affected by the closure of some of that type of unit. Last year, telecoms company EE predicted that almost a third of new businesses launched in the UK between 2015 and 2017 would start as a pop-up, which tend to take six month leases on shops to test out a new business concept, or as a marketing stunt for established brands. The phenomenon was promoted by TV retail consultant Mary Portas and the then-communities minister Eric Pickles as a way to regenerate high streets in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Earlier this month, the supermarket chain Tesco opened a pop-up wine bar in London\u2019s Soho district, serving only Tesco\u2019s finest wine range for two weeks. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, added: \u201cAfter a long run of shop vacancies being below 10%, seeing them rise over that threshold once again will be a bitter disappointment to many.\u201d",

The comments come as economists register their concerns about the immediate prospects for the UK economy following the EU referendum, along with warnings that dire predictions might lead businesses to \u201cbatten down the hatches\u201d and create a self-fulfilling prophecy of an economic slump. The proportion of employers expecting to increase staffing levels over the next three months has fallen from 40% before the referendum to 36%, according to a study of more than 600 businesses published on Monday by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and employment agency Adecco. Meanwhile, a separate survey of 170 chief executives by accountants Grant Thornton found that 49% of respondents were less confident about the year ahead, while only 8% felt more confident. More than 20% are actively planning to decrease investment, while 56% remain unchanged in their investment decisions, Grant Thornton said. Ian Brinkley, the acting chief economist at the CIPD, said: \u201cThere is clear evidence some employers have become more cautious about hiring following the vote to leave the EU. While many businesses are treating the immediate post-Brexit period as \u2018business as usual\u2019, and hiring intentions overall still remain positive, there are signs that some organisations, particularly in the private sector, are preparing to batten down the hatches. \u201cThe economy had positive momentum going into the referendum and there is a risk that employers will create a self-fulfilling prophecy if they overreact in the expectation of a downturn. Instead of looking at cuts, now is the time to be talking about investment in people and in processes, and equipment that will boost productivity and improve the resilience of businesses and our economy.\u201d The comments come after the Bank of England cut interest rates earlier this month for the first time in more than seven years, to a record low of 0.25%, in a bigger-than-expected package of measures designed to prevent a post-Brexit vote recession. The Bank signalled that rates would be reduced further in the coming months as the economic fallout from the decision to leave the EU becomes clearer. Robert Hannah, the chief operating officer at Grant Thornton, said: \u201cWhile much of the immediate political and economic turbulence following the outcome of the vote has settled over the past few weeks, the general outlook for the UK economy remains a top concern for most businesses. \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cut earlier this month will have been met with mixed reactions. Many businesses will be encouraged by lower borrowing rates and the stimulus package announced, whereas others will see the reciprocating impact of the fall in sterling hit their cost of imports and be discomfited by the BoE\u2019s outlook on the UK economy.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct: Large shareholders may vote against chair at AGM", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Large shareholders in Sports Direct are considering voting against the reappointment of the company\u2019s chairman and other directors at next month\u2019s annual general meeting in a bid to force change at the top of the embattled chain. Keith Hellawell, who has been chairman since 2009, will be the main target at the AGM on 7 September. At last year\u2019s meeting, almost 24% of independent shareholders\u2019 votes went against him. After a year in which the company\u2019s reputation has been battered by the Guardian\u2019s revelations about its treatment of employees and declining financial performance, critics expect more shareholders to vote against Hellawell and other non-executive directors. The admission of Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority owner, to MPs that the company had become too big for him to control has added to concerns about how the it is managed. A source at a large fund manager said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the votes will be kinder to the board than they were last year, and they could be pretty striking numbers. It\u2019s possible that the chairman could face a majority of independent shareholders voting against him based on last year\u2019s result and a stiffening of the mood. \u201cMike Ashley told the select committee he has not got proper command and oversight of the company, and everything we\u2019ve seen indicates that is a fair assessment. That is a strong indictment of every member of that board.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s public relations advisers did not respond to a request for comment. New rules require minority investors to approve non-executive directors at companies where a single shareholder owns 30% or more. Ashley owns 55% of the company and is its executive deputy chairman. Sports Direct has become a test of shareholders\u2019 willingness to use the new rule to press for change. \u201cIf not now, then when?\u201d another fund management source said. If independent shareholders vote against Hellawell, Sports Direct can force his appointment through by holding another vote of all shareholders within 90 days. Large shareholders, however, also have long-running concerns. Standard Life voted against Hellawell, and other directors such as Simon Bentley, the former boss of Blacks Leisure, at last year\u2019s AGM. Hellawell rejected calls to quit in March when Sports Direct dropped out of the FTSE 100. He said the company was working to improve relations with shareholders and that problems with its corporate governance were often overstated. As in previous years, Sports Direct will hold the AGM at its headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. The sprawling \u201ccampus\u201d is also the location for the company\u2019s giant warehouse, where a Guardian investigation last year found that workers were effectively paid less than the minimum wage. Ashley has since increased pay to above the minimum wage and started his own review of working conditions, which will be assessed by Sports Direct\u2019s legal advisers RPC. The Unite trade union, however, is seeking City support for a resolution, opposed by Sports Direct, seeking an outside review of the treatment of employees. Large shareholders are considering adding to pressure on the board by sending representatives to the meeting. Hermes Investment Management, one of Britain\u2019s biggest fund managers, said it would send a senior official. Some big shareholders believe Hellawell\u2019s departure is needed for the company to show that it is serious about reforming its governance. Others said they would wait to see how negotiations turned out before deciding how to vote.",

      "body": "<p>Large shareholders in Sports Direct are considering voting against the reappointment of the company\u2019s chairman and other directors at next month\u2019s annual general meeting in a bid to force change at the top of the embattled chain.</p> <p>Keith Hellawell, who has been chairman since 2009, will be the main target at the AGM on 7 September. At last year\u2019s meeting, almost 24% of independent shareholders\u2019 votes went against him.</p> <p>After a year in which the company\u2019s reputation has been battered by the Guardian\u2019s revelations about its treatment of employees and declining financial performance, critics expect more shareholders to vote against Hellawell and other non-executive directors. </p> <p>The admission of Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/mike-ashleys-evidence-surprise-answers-to-unsurprising-questions\">to MPs that the company had become too big for him to control</a> has added to concerns about how the it is managed. </p> <p>A source at a large fund manager said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the votes will be kinder to the board than they were last year, and they could be pretty striking numbers. It\u2019s possible that the chairman could face a majority of independent shareholders voting against him based on last year\u2019s result and a stiffening of the mood.<br></p> <p>\u201cMike Ashley told the select committee he has not got proper command and oversight of the company, and everything we\u2019ve seen indicates that is a fair assessment. That is a strong indictment of every member of that board.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s public relations advisers did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>New rules require minority investors to approve non-executive directors at companies where a single shareholder owns 30% or more. Ashley owns 55% of the company and is its executive deputy chairman. Sports Direct has become a test of shareholders\u2019 willingness to use the new rule to press for change. \u201cIf not now, then when?\u201d another fund management source said.</p> <p>If independent shareholders vote against Hellawell, Sports Direct can force his appointment through by holding another vote of all shareholders within 90 days. </p> <p>Large shareholders, however, also have long-running concerns. Standard Life voted against Hellawell, and other directors such as Simon Bentley, the former boss of Blacks Leisure, at last year\u2019s AGM.</p> <p>Hellawell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/sports-direct-chairman-defies-calls-quit-keith-hellawell\">rejected calls to quit in March</a> when Sports Direct dropped out of the FTSE 100. He said the company was working to improve relations with shareholders and that problems with its corporate governance were often overstated. <br></p> <p>As in previous years, Sports Direct will hold the AGM at its headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. The sprawling \u201ccampus\u201d is also the location for the company\u2019s giant warehouse, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">a Guardian investigation</a> last year found that workers were effectively paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>Ashley has since increased pay to above the minimum wage and started his own review of working conditions, which will be assessed by Sports Direct\u2019s legal advisers RPC. The Unite trade union, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/unions-seek-city-support-for-review-of-sports-direct-working-conditions\">is seeking City support for a resolution</a>, opposed by Sports Direct, seeking an outside review of the treatment of employees.<br></p> <p>Large shareholders are considering adding to pressure on the board by sending representatives to the meeting. Hermes Investment Management, one of Britain\u2019s biggest fund managers, said it would send a senior official.</p> <p>Some big shareholders believe Hellawell\u2019s departure is needed for the company to show that it is serious about reforming its governance. Others said they would wait to see how negotiations turned out before deciding how to vote. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London could bear the brunt of a post-Brexit vote downturn, according to economic indicators in the weeks since the EU referendum pointing to job cuts, falling house prices and a decline in business activity in the capital. London\u2019s economy was relatively unaffected by the previous downturn, compared with other UK regions, but early signs from the latest bout of turmoil suggest that it might not get off so lightly again, economists have said. This could have consequences for the government\u2019s tax receipts and overall growth, given the city\u2019s contribution to the UK economy. One key concern about the impact on London of the vote to leave the EU stems from the capital\u2019s dependence on financial services. London could lose its status as Europe\u2019s financial capital if the UK leaves the single market and City banks are stripped of their lucrative EU \u201cpassports\u201d that allow them to sell services to the rest of the bloc. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cLondon was unscathed by the last recession, but its dependence on finance now is its achilles heel.\u201d He highlighted a potential change of fortunes for London in a note to clients after surveys showed that companies in the capital had taken a hit from the referendum result. London has been the UK\u2019s growth star for the past two decades, outperforming the rest of the country, Tombs said. \u201cSurveys since the referendum, however, indicate that the capital is at the sharp end of the post-referendum downturn,\u201d he added. London was the worst performer out of 12 regions on one measure of business activity for the weeks following 23 June, the day of the referendum. Companies in the capital cut jobs and suffered the sharpest fall in output since early 2009, when the UK was mired in recession, according to the Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers\u2019 index. Clients appeared reluctant to commit to new contracts, London businesses said, leading to a slump in order books. \u201cThe capital was hit harder than any other UK region,\u201d said Paul Evans, the regional director for London at Lloyds commercial banking. Alexandra Jones, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities thinktank, said London\u2019s mix of industries, high-skilled people and strong international connections put it in a good position to respond to any economic downturn. She too, however, said there were particular risks for the capital. \u201cThe European Union single market has been hugely important to London\u2019s success in recent years and lack of access to that market would have a big impact on the capital\u2019s economy,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSlower economic growth in London would also affect public spending across the UK, given the national exchequer\u2019s increasing reliance on London\u2019s tax revenues,\u201d she said, referring to a recent study by the Centre for Cities, which showed that the capital generated almost as much tax as the next 37 largest UK cities combined. Tombs said London\u2019s medium-term fate would depend on how well the City\u2019s interests are protected in Brexit negotiations. \u201cWe think London\u2019s economy will underperform the rest of the UK for a couple of years, not just a few months,\u201d he said. In terms of property, shares in Foxtons have fallen and the London-focused estate agent has said the referendum result will depress property sales in the capital for the rest of the year. A housing market report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed a slowdown across the market in July, but highlighted the fact that price falls were sharpest in London. London and East Anglia were the only areas where house prices were expected to fall over the coming year. Richard Donnell, the insight director at the property consultancy Hometrack, said modest price falls were likely in London\u2019s higher-value markets. \u201cFrom analysis of the past 20 years, we know that events which have shocked the UK economy, such as the dotcom bubble bursting in 2000 and the Iraq war in 2003, impacted housing turnover in London far more heavily than the rest of the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cEven before the EU referendum, high prices, low yields, unaffordability, tax changes for landlords and poor value for money for overseas buyers were creating strong headwinds in the London housing market, which will intensify following the vote to leave.\u201d Not everyone, however, expects London to face a bumpy post-Brexit vote period. Sebastian Burnside, NatWest\u2019s senior economist, said the capital had enjoyed a 17% increase in the number of jobs since 2008 - more than double the growth in the east of England, the second-best performing region. \u201cThat performance isn\u2019t based only on the financial sector. London\u2019s strengths are much broader than that. Technology, professional services and the creative industries are all strong. The things that powered the economy in London won\u2019t have gone away overnight, even if we don\u2019t get a good deal out of negotiations,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen is it my fucking year?\u201d The line you\u2019re most likely to hear quoted from Equity, one of the summer\u2019s most memorable movies \u2013 and one of the best movies ever made about Wall Street \u2013 is the actor Anna Gunn\u2019s hymn of praise to the joys of money. \u201cI really do like money,\u201d says Gunn, playing the role of investment banker Naomi Bishop. \u201cDon\u2019t let money be a dirty word.\u201d But while that call resonates \u2013 she tells a group of young women that it\u2019s OK to be rewarded for being tough, talented and working twice as hard as the men around them \u2013 it somehow lacks the power and the energy of the challenge levied by a furious Bishop to her boss, the global head of equities at the investment bank where she works. He\u2019s retiring. She wants his job, and knows she deserves it. The problem? Although she\u2019s a superstar banker, Bishop has recently, inexplicably lost at the last minute to a rival bank. Now, all that anyone wants to talk about is what went wrong. She\u2019s told: \u201cYou rubbed people the wrong way.\u201d What does that mean? Well, a bemused and annoyed Bishop finds out, it might have been that \u201cI wore an awful dress\u201d on one occasion. It has now been two decades since one of the worst cases of blatant harassment and discrimination against women on Wall Street hit the headlines. The \u201cboom boom room\u201d was a real place, a basement party room at a branch office of Shearson Lehman (later Smith Barney) in Garden City, New York. What took place there, and at other Smith Barney brokerages, ranged from outright sexual assault to the kind of harassment that is almost mundane for women who work on trading floors, such as strippers showing up to celebrate birthdays. Adding insult to injury, many of the 2,000 or so plaintiffs in what \u2013 against the odds \u2013 became a class action lawsuit, earned lower salaries, saw commissions handed to male colleagues and weren\u2019t given the materials they needed to prepare for exams. Smith Barney, now part of Citigroup, paid $150m to settle the claims. Along with other banks, it did everything it could to burnish its image as an attractive place for women to work. It hasn\u2019t really worked, at least if you judge by Maureen Sherry\u2019s new novel, Opening Belle, published early this year by Simon &amp; Schuster. (It, too, will soon be a movie, starring Reese Witherspoon in the title role.) And there\u2019s no reason not to pay attention: Sherry worked at Bear Stearns and has mined her own experiences for material. Sherry\u2019s autobiographical heroine is Isabelle McElroy, 36, a highflyer at Feagin Dixon (a very thinly disguised Bear Stearns run by a very thinly veiled composite of Ace Greenberg, bald head and all, and Jimmy Cayne, although with a drug habit that carefully isn\u2019t cannabis). After joining a group of unhappy women \u2013 the Glass Ceiling Club \u2013 and after a mysterious individual begins sending emails alerting all and sundry to the most egregious behavior at the firm, Feagin Dixon\u2019s Greenberg/Cayne composite convenes a lunch meeting of all his senior women to discuss issues that concern them. The valiant Belle is the only one to speak up, however. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear slut jokes all day long. I don\u2019t want to work in a frat house. I want to be paid equally. I want my input on abnormal rates of risk we take to be heard.\u201d The examples Belle gives of what she endures precisely mirror those that Sherry herself described in an op-ed. Colleagues who uttered \u201cmoo\u201d sounds when she used a breast pump after maternity leave, and one who drank a shot of her breast milk on a dare. A trader who supplied women on the desk with Band-Aids to cover their nipples when it was cold, because he didn\u2019t want to be \u201cdistracted\u201d. Instead of brooding over it all, or getting angry, Sherry advised her younger female colleagues on the importance of handling an important client making a pass at her without annoying him. She prided herself on thick skin. \u201cWe\u2019re ambitious and we aren\u2019t overly sensitive,\u201d a friendwarns her at one point. \u201cThey know how to work with us. The guys aren\u2019t going to change. It\u2019s too late for them. The women just need to deal with it.\u201d But do they? Or should they? While most of Wall Street\u2019s senior women have indeed grown thick skins, they aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cdealing\u201d with it. One woman, Megan Messina, received a bonus a third the size of a man with the same title and similar responsibilities at her employer, Bank of America. That seems to have been the moment when she asked herself when it was going to be her year: although her bonus was a lavish $1.5m, more than most of us can expect to earn in a decade or more, she says the bank\u2019s \u201cbros culture\u201d ensured she wasn\u2019t taken seriously. Her first conversation with her new boss, according to a lawsuit she filed, included him asking her whether she colored her hair. Just how many gender bias cases does Wall Street want to settle? In 2013, Bank of America forked over $39m to women who had worked at Merrill Lynch, in the latest in a long string of discrimination cases involving women and racial minorities dating back decades. Many other cases are settled out of the public eye, through mandatory arbitration. But discrimination, whether it\u2019s subtle (the result of a woman wearing a dress that somehow, inexplicably, a client dislikes) or overt (a woman being forced to share her commissions and clients with a younger man) is still a reality. So, too, is harassment. It\u2019s also worth noting that when most of these women make it big, they don\u2019t do so within big Wall Street firms. Maria Elena Lagomasino was chairman and CEO of the JP Morgan Private Bank, and became CEO of WE Family Offices, a global wealth management firm. Sallie Krawcheck became chief financial officer of Citigroup, then moved to Bank of America Merrill Lynch to head its asset management division. When the bank\u2019s CEO, Brian Moynihan, eliminated her position \u2013 in spite of the fact that Krawcheck had produced profits for the then struggling bank \u2013 she moved on to acquire a professional women\u2019s networking group that began as a Goldman Sachs alumnae organization, and now is launching Ellevest, a new investment platform aimed at women. Another high flyer, Blythe Masters, left JP Morgan Chase to launch her own blockchain company, Digital Asset Holdings. In Sherry\u2019s view of the world, a few smart women on Wall Street\u2019s risk committees might have prevented some of the mayhem of the financial crisis. In Equity, Bishop is the principled investment banker who wants to do what it takes to raise capital for her clients to get money from investors to entrepreneurs. Traders\u2019 greed and her colleagues\u2019 games bemuse her. Maybe, just maybe, all this will trigger a serious discussion about women on Wall Street, rather than more propaganda. It\u2019s not likely to change attitudes on a day-to-day basis, but in this kind of environment, doing away with mandatory arbitration, so that the worst offenders can be publicly named and shamed in lawsuits, would be a fine start. Because at some point, it has to be their fucking year.",

    "webTitle": "Deliveroo told it must pay workers minimum wage", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deliveroo has been told by the government that it must pay its workers the minimum wage unless a court rules that they are self-employed. The food delivery company, which is embroiled in a pay row with its couriers, has had its proposed wage deal described by the Labour party as \u201cVictorian\u201d. The plans prompted hundreds of self-employed riders to protest over attempts to pay them per delivery rather than by the hour, a move which, they say, will significantly reduce their earnings. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy insisted that workers must be paid the \u201cnational living wage\u201d (NLW) of \u00a37.20 an hour unless a court or HM Revenue and Customs defines them as self-employed. \u201cThe government is determined to build an economy that works for all \u2013 that includes ensuring everyone gets a decent wage. An individual\u2019s employment status is determined by the reality of the working relationship and not the type of contract they have signed,\u201d a BEIS spokesman said. \u201cIndividuals cannot opt out of the rights they are owed, nor can an employer decide not to afford individuals those rights. Employers cannot simply opt out of the NLW by defining their staff as self-employed.\u201d Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants that do not have their own delivery service. Its clients include Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen. The company charges customers \u00a32.50 per delivery. Couriers, who are self-employed and provide their own transport, said the move to \u00a33.75 per delivery, instead of an hourly rate of \u00a37, plus \u00a31 per delivery, would lead to uncertainty and lower wages. They are keeping up their protests and the next strike will be in Camden, north London, later on Sunday. On Friday, the company was criticised by the shadow business secretary, Jon Trickett, who accused Deliveroo of \u201coffering a return to a Victorian system which has no place in modern Britain\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian on Thursday, Amir Ali, a Deliveroo courier who went on strike last week, said: \u201c\u00a37 an hour was OK, and if you worked hard, it was good. But now they are cutting it below the basic wage. We work in snow, we work in rain. They don\u2019t give you a place to sit down.\u201d Deliveroo has insisted that the new pay deal is only being trialled in certain areas of London, with about 280 riders taking part, out of more than 3,000 in the capital. In a blogpost, it said pilots of the pay-per-delivery system have led to a doubling of average hourly fees for riders during the busiest times. Dan Warne, Deliveroo\u2019s UK managing director, said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to having an open conversation with riders about this trial. We\u2019ve reached out to every rider involved to gather feedback. We\u2019ve listened to their concerns and offered every rider the choice to withdraw from the trial. \u201cFor those that choose to take part in the trial, we\u2019ll also be guaranteeing [that] fees at peak times for riders will be at least \u00a37.50 per hour, plus tips and petrol costs.\u201d The company added that under the old pay model, its couriers earned an average of around \u00a39 an hour, while it claimed the new scheme would result in payments of \u201cabout \u00a310 per hour, with efficient riders making \u00a315-\u00a317 and some as much as \u00a325\u201d. The criticisms of Deliveroo come after the Guardian revealed last month that Hermes, Britain\u2019s second-biggest parcel company, is paying some of its couriers at levels equivalent to below the national living wage because they are self-employed. Hermes said it is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that our couriers receive earnings that are equivalent or higher than the national living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 per hour.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve had all the surveys. There have been forecasts and predictions by the score. Every thinktank, every City analyst, every international body has a view about whether the UK economy is going to drop into recession following the EU referendum on 23 June. Some of them have sophisticated models of the economy to help them, but the truth is nobody really knows. This week will see the first piece of hard evidence of how the economy has fared in the period after the Brexit vote. Thursday\u2019s retail sales report from the Office for National Statistics will show what happened to spending in the shops and online in July. The ONS data is eagerly awaited because the survey evidence has been so mixed. Reports from the CBI and the polling company GfK have been downbeat, but those from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents have been more positive. Interestingly, both the BRC and Threadneedle Street found that consumer behaviour seemed more affected by the weather than it was by the referendum. If the UK is to steer clear of recession over the coming months, it is important for the tills to keep jangling in the high street. In part, that\u2019s because consumer spending accounts for around two-thirds of national output. But it is also because one of the other big components of GDP \u2013 investment \u2013 is likely to be weak. By and large, businesses were in favour of remaining in the EU and it may take them some time to get over the shock of the result. The report from the Bank\u2019s agents suggested that investment over the next year will now be lower than it would have been, although not dramatically so. Companies will only consider investing if they think demand is going to be strong enough to warrant extra spending on buildings, plant, machinery and training. For those that export, the fall in the value of the pound should help, but the strength of consumer spending will be crucial for those that cater for the domestic UK market. There are umpteen factors that affect consumer behaviour, but the two big ones are the state of the labour market and spending power once the mortgage or rent has been paid. Put simply, people will spend less if they think they are about to lose their jobs or if the value of their wages and salaries is being eroded by higher prices or the rising cost of housing. The recession of the 1990s was caused by a combination of these two effects: a doubling of interest rates to 15% led to much higher unemployment and a sharp reduction in disposable income. Consumer spending fell off a cliff. The recession of 2008 to 2009 was different from those of the early 1980s or early 1990s. In those episodes, interest rates were raised aggressively to combat rising inflation. Last time round, the trouble was not excess consumer demand, it was a crisis in the financial sector, which led to a global credit crunch. In terms of the hit to national output, the last recession was more severe than those of the early 1980s and early 1990s. As such, it was reasonable to assume that unemployment would rise even more sharply than it during those previous downturns. But it didn\u2019t. The labour market felt the strain, but the effects came through in different ways: through under-employment, an increase in self-employment and a sharp drop in productivity growth. People were prepared to accept pay cuts or freezes in order to hold on to their jobs. This was far from an ideal outcome, but better than mass unemployment. The problems that those parts of the UK that suffered de-industrialisation in the 1980s still faced is proof of how joblessness leaves deep and permanent scars. The labour market looked pretty healthy before the referendum. In the three months ending in May, unemployment was at its lowest level since 2005, a year when the economy was booming ahead of the financial crisis. The percentage of the population in work has not been higher since modern records began in 1971, but wage growth has remained stubbornly weak. Average earnings are rising at just over 2%, well down on the levels seen in the years leading up to the financial crisis. One explanation is that there is more slack in the labour market than the official figures suggest. Another is that the dice are loaded in favour of employers in pay negotiations, and that the part of the economy where trade unions have a significant presence \u2013 the public sector \u2013 has borne the brunt of austerity. The Resolution Foundation provides a third explanation in its latest earnings outlook. Researcher Laura Gardiner says earnings growth for those people who stayed in the same job fell from 4% to 2% between 2008 and 2010 and has never recovered. By contrast, the average pay rise for those who change jobs has risen steadily since the economy started to recover and stood at 7.5% in 2015. Gardiner says that previous experience would have led her to expect a \u201cknock-on effect on pay settlements for the \u2018static\u2019 workforce, via mechanisms such as firms experiencing resignations raising the pay of those who remain for fear of losing them too.\u201d There has, though, been little sign of such effects. Gardiner speculates that the reason could be that job mobility is still below its peak, that firms don\u2019t think the stayers need higher pay awards to command their continued loyalty, or that the stayers crave job security in what seems like a tentative recovery. Brexit, she says, may further delay any take off in wage growth, and that seems a reasonable assumption. Even if unemployment holds steady at its current levels, it is hard to envisage average earnings rising at much more than their current level. This won\u2019t matter much in the short term, because with inflation so low spending power is increasing. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut interest rates \u2013 and, just as importantly, signal that they will stay low for a prolonged period \u2013 means that households have the reassurance that the cost of housing is not going to shoot up. The fall in the pound will lead to dearer imports and higher inflation. That will eat into real income growth and is likely to lead to slower consumer spending growth. The process, however, will probably not be immediate and it probably won\u2019t be as dramatic as some fear. Policy stimulus and a willingness to accept low pay awards will support employment, but productivity and living standards will be squeezed. Life for most people will go on in much the same way as it has ever since the financial crisis.",

      "bodyText": "The gambling industry \u2013 which always tries to paint itself as a wildly exciting sector \u2013 is in the doldrums. It has been devoid of genuinely new ideas for years, and its current mantra involves repeating decade-old ambitions (online and international growth) or merging to cut costs. We\u2019ve seen this with the Ladbrokes/Coral and Paddy Power/Betfair tie-ups and the latest is the somewhat cheeky \u00a33.6bn approach for William Hill by two of its small rivals \u2013 online group 888 and casino/bingo operator Rank. William Hill laughed that one out last week \u2013 a \u201cthree-way marriage of inconvenience\u201d as the bookie\u2019s chairman, Gareth Davis, put it \u2013 but the issue is sure to be raised again. Rank reports results on Thursday and the two suitors must do something before next Sunday to avoid being timed out. Still, if there is going to be a development this week, someone at Rank and 888 has some work to do. Their proposal states: \u201c888 and Rank see particular opportunity in... some 2m higher-value [Grosvenor] casino customers, of whom over 50% play or bet online but currently under 3% play online with Grosvenor.\u201d So the pitch seems to be: \u201cWe can\u2019t get our punters to play with us. Do you fancy a stab?\u201d Rank boss Henry Birch insists his approach wasn\u2019t opportunistic. Lord knows what it would have looked like had he rushed it out. The name\u2019s bond \u2013 unsold British bond \u201cNothing will teach you more about perceived value than taking something with literally no value and selling it in the auction format. It teaches you the beauty and power of presentation, and how you can make magic out of nothing.\u201d So said Sophia Amoruso, the founder of fashion retailer Nasty Gal, and while that seems to sum up auctions rather neatly, Amoruso sadly appears to have remained silent on the concept of reverse auctions (I want to buy something, please put in your offers for what you\u2019ll sell it for). Can they also make seemingly dull assets suddenly seem like gold? We will get a chance to see that particular theory in action on Tuesday, when the Bank of England takes a second stab at buying back boring old long-dated gilts as part of its latest attempts at quantitative easing. Last week, the first effort at a long-dated buyback ended up making the Bank look like it was running a fringe event at the Rio Olympics: very few people showed up. For the first time ever Threadneedle Street couldn\u2019t buy the quantities of bonds wanted, at any price. It wasn\u2019t exactly a triumph. Developing. Referendum shock? Let\u2019s hit the shops In Annie Hall, Woody Allen\u2019s character, Alvy Singer, courageously sums up his relationship with Diane Keaton\u2019s eponymous heroine. \u201cA relationship, I think, is like a shark,\u201d he smooths. \u201cYou know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.\u201d It could be stretching a great gag too far, but it is tempting to view an economy along similar lines. It has to be kept moving by consumer spending, or it dies. And what we have on our hands in the UK is still \u2013 just about \u2013 a live shark. Retail sales data due this week from the Office for National Statistics is expected to show that we have continued to spend despite the shock of the referendum result. Warm weather and heavy discounts helped drive a rebound in other recent measure of retail sales, and figures published last week by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), showed that the value of online and high-street sales rose at its fastest pace for six months in the four weeks to 30 July. The statistics chimed with further studies, as well as with another great Annie Hall gag. Annie: \u201cSometimes I ask myself how I\u2019d stand up under torture.\u201d Alvy: \u201cYou kiddin\u2019? If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale\u2019s charge card, you\u2019d tell \u2019em everything.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As ever, it has taken the smell of Britain\u2019s problems reaching parliament to make government act. After Brexit, the manufacturing sector, which had been ebbing towards recession for some time, has now begun to shrink. We have too few of the higher-paying jobs that manufacturing can offer to poor white boys and girls, and soon we will have even fewer. This is rotting our democracy, not to mention wasting talent and denying us all the prosperity a full use of our workforce, capabilities and assets would bring. So we need something that helps us make things to sell abroad, and make some more productive jobs in the north. Business leaders know this and have welcomed Theresa May\u2019s move to merge the government\u2019s business and energy departments and add the phrase \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d into the title. We have had industrial strategies in the UK before, and they have to a large extent got us to where we are now. One element was to privatise national industries like steel, water, electricity and rail. Unfortunately, while this made money for some in the short term, the taxpayer often had to write off billions in debts to encourage buyers, only then to see the break-up of services, the sale of assets and lower investment in research and training. Now, commuters face yet more cancellations on Southern rail, energy consumers are weary of complex deals and switching providers, and governments have been compelled to intervene in the steel industry. Jobs and profits are heading somewhere else. At times it feels like the only major subsidised industry we have left is banking. So, what could a new industrial strategy look like? One which really does work in the interests of all the people, as our new prime minister promised in Downing Street? Firstly, a progressive industrial strategy promotes innovation in new products and processes. We are pretty good at this. Then you need a system to accumulate money and land to build the factories that make the products. We are not so good at that. This seems odd, when the one thing we do own is banks, but it is a product of the \u201csilo effect\u201d taking place on a national scale. Let me explain how it once worked. My dear friend Harris Thompson, known as Tommy and born in 1912, was a brilliant engineer educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who was once in charge of a system that brought ideas all the way from the bench to products for sale. I knew him in later life when, after teaching engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder, he had developed a portable respirator so that people could move around instead of being trapped in an \u201ciron lung\u201d. As he explained, you need a complete system so that people can comprehensively test the craziest ideas and see whether or not they work. You then need a way of filtering the best ideas and bringing them to the next stage, and then the next, until they appear in the showroom. He had worked in large organisations that took possession of every part of this journey. When more money was needed, investment came from within the firm. You need such a firm, not just to defend your economy but your life. A proper industrial strategy is not just about the economy, it is a matter of national security. During the second world war, Tommy was given a prototype for the higher-frequency radar transmitters that were needed to detect the German submarines wreaking havoc with Britain\u2019s food convoys. With MIT and American industry, he was able to turn it into something that could be manufactured in the thousands for targeted use against U-boats. What if he had been forced to take the prototype to a banker and ask for the money for the factory, promising in return to develop the prototype for sale to the navy? There is a good chance the banker wouldn\u2019t see a big enough return for the risk and the U-boats would have kept sinking allied ships. We need an organisation that can make the products that will defend our way of life, from idea to prototype to finished product. This really matters when a product is not a luxury but a necessity \u2013 such as water, energy, transport and even training. But, just like the US, we have broken up the larger organisations we need in this journey. Why? Because you can often make money in the short term by breaking up big organisations, keeping the profitable bits going, and shutting down those bits losing money. The state can and should stop this. Let\u2019s ask a basic question. What is a state for? The first role of the state is to defend our security and our way of life. Mistakenly, successive governments believed that this could be done using the free market for more and more of the operation. Now we have seen how that can go wrong. From energy to transport, we need to put some of the mistakes of recent years into reverse. We must reclaim the essential means of production and plan together for what we want to do with it. Some of this will require the state to act \u2013 to place orders, purchase research and procure products that force manufacturers to train new staff. As we do, we will begin to rebalance not only the economy but society and the country: and the state will once more show it has a reason to exist.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The proposed new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset has turned into the first headache for Theresa May\u2019s government. The issue is now about far more than Britain\u2019s energy policy. It is about foreign policy too. May is yet to say anything publicly about the government\u2019s decision to review the \u00a318bn project. The only official comment was from Greg Clark, the new business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, who welcomed EDF\u2019s approval of the project but added: \u201cThe government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.\u201d On the face of it, taking time to review such a controversial project is sensible. After all, there are genuine doubts about whether EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, can build the plant and its European pressurised reactor (EPR) on time, on budget and safely. The National Audit Office has warned that taxpayers could end up paying more than \u00a330bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. But the role of China has taken centre stage. The China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has a 33% stake in Hinkley, with a gentleman\u2019s agreement that it will go on to build its own nuclear plants in Britain. Last week it emerged that CGN and a consultant to the company have been charged in the US with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material. We now know, thanks to Vince Cable, that May raised security concerns about that while home secretary in the coalition. Her joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote last year that David Cameron\u2019s government was \u201cselling our national security to China\u201d. No one in May\u2019s new government has done much to move people away from the idea that it is concerned about China\u2019s involvement in Hinkley. That is presumably why China\u2019s ambassador to the UK said last week that Beijing\u2019s relationship with the UK was at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d. Britain\u2019s relationship with China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, is clearly at risk because of the plant. The fact that the Hinkley saga \u2013 which has rumbled on for a decade \u2013 is reaching a climax just weeks after Britain voted to leave the European Union adds another ingredient to the mix. Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, says Britain must show that it is open for business and \u201ccan\u2019t be too fussy about who we do trade with\u201d. Mandelson\u2019s comments represent the extreme end of one side of the argument, with Timothy\u2019s at the other. Britain must find a way to work with China, a key investor in London Heathrow, Canary Wharf and football clubs. It could also back other key infrastructure projects such as High Speed 2. China has already shown it is keen to invest in Britain, where the legal and regulatory system offer the reassurance of a safe haven for assets. Security, of course, should be a concern. But when Britain agreed to sell British Energy to EDF for \u00a312.5bn in 2008, it became inevitable that foreign investment and expertise would be needed to build new nuclear power stations. The only way, therefore, to develop a home-grown energy policy is to move away from large Hinkley-type projects, either towards forms of renewable energy or towards smaller nuclear power plants, which Rolls-Royce can build. But if the government does decide to scrap Hinkley Point C, the decision should not be about security: it should be because alternatives offer more value, efficiency, and safety. The potential cost to the taxpayer through subsidies to EDF and China, and the question marks about the EPR reactor \u2013 there still isn\u2019t one in service anywhere in the world \u2013 are more pressing concerns than Chinese involvement. If the government does scrap Hinkley Point C, it must outline the alternative route it intends to take \u2013 and then ensure there are no hard feelings in Beijing. Inheritance tax law needs reform The Dukes of Westminster have had almost as much influence on tax law as they have on the garden squares of Mayfair and Belgravia. The \u00a39bn property fortune now passing to a new generation would probably not exist today without a legal environment moulded over time by the very richest families. The second duke, famous for his four wives and a love affair with Coco Chanel, was more cautious with his finances than his personal life might suggest. In 1936 he won a case in which the judge stated that every man was entitled to arrange his affairs so that the tax owing was \u201cless than it otherwise would be\u201d. The ruling has been a thorn in the revenue\u2019s side ever since. The trust structure from which the 25-year-old Hugh Grosvenor and his sisters will benefit dates from his death in 1953. For the Grosvenors, the 40% death duties incurred by normal estates do not apply. Trusts can last for up to 125 years, with wealth flowing freely from one generation to another. Campaigners are calling for the beneficiaries of family trusts to be named on a public register, and for trusts to publish annual accounts, as private companies do. Lobbyists in the thriving wealth management industry argue that opaqueness provides protection. Research suggests as many as a quarter of the beneficiaries are either children or vulnerable adults. A public register would expose individuals who have access to significant sums. But the secrecy arguments are weak. These vulnerable individuals do not control the money from which they benefit \u2013 that responsibility lies with competent adult trustees. The latest available data shows the number of trusts registered with the tax office has fallen slowly over time, to 160,500 in the financial year ending in March 2013. But their total annual income has risen to \u00a32bn. The degree to which trusts should be taxed is up for discussion, but the argument for transparency has surely been won. Stop whingeing about apprenticeships Depending on who you listen to, the government\u2019s planned apprenticeship levy is a desperately needed scheme to address Britain\u2019s chronic skills shortage or a badly designed payroll tax that will drive down the quality of training. Both sides were out in force to make their case on Friday when the government confirmed it was launching the levy next April and ignoring the calls from business for a postponement in the wake of the Brexit vote. Just days earlier, Downing Street had faced down calls from corporate lobbyists to slow the implementation of the national living wage. Critics who say that the design of the apprenticeship levy needs tweaking to get the kind of schemes we need may be proven right. But Theresa May\u2019s government is right to press ahead with an April launch. May said last week that she wants to tackle inequality, and creating more routes into secure jobs with good career prospects is a key part of that.",

      "body": "<p>The proposed new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset has turned into the first headache for Theresa May\u2019s government. The issue is now about far more than Britain\u2019s energy policy. It is about foreign policy too.</p> <p>May is yet to say anything publicly about the government\u2019s decision to review the \u00a318bn project. The only official comment was from Greg Clark, the new business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, who welcomed EDF\u2019s approval of the project but added: \u201cThe government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.\u201d</p> <p>On the face of it, taking time to review such a controversial project is sensible. After all, there are genuine doubts about whether EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, can build the plant and its European pressurised reactor (EPR) on time, on budget and safely. The National Audit Office has warned that taxpayers could end up paying more than \u00a330bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project.</p> <p>But the role of China has taken centre stage. The China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has a 33% stake in Hinkley, with a gentleman\u2019s agreement that it will go on to build its own nuclear plants in Britain. Last week it emerged that CGN and a consultant to the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller\" title=\"\">have been charged in the US with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material</a>.</p> <p>We now know, thanks to Vince Cable, that May raised security concerns about that while home secretary in the coalition. Her joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote last year that David Cameron\u2019s government was \u201cselling our national security to China\u201d.</p> <p>No one in May\u2019s new government has done much to move people away from the idea that it is concerned about China\u2019s involvement in Hinkley. That is presumably why China\u2019s ambassador to the UK said last week that Beijing\u2019s relationship with the UK was at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s relationship with China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, is clearly at risk because of the plant. The fact that the Hinkley saga \u2013 which has rumbled on for a decade \u2013 is reaching a climax just weeks after Britain voted to leave the European Union adds another ingredient to the mix.</p> <p>Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, says Britain must show that it is open for business and \u201ccan\u2019t be too fussy about who we do trade with\u201d. Mandelson\u2019s comments represent the extreme end of one side of the argument, with Timothy\u2019s at the other.</p> <p>Britain must find a way to work with China, a key investor in London Heathrow, Canary Wharf and football clubs. It could also back other key infrastructure projects such as High Speed 2. China has already shown it is keen to invest in Britain, where the legal and regulatory system offer the reassurance of a safe haven for assets.</p> <p>Security, of course, should be a concern. But when Britain agreed to sell British Energy to EDF for \u00a312.5bn in 2008, it became inevitable that foreign investment and expertise would be needed to build new nuclear power stations.</p> <p>The only way, therefore, to develop a home-grown energy policy is to move away from large Hinkley-type projects,&#xa0;either towards forms of renewable energy or towards smaller nuclear&#xa0;power plants, which Rolls-Royce can build.</p> <p>But if the government does decide to scrap Hinkley Point C, the decision should not be about security: it should be because alternatives offer more value, efficiency, and safety. The potential cost to the taxpayer through subsidies to EDF and China, and the question marks about the EPR reactor \u2013 there still isn\u2019t one in service anywhere in the world \u2013 are more pressing concerns than Chinese involvement.</p> <p>If the government does scrap Hinkley Point C, it must outline the alternative route it intends to take \u2013 and then ensure there are no hard feelings in Beijing.</p> <h2>Inheritance tax law needs reform<br></h2> <p>The Dukes of Westminster have had almost as much influence on tax law as they have on the garden squares of Mayfair and Belgravia. The \u00a39bn property fortune now passing to a new generation would probably not exist today without a legal environment moulded over time by the very richest families.</p> <p>The second duke, famous for his four wives and a love affair with Coco Chanel, was more cautious with his finances than his personal life might suggest. In 1936 he won a case in which the judge stated that every man was entitled to arrange his affairs so that the tax owing was \u201cless than it otherwise would be\u201d. The ruling has been a thorn in the revenue\u2019s side ever since.</p> <p>The trust structure from which the 25-year-old Hugh Grosvenor and his sisters will benefit dates from his death in 1953. For the Grosvenors, the 40% death duties incurred by normal estates do not apply. Trusts can last for up to 125 years, with wealth flowing freely from one generation to another.</p> <p>Campaigners are calling for the beneficiaries of family trusts to be named on a public register, and for trusts to publish annual accounts, as private companies do.</p> <p>Lobbyists in the thriving wealth management industry argue that opaqueness provides protection. Research suggests as many as a quarter of the beneficiaries are either children or vulnerable adults. A public register would expose individuals who have access to significant sums.</p> <p>But the secrecy arguments are weak. These vulnerable individuals do not control the money from which they benefit \u2013 that responsibility lies with competent adult trustees.</p> <p>The latest available data shows the number of trusts registered with the tax office has fallen slowly over time, to 160,500 in the financial year ending in March 2013. But their total annual income has risen to \u00a32bn.</p> <p>The degree to which trusts should be taxed is up for discussion, but the argument for transparency has surely been won.</p> <h2>Stop whingeing about apprenticeships<br></h2> <p>Depending on who you listen to, the government\u2019s planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/12/apprenticeships-levy-will-go-ahead-next-year-uk-government-confirms\" title=\"\">apprenticeship levy</a> is a desperately needed scheme to address Britain\u2019s chronic skills shortage or a badly designed payroll tax that will drive down the quality of training.</p> <p>Both sides were out in force to make their case on Friday when the government confirmed it was launching the levy next April and ignoring the calls from business for a postponement in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Just days earlier, Downing Street had faced down calls from corporate lobbyists to slow the implementation of the national living wage.</p> <p>Critics who say that the design of the apprenticeship levy needs tweaking to get the kind of schemes we need may be proven right. But Theresa May\u2019s government is right to press ahead with an April launch.</p> <p>May said last week that she wants to tackle inequality, and creating more routes into secure jobs with good career prospects is a key part of that.</p>",
