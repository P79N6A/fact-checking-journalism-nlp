      "bodyText": "Quantitative easing has \"lost its bite\" according to leading Bank of England policymaker Paul Tucker, who said the policy of printing money was unlikely to have a major impact on the economy. Tucker, who is a deputy governor of the central bank, warned that \"there are no silver bullets\" in Threadneedle Street's armoury. He also said the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, wanted to make credit cheaper, but was wary of adding to the \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing (QE) in case it triggers a rise in inflation. The downbeat assessment of QE will cheer some analysts in the City who believe the scheme is having little effect on the ability of banks to lend, especially to small businesses. A report by the economic thinktank, the CEBR, found that the main beneficiaries of QE were mortgage payers, who rejected spending the money in favour of paying down their mortgages. The Treasury is relying on QE to increase the amount of money available for spending to offset the effects of its austerity programme. Tucker is a fan of the central bank's latest scheme, called funding for lending, which offers cheap funds to banks if they agree to pass them on directly to customers, but he counselled against expecting a dramatic effect from this scheme to increase lending.

Nevertheless, Nadir said that despite maintaining the trappings of wealth in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus \u2013 and on his return to the UK two years ago including a retinue of bodyguards, a rented Mayfair apartment and the use of chauffeur-driven luxury cars \u2013 the former Polly Peck boss has no assets, not even a bank account.</p> <p>Nadir, who is serving time in Belmarsh prison, argues that since he fled in 1993 \u2014 four months before he was first due to stand trial \u2014 his lifestyle and some of his legal bills had been funded by his family and generous supporters, with the largest contribution latterly coming from Hamit Bagana, the joint owner of <a href=\"http://www.onurair.com.tr/default_eng.aspx\" title=\"\">Turkish airline Onur Air</a>.

      "bodyText": "The fallen business tycoon Asil Nadir, who spent 17 years as a fugitive in apparent luxury in northern Cyprus before returning to the UK and being jailed last month for stealing \u00a329m from his failed Polly Peck empire, has insisted he is broke. Serious Fraud Office prosecutors are pursuing a \u00a360m compensation claim on behalf of Polly Peck creditors following Nadir's conviction on 10 counts of theft from the sprawling conglomerate before it collapsed with debts of \u00a3550m in 1990. Philip Shears QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey that Nadir's summary of his financial position was \"an affront to common sense and to the manifest reality\". If the court agrees that 71-year-old Nadir has failed to give a credible account of his wealth, he could see his 10-year jail term extended by several years. Nevertheless, Nadir said that despite maintaining the trappings of wealth in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus \u2013 and on his return to the UK two years ago including a retinue of bodyguards, a rented Mayfair apartment and the use of chauffeur-driven luxury cars \u2013 the former Polly Peck boss has no assets, not even a bank account. Nadir, who is serving time in Belmarsh prison, argues that since he fled in 1993 \u2014 four months before he was first due to stand trial \u2014 his lifestyle and some of his legal bills had been funded by his family and generous supporters, with the largest contribution latterly coming from Hamit Bagana, the joint owner of Turkish airline Onur Air. It was on an Onur Air jet that Nadir returned to the UK in 2010, promising in a blaze of publicity to fight in the courts the \"immense injustice and tremendous abuse of power\". If sufficient assets are identified, as well as repaying Polly Peck creditors Nadir will be required to stump up for a substantial part of his legal costs during the seven-month trial, which were met by British taxpayers through the legal aid system. Nadir admits receiving about \u00a36,000 a month from a media empire in northern Cyprus which carries his initials, AN Graffics. However, he insisted that the business was owned by his elderly mother, who lives in Cyprus and is unwell. This, Shears noted, was contrary to the evidence of two Cypriot witnesses called by Nadir in his defence. Beyond his income from AN Graffics, Nadir claims to have lived rent-free in a northern Cyprus home also owned by his mother and to have received an occasional allowance from her, in part to support his bodyguards and other household staff. Before he left the UK Nadir, who was then declared insolvent, had become notorious for frustrating the efforts of his bankrupcy trustees. On one occasion some months before he fled, relations had reached such a low point that those conducting a raid on his then home in Eaton Square, Belgravia, central London, removed an expensive watch from his wrist. Shortly afterwards, as a birthday present, the then Conservative Northern Ireland minister Michael Mates gave him a replacement watch bearing the inscription \"Don't let the buggers get you down\". Nadir companies had given generously to Tory campaign efforts, donating \u00a3440,000. Since his conviction party officials said the donations \"were accepted in good faith from what was then considered to be a leading British company.\" Nadir was discharged from bankruptcy in February this year after \"a supporter\" made a payment of \u00a3750,000. However, Shears told the court that this should not be taken as an indication that the bankruptcy trustees had been satisfied that he had declared all his business interests to them. The SFO has suggested the true amount Nadir siphoned out of the one-time FTSE 100 business he headed could be more than \u00a3380m. The agency had failed to apply for a confiscation order in relation to Nadir \u2014 legally different from a compensation order \u2014 many years ago, which could have led to much greater claims being sought against him. Counsel for Nadir, Philip Hackett QC, said much of the SFO's claims about his assets came from \"the internet and Wikipedia\". \"There is not a shred of evidence that he has been involved in any business.\" The judge, Mr Justice Holroyde, expressed some sympathy with the SFO's task of identifying assets in northern Cyprus, referring to \"the concrete impossibility of getting information out of northern Cyprus unless Mr Nadir chooses to release it\". The hearing to consider the application for compensation has been adjourned until 31 October.",

Liam Fox, the former defence secretary until he was forced to resign last year following revelations about his working relationship with his friend and self-styled adviser Adam Werritty, has also publicly supported the deal. The only stumbling block in the UK so far is a defence select committee investigation, which has asked for interested parties to submit written evidence by 9 October, one day before the companies have to submit merger proposals or request an extension. It's a different story across the channel. A committee of MPs in Germany this week warned Tom Enders, the daredevil former paratrooper and current chief executive of EADS, that they may block the deal from going ahead. Kerstin Andreae, a member of the German parliament's economic committee, said the German government had several \"disagreements\" with Enders' vision, which would greatly reduce politicians' influence over the future direction of the company. \"More questions were left open than answered,\" she said of Enders' briefing to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.

But Otto stuck to the German position that the proposed terms giving BAE shareholders 40% and EADS shareholders 60% of the combined company undervalued EADS. Niblett said the fact that Germany is addressing the issue is a healthy sign for the deal. The silence from Paris is more worrying. \"France is feeling weaker relative to Germany.

By building up a trusted relationship with US politicians, BAE has been able to expand its US subsidiary, BAE Systems Inc, into a $14bn-a-year business employing 40,000 people in more than half of the states and works on very sensitive projects including the $1.5 trillion F-35 joint strike fighter programme to build a jet that can avoid surface-to-air missiles.

One of the latest black projects, a drone called Herti [High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion] was developed in complete secrecy at BAE's Warton airfield in Lancashire. Secrecy at the Warton base, which was integral in the development of Nimrod and Typhoon and Tornado jets, is just as tight today. \"No one will speak to you,\" a BAE Systems spokesman said when the Guardian said it planned to visit the base this week. \"If you come and try and doorstep staff we will warn all staff not to speak to you.\" She was right.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne's goal of building an economy that can pay its way in the world looks more distant than ever as official statistics showed Britain ran up the largest current account deficit on record in the second quarter of 2012. The Office for National Statistics said the \u00a320.8bn deficit \u2013 which includes the UK's trade balance, as well as the shortfall on overseas investments by UK plc \u2013 was the biggest ever for a quarter. \"Efforts to rebalance the economy towards net trade may be foundering on the wilting economic outlook in the UK's principal European trading partners,\" said Chris Crowe, of Barclays. The news came as the ONS revealed that the recession-hit economy contracted by 0.4% in the second quarter, slightly less than its previous 0.5% estimate, fuelling hopes that growth may have returned between July and September. \"Latest data and survey evidence overall suggest that there is a good chance that GDP growth in the third quarter will more than outweigh the GDP contraction suffered in the second quarter,\" said Howard Archer of consultancy IHS Global Insight. Labour said the upward revision of the growth figures was good news, but warned that the economy remained fragile. The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, said: \"While any small upward revision is clearly better than the opposite, these figures confirm our economy is in the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. And that is the reason why the deficit is rising \u2013 up by 22% so far this year.\" The ONS said the quarter's trade deficit on goods \u2013 \u00a328.1bn \u2013 was the largest ever recorded, despite the Treasury's efforts to inspire a \"march of the makers\". Meanwhile, a shortfall on financial transactions with the rest of the world, as foreign companies made more on their investments here than UK plc banked from foreign ventures, meant the deficit on Britain's income account in the quarter, at \u00a35.2bn, was also the largest ever, adding to the current account deficit. These \"balance of payments\" statistics, as they are known, were once a hot political issue, which has faded away in recent decades, since the liberalisation of financial markets allowed firms and countries to ramp up their borrowing to fill the gap. But with the Treasury aiming to \"rebalance\" the economy from unsustainable consumer spending towards exports, the record deficit raises fresh doubts about whether the government's economic strategy is working. There was further evidence that consumers were tightening their belts in the detailed figures, with household spending down 0.2% over the quarter. The ONS said the largest declines were in restaurants and hotels, tobacco, and food and drink, as cash-crunched families cut back on treats. One piece of positive news for the economic outlook was a rise in business investment, which the ONS said rose by 0.9% over the quarter. Chris Williamson, of data-provider Markit, said: \"While this is still only a modest improvement in the investment picture, it is an encouraging sign with regard to corporate health.\" John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The revision to GDP is welcome news, but we're not out of the woods yet. Our research shows that small business confidence remained weak in Q3 and we believe growth will continue to be flat in the coming months. \"Clearly employment is key to lifting sentiment and we need to see more people in full time work. The FSB believes extending the National Insurance contributions holiday to all small firms across the UK will go some way to helping to create the jobs that are needed.\"",
