      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight, after another lively day. A quick reminder of the key points. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has warned that the turmoil in the markets could hurt the US economy. She hinted the interest rates will only rise slowly, but tried to dampen speculation that the Fed could cut borrowing costs. Here\u2019s our summary of her testimony to Congress. The Dow Jones index closed down 99 points after Yellen spoke. The dollar weakened, as traders anticipated more dovish monetary policy this year. European markets had rallied back from two-year lows, on hopes that the recent selloff had gone to far. Bank shares led the rebound, with Deutsche Bank gaining 10%, after Germany\u2019s heavyweight began planning to buy back debt to strengthen its financial position. Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam became the latest top bank executive to call for calm. He argued that banks are in much better shape than before the 2008 crisis. But Australia\u2019s market earlier fell into bear territory, having lost 20% since its recent high last April. Japan\u2019s Nikkei also suffered losses on Wednesday. The International Monetary Fund threatened to pull the plug on Ukraine\u2019s bailout. It wants its government to cleans our corruption and implements reforms. And new data showed that Europe\u2019s factory sector had a bad December; Britain\u2019s industrial output fell by 1.1% during the month. Goodnight! GW It now seems pretty unlikely that the Fed will risk raising interest rates in March, for fear of throwing fuel on the fire. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says: As most analysts spotted, the key phrase in Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony was when she said conditions in the US had become \u201cless supportive of growth\u201d. That suggested a Fed belief that the drop in share prices will slow the economy but not derail it completely. Yellen\u2019s wait-and-see approach means that a March increase in interest rates is now off the agenda, but the Fed will require more evidence before abandoning its strategy of cautious tightening. With the spectre of 2008 looming larger, that evidence may not be long in coming. Here\u2019s our US colleague\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic\u2019s take on Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony: And here\u2019s a flavour: In her first major speech for two months, Yellen sought to tread a fine line, acknowledging the threat posed by the financial tremors while at the same time pointing out that the US had continued to recover from the deep recession of 2008-09. The Fed chief said: \u201cThe economy is in many ways close to normal.\u201d Specifically, Yellen pointed out that the unemployment rate had declined to below 5%, which many of her Fed colleagues consider to be full employment, and that inflation was likely to move up to 2%. What was not normal, she said, were the federal funds rates, which had to be held for seven years at \u201cexceptionally low levels\u201d. Yellen added that oil prices, steady job creation and faster wage growth should support growth of incomes and consumer spending. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, the committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labour market indicators will continue to strengthen,\u201d she said....(click here for more) Janet Yellen makes the front page of the Financial Times, with her warning about deteriorating financial conditions threatening the US recovery: Another turbulent day in the financial markets is over! And the Dow Jones index has finished in the red, losing 99 points or 0.6% to finish at 15,914, as investors digested Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony. As we covered earlier (summary here), the Fed chair warned that financial conditions have worsened, which could mean future interest rate hikes come more slowly. But she also said she didn\u2019t see rates being cut again. The broader S&amp;P 500 index was unchanged, while the Nasdaq inched up a bit. That means Wall Street failed to match the early rally in Europe, where shares rebounded from two year lows. That followed a weak Asia-Pacific region; earlier, Australia\u2019s market fell into bear territory, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost another 2%. Janet Yellen\u2019s hearing at Congress was also attended by a group of protesters from the Fed Up campaign, who oppose December\u2019s rate hike. Wearing green t-shirts reading \u201cRecovery, What Recovery?\u201d, they sat behind the Fed chief during the session in a reminder that the public aren\u2019t too happy about economic conditions right now. A quiet end to the session? That would be too much to ask. A sudden bout of selling has hit Wall Street, sending the Dow down around 100 points, or 0.6%.... The dollar has fallen against the yen, hitting a 15-month low. That indicates traders are calculating that the Fed will be more cautious about interest rate rises, after Yellen said financial conditions had become less supportive for growth. Yellen also managed to reassure investors, says Richard Sichel, chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust Co. Sichel told Reuters that the Fed chair managed to spur some bargain hunting, even through she also flagged up economic risks: \u201cWhat Yellen said has been taken positively. Stocks in general are cheaper now than they were three days ago or three months ago, so there\u2019s an opportunity to step in.\u201d Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli believes Janet Yellen managed to leave her monetary policy options open, even though few investors expect many rate hikes this year. Perli says: \u201cThe general message she intended to deliver is that additional rate hikes remain the base case, but markets have to stabilize before we see more.\u201d The US stock market is holding onto its earlier gains, after Janet Yellen completed her appearance at Congress. The S&amp;P 500 is up almost 1%, following the earlier rally in Europe. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says Yellen gave a \u201cmixed testimony\u201d. Her acknowledgement that a Chinese-centred slowdown is detrimentally impacting US growth expectations was offset by yet another reference to a plan for steady and gradual rate rises going forward. A few photos of today\u2019s session: Capital Economics says that Janet Yellen is still more hawkish about interest rate policy than the markets. They write: Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress today revealed that, while the FOMC might not be ready to raise interest rates for a second time in March, she still anticipates a \u201cgradual\u201d series of rate hikes over the next couple of years. That view is clearly at odds with futures markets, which imply that any additional rate hikes are almost now off the table. Let\u2019s recap the main points from today\u2019s hearing at the Financial Services committee over the last three (long...) hours. 1) Janet Yellen has warned Congress that the global financial turbulence is threatening the US economic recovery. She cited the weakening financial conditions in America, following recent turmoil in the financial markets. \u201cThese developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labour market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset.\u201d One analyst saw that as an admission that the Fed perhaps shouldn\u2019t have raised interest rates two months ago. 2) But despite this, the Fed chair did not suggest she will reverse course on interest rates. She defended December\u2019s rate hike, arguing that the economy was strong enough to support slightly higher borrowing costs. And she also insisted that any future rises will be heavily dependent on economic performance -- if things deteriorate, the Fed rate will stay exceptionally low for longer. She doesn\u2019t expect to actually cut rate, though, which suggests the Fed isn\u2019t panicking about the situation. 3) But could the Fed go negative, following Japan and the eurozone? Crucially, Yellen indicated that this isn\u2019t really on the agenda yet. She pointed out that the Fed may not have the legal authority to impose negative rates; you\u2019d think this would have been cleared up, if the Fed was really worried. This was the key quote: \u201cI am not aware of anything that would prevent us from doing it but I am saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues - that still needs to be done.\u201d 4) Yellen have her clearest warning yet about China. She said the financial instability, and plunging commodity prices, caused by its slowing economy was a key threat to the US. 5) But she also tried to remain positive about economic conditions, saying she sees signs of wage growth increasing. \u201cThere are some hopeful signs but I think if the labor market continues to progress we are very hopeful we will see faster progress on wages.\u201d She also argued that families are better off than in 2008, when the financial crisis struck. 6) The Committee raised several other important issues with Yellen; they fear that small challenger banks are being disadvantaged, and want the Fed to release the transcripts of its meetings from 2012, to assist a leak inquiry. Despite Sean Duffy\u2019s best efforts, he only got a holding reply from the Federal Reserve\u2019s top official. The Fed was also criticised for not doing enough to bring down African-American unemployment, and for never even having an African-American regional bank chief. Yellen agreed this is disappointing. And several Representatives challenged Yellen over the state of the domestic economy, pointing out that not enough well-paying \u2018middle-class\u2019 jobs are being created. One was even moved to verse (yes, it was that kind of day....) Congress chair Jeb Hensarling says members have five days to submit further questions for Yellen to respond to. And with that the meeting is adjourned. John Delaney of Maryland says when rates were raised in December, it was based on an improving economy. A lot has happened since then in the markets. When you look at the data now, does it change your view on economic activity and gowth Yellen: The answer is maybe, but the jury is out. We continue to see progress in labour market. GDP growth clearly slowed a lot in the fourth quarter. My expectation is it will pick up in this quarter but financial conditions have tightened which could have implications. Then, we said the risks to outlook were balanced. In January said we were assessing the implications. This is what we\u2019re doing at this point. Has there been a contraction in credit availability recently? Yellen: We haven\u2019t seen this really at this stage. Spreads on lower graded bonds have been widening... When we surveyed banks we\u2019ve seen a tightening of.. loans. This is something that bears watching. There will be additional data before we meet in March [The next Fed meeting}. Andy Barr of Kentucky is asking about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its funding. Yellen seems unsure of the answers, and starts packing her bag. Keith Ellison of Minnesota also brings up the subject of the high levels of black unemployment. He says this needs the attention of the Fed chair. Is there adequate discussion of Afro-American workers within Fed discussions and if not, what can be done. Yellen: It is of course important we look at different groups, particularly those suffering most in the labour market. Our tools are not ones that can be targeted at particular groups in labour market. Ellison wants Fed to realise not all US citizens are experiencing this upturn. Yellen: We should pay adequate attention to different groups. Unemployment rate is only one measure of what\u2019s happening, appropriate for us to do more detailed assessment. Congressman Ed Perlmutter of Colorado ( a Democrat) praises Yellen (and the President) and asks how we can do better. Yellen: Our objective is to try to make sure the picture shows continuing improvement. The signs of wage growth increasing are tentative but hopeful.. and we will try to keep that progress growing. Inflation [should] move up over time [towards our target]. Some of burden should also be on Congress. Job training, educational programmes... are Congress\u2019s job to address. Perlmutter: Soft spot in the economy is oil and gas. Saudis are pumping like crazy into an oversupplied market. Good for pump prices but causes job losses. Yellen: We\u2019re taking account of fact that energy sector is hard hit, we\u2019re losing jobs there. But it is a pretty small sector of the workforces. It is rippling through to manufacturing. But average household is saving $1000 a year {so that is having a positive effect} Robert Pittenger of North Carolina says the economic recovery is dismal despite all these accommodative policies. Is real unemployment not 10% not 4.9%? Yellen barely gets a chance to begin answering before Pittenger steps in again and his time runs out. Wiliam Clay of Missouri says the Fed is more focussed on inflation than unemployment. Yellen: We have both targets and take issue with idea we are not focussed on the unemployment objective... We continue to have accommodative monetary policy. Mia Love of Utah asks about implications of European financial instability, and ECB and Fed using different policies Yellen: The ECB is dealing with inflation falling well beyond their goal...US has done better, is among the strongest economies. It\u2019s put [upward] pressure on dollar, harming manufacturing and exports. Maxine Waters is back and is back with the topic of big banks receiving support from the Fed. Yellen: It\u2019s an essential tool we need to adjust the rate of short term interest rates. We have 2.5trn dollars of reserves compared to 20 to 30 billion during the financial crisis. If we have to use another technique, we will be likely forced to shrink our balance sheet and.. it would have adverse effects on the economy. David Scott of Georgia disagrees when Yellen says Fed can\u2019t target unemployment, pointing out the large unemployment rate among Afro-Americans. He says Fed has historically downplayed unemployment, nor has Fed ever had an Afro-American as head of one of the regional Fed banks. Yellen: We recognise how serious the problems are and we take our employment mandate extremely seriously, we have been doing everything to promote a strong labour market which would benefit Afro-Americans. She agrees there should be an Afro-American head and regrets there has not been. Ed Royce from California: Are negative rates a tool in the tool box? (He says a recent bank stress test from the Fed suggests this might be being looked at). Yellen: ECB and Japan have gone to negative rates. We have had periods of market stress where we see flight into US Treasury bonds as safe haven. We have set stress tests for banks to look at if Treasuries go negative, this may happen without Fed necessarily setting negative rates. Ruben Hinojosa of Texas asks what else could we do to boost economy. Yellen: Productivity growth has been disappointing since the financial crisis. The debt situation facing the country needs to be addressed by Congress. As population ages debt to GDP ratio will be on an unsustainable course. Hinojosa asks about addressing inequality. Yellen: We don\u2019t have policies that target specific groups, main thing we can do is make sure labour market is working well. There is further to go. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, as head of oversight committee is complaining Yellen does not always respond to requests from the committee on compliance issues (in particular documents on possible leaks) and says she has ignored subpoenas. Yellen: We have some concern with providing transcripts since they relate to monetary policy. We will consider this and get back to you. Duffy: This is about a leak, will you let me know why I am not entitled to these documents? I sent a letter a year ago. You knew I would ask. Why will you not provide documents. This is about the internal working of the Fed, not market moving documents. Yellen: I think we have complied fully.. Duffy: What would you do if you wanted this from a bank [but were ignored]. I can imagine what Fed would do. I expect these documents to come over. The discussion ends after a point of order is made about the subpoena and dismissed. European markets are closing in positive territory but on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now slipped back and is down around 12 points. Gregory Meeks of New York asks if Yellen thinks the position is better now than in 2008. Yellen: I believe it is. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress although there are a lot of challenges, a lot of households are suffering. Elsewhere oil is on the rise - Brent is now up 2.7% at $31.15 a barrel - after US crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week. Crude inventories dropped 754,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 3.6m barrel rise. Blaine Luetkemeyer from Missouri asks what Fed could do if there is another downturn. Yellen says there are a number of tools including interest rates, but Luetkemeyer rightly points out that rates are almost as low as they can go (even with the recent hike). Brad Sherman of California: Are you going to break up the too big to fail institutions? To make sure it\u2019s not \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d? Yellen: We are using our powers to make sure a systemically important institution could fail without having a systemic effect. Maloney asks: Given the market turmoil and slowing US economy, some analysts are suggesting a possible recession. What would it take to cut rates again? Yellen: Our commitment is to achieve goals of maximum employment and price stability. I do not expect the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will soon be in a situation to cut rates. The Labour market continues to perform well. Many of the factors factors holding down inflation are transitory. There is always a risk of recession, global developments could produce a slowdown, but don\u2019t want to jump to premature conclusions. I don\u2019t think it will be necessary to cut rates. But if it turned out to be necessary, the FOMC would do what was necessary. Carolyn Maloney of New York asks: Has the turmoil in global markets changed your view on the pace of interest rate rises? Yellen: We are watching very carefully what is happening in global financial markets. The stresses we have seen since the turn of the year relate to uncertainties over Chinese exchange rate policy, the price of oil.. We have not seen shifts that seem significant enough to have driven the sharp move in markets. It seems to be increased fears of recession risk. We have not yet seen a sharp drop off in growth, globally or in the US. Global market developments bear watching. We recognised these developments may have implications for the outlook, which we are currently assessing. Monetary policy is not on a preset course. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina: Does Fed have legal authority to move into negative rates. Yellen: The FOMC considered this around 2010, we were exploring our options. We decided not to lower interest rates into negative territory. Didn\u2019t fully look at legal issues. We would stilll need to investigate more thoroughly. Don\u2019t know any restriction that would prevent us doing it. But we have not fully investigated legal issues. Moore says is there moral hazard in not a single person involved in 2008 crash going to jail. Yellen: I do not think individuals guilty of wrongdoing should escape appropriate penalties. We cannot put in place criminal penalties. We can make sure they are not allowed to work at banking organisations where they committed misdeeds, and in many cases they can be banned from working. We always co-operated with Department of Justice. Gwen Moore from Wisconsin is concerned about small banks. She asks how the rules should have been tailored for small banks, saying \u201cstress tests, capital constraints are killing our small banks.\u201d Yellen says: Community banks and their vitality are exceptionally important. The burden on community banks is intense. We are focussed on doing everything we can to reduce that. What will the world have to look like for a rule based system, asks Mulvaney. Yellen says guidelines from rules are looked at but we should not mechanically follow rules, we need to take into account a large set of indicators. Following on from that, Mick Mulvaney asks if the economy is now normal. Yellen says: The economy in many ways is close to normal... inflation is below 2% but there is a good reason to think it will move up over time. But the neutral level of federal funds rate is by no means normal. We have needed for 7 years to hold the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels to achieve growth of 2% and in that sense it is not normal. Maxine Waters asks what alternative processes could there be to the Fed paying billions to banks on excess reserves when it raises interest rates. The Fed uses IOER (interest on excess reserves) and Yellen defends the use of this system even though it pays commercial banks above market interest rates. Now for the questions. Chair Jeb Hensarling brings up a recent bill that would require the Fed to follow a rules-based monetary policy, which Yellen opposes but a number of economists have backed in a letter. Yellen is against it because it could jeopardise its independence from political pressure. The two sides are basically just repeated their existing stance on the issue. Markets are moving much higher now even though Yellen has just so far repeated her statement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 151 points or 0.9%. (Unsurprisingly it\u2019s taking longer than five minutes - the statement is here if you want to follow along). Yellen now gets five minutes to present her testimony, and is reading her statement. The session is underway, and can be viewed live here. Opening remarks come from chairman Jeb Hensarling - who says he will not use the session to criticise the Fed\u2019s decision to raise rates - followed by a number of members of Congress including Maxine Waters and Soth Carolina\u2019s Mick Mulvaney. Congress, waiting for Yellen. The US economy is strong enough to see through this period of turbulence, says economist Harm Bandholz at UniCredit after Yellen\u2019s testimony: In a nutshell: Chair Yellen has, correctly in our view, highlighted the solid fundamentals of the US economy. Accordingly, her baseline outlook for both the economy and monetary policy have not changed. That said, recent developments in financial markets as well as in the global economy have clouded the picture. In this environment, Fed officials prefer to take a step back and wait. Once the clouds have lifted, the gradual normalization of interest rates will continue. Yes, there are risks out there \u2013 and the longer the financial market rout lasts, the bigger the risk that it will become self-fulfilling \u2013, but we believe that fundamentals are solid enough to carry the economy through this period. And this also seems to be the Fed\u2019s view. Accordingly, the fact that financial markets do not expect the next rate hike before the second quarter of 2017 seems well overdone. Well, it\u2019s not a ringing endorsement of Janet Yellen\u2019s comments but US markets have opened in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 59 points or 0.39%, while at the open the S&amp;P 500 added 0.5%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq has outperformed, up 1.1%. The dollar has reacted to Yellen\u2019s comments as if more rate rises this year - perhaps even in March - could indeed be on the cards despite the worries about global growth. The US currency has risen 0.25% against a basket of currencies, up from a near four month low on Tuesday. The euro fell 0.5% after the release of the testimony, while sterling has dropped from $1.4560 to $1.4484. Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony might appear to leave the door open for further rate rises, but she is likely to be quizzed sharply about the last one, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank. In his initial thoughts he says: In summary \u2013 Yellen retains an open mind on the need for further tightening, though with a heavy skew of risks to the downside, and was defensive about the December rate hike: The mercifully short prepared statement of Fed Chair Yellen to the House Committee on Financial Services did not contain much that was new from earlier speeches, statements or minutes. To the extent that any new material was used, this was mainly an expansion of the risks from softer overseas demand, with China explicitly mentioned, and also from financial market tightening (stronger USD, higher yields on riskier assets and lower equity prices, offset to some extent by lower bond yields and oil prices). The testimony retained the text about the possibility that rates might have to be increased at a faster than anticipated rate if growth and inflation were stronger than expected. However, that is sounding rather hollow right now. We see the continued inclusion of this text as an attempt to portray an open mind about the recent activity slowdown, and not to present a self-fulfilling picture of gloom at the Fed. Financial markets may see this as dovish speech overall, though probably not out of line with expectations. There was also a somewhat defensive paragraph justifying the December rate hike \u2013 we expect that once the questioning starts, Chair Yellen will come in for some stick from disgruntled members of Congress, some of whom may be facing a hostile electorate later this year. One interpretation of Yellen\u2019s remarks on rates is that she is admitting they were raised too soon, says Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets. A not unusually muted reaction to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon, given that she\u2019s come out and said \u2018financial conditions in the US have recently become less supportive of growth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t take a 1st class physicist to recognise that this is essentially another way of saying \u2018we raised interest rates before we should have.\u2019 Nothing had fundamentally changed in December, but the Fed decided to ignore the fundamentals and move US monetary policy to a place that\u2019s less supportive of growth. It now appears the markets chose to ignore the Fed in January, preferring the fundamentals, and what do you know? The markets were right \u2013 they\u2019ve been reacting to this testimony for the past four weeks. An economist\u2019s view on Yellen\u2019s comments: Yellen also, as indeed she has to, defended the December decision to raise interest rates. Many have judged that to be a mistake, especially in the wake of the market turbulence and fears about global growth and stresses on the banks which have dominated the headlines so far this year. Yellen suggested that if a pre-emptive rate rise was not implemented, a sharper increase may well have been necessary in the future which could have pushed the economy into recession: The decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee\u2019s assessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, the FOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are likely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help move inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession. It is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative Janet Yellen has also said that the Fed would slow the pace of interest rate hikes, if the threats to the US economy materialise. She tells the Committee on Financial Services that: In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the Federal funds rate would be appropriate. The full testimony is here. Janet Yellen has also touched on the big issue dominating the markets - how quickly will interest rates rise? She sounds cautious, but neither rules anything in or out (classic central banker) \u201cThe FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d (the FOMC, or Federal Open Market Committee, meets eight times a year to set US monetary policy) Janet Yellen has also warned that \u201cforeign economic developments\u201d could harm the US economy. In her testimony to Congress, the Fed chair singles out concerns about the slowdown in China. That has already caused \u201cincreased volatility in global financial markets\u201d, and \u201cexacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth\u201d, says Yellen. She adds: These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn, low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for U.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.\u201d Newsflash: The Federal Reserve has just released Janet Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony, ahead of this afternoon\u2019s grilling from Congress in 90 minute time. The Fed chief is striking a cautious note about economic prospects, warning that: \u201cFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. But Yellen also points to \u201congoing employment gains and faster wage growth\u201d, which should push real incomes higher. She also suggests that global economic growth should \u201cpick up over time\u201d, helped by \u201chighly accommodative monetary policies abroad\u201d [such as Japan and the eurozone]. And the Fed chief remains confident about medium-term growth prospects, saying: Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\u201d Inequality is one of the issues of our age. Bernie Sanders is building a presidential bid by fighting it, and charities like Oxfam regularly warn that the rich are taking more and more of the cake. Now, credit ratings agency S&amp;P has warned that quantitative easing (QE), a key weapon used in the financial crisis, is widening inequality and the wealth gap between young and old. Under QE, central banks buy assets such as government bonds with new money, driving up the cost of safe assets and encouraging investors into riskier ones (this is the theor, anyway) But it\u2019s also hurting those who don\u2019t own assets, as S&amp;P explains: Quantitative easing (QE) stabilized the economy but also exacerbated wealth disparity between rich and poor, mainly by boosting financial asset prices and house prices. During the U.K.\u2019s recent \u201cjobs-rich, pay-poor\u201d economic recovery, strong employment gains were accompanied by a further rise of already high wage dispersion and an ever-growing share of part-time employment in lower income groups. Between 2006 and 2008 (before QE) and 2010-2012 (after QE started), average wealth held directly in stocks increased by 55% for the wealthiest 10% and by 130% for wealthiest 1% of U.K. households. In the context of the tight housing market, low interest rates and QE are among the drivers behind the widening wealth and income gap between younger and older generations and between those on the housing ladder and those not on it. European markets are sailing higher, up over 2% on average, reversing six days of steady losses which dragged them to a two year low. But the rally looks could unravel, depending on how the chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, performs at Congress in a couple of hours time. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Talk of Deutsche Bank doing an emergency bond-buyback to shore up its finances and relieve worried creditors has seen the German bank\u2019s shares rally by over 10%, lifting the rest of the banking sector. In a way it\u2019s a bit of deju vu from yesterday when markets initially rose thanks to news from Deutsche Bank before financial and commodity sectors led to a spectacular roll-over. There is plenty of scope for another sharp twist in the direction of markets today around 3pm GMT when fed Chair Janet Yellen gives her testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. Investors can\u2019t get enough of Deutsche Bank today. Its shares jumped 17% at one stage this morning, fuelled by reports that it will launch a debt buy-back offer soon. That move would show Deutsche\u2019s financial muscle and calm fears over its ability to meet debt repayments and dividends. Supportive words from Berlin\u2019s finance ministry today may also have helped, along with Deutsche management\u2019s insistence yesterday that the bank is \u201crock solid\u201d. But Deutsche\u2019s problems are not suddenly solved. There are still fears over the quality of the bank\u2019s assets (it is trading at around half its book value). An economic downturn would inflict further losses. Deutsche made a \u20ac6.8bn loss last year, showing the struggles in the banking sector. Newish CEO John Cryan is trying to clean the bank up, following fines for various scandals. But it could face further provisions in the future. There are fears that banks will suffer if eurozone interest rates are cut deeper into negative territory. That would eat into profits, penalising them for leaving cash at the ECB. It would also force prices of government bonds even higher, meaning banks would get an even lower rate of return (if anything). It\u2019s been a bad morning for UK modelmaker Hornby. The miniature train firm, which also owns racing car outfit Scalextric and aeroplane kitmaker Airfix, hit investors with another profit warning today. It also admitted it could breach its loan agreements with its banks - never a good sign. And there was nothing small about the market reaction - Hornby shares have tanked by over 40%. TV presenter James May (who loves toys of a certain generation), has urged the British people to act now, while there\u2019s still time. This might dampen the mood in the markets. The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that Ukraine could lose financial support unless its government gets serious about cleaning up and reforming its economy. IMF chief Christine Lagarde declared: \u201cI am concerned about Ukraine\u2019s slow progress in improving governance and fighting corruption, and reducing the influence of vested interests in policymaking. Without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported program can continue and be successful. Ukraine risks a return to the pattern of failed economic policies that has plagued its recent history. It is vital that Ukraine\u2019s leadership acts now to put the country back on a promising path of reform.\u201d The IMF agreed to a $17.5bn bailout program for cash-strapped Ukraine last year, but has held back a $1.7bn payment since last autumn due to concerns over corruption. Those fears were inflamed when economy minister Aivaras Abromavicius resigned last week, saying it was impossible to implement reforms. He claimed he was under pressure to appoint government cronies to key positions, continuing Ukraine\u2019s well-known problems with graft and vested interests. Ukrainian government bonds have already tumbled in value recently, to levels suggesting a high risk of default or restructuring. Context is everything.... There are encouraging signs from New York. Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins, just over three hours time. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 are tipped to rise by 1%, while the Nasdaq is being called 1.6% higher. The German government has reiterated that it is not worried about Deutsche Bank. A finance ministry spokeswoman told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cYou heard the short sentence that the minister [finance minister Wolfgang Schuable] said yesterday in Paris that he is not concerned, I don\u2019t have anything to add to that.\u201d European banking shares are surging, lead by Deutsche Bank which has jumped by 15%. Investors seem to be regaining their nerve, having been gripped with worries over the financial sector. Rumours that Deutsche is planning to strengthen its financial position by buying back some debt have also helped the mood. Economic jitters are also being eased, with the oil price up 1.5% today. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, explains: Despite another poor session overnight, markets in the UK and Europe have rallied impressively. Banks are surging higher, with Deutsche shrugging off the woes of yesterday as investors take the opportunity to buy on weakness once again. A better performance from the oil price and heavily oversold conditions in a number of markets, plus expectations regarding Janet Yellen\u2019s appearance later in the day have provided bulls with the chance to reverse some of the heavy losses seen so far in February. The main European banking index has gained 5% today. A decent rally - but it still leaves shares down 23% so far this year. And although we\u2019ve heard supportive words from Deutsche CEO John Cryan and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble yesterday, nothing has really changed. The head of Swiss bank Credit Suisse has launched a full-throated defence of the banking sector, in an attempt to calm fears of a new crisis. Tidjane Thiam told the Financial Times that: \u201cThe banking system in general is much stronger than in 2008, 2009 [but] there are a lot of memories of that period. \u201cSome of the scenes we are seeing today are not justified . . . Banks are smaller, they are deleveraged, they are less risky, they are better capitalised.\u201d Thiam was speaking after Credit Suisse shares slumped to their lowest in more than two decades yesterday. He told the FT that Credit Suisse has \u201cno liquidity issues\u201d, and a \u201cstrong balance sheet\u201d. And investors may have heeded his words. Credit Suisse shares have jumped by 5%, as part of a wider rally in bank shares.... The slump in UK industrial production may show that Britain\u2019s economy is weaker than we thought. Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explains: December\u2019s sharp drop in industrial production will fuel concerns about the UK economic outlook as well as the unbalanced nature of growth. It will also likely harden views that the Bank of England will not be raising interest rates during 2016. However, we believe it remains highly unlikely that the Bank of England will cut interest rates. The ONS estimated last month that the UK grew by 0.5% in the last quarter of 2015. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway reckons this could be cut: Ouch. Britain has suffered its biggest fall in industrial output since September 2012. It\u2019s another sign of weakening economic demand \u2013 one of the main triggers for the recent market turmoil. UK industrial production shrank by 1.1% month-on-month in December, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. That was primarily caused by a 4.6% plunge in oil and gas extraction, and a 4% drop in mining. But British manufacturing also suffered, with output down by 0.2% month-on-month and 1.7% lower than in December 2014. Alarmingly, the UK isn\u2019t alone either. France and Italy have also reported sharp falls in factory output this morning, and Germany did the same yesterday. It fuels fears that the global economy ended 2015 with a whimper, not a bang. Shares across Europe are picking up pace, as investors shake off some of their gloom. The FTSE 100 is now up 43 points, or 0.8%, and there are bigger gains over the channel. Germany\u2019s DAX has leapt by 1.8%, as worries over Deutsche Bank recede this morning. Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Geneva-based Prime Partners, says: \u201cThe rebound in Deutsche Bank is helping to reassure some investors who had been concerned about possible contagion in the banking sector.\u201d The slump in profits at shipping magnate A.P. Moller\u2013Maersk [details] hasn\u2019t caused much alarm. It\u2019s quite a different picture than we saw in the Asia-Pacific markets a few hours ago: But there is still a lot of anxiety around, as investors prepare to hear from the head of the Federal Reserve when she testifies to Congress this afternoon. Janet Yellen may concede that the Fed is unlikely to raise borrowing costs four times this year, as it originally expected. But if she sounds too worried, that could spark another bout of market mayhem. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, says Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX. He reckons Yellen will try to avoid saying too much. it ought to be kept in mind that the markets want to be reassured. This injects a degree of wishful thinking into the equation. F or her part, the Fed Chair will almost certainly refrain from plain-spoken commitment on the direction of policy. Here\u2019s the worst-performing companies in Australia today, who helped to drag its stock market more than 20% below its recent peak. Mesoblast, the biggest faller, is an adult stem cell research firm. Many of the other fallers are natural resource and energy companies (including Liquified Natural Gas, Western Areas, Karoon Gas and Whitehaven Coal) Deutsche Bank is climbing higher! The Wall Street Journal has a good take on how Australia\u2019s banks helped drag the country\u2019s stocks into a bear market today. \u201cThis is the first sustained bear market I have seen since the GFC [global financial crisis],\u201d said Evan Lucas, a market strategist at brokerage IG in Melbourne, noting the S&amp;P/ASX 200 briefly was in bear territory in 2011. Australia\u2019s major banks, which are some of the biggest stocks on the S&amp;P/ASX 200 and have a large index weighting, have been caught in a global bank-share selloff this week, despite their having less exposure to liquidity risks compared with peers in the U.S. and Europe and substantially less reliance on the long end of the bond curve and wholesale funding, Mr. Lucas said. Still, worries about banks globally have only exacerbated a decline for local lenders. The financials subindex has lost 14% this year as brokers have flagged concerns about the sustainability of the industry\u2019s attractive dividends as Australia\u2019s economy remains subdued and signs emerge that the property market is beginning to cool. More here: Australia Shares Fall Into Bear Market It\u2019s not all the fault of the banks, though. Mining stocks have also tumbled, in response to waning demand for commodities from China. BHP Billiton, for example, has fallen 12% since the start of January. Resource companies are now cutting thousands of jobs, in response to falling prices for coal, iron ore, zinc, nickel, copper and bauxite. Australia\u2019s fall into bear market territory today has sent another cloud of gloom over the City of London. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the European indices are enduring the aftermath of a rocky Asian session, the Nikkei plunging to a 16 month low following a 2nd day of heavy losses, with the added concern of a bear market-entering night for the Australian markets thrown in for good measure. A red-washed commodity sector is dragging the index down at the moment, though if Brent Crude can see a sustained climb above $31 per barrel (with the US crude inventories arriving this afternoon) sentiment may be able to shift as the day goes on. Danish shipping and oil conglomerate A.P. Moller\u2013Maersk is getting a kicking. Shares in the group have slumped by 7.5%, making it the worst stock in Europe today, after it reported a fourth-quarter net loss due to impairments of $2.6 billion on its oil assets. The global slowdown is hurting the firm. Demand for shipping goods overseas has fallen, just as new ships ordered years ago come into service. Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by over 4% at the start of trading, amid rumours that it is planning new steps to reassure investors about its financial health. The Financial Times set the hare running last night, reporting that: Deutsche Bank is considering buying back several billion euros of its debt, as Germany\u2019s biggest bank steps up efforts to shore up the tumbling value of its securities against the backdrop of a broader rout of financial stocks. After European banks suffered a second consecutive day of sharp falls, Deutsche Bank is expected to focus its emergency buyback plan on senior bonds, of which it has about \u20ac50bn in issue, according to the bank. The move was unlikely to involve so-called contingent convertible bonds [cocos] which, along with the bank\u2019s shares, have been the butt of a brutal investor sell-off in recent days, people briefed on the plan said. Banks can generate capital gains by buying back bonds at a discount to their face value. More here: Deutsche Bank considers multibillion bond buyback European stock markets are crawling higher in early trading, after two days of hefty falls. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip London shares is 26 points higher (+0.3%), led by mining group Anglo American (up 3%). The other European markets are also gaining a little ground, with Spain\u2019s IBEX up 1.1% and the French CAC up 0.7%. So, not exactly a big rally. Traders will be hoping it lasts, after seeing fears over the global economy take hold on Tuesday. I suspect they\u2019ll try to sit tight until Fed chair Janet Yellen testifies to Congress in 7 hours time. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: Once again the FTSE-100 has kicked off the session with a modest bounce, recovering some of yesterday\u2019s gains in the process, but the underlying situation appears little changed. Crude oil prices may be ticking higher but they are still in what could be termed \u2018distressed\u2019 territory below $30/barrel, although despite all this there\u2019s a definite air of risk-on returning to markets. Japan\u2019s stock market also had a rough day, losing another 2.3% and sending the Nikkei to a fresh 16-month low. The selloff was partly fuelled by fears that central bankers are losing the battle to keep economies afloat. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: One analyst said markets could be seeing the start of the \u201cfinal capitulation\u201d as the attempt by central banks to stimulate growth with cheap money since the global financial crisis in 2008 had run its course. \u201cThe artificial support from central banks is at a crossroads,\u201d said Evan Lucas, of IG in Melbourne. \u201cCentral bank intervention will no longer create the holding pattern of the past year; markets now believe banks are out of ammunition.\u201d Here\u2019s Martin\u2019s news story on the Asian selloff: The heavy falls on the Australian stock market has triggered fears that we\u2019re entering another GFC, or Global Financial Crisis. ABC News explains: Stockbroker and author of Marcus Today, Marcus Padley, holds the view that this week\u2019s Australian bank sell-off is more about fear than reality. \u201cThere is fundamentals and there is sentiment, and people are very fearful of another GFC-style event,\u201d he told ABC News Online. This chart shows how the Australian market has now shed more than 20% since last April. Australia\u2019s stock market has been dragged into bear market territory as the the global market rout hit Asia again. The country\u2019s benchmark index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, endured a rough day and finished down 1.2% at 4775.7 points. That\u2019s more than 20% below last April\u2019s peak, that calm time before fears over the global economy (particularly China) began to hit shares worldwide. It means Australia joins Japan\u2019s Nikkei, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 in bear market territory. Financial shares were hit, with Bank of Queensland tumbling by almost 7%, and energy companies also led the selloff. Australian investors are getting spooked by events across the globe, says Reuters: Persistent fears about slowing global growth and the Chinese economy, the health of Europe\u2019s banking sector and concerns that Beijing and major central banks might not be able to turn things around have combined to rattle investors. \u201cWhat\u2019s the scary part about this is we can see things get pretty ugly, pretty quickly,\u201d said Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hold onto your hats, because it\u2019s going to be another stressful day in the financial world. With concerns over the banking sector mounting, investors have three items on the agenda today. 1) Deutsche Bank. Germany\u2019s biggest lender is fighting back against concerns over its financial strength, which drove its shares to a record low last night. There are reports that Deutsche is considering buying some of its debt back, to reassure investors. 2) Janet Yellen. The head of the Federal Reserve testifies to Congress today (3pm GMT, or 10am local time). She\u2019ll be quizzed about the state of the world economy, the banking sector, and whether she\u2019s considering imposing negative interest rates in America (just two months after raising borrowing costs) 3) Oil. The canary in the global economic coalmine had a bad Tuesday, plunging by around 9% to around $30 per barrel. That\u2019s putting more stress on the energy industry, and also the banks, who could suffer heavy losses if producers default on their loans. London\u2019s stock market hit a three-year low yesterday, but traders are suggesting it could be a calmer morning. Economic-wise, the latest UK industrial production data is released at 9.30am. That will show if British factories suffered from the global slowdown in December. And on the corporate front, we get results from (among others) UK chipmaker ARM this morning, and social media network Twitter late tonight. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

However, that is sounding rather hollow right now. We see the continued inclusion of this text as an attempt to portray an open mind about the recent activity slowdown, and not to present a self-fulfilling picture of gloom at the Fed. Financial markets may see this as dovish speech overall, though probably not out of line with expectations.<br></p> <p>There was also a somewhat defensive paragraph justifying the December rate hike \u2013 we expect that once the questioning starts, Chair Yellen will come in for some stick from disgruntled members of Congress, some of whom may be facing a hostile electorate later this year.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:24:16.282Z\">at 2.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bb457ae4b084d24a9f080f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:14:49.558Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One interpretation of Yellen\u2019s remarks on rates is that she is admitting they were raised too soon, says Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A not unusually muted reaction to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon, given that she\u2019s come out and said \u2018financial conditions in the US have recently become less supportive of growth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t take a 1<sup>st</sup> class physicist to recognise that this is essentially another way of saying \u2018we raised interest rates before we should have.\u2019</p> <p>Nothing had fundamentally changed in December, but the Fed decided to ignore the fundamentals and move US monetary policy to a place that\u2019s less supportive of growth.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank fuelled Germany\u2019s rise to the status of economic powerhouse, financing its industry in the 19th century and helping the country\u2019s economy to rise again from the rubble of the second world war. It took on the giants of Wall Street in the postwar globalised economy and survived the 2008 banking crisis without a bailout. Such is its stature that in 2008 Angela Merkel organised a special 60th birthday party, with a dinner of fresh asparagus and veal schnitzel, for its then head, Josef Ackermann, at her chancellery. But now as the institution enters its 146th year, questions are being raised about how it will reinvent itself in a banking landscape that is undergoing seismic change as a result of regulatory change and fears of a global economic downturn. The bank has turned to a 55-year-old Briton, John Cryan, to try to carve out a vision for its future and its 100,000 employees. But Cryan \u2013 taking the extraordinary step of declaring Deutsche \u201crock solid\u201d \u2013 has spent the last 72 hours trying to calm concerns about its financial health after a dramatic plunge in its share price that, even after a 10% rise on Wednesday, is still down more than 30% in the first six weeks of 2016. After announcing the bank\u2019s first full-year loss since the 2008 crisis last month, Cryan\u2019s bank has become the focus of anxiety about the health of the global financial system, and its woes are raising questions about Germany\u2019s reputation as a haven of financial stability. Experts suggest that the country\u2019s entire banking system would have to be redesigned in order to save its standard-bearer. According to J\u00f6rg Rocholl, president of Berlin\u2019s European school of management and technology, \u201cthere is no other country in the world in which a bank has a similarly central role as Deutsche Bank has in Germany\u201d. Christopher Wheeler, banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Deutsche had resembled the UK\u2019s Barclays: an investment bank and large lender to big businesses with a retail banking arm. But it is now attempting to cast off its retail business \u2013 Postbank, which it only acquired in 2010 \u2013 raising questions about how it will generate revenues in the future. Attempts to spin off Postbank are proving troublesome and a report on Wednesday suggested that Deutsche would have to write down the value of the business by a third to \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.2bn) before it could proceed any further. Add to that concerns about the potential bill from litigation and fines. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have forecast another \u20ac3.9bn of charges in 2016 and 2017. \u201cIt is also possible the litigation may not be resolved until 2017, leaving uncertainty on the stock,\u201d the analysts said. They cite \u201cunresolved litigation which the market struggles to book-end, weak capital generation and need for capital raising actions\u201d. Cryan \u2013 who has already announced plans to reduce the workforce by a quarter \u2013 took on a bank that had been rocked by scandals, including a record \u00a31.7bn fine for rigging the Libor interest rate, which sparked accusations it had been obstructive towards regulators. He has described the task ahead of him like mowing the lawn. In December he said previous attempts to cut costs at the bank had involved taking off the top layer, which grew back when it rained as the number of blades of grass remained the same. What he needed to do, he said, was to make the lawn smaller. Investors are yet to be convinced by his plan for shrinking the bank. The cost of insuring Deutsche against default \u2013 by using complex financial instruments called credit default swaps (CDS)\u2013 has risen, although the Morgan Stanley analysts suggest this could be for technical reasons. With rumours \u2013 denied \u2013 that Deutsche might not be able to make payments on specialised bonds known as CoCos that can be converted into shares during times of crisis, investors may have been using the CDS as a form of insurance. Others point to speculators. \u201cHedge funds are betting the regulator will make Deutsche pass on paying the coupon on the CoCo, so buy the CDS as a proxy for the subsequent decline in the CoCos\u2019 value \u2026 As the CDS spikes, other investors get nervous about the bank\u2019s health,\u201d said Wheeler. He is confident that Deutsche will emerge from the crisis, which has already prompted German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble to intervene to insist he had \u201cno concerns\u201d about the bank. While Sch\u00e4uble will have been pleased to see the lack of panic about Deutsche\u2019s troubles in the German media, he may have been irked by a damning front-page comment in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Headquartered in the same city as the bank, the newspaper said: \u201cWhat is one to think of a bank that has to promise its customers and investors that it is able to pay back credits? How solid is a bank that has shed a third of its shareholder value in a month, and half of it over the course of a year? It\u2019s no longer just the customer of a couple of Greek banks that are asking such tough questions, but the customers of Deutsche Bank.\u201d",

It took on the giants of Wall Street in the postwar globalised economy and survived the 2008 banking crisis without a bailout.</p> <p>Such is its stature that in 2008 Angela Merkel organised a special 60th birthday party, with a dinner of fresh asparagus and veal schnitzel, for its then head, Josef Ackermann, at her chancellery.</p> <p>But now as the institution enters its 146th year, questions are being raised about how it will reinvent itself in a banking landscape that is undergoing seismic change as a result of regulatory change and fears of a global economic downturn. </p> <p>The bank has turned to a 55-year-old Briton, John Cryan, to try to carve out a vision for its future and its 100,000 employees.

Experts suggest that the country\u2019s entire banking system would have to be redesigned in order to save its standard-bearer.</p> <p>According to J\u00f6rg Rocholl, president of Berlin\u2019s European school of management and technology, \u201cthere is no other country in the world in which a bank has a similarly central role as Deutsche Bank has in Germany\u201d.</p> <p>Christopher Wheeler, banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Deutsche had resembled the UK\u2019s Barclays: an investment bank and large lender to big businesses with a retail banking arm. But it is now attempting to cast off its retail business \u2013 Postbank, which it only acquired in 2010 \u2013 raising questions about how it will generate revenues in the future.</p> <p>Attempts to spin off Postbank are proving troublesome and a report on Wednesday suggested that Deutsche would have to write down the value of the business by a third to \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.2bn) before it could proceed any further.</p> <p>Add to that concerns about the potential bill from litigation and fines. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have forecast another \u20ac3.9bn of charges in 2016 and 2017. \u201cIt is also possible the litigation may not be resolved until 2017, leaving uncertainty on the stock,\u201d the analysts said.</p> <p>They cite \u201cunresolved litigation which the market struggles to book-end, weak capital generation and need for capital raising actions\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afce72bc74deec366b6c1ec9f55891198512283a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afce72bc74deec366b6c1ec9f55891198512283a/0_311_5825_3496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Cryan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Cryan: wants to make the lawn smaller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Gottschalk/Photothek via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cryan \u2013 who has already announced plans to reduce the workforce by a quarter \u2013 took on a bank that had been rocked by scandals, including a record<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/08/deutsche-bank-shocks-with-warning-of-6bn-euro-losses\"> \u00a31.7bn fine for rigging the Libor interest rate</a>, which sparked accusations it had been obstructive towards regulators. </p> <p>He has described the task ahead of him like mowing the lawn.

    "webTitle": "David Cameron accused of failing UK steel after EU proposal rejected", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has been accused of failing the British steel industry after the government confirmed it was blocking proposals from other EU members to tackle dumping of cheap product by China. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said it would not be right for the EU to scrap regulations known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which some countries want to end in order to allow higher tariffs on Chinese steel. The decision to block the proposals drew fierce criticism from Labour and the remnants of the UK\u2019s steel industry, which has shed 5,000 jobs since last summer. But Javid said getting rid of the rule would lead to higher prices for UK consumers of steel, as the current arrangements balance the interests of producers and buyers of a product. \u201cI think when we look at this, a responsible government would look at the impact overall to British industry and British jobs. If duties are applied that are disproportionate, it would have an impact, in Britain and elsewhere, on the consumers of steel as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many British companies ... that would tell you if duties got out of control ... then it would cost them jobs and growth and it would certainly cut their exports.\u201d He added: \u201cI think to go further, much further, might sort of, in the short term, sound like a way to go to try and protect a certain industry, but we also have to remember that in the UK, as well as manufacturers of steel, there are also companies that consume steel as part of their production process, and the impact that might have on to them.\u201d Only last week, Javid signed a joint letter from European ministers \u201cto use every means available and take strong action\u201d against China and Russia, which have been accused of dumping cheap steel on the market. EU tariffs on steel are currently about 9%, compared with the US suggesting tariffs of up to 236% on some products. However, scrapping the lesser duty rule in Brussels could allow duties to be lifted much higher. Asked about the position, Downing Street said the UK did support some level of higher tariffs as it felt the current levels were \u201ca bit too low\u201d but it opposes scrapping that specific regulation. \u201cAt the end of last month, the commission has set out some higher tariffs of around 9% and we along with the French, Germans and Italians, have said we should go further and that is too low,\u201d Cameron\u2019s official spokesman said. \u201cActually we were looking for higher tariffs. What the questioner was referring to was the lesser duty rule ... essentially it is whether you have a proportionate response or you lurch towards protectionism. Our concern with some of what is being talked about in the commission is that is protectionism.\u201d He said there was an \u201congoing discussion\u201d about the level of tariffs that the UK would like to see. A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said: \u201cWe pushed hard for an investigation into rebar steel dumping and were disappointed at the low tariff level imposed, but the lesser duty rule (LDR) did not stop the commission imposing a higher tariff level. \u201cThis government has gone far further than previous governments in voting in favour of tariffs on steel dumping and leading the charge in the EU for swifter action. We are continuing to push the EU for higher tariffs where the evidence supports this, and modernisation of EU trade defence more generally.\u201d Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said the government\u2019s stance risked killing off British steelmaking altogether, accusing Javid of \u201cleaving the steel industry on its knees\u201d. \u201cAnti-dumping measures in the EU do not currently have the teeth to halt this tsunami of dumped steel,\u201d said Stace. He said the EU should mimic the US, where extra tariffs to prevent dumping can be imposed far more quickly than in Europe. \u201cThe secretary of state for business, innovation and skills, along with other member states wrote to the European commission last week highlighting the potential collapse in the European steel sector unless action is taken now,\u201d said Stace. \u201cIt is therefore galling that the UK government has not taken action itself and has continued to block these changes in the EU \u2013 leaving the steel industry on its knees. The government must support the lifting of the lesser duty rule, otherwise steel manufacturing will be lost in the UK and Europe.\u201d His criticism was echoed by Eurofer, the European steel industry trade body. \u201cIt\u2019s very odd that he [Javid] signed a letter saying he wants strong action and then he doesn\u2019t want to use the tools that are already available,\u201d said a spokesman. He pointed to a steep increase in Chinese steel imports to the EU, up from 4.5m tonnes in 2014 to a projected figure of 7m tonnes for last year. The glut of steel has seen the price of hot rolled coil in northern Europe \u2013 an industry benchmark \u2013 slump from \u20ac600 per tonne last summer to about \u20ac350 per tonne. Steelworkers\u2019 trade union Community also lashed out at the government. \u201cYet again the warm words from government ministers about the importance of the steel industry are not matched by action,\u201d said the union\u2019s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss. \u201cThe UK steel industry is facing a crisis and backing more effective trade defence in Europe by ending lesser duty tariffs would be just of one of the measures the government could take to give our industry the chance of a future. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for a level playing field and the opportunity for UK steel producers to compete in a global market but we need the UK government to stand up for steel in Europe and around the world.\u201d Labour has been pressing ministers to stop China dumping cheap steel on the market at below cost price, effectively making it uneconomic for UK producers. Nic Dakin, Labour MP for Scunthorpe, challenged Cameron about the UK\u2019s position in prime minister\u2019s questions, accusing him of failing to stand up for the British steel industry. Cameron avoided the issue of the EU tariffs in his reply, saying: \u201cWe have repeatedly stood up for UK steel, including supporting taking anti-dumping measures in the EU.\u201d Afterwards, Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, said it was \u201cutterly despicable for Cameron to say that in any way shape or form that he is supporting steel if his government is actually blocking attempts at a European level to place tariffs at a far higher rate on steel-dumping nations like China\u201d. \u201cAccording to calculations the tariff should be more like 66% not 9%,\u201d he said. \u201cThe EU commission wants to change things so we can up this potential tariff from 9% to something higher, and the UK government is most definitely the ringleader amongst EU nations opposing this.\u201d",

Well, a quick bounce in the share price is a useful start but any other reaction would have been alarming given the force of the verbal counter-offensive. Chief executive John Cryan had declared Deutsche to be \u201cabsolutely rock-solid\u201d and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the country\u2019s finance minister, was obliged to lend a hand by saying he had \u201cno concerns\u201d about the bank. Even after these proclamations, Deutsche\u2019s shares are still down 33% since the start of the year and the bank is priced at half its book value. So, no, the crisis is not over \u2013 not for Deutsche and not for the wider banking sector. There are specific worries about Deutsche \u2013 the cost of litigation and restructuring, and possible write-offs from bad loans to energy companies \u2013 but the deeper worry for all banks is simple. Are their business models damaged if we are tip-toeing towards a world of negative interest rates? In the old world of near-zero interest rates there was an easy way for banks to generate capital: borrow some of that cheap money and park it a safe long-term asset, such as a respectable government bond, offering a higher yield. But those opportunities are rapidly evaporating in the weird world of negative rates in which short- and long-term yields are falling in tandem. Some $6tn worth of government debt \u2013 mostly in Japan and the eurozone \u2013 is now calculated to be trading at a negative yield. That financial upset is clearly dramatic, but nobody knows the consequences if it lasts for long. If the European Central Bank, desperately trying to generate inflation and stimulate lending, takes a further step into negative territory at its meeting next month, would the woes of Deutsche and the banking sector deepen? It seems entirely possible if the outlook for the global economy is still weakening. Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyst yesterday quoted the view of Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, from last month on the challenges presented by ultra-low and negative rates. \u201cThe side-effects of the medicine are getting stronger and stronger, the curative effects are getting weaker and weaker,\u201d said Weber. Fair comment. Arm reaches for the future The microchips we design aren\u2019t just bought by Apple, and they aren\u2019t found only in smartphones. Arm Holdings has been singing this tune for a while, but with little effect on its share price. The UK\u2019s finest technology company has been a wonderful investment on a 10-year view but the stock has gone roughly sideways for the past three years, even as profits have risen from \u00a3364m in 2013 to \u00a3511m in 2015. Perhaps the latest variation on the theme will do the trick. Cars as \u201csupercomputers\u201d certainly sounded more compelling than past lectures on the wonders of the internet-of-things, an idea that always seemed just a little too loose. The big idea is that the average vehicle will soon be carrying $150 worth of chips. That is easier to understand because we can see the evidence: modern cars come packed with aids for drivers and elaborate entertainment systems. The computing power in each vehicle is set to increase a hundredfold, says Arm, which seems as good a prediction as any. In terms of the automotive market as a whole, the company reckons it\u2019s looking at an increase from $10bn to $15bn in five years. That\u2019s an opportunity for the medium term. In the short term, investors will continue to fret about China, Arm\u2019s exposure to a saturated smartphone market (still 45% of its business), and a possible slowdown in consumer spending that would slow royalty receipts. Take a step back, though, and another decade of growth for Arm seems assured as the licensing deals continue to flow. Few would describe a valuation of 30 times last year\u2019s earnings as cheap \u2013 but, by tech standards, that\u2019s not bad. Friction over oil The idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia would agree to co-ordinate cuts in oil production always seemed fanciful. And here comes Igor Sechin, chief executive of Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, to throw more cold water on the notion. Sechin, as well as taking a side sweep at \u201crobot traders\u201d \u2013 traditional bogeymen in tough times \u2013 blamed Middle Eastern producers for deliberating creating the current position of low oil prices and then sticking to the policy. It\u2019s not the sort of thing you would say if were trying to lay the groundwork for a deal and turn on the charm. From a mechanical point of view, the joint removal by the Saudis and the Russians of 1m barrels a day of production would probably bring the oil market into balance. But, without a thawing in the political relationship, it\u2019s not going to happen. The International Energy Agency had it right earlier in the week when it said: \u201cPersistent speculation about a deal between Opec and leading non-Opec producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation.\u201d The economic incentives for both countries might change if $30-a-barrel oil became $20. At the moment, though, everyone is wedded to their view that $50-ish will be seen by the end of this year as rising demand for oil meets lower investment. If that\u2019s their genuine view, there\u2019s no Russian/Saudi deal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank of England policies to help Britain\u2019s economic recovery have made inequality worse and increased the wealth gap between young and old, according to a leading credit ratings agency. A study by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has found thatthe low interest rates and quantitative easing used to rescue the economy after the 2008 crash have handed extra wealth to the richest households by propping up stock markets and supporting booming house prices. The report said the wealthiest 10% of households held 56% of all net financial assets in 2008. By 2014 the proportion of the nation\u2019s wealth in the hands of this group had risen to 65%. Without government policies to restrict house price rises and promote greater equality, the report said the situation would only get worse. The finding in the report \u2013 \u201cQE And Economic Inequality: The U.K. Experience \u2013 is likely to wound policymakers in Threadneedle Street who have repeatedly rebutted criticism that the Bank\u2019s policies favoured the rich over the poor. In 2014, the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute (Speri), argued that QE increased the value of financial assets in the UK by \u00a3600bn. Drawing on research by the New Economics Foundation, Speri claimed this amounted to an increase of between \u00a3128,000 and \u00a3322,000 in the wealth of Britain\u2019s most affluent families over the previous five years. By contrast, average earnings fell by 7.9% between 2008 and 2013. S&amp;P said its analysis, based on figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics, found that the central bank\u2019s policies were not the only cause of widening inequality, but were a major factor. \u201cWhile unconventional monetary policy measures such as QE proved successful in restoring confidence and supporting the economic recovery, an unintended consequence has been to exacerbate wealth disparity between rich and poor,\u201d said Tatiana Lysenko, senior economist at S&amp;P. The income gap in the UK remains among the greatest of OECD\u2019s 34 member countries, being wider than that in France, Germany, and Nordic European countries. Only the US, Spain, Italy and Japan rank higher on the scale of inequality. Britain fares better in the wealth tables compared with other European countries following a dramatic increase in home ownership, which spread wealth among middle- and low-income groups. For instance, the wealthiest 10% of UK households have about half of country\u2019s total wealth, while in Germany the share is higher at 60%. \u201cIn our view, this is linked to widespread home ownership in the UK, coupled with house price appreciation over the past decades that benefitted households on a wide income distribution spectrum. In fact, OECD countries with a higher share of household assets invested in housing tend to have lower wealth inequality,\u201d S&amp;P said. Under the QE programme, the Bank of England has spent \u00a3375bn buying government bonds from the banking sector to encourage investment in riskier assets. Officials hoped investors would direct investments into new technologies and assets that improved productivity. But most of the money has been invested in shares and property. Home ownership will likely drop in the coming decades, said the report, perpetuating high income and wealth inequality far into the future. \u201cYounger low- and middle-income households are the ones affected most. As buying a home becomes ever more expensive, they are increasingly forced to rent, spending a large share of their income on accommodation and unable to save to buy a home or otherwise accumulate wealth. \u201cIt also contributes to an even higher income inequality when accounting for housing costs. In fact, while income inequality fell slightly immediately after the crisis and has remained broadly stable since then, inequality when accounting for housing costs is on the rise again,\u201d the report said.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cNonetheless, any progress in reducing the trade deficit is likely to be extremely slow in the near term, leaving the recovery reliant on domestic demand.\u201d So said an analyst quoted in your report on the UK goods trade gap having reached a record \u00a3125bn last year (Financial, 10 February). So, if I go out and exchange my four-year-old car for an expensive one that I cannot afford, apparently I shall have \u201crecovered\u201d. In fact, though the chancellor might be happy in the short term because of the VAT he would harvest, I should be feeling decidedly queasy wondering how I was going to service the debt I had taken on to make the purchase. But no, according to current economic theory, I would be in recovery. Makes you wonder, doesn\u2019t it? Simon Gourlay Knighton, Powys \u2022 You report \u201cfears of 2008-style crisis\u201d (10 February). Truth is, this is still the 2008 crisis. Eight years ago we didn\u2019t \u201csave the world\u201d. Instead, we sat around waiting for someone else to pay the bills. Inertia can preserve wealth for those who already have it; but inertia won\u2019t create wealth for those stuck in poverty. Pretending poverty doesn\u2019t matter, as our Tory government does, does not contribute to economic or social development. Inertia surrenders space to economic and political stagnation, which, in turn, makes space for international conflict and social disharmony.

Some 4,100 people voted via Facebook for Somerville, whose academic writing played a pivotal role in the discovery of the planet Neptune, to appear on a new \u00a310 note. A groundswell of support, including a Facebook campaign by students at the Oxford University college bearing her name, put Somerville way out in front on Sunday, the last day of voting. Rival candidate Thomas Telford, the civil engineer known affectionately as the \u201cColossus of Roads\u201d, could only muster a meagre 500 votes with just hours to spare. But a last-minute surge of voting, much of it from India but also from other countries, saw Telford accelerate past Somerville to reach 5,100 votes by the deadline. James Clerk Maxwell, the physicist whose study of electromagnetism inspired Albert Einstein, limped home a distant third. But after discussions between Facebook and RBS, the late influx of votes was deemed suspicious. RBS later declared the result null and void, meaning Somerville\u2019s face will adorn the bank\u2019s new polymer \u00a310 notes from 2017. \u201cIt looks as if something dodgy has gone on. Mary Somerville was clearly the public\u2019s choice,\u201d said the source.

She is credited with an instrumental role in the discovery of Neptune, thanks to her writing on a hypothetical planet perturbing the orbit of Uranus. Somerville, who died in 1872, is also indelibly linked to the advancement of women in academia, having given her name to the Oxford college that initially only admitted women. Alumni of Somerville College, founded in 1879, include the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the TV presenter Esther Rantzen and the former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. RBS\u2019s decision to include a woman on its shortlist follows a high-profile row in 2013, when the Bank of England faced criticism for replacing the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on the \u00a35 note from 2016. The decision left no women on English banknotes at all, prompting a successful campaign led by the journalist Caroline Criado-Perez to put the face of Jane Austen on the \u00a310 note.",

    "webTitle": "James May urges nation to 'save Hornby' as shares plunge 62%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former Top Gear presenter James May has led the calls to rescue Hornby after the maker of model trains, planes and cars, warned that it faces a battle for survival. The company\u2019s origins can be traced back to 1901, when Frank Hornby, the founder, applied for a patent for an invention he described as \u201cimprovements in toy or educational devices for children and young people\u201d. He then went on to create Meccano and Hornby\u2019s famous collection of model trains. The company now also owns Airfix, Scalextric and Corgi. However, Hornby has suffered a torrid period in the last few years due to falling sales, problems with suppliers in China, and disruption from upgrading its computer and stock management systems. The Kent-based company warned on Wednesday that its problems had worsened significantly since the start of the year. Sales of Hornby products fell in January in the UK and the company has also discovered that it needs to write \u00a31m from the value of its stock. These factors mean that Hornby is now expecting to record an underlying pretax loss of between \u00a35.5m and \u00a36m for its financial year, far larger than expected, and there is a risk that the company will breach banking covenants in March. If it does so, there is a risk that Barclays, its bank, could call in the debt, threatening the company with collapse. Hornby has roughly \u00a39m of net debt, all with Barclays. Richard Ames, chief executive of Hornby, said the company had a \u201clong and supportive relationship\u201d with Barclays and is in talks about the potential breach. \u201cThis has been a real year of change at Hornby,\u201d he added. \u201cUndoubtedly this is a disappointing result, but we have a strong portfolio of brands that we are determined to see flourish.\u201d In response to the statement, May tweeted: \u201cWe must save Hornby. Buy a train set today. Every home should have one. #Forthenation.\u201d Shares in Hornby collapsed nonetheless, closing down 62% at 31.75p. The drop represents the worst day for Hornby\u2019s shares since it floated in 1986. The company is now valued at just \u00a317.4m. Analysts said that Hornby was struggling to be relevant in the modern toy industry, but that it could still have a future. Robert Haigh at Brand Finance, which monitors the health of leading consumer brands, said: \u201cThe toy industry has experienced profound change over the last three decades, with digital media and video games being the most transformative force. Interestingly, we had seen sales of \u2018traditional\u2019 and construction toys strengthen recently, and Hornby enjoyed fairly good sales in the runup to Christmas. \u201cIts long-term prospects are by no means bleak, and there is enduring demand for the types of toys it creates. However, in order to create sustainable brand value growth and increase revenues, it will have to focus attention both on marketing investment and a broadening of its range.\u201d Hornby has now warned on profits three times in the last five months. It has been beset by problems as Ames has tried to modernise the business by upgrading computer and stock management systems. The overhaul caused UK sales to fall sharply over the summer and affected Hornby\u2019s European business. Other recent problems for Hornby have included sales of London 2012 Olympic merchandise coming in well below expectations and disruption to a supplier in China preventing its products from reaching shops. However, Hornby enjoyed a promising end to 2015. Sales in November and December increased by 17% year-on-year in the UK on a like-for-like basis, and the company received a promising response to its 2016 range of products when it launched them last month. These include Corgi Thunderbirds models based on the original TV series, wooden toy Hornby trains, and Scalextric Arc Pro, which lets model car racers drive through different simulated weather conditions and share their results on social media. The drop in sales in January is thought to have been caused by cautious retailers choosing not to restock their shelves with Hornby products after the Christmas period. Ames said: \u201cThe feedback from customers at the recent international toy fairs was encouraging, and we are facing the future where, with the right platform, we can build value for our shareholders and drive the group\u2019s recovery.\u201d The Hornby boss said the board will press ahead with plans to modernise the company, but will analyse the \u201ccauses and consequences\u201d of the fall in sales this year. Ames said the company would update shareholders on the board\u2019s revised expectations for Hornby\u2019s outlook in due course.",

      "bodyText": "Investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan could be left with large stakes in Italian oil services company Saipem following the completion of a \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) share issue. Saipem launched the issue, which it hopes will give it a stronger financial structure, on 21 January at 37% lower than the then traded price in the company\u2019s shares. But, with markets fearful of prospects for companies involved in the oil sector, its shares have fallen below the price of the new shares being issued, making it less likely that rights holders will subscribe for the new shares being issued in the deal. On Wednesday the shares were trading at \u20ac0.36 compared with an issue price of \u20ac0.362. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the issue, are understood to face the possibility of being left with some of the unwanted stock, with some of it sub-underwritten by other banks and institutions. Neither bank would comment before the closure of the deal on Thursday. \u201cThe whole deal is on a knife edge,\u201d said one senior investment banking source. He added that the demand for the deal had been diminished by the volatile and falling oil price, which was creating nervousness in markets as a whole. Banks can often be left with large unwanted shareholdings in the companies they advise if investors shun share issues. In 2013, Barclays ended up with a 14.4% stake in Ziggo after being unable to find buyers for the cable group\u2019s shares. Oil services providers in Europe have been forced to sell new shares at significant discounts as a plunge in oil prices curbs demand for exploration and field development. CGG SA, a French provider of seismic surveys, has just sold \u20ac350m of new shares to finance its turnaround plan at a 72% discount. In the prospectus for its upcoming deal, Saipem said that owing to a slowdown in work in Venezuela in the final quarter, 2015 revenues were now expected to be as low as \u20ac11bn, compared with a previous estimate of about \u20ac12bn. While it remained on track to meet its other 2015 targets, there was a risk results could be worse than expected, while a significant update to 2016 estimates might also be needed, it said. The company said its 2016-2019 plan had been based on an oil price that went from $55 a barrel in 2016 to $80 in 2019. Prices are currently hovering just above $30 a barrel. \u201cIf the price of oil stays at present levels for another three to four months and there is a marked drop in the order portfolio the company will have to acknowledge the further worsening of market prospects and so draw up an updated business plan,\u201d Saipem said. The company, controlled by oil major Eni and state lender fund FSI, has seen about \u20ac14bn wiped off its balance sheet in three years, after a corruption investigation in Algeria, two profit warnings and a glum business outlook.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has predicted a bright future for the oil and gas industry with crude prices spiking at $100 a barrel again, huge increases in shale output and new production from Canadian tar sands. The British oil company believes fossil fuels will still be providing 80% of total energy supply in 2035 and admits that under this scenario, carbon emissions will rocket. The forecasts were immediately attacked by critics who accused BP of deliberately talking up the prospects for its own business while providing a downbeat assessment of future demand for wind and solar power. The predictions are contained in the latest annual BP Energy Outlook, which looks at long-term trends and develops projections for world energy markets over the next two decades. \u201cIn the middle of a downturn in oil and gas prices, it is important not only to adapt to the current tough conditions, but also to prepare for the next set of challenges,\u201d argued BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley. The key message seems to be that the oil and gas industry must keep on extracting new reserves to meet strong demand for energy from developing countries and a growth in the world population. Spencer Dale, BP\u2019s chief economist, was unwilling to say what price assumptions were used in his predictions but did expect an improvement away from a current level of just above $30 a barrel oil. Prices would eventually rise to somewhere between $30 and $100 and while the high figure was not a natural \u201cresting place\u201d, Dale said he expected events to ensure prices would spike up again on occasions to $100. The positive picture for fossil fuel prices and production from BP was attacked by critics as disingenuous and self-serving. \u201cThis is a story of how an oil and gas company predicts the rosy prospects of oil and gas companies. BP would like us to believe that government action on climate will fail, that clean technologies will fizzle, and that the future of energy will still be based on the carbon fuels of the past,\u201d said Greg Muttitt of Washington-based campaign group Oil Change International. \u201cDressed in a veneer of concern about climate change, in fact BP\u2019s outlook is a public relations exercise, designed to boost fossil fuels and undermine public faith in clean alternatives. Meanwhile it deflects responsibility to government or to coal companies, to distract from its own extraction of oil and gas. This is not a credible view of the future of energy.\u201d Dudley told the International Petroleum Week conference in London on Wednesday that the commodity cycle that saw oil prices hit $100 as little as eight months ago was not over. He said the second half of 2016 would see stronger prices because \u201cevery storage tank and swimming pool\u201d would be full of oil. The oil company admitted that in the past it has underestimated the growth of wind and other renewable power technologies in the energy mix but had overestimated the contribution from nuclear and biofuels. It expected carbon emissions to grow by almost 1% a year for the two decades, \u201csuggesting the need for further policy action\u201d such as a meaningful price for carbon, it said in its outlook. BP was unwilling to speculate on where its base case scenario would leave the Earth\u2019s temperatures, but it would be way above the two degrees centigrade growth seen as safe by most scientists. The company also outlined a mixture of alternative scenarios, some of which presume much more policy action to counter global warming, including one with a very high carbon price of $100 a tonne (compared with around $5 a tonne now). The outlook predicted that \u201ctight oil\u201d \u2013 mainly US shale \u2013 would rise from around 4m barrels of oil equivalent to 8m in the 2030s. It added that US shale gas could provide almost 20% of the world\u2019s supplies within 20 years. BP also forecast a major future increase in output from non-Opec production in deep water Brazilian fields and the Canadian tar sands, even though the latter is very expensive and involves high carbon production methods. Launching the outlook, Dale denied the base case forecast was one the company planned its business round but said it was up to ministers to find wider solutions to climate change. \u201cThe idea that you plan on any single base case would not be a sensible thing ... I am not a climate scientist and the mapping between carbon emissions and temperatures itself is highly ill-defined and uncertain thing. \u201cIts a very challenging environment but our job here is not to do anything in terms of advocacy. Our job is not to say whats optimal what is the right thing to do, that\u2019s for policy makers. Our job is to say what is the most likely case.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>BP has predicted a bright future for the oil and gas industry with crude prices spiking at $100 a barrel again, huge increases in shale output and new production from Canadian tar sands.</p> <p>The British oil company believes fossil fuels will still be providing 80% of total energy supply in 2035 and admits that under this scenario, carbon emissions will rocket.</p> <p>The forecasts were immediately attacked by critics who accused BP of deliberately talking up the prospects for its own business while providing a downbeat assessment of future demand for wind and solar power.</p> <p>The predictions are contained in <a href=\"http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/energy-outlook-2035.html\">the latest annual BP Energy Outlook</a>, which looks at long-term trends and develops projections for world energy markets over the next two decades.</p> <p>\u201cIn the middle of a downturn in oil and gas prices, it is important not only to adapt to the current tough conditions, but also to prepare for the next set of challenges,\u201d argued BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley.</p> <p>The key message seems to be that the oil and gas industry must keep on extracting new reserves to meet strong demand for energy from developing countries and a growth in the world population.</p> <p>Spencer Dale, BP\u2019s chief economist, was unwilling to say what price assumptions were used in his predictions but did expect an improvement away from a current level of just above $30 a barrel oil.</p> <p>Prices would eventually rise to somewhere between $30 and $100 and while the high figure was not a natural \u201cresting place\u201d, Dale said he expected events to ensure prices would spike up again on occasions to $100.</p> <p>The positive picture for fossil fuel prices and production from BP was attacked by critics as disingenuous and self-serving. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a story of how an oil and gas company predicts the rosy prospects of oil and gas companies. BP would like us to believe that government action on climate will fail, that clean technologies will fizzle, and that the future of energy will still be based on the carbon fuels of the past,\u201d said Greg Muttitt of Washington-based campaign group Oil Change International.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cDressed in a veneer of concern about climate change, in fact BP\u2019s outlook is a public relations exercise, designed to boost fossil fuels and undermine public faith in clean alternatives. Meanwhile it deflects responsibility to government or to coal companies, to distract from its own extraction of oil and gas. This is not a credible view of the future of energy.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Dudley told the International Petroleum Week conference in London on Wednesday that the commodity cycle that saw oil prices hit $100 as little as eight months ago was not over. He said the second half of 2016 would see stronger prices because \u201cevery storage tank and swimming pool\u201d would be full of oil. </p> <p>The oil company admitted that in the past it has underestimated the growth of wind and other renewable power technologies in the energy mix but had overestimated the contribution from nuclear and biofuels.</p> <p>It expected carbon emissions to grow by almost 1% a year for the two decades, \u201csuggesting the need for further policy action\u201d such as a meaningful price for carbon, it said in its outlook.</p> <p>BP was unwilling to speculate on where its base case scenario would leave the Earth\u2019s temperatures, but it would be way above the two degrees centigrade growth seen as safe by most scientists.</p> <p>The company also outlined a mixture of alternative scenarios, some of which presume much more policy action to counter global warming, including one with a very high carbon price of $100 a tonne (compared with around $5 a tonne now).</p> <p>The outlook predicted that \u201ctight oil\u201d \u2013 mainly US shale \u2013 would rise from around 4m barrels of oil equivalent to 8m in the 2030s. It added that US shale gas could provide almost 20% of the world\u2019s supplies within 20 years.</p> <p>BP also forecast a major future increase in output from non-Opec production in deep water Brazilian fields and the Canadian tar sands, even though the latter is very expensive and involves high carbon production methods.</p> <p>Launching the outlook, Dale denied the base case forecast was one the company planned its business round but said it was up to ministers to find wider solutions to climate change.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that you plan on any single base case would not be a sensible thing ... I am not a climate scientist and the mapping between carbon emissions and temperatures itself is highly ill-defined and uncertain thing.</p> <p>\u201cIts a very challenging environment but our job here is not to do anything in terms of advocacy. Our job is not to say whats optimal what is the right thing to do, that\u2019s for policy makers. Our job is to say what is the most likely case.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Worries about Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial position sent its shares tumbling earlier this week and put the spotlight on so-called CoCo bonds, a financial instrument which has only existed for around three years. What is a CoCo bond? Contingent convertible bonds were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, to give banks an extra layer of protection if they face renewed strains on their balance sheet. Financial regulators also wanted to prevent a repeat of what happened during the crisis, when taxpayers pumped billions into struggling banks while bondholders mostly saw their investments repaid. How do they work? The bonds allow banks to skip interest payments without defaulting, and can be converted to shares or written down if a bank runs into financial difficulties. Investors in CoCo bonds would therefore bear the losses, but in return for taking the risk, the interest rate payments are higher at up to 7% compared with normal senior bank debt which pays around 1%. CoCos are among the riskiest bank debt, with Fitch giving only a quarter of eurozone CoCos an investment grade rating. How big is the market for CoCos? The market is only around three years old but is now an important source of financing for banks, and is estimated to be worth around \u20ac95bn (\u00a373bn) globally. The BBA, the UK banking trade body, says an estimated \u20ac40bn of CoCos were issued by European banks in 2015, while Bank of England data shows that the main UK banks issued around \u00a34.5bn during the second and third quarters of last year. Why are investors worried now? The CoCo market is relatively new and untested. The current market volatility has raised concerns that banks may struggle to pay the interest on the bonds, may not buy them back as soon as investors expected or \u2013 in extremis \u2013 the bonds could become worthless. There are strict regulations governing the bonds, including the trigger points at which they convert to equity or are written down, which are linked to the bank\u2019s overall capital position. For example, to make interest payments on CoCos, banks have to calculate their available distributable items. Deutsche Bank is seen as having less leeway than other large banks, which has helped prompt the current volatility. It insisted on Tuesday its payment due in April was safe, but investors are concerned it may struggle with its 2017 liabilities. This has led to a slump in the value of its \u20ac1.7bnof CoCos, which fell to a record low of 70\u00a2 on Tuesday compared with 93\u00a2 at the start of the year. It is not alone: bonds issued by the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Santander and Unicredit have also fallen. Are there wider implications? Bank shares have been plunging in recent days on fears that negative interest rates will hurt their balance sheets at a time when they are being encouraged to continue lending to businesses to help support economic growth. At the same time there are concerns about their exposure to struggling sectors of the economy such as oil and gas companies. So the prospect of a default on CoCo bonds adds to the current uncertainty over the banking sector, and as well as making further issuance of such bonds a problem, could also undermine other credit markets.",

But losses widened to \u00a325.6m in the year to 1 March 2015, compared with \u00a312.8m in the year before as it opened more than 20 new coffee shops. Tesco also owns the Giraffe family restaurant chain where losses ballooned to \u00a34.1m in the year to 1 March 2015. That business also looks set to remain part of the supermarket business as Tesco said it remained focused on growing the business. In a similar turn of events to those at Harris + Hoole, co-founders Juliette and Russel Joffe, who launched the company in 1998 with friend Andrew Jacobs, stepped down from running the business in the summer.",

      "bodyText": "Exploration company Tullow Oil has promised to its cut costs further after posting a $1bn (\u00a3690m) pre-tax loss, blaming rock-bottom oil prices. Revenues fell 27% to $1.6bn, forcing Tullow to write off $749m in exploration costs and slash the value of equipment and property by $406m. While the result was an improvement on last year\u2019s $2bn loss, shares in the company plunged more than 10% on Wednesday morning, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. The slump came as Tullow said that while it had taken action to prevent breaching the terms of its loans, there was still a risk it could do so at the end of 2016. The Irish oil company has already slashed staff numbers by 37% as part of a $500m cost savings plan. On Wednesday, it cancelled its dividend to conserve cash, as net debt jumped 30% to $4bn, incurring interest payments of $145m. Analysts have begun to raise concerns about the scale of debt in the industry, as the impact of oil prices on revenue from sales makes it harder to service loans. The price Tullow received for its oil slumped from $97.5 a barrel last year to $67. Further falls are inevitable, with the price of Brent crude hovering at around $30. But a spokesman said the $5bn TEN project in Ghana was the main reason for Tullow\u2019s debt, which the company expects to start shrinking once the project comes on stream. The company said it is on course to start pumping oil from TEN in July or August, increasing production from 73,400 barrels a day to about 100,000 in 2017. Its chief executive, Aidan Heavey, insisted Tullow was strong enough to withstand continued low oil prices. \u201cOur challenge in 2016 is to be equally robust in responding to the uncertainties that remain in the sector,\u201d he said. The company pointed to its low cost of production in key west African projects as reason for optimism. It expects the new TEN and existing Jubilee fields in Ghana to have an operating cost of $8 a barrel, making them far more profitable than other areas such as the North Sea \u2013 where costs are closer to $30 a barrel, forcing firms to suspend production while they wait for the slump in oil prices to reverse. Tullow sold major interests in North Sea assets for \u00a350m in 2014 as part of a shift to focus on its African projects, although it still derives about a 10th of production from the area. While capital expenditure in 2015 was $1.7bn, Tullow said this could fall to $900m this year and to $300m from 2017 if there is no upturn in the oil price. As well as its west Africa assets, Tullow is also developing oil and gas basins in Kenya and Uganda. It hopes to benefit from a plan to build an oil pipeline from Uganda to the port of Lamu in Kenya, allowing for cheaper exports.",

      "bodyText": "Investors were toasting Greene King after an upbeat trading statement from the pubs group. The business said it was successfully integrating its purchase of rival Spirit, at the same time as recording a record Christmas performance. Retail sales rose 67% after 40 weeks including a 33 week contribution from Spirit, and it achieved record sales of \u00a36.4m on Christmas Day. It said it was confident about its full year expectations despite the current economic uncertainty, and its shares have risen 24p to 858.5p In a buy note Canaccord Genuity analyst Nigel Parson said: Greene King\u2019s... interim management statement revealed that it has enjoyed a strong third quarter helped by the Christmas fortnight. It continues to make good progress on integration; it has declared \u00a335m of synergies which we think could rise to \u00a340m. In a market where there is little pricing power, the ability to take costs out is attractive. But the investment case is not just about defensive cost savings: Greene King is now a much better investment proposition with higher quality earnings, stronger free cash flow and better growth prospects than before. Greene King has a clear route-map to follow and the heavy lifting of brand rationalisation has now started in earnest this quarter. It reports \u2018encouraging\u2019 performance from the rebranded trial sites. We reiterate our buy recommendation and retain our 1100p share price target, implying 32% potential upside. The market-induced share price weakness since the interim spike gives investors a good entry point. He added: Now the reorganisation is complete and Christmas is in the past, the serious business of rationalising the brands and focusing the capex and effort can get going in earnest. Greene King plans to halve the brand portfolio to ten powerful brands with the most capable management and the majority of the expansion capex being focused here. The key growth brands are to include Hungry Horse, Flaming Grill, Farmhouse Inns, Chef &amp; Brewer and Metropolitan (Premium London estate). This focus is key to Greene King\u2019s medium-term future.The next important date will be systems migration to one platform in early March 2016. Karl Burns at Panmure Gordon said: We reiterate our buy recommendation on Greene King and 1090p price target. Greene King continues to see strong underlying like for like sales growth, whilst the Spirit Pub acquisition will provide at least \u00a335m of cost synergies and potentially \u00a330m of additional profit contribution from investment into the Spirit Pub estate over the next three years Based upon the current enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of around 9.3 times, this would equate to additional value of around \u00a3600m to shareholders, or a 24% uplift to the current equity value. Furthermore, the 4% dividend yield adds further upside to investors, whilst as Greene King reduces net debt, the stock should re-rate. Meanwhile Stifel was also upbeat: This is a positive update from Greene King and management indicates that expectations for the full year are unchanged. With a positive outlook for earnings growth, assisted by the benefits from the Spirit acquisition, the rating of 11 times earnings for 2016/17 looks undemanding with an attractive yield of 4.1%. We consider the shares have good upside to our target price of 1020p. Although it did add: Press reports this morning indicate that ministers are considering reducing the drink driving limit in England, following the reduction in Scotland in November 2014, which impacted pub revenues by 3-4%. This would clearly be negative for the sector.",

Greene King continues to see strong underlying like for like sales growth, whilst the Spirit Pub acquisition will provide at least \u00a335m of cost synergies and potentially \u00a330m of additional profit contribution from investment into the Spirit Pub estate over the next three years</p> <p>Based upon the current enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of around 9.3 times, this would equate to additional value of around \u00a3600m to shareholders, or a 24% uplift to the current equity value. Furthermore, the 4% dividend yield adds further upside to investors, whilst as Greene King reduces net debt, the stock should re-rate. </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Stifel was also upbeat:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a positive update from Greene King and management indicates that expectations for the full year are unchanged. With a positive outlook for earnings growth, assisted by the benefits from the Spirit acquisition, the rating of 11 times earnings for 2016/17 looks undemanding with an attractive yield of 4.1%. We consider the shares have good upside to our target price of 1020p.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although it did add:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Press reports this morning indicate that ministers are considering reducing the drink driving limit in England, following the reduction in Scotland in November 2014, which impacted pub revenues by 3-4%. This would clearly be negative for the sector.</p> </blockquote>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s industrial production fell by 1.1% in December after warm winter weather forced a sharp decline in energy output and the low oil price hit North Sea oil producers. The manufacturing sector experienced a further fall from an already weak November, while mining and quarrying also dropped, fuelling concerns that the slowdown in the US and turmoil on global markets is undermining confidence across the UK\u2019s major export industries. One analyst described the last year as \u201cdismal\u201d after official figures showed that the recovery in Britain\u2019s industrial sector during 2013 and 2014 came to an abrupt end in 2015. Manufacturing output, which accounts for about 10% of GDP, shrank 1.7% in 2015 compared with the previous year, leaving it still 6.5% below the total it achieved before the 2008 financial crash. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the weakness of manufacturing, where output fell 0.2% in December, was the most worrying feature of the survey data. \u201cThis was the third successive month in which factory output had declined, leaving the size of the manufacturing [sector] unchanged in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe extent to which the UK has failed to rebalance towards manufacturing is further highlighted by the industrial sector as a whole and manufacturing being 9.8% and 6.5% respectively smaller than their pre-recession peaks seen at the start of 2008.\u201d A similar picture across Europe emerged this week, with figures on Tuesday showing much weaker industrial output in Germany being matched on Wednesday by a 1.6% month on month drop in French industrial output and 0.7% fall in Italy. The Office for National Statistics said output in the energy supply sector dived by 5.4% month-to-month, accounting for 0.5 percentage points of the fall in overall production, as demand for heating energy from households and businesses was lower than usual owing to the mild winter in much of the country. Output in the mining and quarrying sector fell by 4%, accounting for a further 0.5 percentage points of the overall industrial decline. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said oil producers appear to be scaling back production now that prices have fallen below the marginal cost of extracting it from existing rigs. He said manufacturers would continue to have a difficult time despite a fall in the pound in recent months. \u201cLong lags mean that manufacturers won\u2019t feel the full benefits of the recent depreciation of sterling until the end of 2016. Accordingly, the economic recovery is likely to remain entirely dependent on the services sector this year,\u201d he said. Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the UK had ended the year \u201con a dismal note\u201d, but was more optimistic about the impact of sterling on exports. \u201cThe recent depreciation of trade-weighted sterling and our expectations of a pickup in world growth in 2016, suggest that the manufacturing sector\u2019s fortunes will improve slightly as this year progresses,\u201d he said. Dennis De Jong, managing director of currency broker UFX.com, said an increase in output from larger manufacturers was not enough to return the sector to growth, and reports of underlying staff cuts will be cause for further concern. \u201cWith global financial markets continuing to undergo extreme volatility, we will have to wait to see if the manufacturing sector can build some momentum in the face of weakening demand from emerging markets, not to mention negative headwinds from China,\u201d he said.",

Tidjane Thiam said Credit Suisse was \u201cstronger than ever\u201d, after the bank\u2019s shares dropped 8% on Tuesday, taking its fall since this year to 40%. The former boss of Prudential, who took over at Credit Suisse in July, said his bank\u2019s balance sheet was stronger than it had ever been and that it had no trouble raising funding in the market. Banks in general are safer than during the financial crisis, he added. Shares of banks in Europe, the US and Japan have plunged due to a wide range of concerns including fears of a global recession, the impact on profits of low or negative interest rates and worries about balance sheet strength. Some analysts have compared the panic to the period before Lehman Brothers went bust in September 2008 but Thiam said the comparison was not valid. \u201cThe banking system in general is much stronger than in 2008, 2009 [but] there are a lot of memories of that period,\u201d Thiam told the Financial Times (\u00a3). \u201cSome of the scenes we are seeing today are not justified . . .

Deutsche has tried to reassure investors that it will be able to make payments on bonds that convert into shares at times of crisis. Credit Suisse, Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest bank, has also been in the line of fire. Its shares fell more heavily than Deutsche\u2019s on Tuesday. Last week Credit Suisse posted its first annual loss since 2008 as it wrote down the value of its investment bank. Thiam said Credit Suisse could answer questions about the strength of its balance sheet and that traders in bank shares were reacting to short-term events. Credit Suisse shares rose 3% in early trading on Wednesday as the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 banking index gained 3.7%. The sector was supported by a report in the FT that Deutsche is considering buying back billions of euros of its own debt in an effort to support the falling value of its bonds. Deutsche shares jumped more than 11% on Wednesday morning.",

      "bodyText": "Markets are staging an early rally after this week\u2019s hefty falls amid panicky trading. But the mood is still cautious ahead of chair Janet Yellen testifying to Congress later, and there are some notable losers. Hikma has dropped 234p or nearly 12% to \u00a317.61 after the pharmaceutical group revised the terms of its offer for US generic drug group Roxane. It said it would pay $535m less than originally anticipated $2.65bn since the group\u2019s 2015 revenue would be lower than expected. It said Roxane\u2019s revenues this year would also be affected. Analysts at Jefferies said: The company stated they believe 2016 revenue will be negatively impacted and has reduced the revenue range for 2017 to $700-750m vs. $725-775m previously and JEFe $750m. Since the publication of the Prospectus on January 22nd, Hikma received new information from BI with regard to the financial performance of Roxane in 2015, leading to a reassessment of the outlook for 2016 and 2017. Roxane\u2019s unaudited revenue appears to have been lower than Hikma expected at the time of the prospectus\u2019 publication. Higher than expected rebates and increased cost of sales the cause: Rebates were primarily being paid to wholesalers, as the mix shifted from direct sales to retailers towards more indirect sales via wholesalers the level of rebates paid increased. This resulted in lower net selling prices than had been previously expected. Furthermore, Hikma believes the cost of sales is higher due to higher volumes and a change in mix which has led to a higher cost of raw materials. Analysts at Stifel were still positive on the deal, saying: We still believe the acquisition makes strong strategic sense for Hikma, and plan to adjust our forecasts for these changes in due course. Chip designer Arm is also in the doldrums, down 37.5p to 902.5p as the Apple supplier reported a better than expected 14% rise in fourth quarter revenues to $407.9m but brokers pointed out that a $9m royalty catch-up payment inflated the figures. Liberum said: Dollar revenue was 2% ahead of our forecast. However, there was a $9m royalty catch-up which boosted numbers. Excluding this catch up revenue was in-line. Opex was 5% ahead of our forecast. Including the royalty catch-up EBIT was in-line, but excluding it EBIT was 4% below our forecasts. Dividend per share has been increased by 25% but nothing further on cash returns which may disappoint some. Backlog was up quarter on quarter. Arm\u2019s outlook statement is cautious. The company has also been under pressure on signs of a slowdown in iPhone sales. Despite poor UK industrial production data, the FTSE 100 is currently up 51.03 points at 5683.22. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: Major European markets are trying to rally once again, but with previous rebounds having lacked conviction, falling sharply after early gains, sentiment remains fragile. Any early movement in markets is, however, just a precursor to this afternoon\u2019s main event, billed as possibly the most important debate of the year so far, as Janet Yellen makes her first official public statement since raising rates in December. At the House Financial Services Committee today, Janet Yellen can expect a tough examination from lawmakers after the financial carnage that has ensued since the Fed hiked interest rates. Will she insist that the Fed is simply data-dependent, or might there be an acknowledgment that the world simply wasn\u2019t ready for higher US interest rates? With both the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank still in aggressive easing mode, the Fed appears more isolated than ever in its efforts to normalise US monetary conditions. Insurers are among the main gainers, with Prudential up 55p to \u00a311.81 and Legal and General, which on Tuesday reassured investors about its bond exposure, adding 7.5p to 209.9p. Elsewhere Domino\u2019s Pizza has jumped 68p to 924.5p after Credit Suisse moved from neutral to outperform with a target price raised from 770p to \u00a311.",

      "body": "<p>Markets are staging an early rally after this week\u2019s hefty falls amid panicky trading. But the mood is still cautious ahead of chair Janet Yellen testifying to Congress later, and there are some notable losers.</p> <p><strong>Hikma</strong> has dropped 234p or nearly 12% to \u00a317.61 after the pharmaceutical group revised the terms of its offer for US generic drug group Roxane. It said it would pay $535m less than originally anticipated $2.65bn since the group\u2019s 2015 revenue would be lower than expected. It said Roxane\u2019s revenues this year would also be affected. Analysts at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The company stated they believe 2016 revenue will be negatively impacted and has reduced the revenue range for 2017 to $700-750m vs. $725-775m previously and JEFe $750m.</p> <p>Since the publication of the Prospectus on January 22nd, Hikma received new information from BI with regard to the financial performance of Roxane in 2015, leading to a reassessment of the outlook for 2016 and 2017. Roxane\u2019s unaudited revenue appears to have been lower than Hikma expected at the time of the prospectus\u2019 publication.</p> <p>Higher than expected rebates and increased cost of sales the cause: Rebates were primarily being paid to wholesalers, as the mix shifted from direct sales to retailers towards more indirect sales via wholesalers the level of rebates paid increased. This resulted in lower net selling prices than had been previously expected. Furthermore, Hikma believes the cost of sales is higher due to higher volumes and a change in mix which has led to a higher cost of raw materials.</p> </blockquote> <p>Analysts at Stifel were still positive on the deal, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still believe the acquisition makes strong strategic sense for Hikma, and plan to adjust our forecasts for these changes in due course.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> is also in the doldrums, down 37.5p to 902.5p as the Apple supplier reported a better than expected 14% rise in fourth quarter revenues to $407.9m but brokers pointed out that a $9m royalty catch-up payment inflated the figures. Liberum said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dollar revenue was 2% ahead of our forecast. However, there was a $9m royalty catch-up which boosted numbers. Excluding this catch up revenue was in-line. Opex was 5% ahead of our forecast. Including the royalty catch-up EBIT was in-line, but excluding it EBIT was 4% below our forecasts. Dividend per share has been increased by 25% but nothing further on cash returns which may disappoint some. Backlog was up quarter on quarter. Arm\u2019s outlook statement is cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>The company has also been under pressure on <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/26/apple-iphone-sales-slowdown-2007-drop-holiday\">signs of a slowdown in iPhone sales</a></strong>.</p> <p>Despite poor UK industrial production data, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 51.03 points at 5683.22. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Major European markets are trying to rally once again, but with previous rebounds having lacked conviction, falling sharply after early gains, sentiment remains fragile. Any early movement in markets is, however, just a precursor to this afternoon\u2019s main event, billed as possibly the most important debate of the year so far, as Janet Yellen makes her first official public statement since raising rates in December.</p> <p>At the House Financial Services Committee today, Janet Yellen can expect a tough examination from lawmakers after the financial carnage that has ensued since the Fed hiked interest rates. Will she insist that the Fed is simply data-dependent, or might there be an acknowledgment that the world simply wasn\u2019t ready for higher US interest rates? With both the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank still in aggressive easing mode, the Fed appears more isolated than ever in its efforts to normalise US monetary conditions.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Insurers are among the main gainers, with <strong>Prudential</strong> up 55p to \u00a311.81 and <strong>Legal and General</strong>, which <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/feb/09/ftse-edges-higher-after-rout-with-legal-and-general-leading-the-way\">on Tuesday reassured investors about its bond exposure</a></strong>, adding 7.5p to 209.9p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Domino\u2019s Pizza</strong> has jumped 68p to 924.5p after Credit Suisse moved from neutral to outperform with a target price raised from 770p to \u00a311.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Banking shares have come under pressure this week as investors express fears that the sector will be badly hit by a global economic downturn. Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets since the 2008 financial crisis, but they could be in for a turbulent year if potential flashpoints such as emerging markets or the energy sector produce a cascade of debt defaults. Here are the five biggest threats to the banking sector: China A property boom and frenzy of manufacturing in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash kept the global economy motoring, but stored up huge private debts that investors fear will soon destabilise the Chinese economy. Beijing is working hard to wean itself off being the world\u2019s source of cheap manufactured goods, but it is a painful transition, full of pitfalls. Some banks have called in bad loans, forcing firms to go bust. But these are rare, leaving international investors to fear that more are in the pipeline, without knowing the extent of the problem. Property developments and infrastructure projects stand half-finished while the authorities take stock of the situation. Some analysts fear Beijing is covertly depreciating the yuan to gain a competitive advantage while it moves towards a more western-style consumer economy. That would spark a currency war and a wave of competitive devaluations. The stock market is dominated by individual investors who treat the market like a casino. Efforts to shift share ownership to institutional investors and impose stricter regulations have proved ineffective so far, leaving the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges to cope with wild swings each time there is bad economic news. Emerging markets The list of developing nations suffering the after effects of the slowing global economy and the slump in oil prices grows every week. Last year, Brazil slid into a recession made worse by a corruption scandal that could topple the government. Venezuela\u2019s ailing post-Hugo Ch\u00e1vez administration is expected to default on its loans after oil revenues dried up. Nigeria, Russia and the Middle Eastern producers are also badly hit by falling oil prices, leaving government budgets under water. Turkey, South Africa and Mexico are braced for corporate insolvencies after strong signals from the US Federal Reserve that years of borrowing heavily at rock bottom interest rates will soon come to an end. The Fed raised rates in December and could do so again soon, jeopardising the finances of large corporations that borrowed heavily in dollars. East Asian economies Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea, which depend on trade with China\u2019s manufacturing sector, are suffering a dramatic slowdown as the world\u2019s second-largest economy focuses on tackling corruption and boosting consumer demand. Sovereign debts that only last year appeared to be manageable are coming under scrutiny by the international ratings agencies. Only India, which is large enough to be relatively insulated from the recent market turmoil, has maintained its growth, outstripping Beijing\u2019s official 6.9% rate with a 7.5% expansion in 2015. Eurozone When the European Central Bank cut its already ultra-low main interest rate from 0.15% to 0.05% in the autumn of 2014, the Ukraine crisis was cited as a risk to Europe\u2019s hopes of recovery. Since then, the Syria crisis and the exodus of refugees to Europe\u2019s shores has become a more serious threat to the stability of the 19-member currency bloc and the ECB has cut rates further and hinted of more to come next month. While stock markets have welcomed cheaper borrowing costs, fears that European banks have returned to their bad old ways and become embroiled in risky lending has come to dominate discussions in the City. Bank shares, led by Deutsche Bank and Barclays, dived this week as investors scrambled to buy safer assets. Some countries are suffering more than others. Finland has fallen into a recession deeper than anything Portugal experienced. France is lagging and Italy\u2019s burst of activity last year is waning. Worse, Germany\u2019s industrial output has come under pressure from the decline in trade along the Silk Road that leads back to China. Oil JP Morgan believes the exposure to the oil sector of US and European banks amounts to about $250bn (\u00a3173bn), although it thinks big losses on that money are unlikely. The oil industry had $455bn of bonds outstanding in 2006, but that figure increased to $1.4tn by 2014, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Oil companies had $1.6tn of syndicated loans in 2014, although that does not take into account repayments or loans that were never drawn. Both numbers are likely to have increased significantly since the BIS last crunched the numbers. Debts have ballooned in part because of the boom in shale oil and gas extraction in the US. Companies borrowed heavily to fund investment in shale when the oil price was high. Now that prices have tumbled, those debts look increasingly unsustainable. America\u2019s second-biggest natural gas firm, Chesapeake Energy, threatens to provide the first significant example of a big company driven under by debt. It was forced to deny this week that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, with debts of $10bn and a market value of just $1.2bn. It is not just in the US where such disasters could arise. Firms that operate in regions where it costs a lot to extract oil, such as the UK North Sea, are seeing their profits wiped out. Prolonged rock-bottom oil prices raise the prospect that some of these oil and gas companies will default on their debts, sending shockwaves through lenders such as banks and bond investors. There is also a knock-on effect in countries that rely on oil reserves for income. Falling oil revenues result in lower tax receipts, which could force greater austerity and depress economic activity further, triggering debt defaults across a variety of businesses. Commodities In a report at the end of last year, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s warned of a \u201cspike in defaults\u201d among commodity companies, as well as oil producers. \u201cThe sheer volume of commodity-related debt poses challenges because it means that credit losses from commodity investments will be substantial for many investors,\u201d said Mariarosa Verde, Moody\u2019s group credit officer. The group said $2tn of bonds had been issued by mining companies since 2010, many of them now rated as junk, meaning there is a high risk investors will not get their money back. Mining companies have suffered badly because they spent big when metals prices were high and cannot sustain their operating costs now that prices are low. One of the hardest hit has been commodities giant Glencore, which has $36bn of net debt and a market value of $20bn. Observers have warned that because Glencore\u2019s metals trading arm deals with so many companies around the world, it poses a risk. If it were to fall into severe financial trouble, it might trigger a Lehman Brothers-style event, creating a domino effect of debt similar to the banking crisis of 2008. Bank of America has estimated that the financial sector\u2019s exposure to Glencore could be as high as $100bn \u2013 and that\u2019s just one company. The company has insisted that it has plenty of financial room for manoeuvre if things get tight and it has since moved to cut its debts. But ultra-low commodity prices could cause big problems for more than just the banks and investors who lend to mining firms. For instance, the copper price has more than halved to below $2/lb since 2011. This is largely because China\u2019s slowdown means the metal, used in electrical wiring among other things, is not in such demand. The economy of some countries \u2013 such as Zambia, for instance \u2013 are built almost entirely on copper. Low metals prices could force mining-dependent countries to default on their debts, spreading the problem to sovereign debt markets. too.",

      "bodyText": "Fears the government could privatise Network Rail have been heightened after a report from an influential thinktank called for its abolition and endorsed closing lines and deregulating fares. The free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said full privatisation of the UK\u2019s railways would improve services and ease the burden on the taxpayer. It claims that strict regulation, price controls on fares and the structure separating train and track have made the railways inefficient, while the industry still cost taxpayers almost \u00a35bn in 2014/15 \u2013 equivalent to \u00a3180 per household. Labour and transport campaigners called on ministers to reject the report. The IEA\u2019s study comes as the government is considering the future of Network Rail, with a review by Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, into its financing and structure due to be delivered before next month\u2019s budget. Shaw has said a full privatisation and breakup of Network Rail is among the options on the table. The IEA said rail firms should be allowed full control of fares and spending on safety, and subsidies should be removed. It argued that private railways should be free to cut costs by closing loss-making lines and services, introducing super-peak fares to tackle overcrowding, offering cut-price options such as standing-only carriages and determining an appropriate level of safety expenditure. The report\u2019s author, Dr Richard Wellings, head of transport at the IEA, said: \u201cThe renationalisation of rail infrastructure has proven to be wholly unsuccessful. We now have a hybrid model where despite part-privatisation, the sector has remained heavily dependent on taxpayers\u2019 money, while Network Rail\u2019s net debt has quadrupled since its creation. \u201cWe need a successful privatisation model to wean the industry off state support.\u201d But Lilian Greenwood, shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThis report makes it clear that breaking up Network Rail would be a recipe for higher fares, reduced spending on safety and even line closures. \u201cMore fragmentation and more privatisation are the last things that passengers need, but the Tories are considering dragging us back to the dark days of Railtrack. Ministers must unequivocally reject this report and abandon plans to privatise Network Rail.\u201d The Campaign for Better Transport branded the report \u201ccompletely out of step\u201d. Spokesman Martin Abrams said: \u201cPaving over Britain\u2019s railways or cutting all public funding, both of which are suggested by this report, are recipes for chaos, congestion and pollution, especially in our cities and towns. \u201cWhile there is certainly room for improvement within Network Rail, no one should forget the disaster that was Railtrack and the appalling number of fatalities on Britain\u2019s railways during that time. \u201cRather than repeating the mistakes of the past, and give any credence to this outdated anti-rail report, the government should support a strong, accountable national body to manage the network and allow more devolved decision-making to link rail with strategic land-use planning and the needs of passengers and communities.\u201d Full renationalisation of rail is more popular with the public. A recent poll by Survation showed 59% oppose privatising Network Rail. The government commissioned the Shaw review in the wake of cost overruns in Network Rail\u2019s five-year plan, which led to the shelving of major upgrade projects, and growing concerns over its \u00a338bn debt.",
