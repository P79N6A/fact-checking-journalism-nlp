      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green will have to make a generous offer to rescue the BHS pension scheme if he wants to save his reputation and knighthood, MPs have warned after a fiery six-hour hearing with the billionaire retail tycoon. Green promised to resolve the problems facing the pension scheme and apologised for the collapse of the department store chain during an extraordinary parliamentary meeting that ran from just after 9am until 3pm. The tycoon, who declined to provide details about his rescue plan, repeatedly clashed with MPs during the hearing, castigating Richard Fuller, the Conservative MP, for staring at him in a \u201creally disturbing\u201d way and accusing committee chairman Iain Wright of being \u201creally rude\u201d. At one stage he told MPs: \u201cI want to try to get back to work after this, I have been out of work for four weeks.\u201d MPs are now planning to call Green\u2019s wife, Lady Green, to give evidence. Monaco-based Tina Green owns the family\u2019s business interests, including Arcadia, the parent company of Topshop, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins. Trade union leaders said Green\u2019s apology was \u201csimply not enough\u201d for the 11,000 workers who face losing their jobs due to the collapse of BHS. \u201cThere are still serious questions that need to be answered and we hope the select committees take up Sir Philip\u2019s offer to scrutinise his finance team,\u201d John Hannett, the Usdaw general secretary, said. BHS is being wound down after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving it with a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until March 2015, during which time the tycoon and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments. Green sold BHS to Dominic Chappell, a three-time bankrupt whose consortium, Retail Acquisitions, extracted at least \u00a317m from the retailer. Green told MPs: \u201cNothing is more sad than how this has ended. There is certainly no intent at all on my part for anything to be like this, and it didn\u2019t need to be like this. I just want to apologise to all the BHS people who have been involved in this.\u201d The 64-year-old insisted that the financial structure of BHS during his tenure in charge was \u201cnot excessive\u201d and claimed that between 2004 and 2015 as much as \u00a3800m had been pumped into the business. \u201cWe put all that back into the business and more,\u201d he said of the shareholder payments. Green also said he had a \u201cclear conscience\u201d over the tax structure of his businesses. \u201cWe have run these things properly and paid everything due,\u201d he stated. The tycoon said the sale to Chappell had been an \u201chonest mistake\u201d. \u201cI made a bad call selling this business to RAL [Retail Acquisitions]. We found the wrong guy,\u201d he said. Green denied Chappell\u2019s claims that he had pushed BHS into administration by blocking a rescue deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct. He claimed to have had \u201cno involvement in that deal whatsoever\u201d initially, but then offered to pay a \u201cfew million\u201d to top up Ashley\u2019s offer when he found out. However, while insisting the demise of BHS was \u201cmy fault\u201d, Green also pointed the finger at the pension trustees, the Pensions Regulator, Goldman Sachs and Chappell\u2019s advisers, Grant Thornton and Olswang. Green said that he \u201cone million per cent would not have done business\u201d with Chappell if he had not passed an informal vetting by Goldman Sachs. He also said Grant Thornton and Olswang had given Chappell \u201ccredibility\u201d by representing him, and had collected more than \u00a38m from the deal. Green alleged that both firms had worked for Chappell \u201con contingency\u201d, implying the size of their fee depended on whether the deal happened. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know him from a hole in the wall,\u201d he claimed to MPs. Green accused Olswang of helping Chappell to extract \u00a37m from the \u00a332m sale of BHS\u2019s offices at North West House in London. This was a \u201cblatant breach of covenant,\u201d he said, because Chappell had agreed not to extract money from BHS when he bought it from Green. \u201cThis is \u00a37m that went missing,\u201d the Arcadia boss said. Green also said that \u201cstupid, idiotic mistakes\u201d had been made about the pension scheme and the trustees should have approached him earlier about restructuring it. However, he said the problems facing the BHS scheme are \u201cresolvable and sortable\u201d. Green pledged to find a solution that involves BHS workers getting a better deal than if the scheme entered the Pension Protection Fund, where they would suffer a 10% cut to their benefits. \u201cWe will sort it, we will find a solution,\u201d Green said. \u201cI want to give assurance to the 20,000 pensioners that I am here to sort this, in the correct way. We are working on it. As we speak there is a team currently working. It is in motion.\u201d Green declined to provide details about the potential rescue plan. However, MPs said he needs to make a \u201cvery generous\u201d offer. In a joint statement after the hearing, Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions committee, and Iain Wright, chairman of the business, innovation and skills committee, said: \u201cWe hope he will come up with an offer that is satisfactory to the Pension Regulator. However, he doesn\u2019t only have to satisfy the Pensions Regulator \u2013 today he is before the bar of public opinion. Much of his reputation now depends on how generously he responds.\u201d Field said that \u201ca lot of credibility now rests on a very generous settlement\u201d from Green. The Labour MP said the retail tycoon\u2019s evidence suggested he had \u201cjust gone through the worst four weeks of his life\u201d and that to win over public opinion, which was clearly important to Green, the payment of \u00a3571m would be \u201cquite cheap\u201d. Field agreed a deal with Green that his wife would not be called if he made an appearance. But Wright said he had not signed up to that deal and hinted that she could yet be called. \u201cWe are very interested in corporate governance and ownership structure,\u201d he said. The Pensions Regulator said claims from Green that it had not engaged with him and his advisers about a restructuring of the BHS pension scheme were \u201cnot true\u201d. The regulator added: \u201cOur door is always open to discuss credible proposals and we have made initial contact with Sir Philip\u2019s advisers to remind them of this point following comments that we have not engaged with them. We cannot comment further at this stage. \u201cWe will consider any credible and reasonable proposals that are put to us but we have not received details of any new proposal from Sir Philip Green or his advisers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has been criticised for cutting the pay of approximately 10% of its shop-floor workers by removing premiums for working Sundays and antisocial hours and trimming back bank holiday payments. The retailer plans to increase basic pay for its 69,000 shop-floor workers by 15% from next April to \u00a38.50 an hour but has offset the cost of doing so by cutting special pay rates. The changes, announced last month, will give a boost to the majority of staff but long-serving workers \u2013 who previously enjoyed premiums for working after 9pm and on Sundays and bank holidays \u2013 will lose out. Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh said some staff members would lose up to \u00a32,000 a year as a result of the changes. \u201cThis is not just any pay cut. This is a big fat M&amp;S pay cut,\u201d she said. Calling on the prime minister during question time in parliament to close loopholes which made such changes possible, McDonagh said: \u201c11,000 of M&amp;S\u2019s most loyal employees, many with over 14 years service, are about to get a serious pay cut \u2013 cuts to Sunday, bank holiday and antisocial hours pay, all made on the back of the national living wage, means they\u2019ll take home less next year than they do this year.\u201d M&amp;S said the planned pay rise would give its staff one of the highest hourly rates in UK retail alongside one of the best benefits packages. All staff affected by the change are to get a one-off compensation payment to ensure they are not financially affected for the first two years of the change. A spokesperson for Marks &amp; Spencer said: \u201cWe believe our proposed new approach to pay and premiums would reward our people in a fair and consistent way, simplify and modernise our business and help us attract and retain the best talent so we can continue to provide great service for our customers. The proposals include one of highest pay rates and one of the best benefit packages in UK retail. We will now consult with our colleagues and listen carefully to their feedback. \u201cWe would reward our people in a fair and consistent way, simplify and modernise our business and help us attract and retain the best talent so we can continue to provide great service.\u201d David Cameron said he had not seen details of the pay changes at M&amp;S but wanted to see the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, a new minimum wage for over-25s, feed through into \u201chigher take home pay, not lower take home pay \u2026 We would urge all companies to make sure that is the case,\u201d he said. The government faces pressure to crack down on companies offsetting rises in basic pay by removing other benefits. In recent months, a string of firms, from fish factories in Grimsby to coffee shops in central London, have withdrawn overtime, Sunday pay, bonuses, free food and paid breaks in order to keep the wage bill down. Major retailers including Tesco, Morrisons and B&amp;Q have faced protests over implementing cuts to benefits alongside increases in basic pay. McDonagh is campaigning to persuade the government to prevent such changes by, for example, insisting that staff are paid for the legally required 20-minute break in a six-hour shift.",

      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve announced it would not raise interest rates on Wednesday afternoon, blaming uncertainty over the UK\u2019s potential exit from the EU and slowing economic growth for the decision. The Fed has kept rates at close to zero since the recession. In December it raised them a quarter percentage point for the first time since 2006 and indicated more rises would come, a decision the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, was quizzed on during today\u2019s press conference. Yellen said she did not believe raising rates had led to the current slowdown in growth. Yellen also said that after a two-day meeting the looming Brexit \u2013 the UK\u2019s referendum on whether to leave the EU \u2013 had pushed the Fed\u2019s committee members to put a further rise on hold. \u201cBrexit, the upcoming UK decision on whether or not to leave the European Union, is something we discussed, and I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s one of the factors that factored into today\u2019s decisions,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cClearly this is a very important decision for the United Kingdom and for Europe. It is a decision that could have consequences for global financial markets. It could have consequences in turn for the US economic outlook.\u201d The Fed also announced its calculations that US economic growth will slow for the rest of the year and remain flat through 2018. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), chaired by Yellen, also reduced its interest rate projections for 2017 and 2018. The decision not to raise rates was applauded by Washington DC thinktank the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged was the right one,\u201d wrote policy director Josh Bivens. \u201cThere is no sign in the economic data that a durable acceleration in inflationary pressures is brewing and needs to be stopped by the Fed beginning to slow the economy.\u201d Bivens called \u201cthe still-damaged labor market\u201d a drag on the US economy. \u201cThe committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run,\u201d said the committee in a statement. \u201cHowever, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.\u201d Expectations for a rate rise fell after the May jobs report was released. The US added just 38,000 new jobs, according to the Department of Labor. It was the second straight month of disappointing jobs growth, and in unexpected ways. Though weak exports and lower energy prices were predictable, other factors were not: \u201cBusiness investment outside of energy was particularly weak during the winter and appears to have remained so during the spring,\u201d she said. Still, Yellen was optimistic: \u201cI don\u2019t expect that progress in the labor market has come to an end,\u201d she told reporters.",

      "bodyText": "This week we learned that the directors of the housebuilding company Persimmon are to share a bonus of \u00a3600m (Executive pay is obscene \u2013 restructuring the economy is the only way to curb it, G2, 14 June). This revelation was greeted with calls for these executives to \u201cshow restraint\u201d, given the ongoing shortage of affordable housing. After all, as the Conservative party tells us, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d. I was reminded of an earlier campaign to encourage the rich to show restraint and demonstrate solidarity with the people disadvantaged by government policy. I\u2019m thinking of events in 1795, when wheat prices in England rose precipitously. Working people relied on bread, and spent a significant percentage of household income on it. Concerned that the high cost of bread would cause hardship, and that hardship might lead to unrest, MPs called on the wealthy to show restraint. Gentlemen up and down the country signed pledges and issued public statements affirming that until prices fell they and their households would eat more economical wholegrain breads, and would not use scarce grain for non-essential purposes such as in hair powder. The artist James Gillray illustrated the effect of this policy in his cartoon \u201cSubstitutes for Bread\u201d. It depicts the prime minister William Pitt, together with other politicians, showing restraint. On the wall is a sign calling for \u201ca general fast in order to avert the impending famine\u201d. Another lists suitable substitutes for bread: venison, roast beef, champagne, turtle soup\u2026 Outside the window, a hungry crowd waves placards denouncing the government\u2019s hypocritical claims of solidarity. Gillray\u2019s critique from two centuries ago seems dismayingly relevant. Professor Rebecca Earle Department of history, University of Warwick \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s article (Less free market, more freeloaders. How Britain bails out the business chiefs, 14 June) is an awful indictment of the way some \u201ccompany executives are rewarded for cannibalising their businesses and bilking their staff\u201d. The Companies Act of 2006 states in paragraph 172 (1) that \u201cA director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard (amongst other matters) to (a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term; (b) the interests of the company\u2019s employees \u2026 (e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and (f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company.\u201d Clearly some company executives have violated these principles. Is there no redress in law? Michael Bassey Coddington, Nottinghamshire \u2022 We must stop idolising business owners who are relying on taxpayers, driving down wages, and pushing people and families into poverty. The real business superheroes are those leading the 70,000 social enterprises across the UK. Research shows that 74% of social enterprises pay the living wage, as accredited by the Living Wage Foundation \u2013 not the lower \u201cnational living wage\u201d introduced more recently by the government. Social enterprises reduce the need for wages to be topped up by the public purse. They also pay their taxes and reinvest their profits. Last week Welsh Water announced that it will offer a \u00a332m windfall to its customers, reducing their bills. This is what is possible when companies are free of the shackles of profit-hungry shareholders. These businesses are not too good to be true. They have the promise to make capitalism great again, and to reduce the gulf between rich and poor. Britain\u2019s future business leaders are choosing social enterprise, which has three times the startup rate of mainstream SMEs. But their entrepreneurial efforts will be stifled unless our policymakers take great strides to nurture and support their growth. Peter Holbrook Chief executive, Social Enterprise UK \u2022 I\u2019m not sure the moral crisis in capitalism is new (Editorial, 13 June). Businesses have been buying organisations and extracting their value for generations \u2013 it used to be called \u201casset stripping\u201d. Today we are seeing the same behaviour in the public education sector. We are frequently told by businessmen that their sole duty is to maximise shareholder value (except by moderating their own salaries). As marketing departments will tell you, the only reason for appearing to be socially responsible is if it will increase profits, and then only with the minimum investment. Similarly, for the company, donating to politicians and political parties is only for the purpose of having laws changed to their benefit \u2013 ideally legalising what is unethical. There used to be the idea that the difference between the public and private sectors is that, because it is providing a socially essential service, if the former fails it will need to be rescued, therefore the risk of failure is not a motivation to meet the needs of the customer. The whole point of social democratic government is to keep the excesses of capitalism under control while maximising the benefits. Let\u2019s forget the political pragmatism of recent governments and go back to the principles of democracy.

I\u2019m thinking of events in 1795, when wheat prices in England rose precipitously. Working people relied on bread, and spent a significant percentage of household income on it. Concerned that the high cost of bread would cause hardship, and that hardship might lead to unrest, MPs called on the wealthy to show restraint. Gentlemen up and down the country signed pledges and issued public statements affirming that until prices fell they and their households would eat more economical wholegrain breads, and would not use scarce grain for non-essential purposes such as in hair powder.</p> <p>The artist James Gillray illustrated the effect of this policy in his cartoon \u201c<a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=46677001&amp;objectId=1478808&amp;partId=1\" title=\"\">Substitutes for Bread</a>\u201d. It depicts the prime minister William Pitt, together with other politicians, showing restraint. On the wall is a sign calling for \u201ca general fast in order to avert the impending famine\u201d. Another lists suitable substitutes for bread: venison, roast beef, champagne, turtle soup\u2026 Outside the window, a hungry crowd waves placards denouncing the government\u2019s hypocritical claims of solidarity. Gillray\u2019s critique from two centuries ago seems dismayingly relevant.<br><strong>Professor Rebecca Earle</strong><br><em>Department of history, University of Warwick</em></p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/14/freeloaders-free-market-britain-business-taxpayer-philip-green\" title=\"\">Less free market, more freeloaders.

Is there no redress in law? <br><strong>Michael Bassey</strong><br><em>Coddington, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 We must stop idolising business owners who are relying on taxpayers, driving down wages, and pushing people and families into poverty. The real business superheroes are those leading the 70,000 social enterprises across the UK.</p> <p>Research shows that 74% of social enterprises pay the living wage, as accredited by the Living Wage Foundation \u2013 not the lower \u201cnational living wage\u201d introduced more recently by the government. Social enterprises reduce the need for wages to be topped up by the public purse. They also pay their taxes and reinvest their profits.

They have the promise to make capitalism great again, and to reduce the gulf between rich and poor.

Businesses have been buying organisations and extracting their value for generations \u2013 it used to be called \u201casset stripping\u201d. Today we are seeing the same behaviour in the public education sector. We are frequently told by businessmen that their sole duty is to maximise shareholder value (except by moderating their own salaries). As marketing departments will tell you, the only reason for appearing to be socially responsible is if it will increase profits, and then only with the minimum investment. Similarly, for the company, donating to politicians and political parties is only for the purpose of having laws changed to their benefit \u2013 ideally legalising what is unethical.</p> <p>There used to be the idea that the difference between the public and private sectors is that, because it is providing a socially essential service, if the former fails it will need to be rescued, therefore the risk of failure is not a motivation to meet the needs of the customer.</p> <p>The whole point of social democratic government is to keep the excesses of capitalism under control while maximising the benefits.

It missed out on the Argos owner, Home Retail, which went to Sainsbury\u2019s; French electricals chain Darty also slipped away. But now Christo Wiese, Steinhoff\u2019s majority shareholder, is taken by the splendours of Poundland. He\u2019s bought a 15% stake from private equity outfit Warburg Pincus and is contemplating a full bid. Wiese gets top marks for opportunism. Poundland\u2019s share price has fallen sharply since the takeover of 99p Stores, which was a simple deal on paper but less so in practice. Investors worry whether that the UK is now awash with general-merchandise discount shops. And, in Warburg Pincus, Steinhoff identified a large and loose piece on the shareholder register. An offer around Wednesday\u2019s closing share price of 200p \u2013 up almost a third on the level at the start of the week \u2013 would probably succeed. But what\u2019s Steinhoff grand strategy? Its UK portfolio includes Benson for Beds; home furnishing chain Harveys; and stakes in gym firm Virgin Active and clothing retailer New Look. It\u2019s a disjointed collection, and will be odder still if Poundland arrives. One can understand the desire to expand out of South Africa and earn profits in a currency that is more solid than the rand. But a general splurge on unconnected European retailers looks a very unsophisticated strategy. It\u2019s baffling.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland has been targeted for a takeover by Steinhoff, the South African retail conglomerate that owns Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK. Shares in the British discount retail chain rose 2% to 200p on Wednesday, valuing the company at more than \u00a3530m, after Steinhoff said it was considering making an offer. The rise followed a 27% jump in Poundland shares on Tuesday, driven by speculation about a bid. The move is the latest by the billionaire Christo Wiese to take a share of the UK\u2019s burgeoning discount market. Wiese, who owns a 17% stake in Steinhoff, also has stakes in the cut-price fashion chain New Look and the grocer Iceland, and an investment in the Virgin Active gym chain via his Brait investment vehicle. Steinhoff attempted to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, this year, but withdrew after looking over the company\u2019s books in the face of competition from Sainsbury\u2019s. It is also backing the former Asda boss Andy Bond\u2019s two nascent discount chains Pep &amp; Co and Guess How Much!, which have more than 50 stores between them. Steinhoff revealed on Wednesday that it had amassed a 22.78% stake in Poundland, in effect confirming that it was the buyer of most of a 15.3% stake sold by the US private equity house Warburg Pincus, Poundland\u2019s biggest shareholder. The sale was revealed on Tuesday. The South African group said it was \u201cconsidering a possible offer\u201d for Poundland, which would be made in cash. \u201cThere can be no certainty that any offer will be made and a further announcement will be made as appropriate,\u201d the company said in a follow-up to an early morning statement, which it said had been made without Poundland\u2019s consent. Under takeover rules, Steinhoff has a deadline of 5pm on 13 July to announce a firm intention to make a bid for Poundland or walk away. Poundland issued a brief statement in response to Steinhoff\u2019s approach, urging investors to do nothing. It said: \u201cPoundland shareholders are strongly advised to take no action. The company will issue a further statement if and when appropriate. \u201cThere can be no certainty that a firm offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which any firm offer might be made. This announcement is being made by Poundland without the prior agreement or approval of Steinhoff.\u201d Poundland will publish its results on Thursday for the year ending 27 March 2016. Steinhoff\u2019s approach comes at a difficult time for Poundland, which admitted in April that sales had been hit by the \u00a355m purchase of its loss-making rival 99p Stores. It is also grappling with dwindling numbers of shoppers on Britain\u2019s high streets and competition from supermarkets which are in the throes of a fierce price war. The company\u2019s long-term chief executive, Jim McCarthy, also stepped down in April to be replaced by the former B&amp;Q executive Kevin O\u2019Byrne. With the takeover of 99p Stores complete after a six-month investigation by the competition regulator, Poundland has more than 900 stores in the UK and Ireland. The Competition and Markets Authority allowed the takeover to go ahead after dropping earlier objections that a deal would be bad for customers, reducing competition in more than 90 locations. Ultimately, however, the CMA concluded that low-price retailing was established in the UK and that the combined company would meet competition from Poundworld, Wilko, B&amp;M and other value chains, as well as Tesco and Asda among the supermarkets. Steinhoff operates in Europe, Africa and Australasia, selling household goods, clothing, footwear and homeware and focuses on the budget end of the market. It is listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, with a secondary listing in Johannesburg, and a market value of about \u20ac20bn (\u00a316bn). It employs about 105,000 people. Steinhoff\u2019s pursuit of Poundland is its third attempt this year to buy a European retailer. After losing out to Sainsbury\u2019s in the battle to buy Home Retail Group, it also abandoned attempts to buy the French retailer Darty.",

The rise followed a 27% jump in Poundland shares on Tuesday, driven by speculation about a bid.</p> <p>The move is the latest by the billionaire Christo Wiese to take a share of the UK\u2019s burgeoning discount market. Wiese, who owns a 17% stake in Steinhoff, also has stakes in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/15/new-look-deal-south-african-tycoon\">cut-price fashion chain New Look</a> and the grocer Iceland, and an investment in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/16/virgin-active-stake-sold-to-south-africas-brait\">Virgin Active gym chain</a> via his Brait investment vehicle.</p> <p>Steinhoff attempted to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, this year, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/18/sainsburys-rival-steinhoff-pulls-out-of-race-for-home-retail-group\">withdrew after looking over the company\u2019s books</a> in the face of competition from Sainsbury\u2019s. It is also backing the former Asda boss Andy Bond\u2019s two nascent discount chains Pep &amp; Co and Guess How Much!, which have more than 50 stores between them.</p> <p>Steinhoff revealed on Wednesday that it had amassed a 22.78% stake in Poundland, in effect confirming that it was the buyer of most of a 15.3% stake sold by the US private equity house Warburg Pincus, Poundland\u2019s biggest shareholder. The sale was revealed on Tuesday. </p> <p>The South African group said it was \u201cconsidering a possible offer\u201d for Poundland, which would be made in cash. \u201cThere can be no certainty that any offer will be made and a further announcement will be made as appropriate,\u201d the company said in a follow-up to an early morning statement, which it said had been made without Poundland\u2019s consent. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bcccd631108aa6b14b10c3eaddf5ee3bf4c5d78d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcccd631108aa6b14b10c3eaddf5ee3bf4c5d78d/546_0_1566_1957/800.jpg\" alt=\"Billionaire businessman Christo Wiese.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billionaire businessman Christo Wiese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under takeover rules, Steinhoff has a deadline of 5pm on 13 July to announce a firm intention to make a bid for Poundland or walk away.</p> <p>Poundland issued a brief statement in response to Steinhoff\u2019s approach, urging investors to do nothing. It said: \u201cPoundland shareholders are strongly advised to take no action. The company will issue a further statement if and when appropriate.</p> <p>\u201cThere can be no certainty that a firm offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which any firm offer might be made. This announcement is being made by Poundland without the prior agreement or approval of Steinhoff.\u201d</p> <p>Poundland will publish its results on Thursday for the year ending 27 March 2016.</p> <p>Steinhoff\u2019s approach comes at a difficult time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/poundland-admits-buying-rival-99p-stores-hit-sales\">Poundland, which admitted in April that sales had been hit by the \u00a355m purchase of its loss-making rival 99p Stores</a>. It is also grappling with dwindling numbers of shoppers on Britain\u2019s high streets and competition from supermarkets which are in the throes of a fierce price war.

It employs about 105,000 people. </p> <p>Steinhoff\u2019s pursuit of Poundland is its third attempt this year to buy a European retailer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/18/sainsburys-rival-steinhoff-pulls-out-of-race-for-home-retail-group\">After losing out to Sainsbury\u2019s in the battle to buy Home Retail Group,</a> it also abandoned attempts to buy the French retailer Darty.</p>",

The banking experts at investment management and research group Bernstein said Barclays would be hardest hit, falling 40% over 18 months. The bank has the highest exposure to London and the investment banking sector, which the Bernstein analysts said would suffer a \u201ctank\u201d in revenues. The share prices of the two bailed-out banks \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 could take a hit of 35% and 25% respectively, according to the analysts\u2019 research. Bernstein predicts rising unemployment, a slide in sterling and falling house prices in the event of a decision to leave the European Union. The well-regarded City firm said it was publishing the research because of market movements as a result of bookmakers upgrading the likelihood of the UK leaving the EU from 25% to 40%. Earlier this week, analysts at Jefferies concluded that Barclays\u2019 shares had the most to gain from a remain vote \u2013 and most to lose from a leave vote. \u201cBarclays is the most geared to the outcome of the referendum based on our analysis. We retain a buy on Barclays and note that its fundamentals are also likely to be the most directly impacted by the referendum result, given a large investment bank and broad corporate banking presence,\u201d the Jefferies research team said. The Bernstein analysts do not expect banks to have to embark on significant cash calls in the way they did after 2008. Referring to the global financial crisis caused by the 2008 banking crash, the Bernstein analysts said: \u201cThe UK banks today hold the highest level of capital in their history \u2013 helped by a regulatory push post the global financial crisis to counter the very real risks that Brexit brings.\u201d However, the analysts said dividend payouts to shareholders would be \u201ctoast\u201d. Shares in HSBC, which has warned it would move jobs to France if the UK voted to leave the EU, could fall by between 15% and 20%, the Bernstein analysts said. Standard Chartered, listed in London but with its operations overseas, would not be affected. The Bernstein research, which was published as Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, also pointed to the possible impact on bank shares. \u201cIt is clear that no other segment of the UK equity market is more vulnerable to a Brexit than UK-domiciled banks,\u201d he said. \u201cEven after considering the economic slowdown, negative interest rates and fragile financial markets, shares of UK-based banks in the FTSE 100 index are down 36% on average in the past year. Since the recent highs in mid-May, shares have gone down again as surveys on average point to strength for the leave campaign.\u201d Garnry said Brexit would change everything for the City as the UK\u2019s influence would be reduced. The Bernstein analysts said that, in the short term, sterling would fall 15% to 20% and unemployment would rise. \u201cJust to lay it out straight for a hugely contentious issue in the UK, this note is not about the longer-term implications on the decision if the UK votes out \u2013 that\u2019s hard to arrive at today,\u201d the Bernstein analysts said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "1. Green is working on a plan to sort out the BHS pension scheme The billionaire businessman revealed there had been contact with the Pensions Regulator in recent days, adding (snidely): \u201cThe regulator made a phone call - maybe someone bought them a telephone.\u201d However, his comments seem to make it difficult for him not to agree a pensions deal from here. \u201cThere does seem to be a light in the tunnel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to find a solution for the 20,000 pensioners\u201d. No detail, though. 2. Green says he put money into BHS The tycoon said \u00a3254m was invested in BHS in the early days of his ownership. After 2009 his Arcadia empire loaned \u00a3250m, interest free, plus another \u00a3100m in additional capital. In total, he said, Arcadia ploughed \u00a3600m into BHS in the years between taking out \u00a3400m in dividends and selling to Dominic Chappell in 2015. 3. Green suggested Chappell\u2019s lawyers, Olswang, were on a success fee Chappell was a bankrupt with no track record of business success when he acquired the retailer. Green said Olswang, a respected City law firm, was paid on contingency, suggesting it received fees only if Chappell\u2019s acquisition of BHS went through. That would be troubling, as Olswang, whose presence gave Chappell a lot of his credibility, would have had little incentive to expose its client\u2019s obvious weaknesses. 4. Chappell breached covenants within days of buying the retailer Green said \u00a37m \u2013 part of the proceeds of a property deal \u2013 had been earmarked for BHS, and that Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium said it had been transferred to the Bank of China to help set up a \u00a3100m loan for the retailer. Green added that he had since discovered that the \u00a37m then arrived at Olswang and that \u00a31.2m of it was paid to the law firm, \u00a31.2m to accountants Grant Thornton, and \u00a31.8m to Chappell. This, the billionaire claimed, meant that within days of buying the retailer, Olswang had helped Chappell breach one of the deal\u2019s covenants, supposedly preventing Chappell from taking money out of BHS. 5. Green would not have sold BHS to Chappell if Chappell had not passed Goldman Sachs\u2019 smell test Green said he was not going to blame anybody, but then tried to shift the focus to many other figures. Would he have sold to Chappell if Goldman Sachs had not approved him? \u201cA million per cent no,\u201d Green said. 6. Green said he did not block a Sports Direct rescue deal or stop Chappell from seeing the Pensions Regulator Chappell, who was described at a previous session by BHS management as a \u201cPremier League liar\u201d, raised these allegations during his hearing. Green said both claims were untrue, adding it was inconceivable that he could have stopped Chappell going to the regulator. 7. The BHS pension fund paid large fees to its advisers In an attempt to deflect criticism that the BHS pension fund was in surplus when Green acquired the business, he pointed out that a lot of money was paid by the fund to pension advisers: \u00a3650,000 in the early days, rising to \u201cnorth of \u00a31.5m\u201d by 2005-06, he said. 8. Green moved to Monaco for health reasons It has long been assumed that Green moved to Monaco for wealth reasons. It turns out they were health reasons. The retailer said he and his family left the country in 1998 after he had a heart scare. \u201cSomeone\u201d then suggested Monaco would be a good place to recuperate. He later returned to the UK to work, leaving his family behind. 9. Green\u2019s personality The retailer\u2019s manner in front of the committee was not really surprising to anybody who has dealt with him, but it would have been fascinating for those who are not familiar with his way. He often interrupted and spoke over MPs\u2019 questions and visibly bristled when proceedings displeased him. 10. Green feels he has something to apologise for Despite Green\u2019s personality traits, and efforts to deflect criticism on to others, he did acknowledge he was at least partly at fault. \u201cI just want to apologise to all the BHS people,\u201d he said. He later added that most of them were part-timers who would probably soon get other jobs.",

Green said both claims were untrue, adding it was inconceivable that he could have stopped Chappell going to the regulator.</p> <h2><strong>7. The BHS pension fund paid large fees to its advisers</strong></h2> <p>In an attempt to deflect criticism that the BHS pension fund was in surplus when Green acquired the business, he pointed out that a lot of money was paid by the fund to pension advisers: \u00a3650,000 in the early days, rising to \u201cnorth of \u00a31.5m\u201d by 2005-06, he said.</p> <h2><strong>8. Green moved to Monaco for health reasons</strong></h2> <p>It has long been assumed that Green moved to Monaco for wealth reasons. It turns out they were health reasons. The retailer said he and his family left the country in 1998 after he had a heart scare. \u201cSomeone\u201d then suggested Monaco would be a good place to recuperate. He later returned to the UK to work, leaving his family behind.</p> <h2><strong>9. Green\u2019s personality</strong></h2> <p>The retailer\u2019s manner in front of the committee was not really surprising to anybody who has dealt with him, but it would have been fascinating for those who are not familiar with his way. He often interrupted and spoke over MPs\u2019 questions and visibly bristled when proceedings displeased him. </p> <h2><strong>10. Green feels he has something to apologise for</strong></h2> <p>Despite Green\u2019s personality traits, and efforts to deflect criticism on to others, he did acknowledge he was at least partly at fault. \u201cI just want to apologise to all the BHS people,\u201d he said. He later added that most of them were part-timers who would probably soon get other jobs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "That was the longest and most confrontational parliamentary session I\u2019ve covered over the last decade. Sir Philip Green went into the grilling vowing to put his side of the story, and he took every opportunity to do so \u2013 interrupting MPs, refusing to answer questions he didn\u2019t fancy, and taking criticism extremely badly. Broadly, his position is that some mistakes were made, but it\u2019s not really his fault. He doesn\u2019t want to blame anyone else, but managed to blame pretty much everyone who had a role in this fiasco - advisers, the pension regulator and even journalists. He seemed particularly irked with City firms Olswang and Grant Thornton for representing Dominic Chappell, suggesting they provided a sheen of respectability. That\u2019s a pretty poor excuse for not realising that the ex-bankrupt racing driver might not be the best person to buy BHS. Green did at least apologise, nice and early in the session, and admit he should never have sold the company to Chappell for \u00a31. But he also claimed that recent criticism was \u201cwholly\u201d unfair, and even blamed \u201cenvy and jealousy\u201d for the dividends which moved from BHS to his luxury base in Monaco. Green is entitled to his point of view, but perhaps he should save the lectures until the BHS pension deficit has been fixed. The committee struggled to land many punches on Green over the financial details of the BHS farrago. That\u2019s because the Arcadia chief had a two-pronged strategy; he either produced his own figures to challenge the MPs, or claimed he simply didn\u2019t get involved with whatever they were asking about. For example, the sale of BHS\u2019s Ealing store to his stepson. Instead, Green preferred to focus on other wrong-doing - such as Chappell\u2019s apparent breach of the covenants set up to protect BHS. Green did have the excuse that his wife, Lady Christina, actually owns Arcadia\u2019s assets. Did the committee call the wrong Green? Perhaps Tina should sail one of the family\u2019s yachts up the Thames and testify herself.... BHS pensioners did get one piece of good news - Green\u2019s pledge to address the pension black hole. He said: \u201cI want to give an assurance to the 20,000 [BHS] pensioners that I am there to sort this, in the correct way.\u201d However, Green did not promise to ensure they would receive their full entitlement; instead, it might just be better than taking a cut in the Payment Protection Fund. Green was also rather hazy about how the scheme fell into such a mess, insisting that he\u2019d not bled the company dry but had actually invested capital in it. Green\u2019s aggressive attitude seemed to stun MPs at first; he slammed one member for excessive staring, and snarled \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this\u201d when asked a pretty fair question about whether he\u2019d deliberately offloaded BHS\u2019s pension liabilities. After a while they began to suspect that it might hold the key to the crisis. The committee may well conclude that the BHS disaster might have been averted if Arcadia\u2019s chairman had been more open to criticism. A corporate governance problem, indeed. Green also showed that he\u2019s not at the cutting edge of technology \u2013 we got a glimpse of his antiquated Nokia mobile phone, after he failed to turn it off following a break. Some younger viewers may have been baffled by the small booklet he waved at MPs at one stage; that\u2019s called a cheque book, kids. And Green may well have to get it out again, and write a nine-figure sum to patch up the black hole in BHS\u2019s pension. That\u2019s all from me today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight. GW Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension trustees, has told Sky News that he hopes Green will make an offer that means pensioners will receive more than they\u2019d get through the Pension Protection Fund. And that means Green stumping up more than \u00a3100m, Martin adds. Here\u2019s a snap of Green leaving the Houses of Parliament after being questioned by MPs today. I missed this earlier, but there was a small protest outside parliament, urging Green to save his reputation and cover the BHS pension black hole. Iain Wright and Frank Field have issued a statement, warning Green that he may have to dig deep into his pocket to satisfy public anger over the collapse of BHS. The two MPs also warn Green that he may have to answer further questions: \u201cWe thank Sir Philip for giving us six hours of evidence in Parliament today, and we were pleased to hear that he is still trying to put together a better deal for the BHS pensioners. We hope he will come up with an offer that is satisfactory to The Pension Regulator. However, he doesn\u2019t only have to satisfy The Pensions Regulator, today he is before the bar of public opinion. Much of his reputation now depends on how generously he responds. \u201cToday\u2019s evidence raised host of further questions and we first want to get much more detail on the structure of various companies, particularly those owned by Lady Cristina Green, the profits they have made and the tax they have paid. \u201cWe have more witnesses scheduled at the end of June and in the last few days we have received a huge amount of further evidence. We have many further questions for Sir Philip, particularly the big questions on the pension fund that he was unable to answer today.\u201d Frank Field, head of the work and pensions committee, says that Sir Philip Green\u2019s credibility is now on the line. His reputation as a top business chief now hangs on his willingness to support BHS pensioners, says Field, speaking to my colleague Sarah Butler. The pension regulator has swiftly responded to Green\u2019s evidence. In a statement, it denies refusing to engage with Sir Philip Green. It also states that it hasn\u2019t received any \u201cnew proposals\u201d. And finally, as Big Ben rings 3pm, Green repeats his pledge to sit down with the pensions regulator and talk about the pension scheme. I want to get this over quicker than you do, he pledges. And he promises to do all he can to support any deal to save BHS. And that is finally the end of the meeting, after a near six-hour marathon. Q: With hindsight, do you think the offshore setup of your businesses is incompatible with the modern world? Green checks his pad for a prepared statement, and then pronounces Envy and jealousy are two incurable diseases. I have done nothing wrong. Green insists that his empire could have been structured much more aggressively to avoid tax. We have paid many, many hundreds of millions of pounds of tax. As far I am concerned I have a very clear conscience. We have paid everything due. Green suggests that he could, for example, have taken his fashion brands offshore and charged a royalty. Where we made money here, we paid tax here. Q: What lessons can we learn from the BHS failure, to help rebuild the public\u2019s trust in the capitalist system? Green say\u2019s he\u2019s immune to criticism after the last few weeks, which have meant he\u2019s been unable to visit his stores. Q: Do you feel hounded? The criticism has been wholly unbalanced and unfair, Green says, a little mournfully. I made a bad call selling this business to RAL [Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions], Green says. But other people made mistakes too, including lawyers, and now everyone says it\u2019s just my fault. I\u2019m a big boy, I can take a punch on the chin.... but I didn\u2019t do this deliberately, he concludes. Q: Do you think your reputation has been improved by today\u2019s session? Green declines to mark his own homework, but hopes that people understand what happened at BHS. I\u2019ve had quite a few supportive emails and texts from BHS staff, he adds. Q: What would you like your legacy to be, in a year\u2019s time? Green looks baffled, saying even he\u2019s not clever enough to undo the past. Then he talks about the work that Arcadia does in the fashion industry, encouraging young talent. \u201cAll people in BHS know I\u2019m honest and no way I would have wanted this kind of ending.\u201d In other words, he\u2019s not a bad guy, honest... Q: Would you consider buying BHS back if you could get the pension issue sorted? No, Green insists. Life has moved on. Not for the 11,000 staff at BHS, the committee point out. Q: So who are the winners from the BHS story? No-one, Green says, adding. I think it was a very sad episode. Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. Q: So who are the losers? That\u2019s easy, Green says. The staff and the pensioners. Green then confirms that he attended a meeting with Mike Ashley and the administrators on 27 April, at Arcadia\u2019s offices. He produces a letter from the administrator saying Arcadia offered to add \u00a35m to Sports Direct\u2019s bid for BHS and did not frustrate the deal. Q: So why did it fail? Because of one of these, says Green, producing his chequebook. And he denies that he did anything to block Mike Ashley from taking control On what possible basis would I want to stop someone buying BHS? \u201cEgo\u201d, says Iain Wright. Green looks *furious*. \u201cThat\u2019s really rude,\u201d he says, and out of order. He says Wright should apologise. Green starts to assembles his papers, muttering that he\u2019s glad the meeting is over. But it\u2019s not over quite yet The session turns rowdy, now, as Iain Wright probes Sports Direct\u2019s attempts to rescue BHS. He gets Philip Green to confirm that he didn\u2019t know Mike Ashley (Sports Direct\u2019s founder) was trying to sort out a deal. And Wright then produces a letter from Ashley, which states that the two men did have contact. Green tries to interrupt, telling Wright to stop bullying him (!) and claiming that he\u2019s in charge of what he says. Green then explains that he didn\u2019t know that Chappell held all-night talks on Thursday 21 April, until the Friday lunchtime Chappell asked Green for Ashley\u2019s phone number. He reveals that he then had a jokey conversation with Ashley, but insists that he has zero knowledge about the negotiations. Q: So how much contact did you have over the weekend? We may have spoken a few times, Green concedes. The committee turn to the events of April, when BHS went into administration. Green denies that he triggered it - even though he refused to accept that \u00a360m loan from Gordon Brothers. But then Iain Wright MP reads a letter from the administrators, Duff and Phelps, showing that Green has asked him to attend a meeting. Green explains that he was told on Friday 22 April that an unknown retailer was attempting a last-ditch rescue bid, but he didn\u2019t know who [I think this is Sports Direct]. But if it didn\u2019t transpire, he [Green] was concerned that staff wouldn\u2019t be paid the next week if a deal wasn\u2019t agreed. Green looks like he might mislay his rag, when asked to clarify his commitment to BHS pensioners. We covered that five and half hours ago, he says, before repeating that he will meet with the pension regulator and try to agree a deal. Green also explains that he wasn\u2019t prepared to support a \u00a360m loan from investment group Gordon Brothers which Chappell had lined up in the final days before BHS went under. It was a \u201cloan to own\u201d, says Green, as BHS would have breached it quickly.... meaning Gordon Brothers would have walked away with the business. Q: Dominic Chappell told us that he was shocked that you sold the BHS Ealing branch to your stepson, and he flipped it for a \u00a33.5m profit. Is that true? I wasn\u2019t involved in that deal, Green replies. It wasn\u2019t my transaction. Q: But did you know about it? Green doesn\u2019t give a particularly clear answer, but indicates he was aware the property was being sold. Q: Is it true that you initially told the regulator that you had not sold any assets to any interested parties, and then had to correct it once the Ealing sale came to light? Is which bit true, asks Green? Q: That you initially told the regulator that you had not sold any assets to any interested parties, and then had to correct it? Green says he doesn\u2019t know. Q: Well, could you help us check? Green says this line of questioning is \u201cludicrous\u201d. Q: Did you have regular talks to Chappell about weekly sales? No, says Green. Chappell wouldn\u2019t know what they were. Q: And you sold him the company... Don\u2019t remind me, Green grimaces. And he jokes: If you look Dominic Chappell up in the dictionary it says \u201cvery optimistic\u201d Q: Do what did you talk to Chappell about? I didn\u2019t want to the business to fail, Green insists, so he acted as a sounding board for Chappell\u2019s ideas. Green also disses Chappell\u2019s claims to be a property expert, saying he failed to cut a better deal with landlords. Chappell was also too slow to arrange the CVA [Company Voluntary Arrangement] which trimmed BHS\u2019s rent costs, Green adds. That stubbornness undermined the chances of turning BHS around. Green now wants the committee clerk to stop whispering to MPs during the session. It looks like Green uses an old-school Nokia handset... Suddenly, a mobile phone rings, disrupting the session....and it\u2019s Sir Phil\u2019s! Apologies, he says, I forgot to turn it off. It\u2018s the pensions regulator, jokes Iain Wright. The committee are back again for the final part of the session. Sir Philip Green seems quite chirpy still - maybe he can see the finishing line in sight. Jeremy Quin MP asks about the charges that he retained on BHS after selling it, which meant Arcadia was a preferred creditor. Green says that out of \u00a3256m of debt, \u00a3216m was written off when BHS was sold and a \u00a340m charge was retained. He says that he also agreed to released a fixed charge on one property, to help the new owners raise more money Q: So you had an umbilical connection... I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t accept that, Green interrupts, showing that thin-skinned side again. OK, the committee are taking another quick break for a vote, but they will be back shortly. Green would happily have finished the session right then. Green is arguing that he didn\u2019t realise that Chappell was unreliable... Green says one of the \u201clovely journalists in the room\u201d contributed to BHS\u2019s demise, by undermining Chappell\u2019s credibility each weekend. Those articles made it impossible to get credit insurance for BHS, he claims. I\u2019m pretty sure he means Oliver Shah of the Sunday Times, who has swiftly responded: Onto another curious property deal, the sale of North West House (a BHS asset sold in 2015). Green says that it was sold to \u00a332m, but only \u00a325m showed up in the BHS accounts. Arcadia were told that remaining \u00a37m had been transferred to the Bank of China, to help set up a \u00a3100m loan. He says that the \u00a37m then arrived at Chappell\u2019s lawyers, Olswang. But \u00a31.2m was then paid to Olswang, \u00a31.2m to Grant Thornton, \u00a31.8m to Chappell himself.... This, Green declares. means that Chappell breached a covenant which Arcadia had made him sign, to not take money out of the business (as our Sarah Butler reported earlier this month) Philip Green is getting ill-tempered again, as the committee ask how he compensated Chappell for the \u00a38.5m profit that he didn\u2019t get on the Marylebone House deal. He keep trying to sweep away questions he doesn\u2019t like the sound of. And Iain Wright MP has spotted a pattern - suggesting that Green\u2019s Arcadia Group has a serious corporate governance problem. That\u2019s your opinion, Green says. If you behaves like this in a parliamentary committee, it must be hard for directors to raise concerns at an Arcadia board meeting, suggests Richard Fuller MP. I\u2019m choosing to ignore that, says Green. Green confirms that he had planned to sell Marylebone House, BHS\u2019s HQ, to Chappell for \u00a335m. [This is a crucial point; Chappell had taken a \u00a335m loan from the Dellal family of property investors, and was planning to sell it onto them for \u00a345m]. Green suggests he didn\u2019t originally know Chappell was planning to turn a quick profit; even though \u00a38.5m of profits from the deal appear on the BHS term sheet. Q: So why did you change your mind and sell Marylebone House to someone else? Once word spread in the property market that we were selling it, we received better offers and realised it was worth more, Green replies. But.... Marylebone House was owned by Wilton Equity, an offshore group owned by Green\u2019s wife Lady Tina. And it emerged last week that the property was actually sold by Wilton, to Arcadia, reportedly yielding a profit of \u00a321m. The committee are now turning to the financial help which Sir Philip Green provided to Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions to help the BHS purchase go through. Conservative Richard Fuller says that Chappell\u2019s term sheet, which claimed to have \u00a3120m of funding, actually only had \u00a340m. So how did Green not spot the problems? Green repeats that he wasn\u2019t involved in the sale until he\u2019d been convinced that Chappell was genuine. Q: So is it a fair observation that a \u201cwrong \u2018un\u201d got through the system because you relied on advisers for all the detail? That\u2019s your observation, Green replies. But again, he\u2019s spreading the blame to other people...while claiming he\u2019s not blaming anyone..... Iain Wright MP then calls Green up for his refusal to say if any of his executives raised any concerns about the Chappell deal. You seem a dominant character, but also extraordinarily thin-skinned when asked quite courteous questions, Sir Philip .... This seems to prick the Arcadia boss: Wright\u2019s point is that some Arcadia lieutenants might have been scared to raise a red flag to the Chappell deal. Green adds that \u201cunfortunately, we found the wrong guy\u201d when they sold BHS to Dominic Chappell. What happened subsequently is \u201cbeyond horrible\u201d. Iain Wright MP tries to pin Green down. Q: Was good corporate governance followed in the sale of BHS? We\u2019re going this again, Green asks, incredulously. He says that Arcadia put good people on the sale -- they should have been able to do the right deal. Q: Are you still happy with Lord Grabiner (Arcadia\u2019s chairman, who didn\u2019t attend the meeting where BHS was sold)? Yes, Green insists. Grabiner is highly capable, and highly respected... \u201cwas\u201d, chips in one MP. Grabiner\u2019s reputation has changed, Sir Philip.... Green concedes that he shouldn\u2019t have sold BHS to Chappell, but insists that advisers -- both his and Chappell\u2019s \u2013 are to blame. Would I do that deal again, no. Am I sorry we did that deal, yes. Richard Graham MP calls up Green about his claim that Chappell lives in Fantasy Land... ..I never said that, claims Green, astonishingly. Yes you did, the MPs chorus. It\u2019ll be in the record (and the liveblog, five short minutes ago) Graham then tries to put another question about the decision to sell BHS with an unresolved pension deficit, and Green isn\u2019t happy at all. He repeats that he\u2019s going to find a solution, and blames the pension regulator. Sir, the regulator has never called me! Do you want me to write down my mobile phone number and email so you can pass it on? Green is now dishing out fashion advice to Jeremy Quin. The committee continue to push Sir Philip Green about exactly how closely he knew Dominic Chappell, and when. Green insists that he first met Chappell on February 3rd 2015. Q: Meet often socially before then? Green makes a \u201czero\u201d sign with his finger and thumb. Q: So why was Chappell telling his mates in 2014 that he was going to buy BHS? Was it a \u201cfantasy land\u201d idea? Green suggests Chappell is a permanent resident of fantasy land..... [Anyone know if Fantasy Land is a tax haven, ala Monaco?] Green may be getting more confident - he tells Richard Fuller to \u2018relax\u2019 and stop butting in. Q: Would you have done the BHS deal if Chappell hasn\u2019t passed Goldman Sachs\u2019 smell test? No, Green insists. A million percent no. But Richard Fuller MP suggests that Green must have had concerns -- otherwise why vet Chappell at all? Q: So will you deal with Goldman Sachs again? Green won\u2019t answer this question - saying he\u2019s not blaming anyone (?!). He defends choosing to sell to Chappell, as he didn\u2019t want to sell it to someone who would have put BHS into administration. If the business plan laid out in 2015 had been followed by the new owners, the company would have survived, he adds [Reminder: BHS\u2019s former finance officer also told the committee last week that BHS could have been saved, with better leadership from Chappell] Green denies that he blundered by not Googling Dominic Chappell and discovering he was a former bankrupt. I checked Google, and found that Walt Disney and HJ Heinz were made bankrupt, he says. Businessmen go bankrupt from time to time, Q: But your chief financial officer also knew he\u2019d been involved with a convicted fraudster.... Green says he didn\u2019t know the full details of the links between Chappell and Sutton. Philip Green seems to have abandoned his pledge not to blame anyone else. He tells the committee that top brass at law firm Olswang, and accountants Grant Thornton, helped to give Dominic Chappell vital credibility. I took a great deal of comfort that those two firms were representing Chappell, says Green, even though he suspect \u201cthey didn\u2019t know the guy from a hole in the wall\u201d before the deal began. The committee are pushing Green about exactly how Dominic Chappell came on the scene.... Green also tries to dob Goldman Sachs in, citing a congratulatory email from top GS banker Anthony Gutman to Chappell. Q: So, how did talks with Dominic Chappell begin? Green says that he didn\u2019t meet Chappell until he\u2019d been \u201cindependently vetted\u201d by Goldman Sachs. [Background: last week, Chappell told the committee that he learned via Paul Sutton that BHS was for sale] Green reveals that Paul Budge, Arcadia\u2019s finance director, asked for an affidavit from Chappell stating that there was no link to Sutton. Q: Why would you do that? There was a point when we realised there was a possible connection between the men, so we wanted a pledge that they weren\u2019t linked, says Green. The Sunday Times\u2019s Oliver Shah has an important insight on this point: Conservative MP Amanda Solloway now takes up the questioning, asking Green about how the sale of BHS unfolded. He says Robin Saunders, a top City banker, had flagged up \u201cen passant\u201d that she knew of a well-funded individual who was interested in buying the group. He confirms that this was Paul Sutton, a convicted fraudster, who Green says he\u2019d not met previously. Chappell didn\u2019t come onto the scene until 3 February 2015, Green insists - sinking the idea that Chappell was a leading light in Sutton\u2019s deal team. And Green then says that a mysterious file on Sutton landed on his desk, which prompted Arcadia to \u201cdisengage\u201d with him. Q: Robin Saunders told us that she warned you in June 2013 that Sutton was discredited....yet you still continued to deal with him. Not true, Green insists - we broke off talk as soon as the file arrived [he\u2019s vague about when it turned up, though] Q: Did you lambast your team for not discovering problems with Sutton? Green pauses, looking suspicious, and then asks if the committee have a note saying that happened (!). It seems they do not. And we\u2019re back... Reminder you can watch the session in the top of this blog - or on Parliament Live. Green seems in jovial mood: Jeremy Quin MP turns to the sale of BHS to ex-bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Green denies Chappell\u2019s claim that he was initially led to believe he could buy BHS without its pension liabilities. There was no question that was ever on the table once we began serious negotiations, Green insists. Q: But this looks like a classic bait-and-switch... Not so, Green says Q: Chappell says he wasn\u2019t given access to the BHS trustees or the pension regulator. That\u2019s not true, Green says, suggesting that Chappell actually met with Chris Martin, the head of the pension trustees. Q: Chris Martin has notes of a conversation with you, the day after the deal was done, in which you say he potentially jeopardised the deal by telling Chappell the annual pension contributions could rise to \u00a330m. Green doesn\u2019t really address this point. Here\u2019s our first news story on Sir Philip Green\u2019s testimony, from Graham Ruddick: That was one of the most combative, sometimes aggressive performances I\u2019ve seen from a businessman before MPs. So, where do we stand, as the participants take a quick break? Philip Green has apologised to BHS staff for the collapse of the company, saying: \u201cThere certainly was no intent at all on my part for anything to be like this. It didn\u2019t need to be like this and I just want to apologise to all the BHS people who have been involved in this\u201d. He has promised to find a solution to the company\u2019s pension deficit, pledging: We want to find a solution for the 20,000 pensioners. But Green has refused to take the blame for the pension black hole, saying \u201cstupid and idiotic\u201d decisions were made. He claimed ignorance about the nitty-gritty of the finances at his empire Insisted that he invested in BHS, rather than just huge taking dividends out Defended his decision to live in a tax haven Told one MP to stop staring Described female MPs as \u201cyour lady\u201d Struggled to pour a glass of water One finally final question before the break - was Green unhappy that Arcadia chairman Lord Grabiner didn\u2019t even turn up for the meeting when BHS was sold? Green declines to put the boot into Grabiner, suggesting he may have had other commitments. And now a 15 minute break - after which, we\u2019ll hear about the decision to sell BHS to Dominic Chappell.... Green also suggests that he did the right thing for BHS. I could simply have put the company into administration, he argues, and addressed the pension issue that way. And he also takes another pop at the recent press coverage: In the last four weeks, I could be a murderer for the way they write about me. Last questions before a quick break. Jeremy Quin MP asks Green whether he agrees that his failure to keep a closer eye on the BHS pension scheme was a corporate governance failure. Green doesn\u2019t accept the charge, and then perks up when the House of Commons bells ring. Break time, he smiles. No Mr Green, that\u2019s the bell for prayers, Frank Field explains gently. Is that for you or for me, asks the Arcadia boss. For both of us hopefully, Field murmers. Green, who looks desperate for a break, repeats that he wants everyone to know that he\u2019s committed to finding a soltuion to the BHS pension scheme There\u2019s nothing I\u2019m going to tell you that you can\u2019t go and check up.,.... I\u2019m not going to tell you lies. That\u2019s the third time Green has promised he\u2019s not fibbing.... Richard Graham MP is pushing Green on Project Thor. He suggesting that the scheme was suspended once the regulator demanded more details about exactly what Arcadia would putting into the BHS scheme. And he produces an email from the chair of the BHS pension trustees, which says Green was unhappy that the regulator was \u201cTrawling through bullshit from 10 years ago\u201d. Graham points out that Green had originally proposed selling BHS to Dominic Chappell free of its pension liabilities. Is that because you thought Project Thor would have been executed first? Green won\u2019t engage.... snarling: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are we in the same room? I can\u2019t deal with this\u201d And he appeals to committee chair Frank Field to call Graham off, before repeating that he will solve the pension issue. Graham won\u2019t be knocked off course by Green\u2019s antics though, referring to Dominic Chappell\u2019s evidence from last week. He suggests that Green decided to sell BHS to Chappell for \u00a31 to get the pension problem off his hands (once the regulator threw up hurdles to the Project Thor scheme). If you look out of the window, is the sky light or dark, asks Green sarcastically (and bafflingly). He also denies that he threatened to pull the sale if Chappell contacted the pension regulator (as Chappell claimed last week). Sky News\u2019 Mark Kleinman reckons Green is making a substantial commitment to his former workers... The committee turn to Project Thor, Arcadia\u2019s proposal to restructure the BHS pension scheme, which was suspended in 2014. Green reveals that there has been contact with the regulator in recent days, saying snidely that. The regulator made a phone call - maybe someone bought them a telephone. And Green hints that a deal is still possible to address the \u00a3571m deficit, saying \u201cthere does seem to be a light in the tunnel\u201d. Green declares that he wants to give a reassurance to BHS\u2019s 20,000 pensioners that he will sort the problem out. We want to find a solution for the 20,000 pensioners. Green argues that putting the scheme into the Pension Protection Fund (the PPF - the lifeboat for failed schemes) would not resolve the issue , as the schemes are quite complex, says Green. And he then pledges: But I believe it is resolvable, it is solvable. We will sort it, we will find a solution. Q: Does that mean that pensioners would get everything they are entitled to, asks Frank Field. Green won\u2019t make such a commitment, but repeats that his advisers are working on a solution, and it will be presented soon. [background: there are rumours that Green could set up a separate \u201cPhoenix\u201d fund to provide extra payments to BHS pensioners] Richard Graham MP suggests that Sir Philip Green met with pensions minister Steve Webb in 2012 about reducing BHS\u2019s pension levy -- suggesting the issue was actually on his agenda. And then he lashes out again at Graham, demanding to know: Which bit of \u201cdon\u2019t remember\u201d do you find difficult? SNP MP Mhairi Black (who isn\u2019t on the committee) can\u2019t believe what she\u2019s hearing: Conservative MP Richard Graham leads Green through the details of BHS pension deficit. He gets him to agree that BHS was the sponsor for its pension scheme, and that the average BHS wage was \u00a317,000, meaning a long career would deliver a pension of \u00a38,500 per year. So the scheme went from a surplus when you bought it, to a deficit in 2005. Then you later proposed putting \u00a310m per year into the fund to fix the deficit - how was that decision made? Green again claims it\u2019s nothing to do with him, and tried to blame others (such as pension trustee chair Margaret Downes). I don\u2019t want to pass this to other people, but there has to be some accountability..... There have been some stupid, stupid, idiotic mistakes made. Karen Buck MP has a valiant attempt to pin Green down about the meetings he had with BHS\u2019s pension trustees. You can\u2019t expect me to remember what I did eight years, ago, he insists. He suggests Buck must have been a mind-reader in a previous life if she could remember such details, and should come to work for Arcadia. Buck points out that if she were testifying to a committee, she\u2019d know jolly well who she\u2019s met with. City analyst Louise Cooper shares the committee\u2019s sense of disbelief: The MPs are simply not convinced that Green could have been so ignorant about the BHS pension scheme. Iain Wright MP points out that the Arcadia chief famously once intervened to change BHS\u2019s coat hangers, to save \u00a3400,000 per year. Would a man who did that really ignore the pensions of 11,000 staff? Green insists that no-one brought the issue to his attention, while also claiming that he\u2019s not blaming anyone else. And he also repeats that he\u2019s not a liar... I am here, I\u2019m happy to be accountable. I\u2019m not a liar, I can\u2019t tell you about things I\u2019m not responsible. Someone was asleep at the wheel about the pension issue, he concludes. Do luxury yachts have wheels? Green keeps referring to female MPs on the committee as \u201cyour lady here\u201d \u2013 which is going down as badly as you\u2019d expect. Here\u2019s Sir Philip Green\u2019s apology to BHS staff (delivered at the start of the hearing) \u201cThere certainly (was) no intent at all on my part for anything to be like this. It didn\u2019t need to be like this and I just want to apologise to all the BHS people who have been involved in this.\u201d Sir Philip Green is unhappy that MPs keep interrupting him, trying to pin him down on the pension problems. He insists that he simply wasn\u2019t involved until 2012 (!) But we\u2019ve been told that you\u2019re a Napoleon of industry, explains Frank Field MP, the man in control of everything. We\u2019re struggling to acclimatise to this new image of you... Green looks hurt, saying: I haven\u2019t run away, I haven\u2019t tried to run away. He hits out at the \u201coutrageous and pretty rude media coverage\u201d in recent months, which have created quite the wrong impression. And he then issues a second apology, for the pension deficit: I\u2018m happy to apologise, I should have been involved earlier. For whatever reason I wasn\u2019t, but I should have been involved earlier. Onto the BHS pensions black hole.... Green says that the pension deficit should have been tackled as soon as he bought the company. But he also argues that it\u2019s not his fault, blaming \u201cpoor communication\u201d on both sides. He also reveals he only spoke to the BHS pension trustees on a handful of occasions Green also tries to spread the blame around, saying a lot of money was paid to pension advisers -- \u00a3650,000 in the early days, rising to \u201cnorth of \u00a31.5m\u201d by 2005-06. The MPs are concerned that Green doesn\u2019t seem to have been a very caring steward of the BHS pension fund. In 2000, it had a \u00a343m surplus, before you began taking dividends out. Tht\u2019s not very fair, Green insists. \u201cWith due respect\u201d I\u2019ve explained that we put \u00a3750m back into the company. I was not a trustee of the pension fund, he insists. Q: But surely you are ultimately accountable for the pension fund? Where\u2019s this conversation taking us, demands Green - [perhaps suspecting that his wallet is being lined up for a hit] Q: Does your wife ever share the details of the accounts of her offshore property company (which owned some BHS properties)? No, says Green, shaking his head and chewing on his spectacles. Q: Why didn\u2019t the hundreds of millions you say you put into BHS do much good? Retail is difficult, snaps Green - if it wasn\u2019t, anyone could do it. And \u201cwithout being rude\u201d, he suggests Fuller should give it a go sometime. I know that I wouldn\u2019t be any good at it, Fuller smiles back. Green invites MPs to visit Arcadia to see for themselves how it works.... Richard Fuller MP \u2013 he of the piercing stare \u2013 tells Green that he learned in business that you should look people in the eye when you\u2019re dealing with them. Q: What\u2019s the purpose of a company - is it to make money, to employ people, be creative? To run a business, says Green, looking a little confused. Fuller rattles through some BHS financial statements from 2000-2004, which he claims show that Green took a lot in dividends and invested little in BHS. Green queries it, saying the figures show \u00a370m was spent on capital expenditure, and \u00a380m on corporation tax. Plus \u00a3380m in dividends. Q: Why is the \u00a3380m dividend figure different than the \u00a3423m we\u2019ve heard earlier? Green airily says he\u2019d just reading out the numbers handed by his finance team, arguing that he doesn\u2019t really get involved with the money side of things. I wouldn\u2019t even know who to phone to take money out of our bank. Frank Field MP says this is quite a contrast with Dominic Chappell, who was very intent on taking money out of BHS once he bought it from Green for \u00a31. Asked about BHS\u2019s decline under his ownership, Green says it\u2019s very hard to find world-champion CEOs. He pins some the blame on the \u201cvery poor property deals\u201d signed before he bought it. Some were on leases of 40 or 50 years, and that gradually eroded the profitability. Q: Wouldn\u2019t it have been a good idea to sell in 2009? With hindsight, 2002 would have been a good time to sell it, smirks Green [ie, after Tina Green had cashed that \u00a3400m dividend cheque] Snap summary: I\u2019m starting to suspect Sir Philip would rather be sunning himself on his new \u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart. He just broke off an answer to ask Richard Fuller MP to \u201cstop staring\u201d at him, as it\u2019s making him uncomfortable. Fuller insists he doesn\u2019t want to make Green uncomfortable, as everyone stares at Green in disbelief. Green then declines to comment on how much money is still owed to his wife Tina, as he doesn\u2019t sign off the accounts. But you\u2019re a director of the company, points out a startled Jeremy Quin. Oops. Green now interrupts the committee so he can deliver a short speech correcting some inaccuracies delivered by previous witnesses. He says \u00a3254m was invested in BHS in the early days. After 2009, his Arcadia empire loaned \u00a3250m, interest free, plus another \u00a3100m in additional capital. In total, he says, Arcadia put \u00a3600m in -- in the years between taking \u00a3400m dividends out and selling to Dominic Chappell. He\u2019s trying to puncture the idea that he ravaged the business like a rapacious robber baron. Green says he first thought about selling BHS in 2014, although it would have saved \u201ca lot of aggravation\u201d if he\u2019d sold sooner. Q: Why did your Arcadia operation take over some of BHS\u2019s back-office functions? Green claims it was for efficiencies, saying the service was provided below cost. And again, he\u2019s not accepting criticism.... Michelle Thomson MP points out that Green\u2019s property operation is based offshore, in Jersey, outside the UK tax jurisdiction. Green doesn\u2019t accept the criticism, saying that 30 or 40% of the FTSE is owned by offshore companies. It is the British Home Stores, and it\u2019s owned by your wife, points out Frank Field. Thomson asks Green if he\u2019ll release all his accounts, including those of the offshore companies, to help the pensions regulator conduct its inquiries into BHS. Green says he doesn\u2019t have these details (even though his wife Tina is the ultimate owner). He insists that he\u2019s never held an offshore bank account. The committee turn to the BHS properties which were sold to Green family companies (in a sale and leaseback scheme). Q: Does that mean that you avoided paying tax on \u00a3152m rent? It doesn\u2019t work like that, mutters Green, suggesting this isn\u2019t a sensible path to go down. Q: So how does it work? Green says he and his family left the country in 1998 for health reasons after a heart scare. He then returned to the UK to work, leaving his family behind. He suggests that Monaco was recommended to him as a good place to recuperate. Q: When did you first discover the tax advantages, asks Frank Field innocently (ish) I think it\u2019s well known, Green replies - but at that stage he didn\u2019t know how his career would turn out. Q: But didn\u2019t you ever think that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to be based in a tax haven? Green denies that he structured his business to avoid tax -- we have paid tax on all the money raised in the UK, and paid a lot of it, he insists. Green is already looking irked as the committee try to dig into BHS\u2019s finances. We\u2019ve already had two \u201cwith respect\u201ds.... Q: What about the dividends that you took out of BHS? Green claims that he didn\u2019t operate an aggressive financial strategy at BHS. Q: But in 2000-2004 dividends were around double the profits... Green cites different figures, claiming that they show BHS made a profit of \u00a3537m during that period [higher than the \u00a3400m dividends his family took out] Q: But do you still think that the dividend policy was prudent? The leverage used was not excessive, Green insists. Sir Philip Green then tells the committee that his \u201cemotional tie\u201d to BHS meant he hung onto the chain too long, adding. Nothing is more sad than how this has ended. And he then apologises to staff at BHS for the chain\u2019s collapse. And we\u2019re off. Frank Field begins by welcoming Philip Green. And then Michelle Thomson starts the questioning, asking Green what value sums up his career as a top retailer. Green looks a bit surprised by this approach, replying that \u201cit\u2019s not right to mark your own essay\u201d. He then explains that he began at the bottom, trudging the streets at 6.30am selling clothing. If I\u2019ve done something wrong, I\u2019ll put my hands up and admit it. And I don\u2019t tell lies, he pledges. Q: So would you sum up your attribute as \u201chonesty and hard working\u201d. Yes, I think so, Green replies. The eagerly anticipated session begins shortly. We are embedding a live feed at the top of this blog (you might need to refresh to see it). It is also being streamed live here, and on BBC Parliament. Today\u2019s Daily Mirror points out that taxpayers have effectively subsidised Green\u2019s retail empire over many years, through tax credits to bump up salaries. One tantalising question is whether Sir Philip Green maintains his composure once MPs probe his conduct over BHS: Chris Nuttall of the Financial Times explains: The first challenge facing the Svengali of the rag trade will be to keep his temper. Sir Philip has a short fuse and MPs will be tempted to see if they can light it. Anger is the short cut to putting his foot in it. This brings us on to Point Two: don\u2019t swear or crack jokes. The entrepreneur uses some colourful language in private and has a sardonic sense of humour. He needs to keep it clean and straight-faced for the cameras. Thirdly the entrepreneur and part-time admiral in the Monaco Navy must sound contrite \u2013 11,000 people have lost their jobs. Sir Philip can be expected to avoid negotiating a settlement of liabilities for BHS\u2019s underfunded pension scheme on-air, not least because committee chair Frank Field MP wants \u00a3600m, far more than is needed to cover the deficit on an ongoing basis. No sign of Sir Phil yet.... Dave Gill, national officer of the Usdaw trade union, says Philip Green must explain exactly why BHS failed. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe should remember there are 11,000 employees that could in the next six weeks be out of jobs. \u201cThey want to know what exactly has Philip Green been doing over the last number of years? What suddenly made him pull the plug on it? Its a very sad time and he should be held accountable for it.\u201d Gill adds that workers deserve answers on why Green handed the business to Dominic Chappell last year: \u201cThe main thing that people find concerning is that he could just sell his company for \u00a31 to someone who has already been bankrupt a number of times. It\u2019s not as though he even tried to sell it on to someone credible who could actually try and turn the business round.\u201d \u201cReading between the lines it seems that his view was just to try and get rid of it as soon as possible. We\u2019ve rounded up the 11 key questions which MPs must put to Green today, so lets see how many the MPs manage to ask. Why did you sell BHS to Dominic Chappell? Why were you in such a hurry to sell BHS? What profit did you and your wife make from BHS? What will you do to help the BHS pension scheme? How much did you know about Chappell\u2019s deal with the Dellal family? [they loaned Chappell \u00a335m, and were planning to buy BHS\u2019s HQ, Marylebone House] Why did you sell Marylebone House to Arcadia when there were external buyers? Did you use \u00a335m of debt to unduly influence BHS in the past year? Did you break a promise to arrange credit insurance for BHS? Did you block a BHS rescue deal with Sports Direct? [as Chappell claimed last week] How much did you or your companies pay to Retail Acquisitions or Dominic Chappell? Do you think your conduct has been befitting of a knight? More details here: Green had threatened to boycott today\u2019s hearing, furious with Frank Field MP for suggesting he should lose his knighthood. But yesterday, he confirmed he would show up today, saying: \u201cThis will be the first and only opportunity I have had to tell my side of the very sad BHS story, and I will do my best to answer all the questions put to me in an honest and open way.\u201d I\u2019m not sure this is exactly the first opportunity \u2013 frankly, we\u2019d have sent a taxi to Monaco if Green had fancied speaking out sooner. Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s session: People are already flocking to Portcullis House ready for Green\u2019s appearance, in an hour\u2019s time. Good morning. Sir Philip Green is swapping the luxury of the Monto Carlo yacht club for the relative austerity of parliament\u2019s Portcullis House today, as MPs continue to probe the collapse of the BHS retail chain. And it should be an absolute belter of a session, perhaps one of the most exciting since these events were televised. Green, one of Britain\u2019s most successful businesspeople, has been summoned to explain his part in a scandal that is costing 11,000 jobs and threatening the pensions of thousands more former employees. The Business, Innovation and Skills committee, and the Work and Pensions committee, will together quiz Green about his stewardship of BHS, and the seemingly huge sums he paid his family during that time. They must quiz Green on his fateful decision to sell the chain in 2015 for \u00a31 to a man, Dominic Chappell, with a couple of bankruptcies on his CV but no retail experience. That includes investigating curious property deals which appeared to be designed to help make Chappell look like a credible bidder. And probably most importantly, they need to press Green hard on the BHS pension deficit (currently \u00a3571m). Why didn\u2019t he fix this problem before the sale, rather than leaving it in Chappell\u2019s tender clutches? And what will he do to fix the mess now? Green\u2019s reputation has been badly damaged by the unfolding drama around BHS already. His credibility is on the line. And so is the knighthood he received a decade ago for services to the fashion industry. The meeting is due to start at 9.15am. And it could be an epic session, as the room is booked until 2.30pm. So get the popcorn in.",

That\u2019s because the Arcadia chief had a two-pronged strategy; he either produced his own figures to challenge the MPs, or claimed he simply didn\u2019t get involved with whatever they were asking about.

      "bodyText": "Paying hotel bills and offering tickets to football and international rugby matches is part of corporate life, Goldman Sachs has told the high court, as the bank lays out its defence against a $1.2bn (\u00a3850m) claim by a Libyan investment fund set up during the Gaddafi era. The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) argues that Goldman and its bankers attempted to exert influence over its investment decisions by paying hotel bills and offering corporate hospitality. Robert Miles QC told Mrs Justice Rose that corporate hospitality was \u201cpart of the ordinary influences of commercial life\u201d. He said the corporate hospitality Goldman is said to offered \u2013 tickets to the Rugby World Cup and Champions League finals \u2013 were not lavish in comparison to what other banks were offering the LIA. He read out an email in which an LIA official asked HSBC to provide hotel accommodation. The LIA has also made claims that a Goldman banker, Youseff Kabbaj, procured prostitutes as part of his efforts to win access to the fund. Goldman\u2019s QC did not address these allegations. Kabbaj, the court has been told, has agreed a $4.5m settlement with Goldman and will not give evidence. Miles said it would be a travesty to say that Goldman had misled the LIA, which argues that its staff did not understand the detail of the loss-making trades that took place between January and April 2008, and which are at the centre of the claim. \u201cThe question is what they were capable of understanding and what they did understand. If it turns out they didn\u2019t understand it\u2019s not through any fault of [Goldman],\u201d he said. He also disputed the idea that Kabbaj was able to exert influence at the LIA, which had dealings with 77 financial institutions and had refused to take part in one deal involving the head office of the Spanish bank Santander. \u201cThis idea he had them under his thumb will not wash,\u201d Miles said. The case is expected to last seven weeks and the first witnesses are due to be called on Thursday. The court was told that Sofia Blount, nee Wellesley, the wife of the pop singer James Blunt and who used to work as a PA at the LIA, would not give evidence. Roger Masefield QC, representing the LIA, told the court she was not being called because of \u201cmedia intrusion\u201d. The LIA\u2019s skeleton argument presented to the court earlier in the week had set out how Kabbaj took Haitem Zarti, the brother of an LIA official, on holidays to Morocco. \u201cMr Kabbaj also took him to Dubai for a conference, with the business-class flights and five-star accommodation being paid by Goldman Sachs. Documents disclosed by Goldman Sachs show that during that trip Mr Kabbaj went so far as to arrange for a pair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening,\u201d the LIA said. Goldman said the claim was one of buyers\u2019 remorse. \u201cThe LIA was the victim of an unforeseen financial depression, not of any wrongdoing by [Goldman],\u201d the bank said.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco food waste rose to equivalent of 119m meals last year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has revealed that the amount of food waste generated by the supermarket giant increased to 59,400 tonnes last year \u2013 the equivalent of nearly 119 million meals. Tesco is the only major supermarket to publish its food waste data, and the increase came despite numerous initiatives designed to tackle the problem. The figure represents a 4% increase on 2015 with its beers, wines and spirits aisles and bakeries blamed for the rise. The amount wasted was the equivalent of one in every 100 food products sold by Tesco during the last financial year. The new figures, which were published at the time of its annual report, come as Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis today used a major industry conference to call for collective action to tackle food waste right across the supply chain \u2013 from farms to supermarket operations, right through to customers\u2019 homes. \u201cWhen I arrived at Tesco, we were the only UK retail company to publish our food waste data,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat the data shows is that it\u2019s clear where we need to focus our efforts \u2026 nearly three years after we announced it, we are still the only UK retailer publishing our data.\u201d He also called on companies, in the short term, to do more to redistribute their surplus edible food waste to people in need. Tesco has published its food waste figures since 2013, but no other retailer has followed suit. The retail giant says the transparent approach has helped it to identify hotspots and develop programmes to tackle the problem. While the problem got worse in its bakery departments last year, Tesco said it had managed to cut produce waste by 2%. The meals calculation uses a factor of 0.5kg for the average weight of a meal. Lewis, a former Unilever executive who was drafted in to lead a turnaround of Tesco in 2014, told the Global Summit of the Consumer Goods Forum: \u201cTackling food waste makes sense for business, it will help people and our planet, and it\u2019s also the right thing to do.\u201d To cut waste, Tesco has tried to reduce the time that food sits in its supply chain so that it can sell produce that lasts longer. It has also widened specifications to sell more of a crop with a range of \u201cwonky\u201d fruit and vegetables called \u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d, which launched in February. The retailer has also promised to redistribute all edible food waste from stores to charities by the end of 2017. A Tesco spokesman said: \u201cWe are confident that despite the small increase in our waste this year we have the right plans in place to see a reduction in future years and are proud of the work we have already done to redirect surplus food to provide millions of meals for those in need.\u201d This year the big four supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons signed a voluntary agreement that promised to drive down food and drink waste by a fifth within the next decade. Major brands and manufacturers, including Coca-Cola and Nestle also committed to the Courtauld Commitment 2025 which was produced by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap). Wrap estimates that 1.9m tonnes of food is wasted in the UK grocery supply chain every year. \u201cWrap welcomes Tesco\u2019s efforts to reduce its food waste,\u201d said Dr Richard Swannell, director at Wrap. \u201cTesco, alongside all major UK retailers is signed up to Courtauld 2025. As part of Courtauld we report the retail sectors\u2019 aggregate food waste levels and industry is making good progress. \u201cJust recently we published new research that shows a 200,000 tonne reduction in food waste by retailers and manufacturers. Interest and action on tackling food waste has never been greater in the UK food sector, however WRAP research shows that waste in the 27-plus-million UK households remains the greatest challenge and opportunity. Through Courtauld 2025 we are seeking to increase the sectors\u2019 efforts in tackling food waste with consumers, as well as at an operational level.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Berkeley reports 20% fall in reservations for new homes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Berkeley Homes has reported a 20% drop in reservations for new homes in the run-up to the EU referendum and has not launched any new schemes in London this year. Aside from next week\u2019s vote, the housebuilder blamed global economic uncertainty, higher UK stamp duty and the \u201cpolicy shift against buy-to-let investors\u201d for the sharp drop in reservations between January and May. Berkeley specialises in upmarket homes in the capital and the south-east, and currently has 77 developments, including 55 in London. A spokesman explained that Berkeley \u201cput less to market because their job is to sell at what they think is the right price\u201d. To attract buyers, the company had said it would absorb the increased stamp duty at the top end of the market but has otherwise refrained from discounting. It said the market remained robust below the \u00a31.25m mark. This adds to evidence that Brexit fears are paralysing parts of the London luxury housing market. The market had already been cooling due to sweeping changes to the stamp duty regime, which made it more expensive to buy homes above \u00a3937,000. London\u2019s luxury postcodes have seen house prices fall by as much as 11.8% over the past year, according to estate agent Stirling Ackroyd. Berkeley\u2019s chairman, Tony Pidgley, said the company supported a vote to remain in the EU, joining other housebuilders that are concerned about the upheaval and likely labour shortages following a leave vote. He said: \u201cThe outcome of next week\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union is significant for the UK\u2019s housebuilding and property sector. London\u2019s status as the world\u2019s best big city is underpinned by labour mobility, cultural diversity and a constant influx of talent and investment from around the world, and the UK economy in turn is powered by the success of our capital city.\u201d Anthony Codling, analyst at Liberum Capital, said of the UK\u2019s housebuilders, Berkeley was most sensitive to the referendum decision. \u201cBerkeley has the highest private average selling price and the highest exposure to central London, which means that it has the highest share of discretionary buyers. It has therefore most to lose from uncertainty in the wake of a possible leave decision, as the stock market has already figured out quite clearly. On the flip side, it should be the biggest beneficiary of a remain decision.\u201d Its shares dropped nearly 2% earlier and are now down 0.4% at \u00a329.76. They have lost about a fifth of their value this year. Despite the slowdown, Berkeley is still confident that it can deliver \u00a32bn of pre-tax profits over three years, which assumes profits rise to \u00a3750m in each of the next two years. Its forward order book is up 10% to \u00a33.25bn. The company sold 3,776 homes in the year to 30 April, down 4%, at an average selling price of \u00a3515,000, down from \u00a3575,000 in 2015. The selling price is around twice that of other FTSE 100 housebuilders, reflecting its focus on the London market. The firm made pre-tax profits of \u00a3530.9m, down 1.6%. Berkeley has launched a new design called the Urban House, a three-storey house with a private roof garden instead of a back garden. This allows it to build twice as many homes as previously on a site, at a time when demand for family homes in London outstrips supply by 13 to 1. The first homes of this prototype have been built at Kidbrooke Village in Greenwich, while others are under construction at Green Park Village in Reading. Assuming the company hits its targets, Berkeley\u2019s top executives are in line for a combined payout of up to \u00a3500m by 2021, one of the biggest ever handed out by a UK listed company. Pidgley received \u00a323.3m in cash and shares last year and could pick up another \u00a325m this year. The firm\u2019s results showed that Pidgley paid a further \u00a3378,593 to Berkeley in the last financial year for work done at his 16th-century home in Windsor. In 2009, he paid the firm \u00a31.3m for improvements to the property. Chief executive Rob Perrins paid Berkeley \u00a3155,167 for work done at his home last year. A company controlled by Pidgley\u2019s son, Langham Homes, was paid a fee of \u00a3173,000 in the year to 30 April 2015 for identifying potential land purchases for the group, but did not receive any fees last year, although the firm continues to do work for Berkeley. Several directors bought London apartments from Berkeley in recent years.",

      "body": "<p>Berkeley Homes has reported a 20% drop in reservations for new homes in the run-up to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum</a> and has not launched any new schemes in London this year.</p> <p>Aside from next week\u2019s vote, the housebuilder blamed global economic uncertainty, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/03/george-osborne-stamp-duty-reform-key-facts-autumn-statement\">higher UK stamp duty</a> and the \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/15/landlord-mortgages-plummet-by-85-after-stamp-duty-changes\">policy shift against buy-to-let investors</a>\u201d for the sharp drop in reservations between January and May. Berkeley specialises in upmarket homes in the capital and the south-east, and currently has 77 developments, including 55 in London.</p> <p>A spokesman explained that Berkeley \u201cput less to market because their job is to sell at what they think is the right price\u201d. To attract buyers, the company had said it would absorb the increased stamp duty at the top end of the market but has otherwise refrained from discounting. It said the market remained robust below the \u00a31.25m mark.</p> <p>This adds to evidence that Brexit fears are paralysing parts of the London luxury housing market. The market had already been cooling due to sweeping changes to the stamp duty regime, which made it more expensive to buy homes above \u00a3937,000. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/17/house-prices-drop-london-luxury-postcodes\">London\u2019s luxury postcodes have seen house prices fall by as much as 11.8%</a> over the past year, according to estate agent Stirling Ackroyd.</p> <p>Berkeley\u2019s chairman, Tony Pidgley, said the company supported a vote to remain in the EU, joining <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/14/housebuilder-leaving-eu-construction-stephen-stone-crest-nicholson-brexit\">other housebuilders that are concerned about the upheaval</a> and likely labour shortages following a leave vote.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe outcome of next week\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union is significant for the UK\u2019s housebuilding and property sector. London\u2019s status as the world\u2019s best big city is underpinned by labour mobility, cultural diversity and a constant influx of talent and investment from around the world, and the UK economy in turn is powered by the success of our capital city.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony Codling, analyst at Liberum Capital, said of the UK\u2019s housebuilders, Berkeley was most sensitive to the referendum decision.</p> <p>\u201cBerkeley has the highest private average selling price and the highest exposure to central London, which means that it has the highest share of discretionary buyers. It has therefore most to lose from uncertainty in the wake of a possible leave decision, as the stock market has already figured out quite clearly. On the flip side, it should be the biggest beneficiary of a remain decision.\u201d</p> <p>Its shares dropped nearly 2% earlier and are now down 0.4% at \u00a329.76. They have lost about a fifth of their value this year.</p> <p>Despite the slowdown, Berkeley is still confident that it can deliver \u00a32bn of pre-tax profits over three years, which assumes profits rise to \u00a3750m in each of the next two years. Its forward order book is up 10% to \u00a33.25bn.</p> <p>The company sold 3,776 homes in the year to 30 April, down 4%, at an average selling price of \u00a3515,000, down from \u00a3575,000 in 2015. The selling price is around twice that of other FTSE 100 housebuilders, reflecting its focus on the London market. The firm made pre-tax profits of \u00a3530.9m, down 1.6%. </p> <p>Berkeley has launched a new design called the Urban House, a three-storey house with a private roof garden instead of a back garden. This allows it to build twice as many homes as previously on a site, at a time when demand for family homes in London outstrips supply by 13 to 1. The first homes of this prototype have been built at Kidbrooke Village in Greenwich, while others are under construction at Green Park Village in Reading.</p> <p>Assuming the company hits its targets, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/10/berkeley-boss-gets-232m-payout-after-companys-profits-soar-by-42\">Berkeley\u2019s top executives are in line for a combined payout of up to \u00a3500m</a> by 2021, one of the biggest ever handed out by a UK listed company. Pidgley received \u00a323.3m in cash and shares last year and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/media/pdf/l/2/berkeley-annual-report-2015.pdf\">could pick up another \u00a325m</a> this year.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s results showed that Pidgley paid a further \u00a3378,593 to Berkeley in the last financial year for work done at his 16th-century home in Windsor. In 2009, he paid the firm \u00a31.3m for improvements to the property. Chief executive Rob Perrins paid Berkeley \u00a3155,167 for work done at his home last year.</p> <p>A company controlled by Pidgley\u2019s son, Langham Homes, was paid a fee of \u00a3173,000 in the year to 30 April 2015 for identifying potential land purchases for the group, but did not receive any fees last year, although the firm continues to do work for Berkeley. Several directors bought London apartments from Berkeley in recent years.</p>",

The aircraft engine maker told employees that Brexit would put the company\u2019s future investment plans in the UK at risk and hand its American rivals a competitive advantage. Warren East, the chief executive, said a planned new \u00a365m engine testing plant was a \u201cgood example\u201d of the kind of investment that might be put at risk if Britain voted to leave the EU on 23 June. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday: \u201cWe believe it is much better for our employees, our customers and our suppliers if Britain remains part of Europe. \u201cThis is because we are a very interconnected operation across Europe. If Brexit occurs there will almost inevitably be a period of uncertainty, and uncertainty is what we can\u2019t cope with. \u201cWe\u2019re making investment decisions all the time about where to place different parts of our operation, and uncertainty created by Brexit puts a lot of those decisions on hold and that pause is something that our US competitors don\u2019t have to cope with. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not so good for us.\u201d Rolls-Royce employs more than 50,000 people around the world, with three-quarters of the workforce based in the EU. Major customers include the European aircraft maker Airbus. Its largest UK plant is in Derby, where it designs, tests and assembles Trent jet engines. \u201cWe have to deal with whatever the outcome happens to be,\u201d East said. \u201cAll we\u2019re saying today is, a Brexit result would likely lead to a period of uncertainty. \u201cWe need to make investment decisions throughout that period, we\u2019re going to be held back by uncertainty, and we could do without that. But we\u2019re going to continue to be a global leader no matter what.\u201d Rolls has faced difficult times recently, issuing a string of profit warnings and cutting its dividend for the first time in almost 25 years. The FTSE 100 company is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, following allegations of bribery and corruption in Indonesia and China. East said that since he was appointed chief executive almost 12 months ago, he had not witnessed any problems with the culture of the business. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is a problem which existed then and it certainly doesn\u2019t exist today. We will tolerate absolutely no improper behaviour whatsoever and I think every one of our 50,000 plus employees is well aware of that. It\u2019s well known there is an SFO investigation going on into some historical practices. \u201cWe have some of our facilities that need modernisation, and some of our processes, practices and behaviours also need modernisation.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An abrupt about-face has thwarted efforts by the British security firm Serco to open its first family detention center in Texas. Local officials unanimously voted this week against \u201centering contract agreements\u201d with the company after at least a month of negotiations. Serco had lobbied Jim Wells County to help it enter the US detention market by opening a facility in a closed down nursing home that would hold 500 to 600 women and children facing deportation. This followed a year of lobbying at the federal level. \u201cWe wanted to make an informed decision that is best for everybody and we felt were not able to do that because of Serco\u2019s limited time frame,\u201d said judge Pedro Trevino Jr, the presiding member of the Jim Wells commissioners court. \u201cIf something would change that could take us back and make us rethink it,\u201d Trevino said. \u201cIt would have to be something solid.\u201d Trevino said he became concerned when Serco told him the facility would be used to house \u201cwhole families\u201d including men. \u201cChanging what they said in the beginning drew a red flag. I don\u2019t think they were forthcoming.\u201d After first voting to consider the agreement last week, another commissioner voiced concern last Thursday when Serco representatives met with officials and residents to answer questions, and opponents gave examples of numerous scandals Serco had faced at its detention centers in the UK and Australia. \u201cWe are not here to be inhumane,\u201d said Precinct 1 Commissioner Margie Gonzalez. \u201c[We] did not know about all of this.\u201d ICE said a \u201cdecision to move forward with a request for proposal is pending\u201d and that it is \u201cstill developing its acquisition strategy based on the responses the agency received to the request for information.\u201d Serco did not respond to requests for comment.

It is not a question of whether the figures are good or bad in themselves, but whether they are helpful to camp remain or camp leave. In the past week, the releases have been in favour of the Brexiteers. Industrial production was up, the trade deficit narrowed and inflation was better than the financial markets had expected. The latest report on the labour market continued the trend. The news from the Office for National Statistics was not unambiguously good. Employment was up by 55,000 but all bar 5,000 of the increase was due to the hiring of part-time workers. The pace of job creation has slowed over the past year. Even so, the drop in the unemployment rate from 5.1% to 5% allowed the leave side to castigate George Osborne for his \u201cdoom-laden\u201d comments on the state of the economy. The chancellor is in the awkward position of not being able to welcome what, in other circumstances, he would be proclaiming as evidence that his \u201clong-term economic plan\u201d is working. There is, though, another way in which the leave camp can exploit the labour statistics. The ONS breaks down the increase in employment between UK nationals and non-UK nationals, and this split shows that the latter made up more than half of the increase seen between early 2015 and early 2016. More specifically, the number of UK nationals working in the UK rose by 185,000 to 28.15 million between January to March 2015 and the same months of 2016, while the number of non-UK nationals increased by 229,000 to 3.34 million. This pick-up in employment among non-UK nationals is the result of workers arriving from other EU countries. That rose by 224,000 over the past year, while employment for non-UK nationals from outside the EU was little changed. This continues a trend since David Cameron first came to power at the head of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. Tough immigration controls on people from countries outside the EU has meant the number of non-EU nationals working in the UK has barely changed. Over the same period, employment has been boosted by the arrival of about 1 million non-UK nationals from other EU countries. In large part, that increase can be attributed to the long-running eurozone crisis, which has meant there have been more job opportunities in Britain than elsewhere in the EU. But as the remain camp has found, convincing people in the less well-off parts of Britain that such an increase is a sign of economic success is mightily difficult.",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment dropped to its lowest rate since 2005 in April, to a level which without the looming Brexit vote would set off interest rate warning bells at the Bank of England. . The unemployment rate fell to 5% from 5.1% in March, while the number of jobs in the economy jumped 55,000 from March to set a record high employment rate of 74.2%. Once the jobless rate falls below 5%, the Bank believes wage pressures start to build. The strength of the jobs market was seized on by the chancellor, George Osborne, who tweeted: \u201cAt 5%, unemployment at its lowest rate for 11 years \u2013 let\u2019s not put that at risk by irreversible decision to quit EU.\u201d Campaigners for Britain to leave the EU were expected to claim the figures showed employers were relaxed about a Brexit vote, but John Philpott, director of the JobsEconomist, said the increase in the total number of people employed relied on a huge increase in self-employment. \u201cThe UK private sector effectively stopped hiring in the spring. Employees account for just 5,000 of the 55,000 increase in total employment in the three months to April, almost all of which is due to a rise in self-employment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once one strips an increase in public sector employment out of the latest figures it becomes clear that the private sector has for the moment called a halt to job creation.\u201d City economists were more relaxed about the figures, with most saying it was a sign of the economy\u2019s underlying strength and, with a vote to remain, could force the Bank of England to raise rates as soon as next year. James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets, said: \u201cBrexit risks obviously nullify this report, but should the UK stay then the data does help build the case for a rate rise early next year. \u201cThere are still more job vacancies than there are people claiming unemployment benefits, which suggests a degree of labour market tightness. This should be good news for pay, which will help generate medium term and inflation pressures.\u201d Officials on the Bank\u2019s interest rate setting committee have been waiting several years for a strong pickup in annual wages growth to about 4%. The most recent figures will have proved disappointing after total pay excluding bonuses, only nudged higher to 2.3% from 2.2% in the rolling three-month to three-month figures to April favoured by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Wages growth including bonuses was even lower 2%, but jumped 2.5% in the more volatile month-on-month figure to April. City economists had pencilled in a fall in total wages growth to 1.7%. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the financial information and services company, said the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which pushed the minimum hourly rate to \u00a37.20 from \u00a36.70 for over-25s, could be behind much of the small rise in wages. He said: \u201cRecruitment companies have reported that although the introduction of the living wage has pushed average wage rates higher, the increase in staff costs has also led to a pullback in hiring at some firms. Slower economic growth and rising uncertainty may also have hit hiring in recent months, suggesting the labour market data for May and June may disappoint.\u201d Williamson said many areas of the economy had slowed over the past year: \u201cThe business surveys are pointing to a further slowing of economic growth in the second quarter, down to 0.2%, as a result of weaker global demand and intensifying uncertainty regarding Brexit. Companies have reported that both investment and hiring have been affected, albeit often temporarily until the outlook clears.\u201d The employment rate, which tracks the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 who were in work, was 74.2%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971, the ONS said. Unemployment fell to 1.67 million, 20,000 fewer than the figure for the three months to January 2016, and 148,000 fewer than the same period last year. Last month, the number of people employed increased by 44,000 to 31.58 million, while total pay including bonuses edged up by 2%.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has pledged to resolve the problems facing the BHS pension scheme and apologised for the collapse of the department store chain. In a fiery session with MPs, Green said the pension problems the company faced were resolvable, and promised that beneficiaries would get a better deal than if the scheme entered the pension protection fund. The BHS scheme has a deficit of \u00a3571m. \u201cWe will solve it. We will find a solution,\u201d Green said, without providing details. There were some extraordinary exchanges between Green and MPs during the joint hearing of the business, innovation and skills committee, and the work and pensions committee. Green asked Richard Fuller, the Conservative MP, to stop looking at him. \u201cSir, do you mind not looking at me like that all the time? It\u2019s really disturbing,\u201d he said. He also appealed to Frank Field, the work and pensions committee chairman, saying that the Tory MP Richard Graham was \u201cbeating me up\u201d. Green asked Graham: \u201cAre we in the same room?\u201d during questions about the BHS pension scheme. \u201cWhich bit of \u2018I don\u2019t remember\u2019 is not clear to you?\u201d Green asked another MP. BHS is being wound down after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until March 2015, when he sold it to Dominic Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, for \u00a31. The tycoon and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his tenure at BHS. Green apologised for the collapse of the 88-year-old chain and insisted the dividends he took out of the company were not excessive. The billionaire said he should have sold BHS earlier and that \u201cstupid, idiotic mistakes\u201d had been made about the pension scheme. \u201cNothing is more sad than how this has ended,\u201d he said. In response to questions from MPs, Green said the financing of BHS was \u201cnot an aggressive finance strategy\u201d and not excessive. He said that as much as \u00a3800m had been pumped into the business between 2004 and 2015. \u201cWe put all that back into the business and more,\u201d he said. Green also said he left the UK in 1998 because of a heart scare, and moved to Monaco because \u201csomeone suggested it\u201d and it had good schools for his children. \u201cI had never spent a day there previously,\u201d he said. Green\u2019s business interests, including Arcadia, his retail business, are owned by his wife, who is also based in Monaco. The tycoon told MPs he did not accept claims he was avoiding tax. \u201cThere are competitors of ours who don\u2019t pay tax as a normal course of business,\u201d he said. Chappell and senior managers at BHS made a series of explosive allegations when they faced MPs last week. Chappell was accused of being a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d, a \u201cPremier League liar\u201d and of having his \u201cfingers in the till\u201d at BHS. In his own evidence, Chappell said Green had blocked a rescue deal for BHS with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct after going \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out about the talks. MPs have called for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. He was accused of being an \u201cunscrupulous chancer\u201d and overseeing \u201cwealth extraction rather than wealth creation\u201d during a parliamentary debate into the collapse of BHS.",

    "webTitle": "George Osborne's Brexit budget would guarantee a recession", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Picture the scene. It is 28 June, five days after Britain has decided to leave the European Union. Since the referendum, the financial markets have been panic-stricken. Shares and the pound have fallen, despite the efforts of the Bank of England to calm nerves. David Cameron has called a meeting of the cabinet to be addressed by George Osborne. Eight days before the vote, the chancellor had warned that a Brexit vote would force him to deliver an emergency budget that would raise \u00a330bn \u2013 half from tax increases and half from spending cuts. The pain, Osborne had said, would be necessary because the economy\u2019s prospects had been impaired so grievously by quitting the EU. He had been supported by his Labour predecessors, Alistair Darling, who said he was more worried than he had been when the global economy was on the brink of collapse in 2008. But that was then. Is what could be Osborne\u2019s last act as chancellor really going to be to take revenge on the voters for refusing to back the remain side in the referendum? Not a chance. There would be, in reality, three options open to the government in a post-Brexit world. Option one would be to go ahead with Osborne\u2019s \u00a330bn plan \u2013 putting 2p on the basic rate of income tax and 3p on the higher rate, whacking up excise duties on alcohol and fuel, lopping 2% off the budgets for the NHS, education and transport. The problem with option one is that nobody knows for sure how the economy is going to behave after a Brexit vote. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned of a possible technical recession, which means two consecutive quarters of negative growth. That is a long way, though, from the horrors of 2008-09, when the economy contracted by more than 6% in its longest and deepest post-war slump. What is certain is that taking \u00a330bn out of the economy when it is so fragile would guarantee a recession. It would cut spending when it was already weak. It is the sort of approach that has been foisted upon Greece by its creditors, with disastrous consequences. What\u2019s more, as Osborne knows all too well, it would be impossible to get such a budget through parliament given the size of the likely revolt from Conservative MPs. Option two involves the opposite approach, the sort favoured by Darling when the crisis was at its deepest in 2008-09. This would be an expansionary package of measures, perhaps involving higher spending on infrastructure, designed to help the economy through a tough patch. With interest rates so low, the government could borrow cheaply and underpin growth. The downside would be that the budget deficit would widen and the national debt would rise at a time when Osborne has still not finished the repair job on the public finances from the last downturn. Option three is the suck-it-and-see approach. This recognises that it is too early to say how the economy is going to perform so there is no point in doing anything too hasty. If growth does weaken, the so-called automatic stabilisers will kick in. This means that the Treasury tolerates the extra borrowing that is the consequence of weaker activity leading to lower tax receipts and higher welfare payments, waiting until the worst is over before deciding whether remedial action is needed on the public finances.

      "body": "<p>Picture the scene. It is 28 June, five days after Britain has decided to leave the European Union. Since the referendum, the financial markets have been panic-stricken. Shares and the pound have fallen, despite the efforts of the Bank of England to calm nerves.</p> <p>David Cameron has called a meeting of the cabinet to be addressed by George Osborne. Eight days before the vote, the chancellor had warned that a Brexit vote would force him to deliver an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-live-osborne-punishment-budget-farage-flotilla-thames\">emergency budget</a> that would raise \u00a330bn \u2013 half from tax increases and half from spending cuts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu\">George Osborne: vote for Brexit and face \u00a330bn of taxes and spending cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pain, Osborne had said, would be necessary because the economy\u2019s prospects had been impaired so grievously by quitting the EU. He had been supported by his Labour predecessors, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">Alistair Darling</a>, who said he was more worried than he had been when the global economy was on the brink of collapse in 2008.</p> <p>But that was then. Is what could be Osborne\u2019s last act as chancellor really going to be to take revenge on the voters for refusing to back the remain side in the referendum? Not a chance.</p> <p>There would be, in reality, three options open to the government in a post-Brexit world. Option one would be to go ahead with Osborne\u2019s \u00a330bn plan \u2013 putting 2p on the basic rate of income tax and 3p on the higher rate, whacking up excise duties on alcohol and fuel, lopping 2% off the budgets for the NHS, education and transport.</p> <p>The problem with option one is that nobody knows for sure how the economy is going to behave after a Brexit vote. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite\">warned of a possible technical recession,</a> which means two consecutive quarters of negative growth. That is a long way, though, from the horrors of 2008-09, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/22/britain-still-in-recession\">the economy contracted by more than 6% in its longest and deepest post-war slump</a>.</p> <p>What is certain is that taking \u00a330bn out of the economy when it is so fragile would guarantee a recession. It would cut spending when it was already weak. It is the sort of approach that has been foisted upon Greece by its creditors, with disastrous consequences.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, as Osborne knows all too well, it would be impossible to get such a budget through parliament given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-live-osborne-punishment-budget-farage-flotilla-thames\">the size of the likely revolt from Conservative MPs</a>.</p> <p>Option two involves the opposite approach, the sort favoured by Darling when the crisis was at its deepest in 2008-09. This would be an expansionary package of measures, perhaps involving higher spending on infrastructure, designed to help the economy through a tough patch. With interest rates so low, the government could borrow cheaply and underpin growth. The downside would be that the budget deficit would widen and the national debt would rise at a time when Osborne has still not finished the repair job on the public finances from the last downturn.</p> <p>Option three is the suck-it-and-see approach. This recognises that it is too early to say how the economy is going to perform so there is no point in doing anything too hasty. If growth does weaken, the so-called automatic stabilisers will kick in. This means that the Treasury tolerates the extra borrowing that is the consequence of weaker activity leading to lower tax receipts and higher welfare payments, waiting until the worst is over before deciding whether remedial action is needed on the public finances.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out which of these options the government would take. Clearly, it would be option three. This would recognise the near-impossibility of seeing through the post-Brexit economic fog, would help soothe financial market fears rather than add to them, be consistent with the pragmatic approach to deficit reduction Osborne has taken over the past six years, and avoid a schism in his party.</p> <p>There is, in other words, not the remotest chance that a leave vote will lead to a \u00a330bn austerity budget.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Australian share market faces a period of prolonged uncertainty as the possibility continues to grow that Britain could vote to leave the European Union. As the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 endured a fourth straight day of losses on Wednesday, there were mixed results across the rest of the Asia-Pacific as investors grappled with the prospect of the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy pulling out of the EU and continued concerns about the state of the Chinese economy. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark closed down 56 points at 5,147 points on Wednesday, a fall of just over 1% following overnight losses in London as fresh polls indicated a majority were in favour of a Brexit and amid fears the impact of such a vote could spread across the world. Stocks were also down for a fourth successive day in New York. Nicholas Forsyth, director of online trader Market Matters, said that whatever the result of the 23 June referendum, the overall outcome would be an \u201ceconomic mess\u201d. \u201cA Brexit result would be very dangerous for equities and should not be underestimated by the nervous,\u201d he said. He added there was more geopolitical turbulence for the market on the horizon with the Australian election on 2 July, followed by a potentially volatile US presidential showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Chris Weston of IG agreed the mood in the markets was febrile. \u201cWhile a \u2018remain\u2019 vote is still my base case, I would expect strong volatility before and violent swings in either direction throughout the day.\u201d The dollar also suffered some early punishment, dropping to US73.57c before recovering to US73.84c at 5pm AEST. Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said the uncertainty around the UK vote could easily see a return of the heavy selling that saw the ASX200 lose more than 2% on Tuesday. \u201cIn the current circumstances, the sort of selling pressure we saw yesterday could easily return over coming days,\u201d he said. \u201cPolls are currently favouring a leave vote but in a volatile situation, some doubts remain about whether people will actually vote this way when it comes to it.\u201d The market had held off trying to anticipate the result, he said, which increased the risk of a sharp fall if the leave camp won on 23 June. But it could equally mean a boost for valuations in the event of a remain vote. Across Asia, markets were more positive despite a surprise decision by the US index provider MSCI not to include domestic Chinese equities in its indices. Mainland Chinese shares, among Asia\u2019s worst performers this year, were mixed while Hong Kong slid, as markets which had expected Chinese A-shares to be included in the emerging market index considered the announcement. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were down 0.1%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei reversed earlier losses to rise 0.7%. The Chinese central bank set the yuan midpoint rate at 6.6001, the lowest level against the US dollar since January 2011. However, it eased to 6.6020 per dollar on the open , and was last trading slightly higher at 6.5978. The more widely traded offshore yuan rose to 6.6071 after earlier falling to 6.6152 to the dollar, its weakest level since early February as worries about China\u2019s economy deepened after data showed growth in China\u2019s fixed-asset investment slowed to a 15-year low. However, there was some better news for the ecomnomic outlook on Wednesday as the latest measure of Australian consumer sentiment showed that households were still fairly optimistic about the outlook. Although the monthly Westpac index dipped 1% in June, it followed a huge 8.5% surge in May \u2013 a result boosted by the Reserve bank\u2019s decision to cut the cash rate to 1.75%. At 102.2 the index was still in positive territory overall \u2013 readings above 100 indicate optimists outnumber pessimists \u2013 and confidence was 7.2% above its level a year ago.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A vote to leave the European Union would trigger economic and political convulsions in the UK, plunging the country back into recession and sending the pound sharply lower, a forecasting group has warned. Investors would rush to dump UK assets including shares and bonds in the immediate aftermath of voters choosing Brexit, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The pound would fall 14-15% against the dollar in the course of this year, unemployment would rise and the UK would risk losing its status as a global financial centre. In its Out and Down: mapping the impact of Brexit report, the EIU warned the damage from a decision to leave the EU would be felt until at least 2020. Analysts at the thinktank claim the UK economy would shrink 1% next year in the event of Britain voting to leave in the 23 June referendum. That would be the first contraction in annual GDP since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. By 2020, the economy would be 6%, or \u00a3106bn, smaller than it would have been had it stayed in the EU, as the UK grappled with a \u201chighly disruptive period in the country\u2019s history\u201d, the EIU said. Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at the EIU, said: \u201cWhile some of the remain campaign claims may seem alarmist, the fact is that a vote to leave would have a negative political and economic impact. \u201cThe negotiation process would create a period of uncertainty, both for consumers and investors, sterling would weaken and prices would rise, especially as trading with European counterparts became more complex.\u201d The thinktank\u2019s damning report on the consequences of Brexit predicted consumers would spend less and companies would delay investment decisions in a climate of heightened uncertainty over Britain\u2019s economic future. That in turn would be a drag on GDP and contribute to a rise in unemployment, peaking at 6% in 2018. The number of people out of work would be 380,000 higher than if the UK voted to stay, the EIU said. Borrowing costs would rise, as the average yield on 10-year government bonds would be 0.6 percentage points higher in the second half of 2016 than they would have been inside the EU, reflecting the additional risks associated with UK assets. \u201cShould the UK vote to leave the EU on 23 June, the country\u2019s economy will be plunged into uncertainty. This would be reflected in the first instance by tumultuous financial market volatility, but there would also be a swift impact on the real economy, with households and businesses reining in their spending until the dust settles,\u201d the EIU said. Some parts of the economy would feel the negative effects of Brexit more than others, according to the report: Financial services London\u2019s status as a global financial hub would be at risk and the sector would shrink. Firms would move operations out of the UK to ensure access to the single market, benefiting other European centres such as Frankfurt and Paris. Retail Brexit would deliver a \u201cshort and relatively sharp\u201d retail shock, with sales volumes falling 3% in 2017 and growth not stabilising until 2020. Companies in the sector would struggle with more complex supply chains and prices would rise as a weaker pound would make imports more expensive. Car industry A UK recession in 2017 would lead to a fall in car sales over the next few years. However, Brexit could have some advantages for the industry, with increased trade barriers potentially benefiting UK-based carmakers and making it harder for say, Volkswagen, to sell in the UK. Healthcare Pharmaceuticals exports could be hit unless the UK managed a quick renegotiation of trade links in the event of Brexit. The industry would face uncertainty over regulation, which could deter foreign companies from launching products in the UK market. NHS spending could be cut as recession takes hold, hitting pharma companies. Energy Brexit would create uncertainty about the future of the UK energy market. \u201cPost-Brexit, the greater the isolation of the UK from European energy policy and regulatory frameworks, the smaller its influence over the rules governing a market on which it is becoming increasingly dependent.\u201d Telecommunications The telecoms industry would be less affected than other industries, mainly because consumers deal with operators at a national level. The biggest impact would be on roaming charges, which are scheduled to be abolished within the EU in 2017. Outside the EU, the UK would have to negotiate a number of commercial agreements to abolish the charge, or to secure lower roaming charges for UK customers in Europe. Away from the economic implications, the EIU warned: \u201cA vote to leave the EU would trigger a political and constitutional crisis with immediate and lasting impact. It would be an event of immense force, pulling all other considerations into its orbit until the terms of the Brexit agreement have been negotiated.\u201d",

This would be reflected in the first instance by tumultuous financial market volatility, but there would also be a swift impact on the real economy, with households and businesses reining in their spending until the dust settles,\u201d the EIU said.<br></p> <p>Some parts of the economy would feel the negative effects of Brexit more than others, according to the report:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Financial services </strong>London\u2019s<strong> </strong>status as a<strong> </strong>global financial hub would be at risk and the sector would shrink. Firms would move operations out of the UK to ensure access to the single market, benefiting other European centres such as Frankfurt and Paris. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Retail </strong>Brexit would deliver a \u201cshort and relatively sharp\u201d retail shock, with sales volumes falling 3% in 2017 and growth not stabilising until 2020. Companies in the sector would struggle with more complex supply chains and prices would rise as a weaker pound would make imports more expensive.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Car industry </strong>A UK recession in 2017 would lead to a fall in car sales over the next few years. However, Brexit could have some advantages for the industry, with increased trade barriers potentially benefiting UK-based carmakers and making it harder for say, Volkswagen, to sell in the UK. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Healthcare </strong>Pharmaceuticals exports could be hit unless the UK managed a quick renegotiation of trade links in the event of Brexit. The industry would face uncertainty over regulation, which could deter foreign companies from launching products in the UK market. NHS spending could be cut as recession takes hold, hitting pharma companies.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Energy</strong> Brexit would create uncertainty about the future of the UK energy market. \u201cPost-Brexit, the greater the isolation of the UK from European energy policy and regulatory frameworks, the smaller its influence over the rules governing a market on which it is becoming increasingly dependent.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Telecommunications</strong> The telecoms industry would be less affected than other industries, mainly because consumers deal with operators at a national level. The biggest impact would be on roaming charges, which are scheduled to be abolished within the EU in 2017. Outside the EU, the UK would have to negotiate a number of commercial agreements to abolish the charge, or to secure lower roaming charges for UK customers in Europe.</li> </ul> <p>Away from the economic implications, the EIU warned: \u201cA vote to leave the EU would trigger a political and constitutional crisis with immediate and lasting impact. It would be an event of immense force, pulling all other considerations into its orbit until the terms of the Brexit agreement have been negotiated.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Josh Altman walks on to the stage nodding and smiling as though he\u2019s just heard the funniest thing and he can\u2019t wait to share it. He introduces himself as \u201creal estate-a-holic\u201d. He explains: \u201cSee, I\u2019m addicted to real estate.\u201d He asks who of the audience shares his addiction, and about 100 hands go up of a crowd several times that size. \u201cAre there many real estate agents here?\u201d \u201cToo many,\u201d mutters a woman behind me. \u201cHow many of you have the real-estate dream?\u201d I put my hand up. But my real estate dream \u2013 it quickly becomes apparent, then is relentlessly hammered home over the course of 90 minutes \u2013 is very different to Josh Altman\u2019s. The star of the reality television show Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles, he purports to be the world\u2019s most successful real estate agent. He has sold more than US$2bn in real estate, including the most expensive one-bedroom house in history for US$20m. At any time, he says, he has more than US$350m in listings. His clients include Kim Kardashian West, Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Wes Craven, Denise Richards, and Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. Altman has the \u201cgreatest job in the world\u201d, he says: \u201cI get to be part of the American dream.\u201d On Tuesday night he shared the secrets of his success with ticket holders at The Star events centre in Sydney. The city has one of the most inflated property markets in the world, where the median house price is upwards of seven figures and about 12 times what the middle-income Sydney household earns in a year. My real estate dream is to, one day, own some. Josh Altman\u2019s real estate dream, as he tells it, is a literal night-time hallucination about making 5% commission on a $200m mansion. \u201cI was going to sell it, I was going to make $10m \u2013 then my wife woke me up,\u201d he says. Tickets for the event, sponsored by Rolls-Royce, ranged from $49 to $199. The \u201crockstar experience\u201d package, including a selfie and a handshake with Altman and a pre-event champagne reception, was limited to 30 spots for $997 each. From a cursory inspection of the premises, more people had taken advantage of this deal than I\u2019d expected. I had expected zero. But Altman is a rock star among real estate agents, all the more aspirational for his humble beginnings, which he labours over: renting a couch to sleep on in a frat house, skating to his job at a mailroom. With his older brother Matt \u2013 his business partner, who later joins him on stage \u2013 they each saved US$5,000 and went in on a $400,000 condo. Once upon a time in the US, there was something called 100% financing, he says. \u201cAnd people wonder why the economy collapsed!\u201d The condo sold for $600,000. The first thing he did was buy a Jeep. \u201cBut for me, I wanted to make more money,\u201d he explains, a recurring theme of the evening. He studied for his real estate licence. He failed twice. Then he got it. That\u2019s what counts for adversity in the Josh Altman story. Later he talks about the selection process for Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles: he was one of 200 potential candidates. \u201cMy chances were great,\u201d he says with sarcasm. He got it. At 26 Altman became a mortgage broker, set up his own firm and hired all his friends. \u201cAt lunch we\u2019d all go to the gym and play basketball, and then we\u2019d come back and close deals,\u201d he reveals. Before long, they\u2019d traded their Jeeps for Ferraris, he says. It sounds like Entourage, I think derisively. \u201cYou know that movie Entourage?\u201d says Altman. \u201cIt was kind of like that.\u201d Then the economy collapsed. While the good times had been rolling, he says, he\u2019d stopped paying attention. He\u2019d just bought a $2.5m castle. \u201cI was a millionaire by the age of 26 and I was broke by the age of 26 and a half.\u201d He likens it to the Seinfeld episode where Jerry takes the offer of a seat in first class because Elaine hasn\u2019t ever been and so doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing out on. \u201cThat was my life. I knew exactly what I was missing,\u201d he says. This was Josh Altman\u2019s rock bottom: making a $800,000 loss on his castle, having his luxury cars taken away, a brush with depression. Then comes the redemption, almost biblical in his retelling: the soles of his shoes wearing out from his pounding the pavement, evenings spent icing his knuckles after days of door-knocking. Hard work pays off is the lesson here, one of several Altman has for the gathered Australian real estate agents. The first is: \u201cGet a reality show. It helps.\u201d He\u2019s joking, but what does help is selling luxury properties worth many millions of dollars to people with just that to burn. Mansions of between $1m and $5m are \u201cflying off the shelves\u201d, says Altman; his clients are among the richest celebrities in the world. (No wonder they \u201clove what they do\u201d, his No 1 rule for success.) How hard can it be to sell them a house? I\u2019d imagined that for the super rich, property was a negligible expense like the gum or discounted chocolate bars that you chuck on to the conveyer belt while in line at the supermarket \u2013 yeah, thinks Kylie Jenner, Mom won\u2019t notice a $6m six-bedroom house in the Hidden Hills. (Just kidding, she bought it herself!) To hear Altman tell it, that doesn\u2019t seem so far from the truth. He convinced the actor Tyler Perry, net worth $400m, to sell his house after he got on to the treadmill next to him at the gym. Perry told him he hadn\u2019t been to the house in more than a year. Altman made more than half a million dollars, he says, on a day when he had nothing to do. Another time, Altman sold a property to an NBA star he introduced himself to while in line at Starbucks, who volunteered that he was at that moment in the market for three: for himself, his family and his entourage. (Altman offered him $1,000 to get in his car there and then.) For all their earlier reluctance to identify as real estate addicts, the audience is well and truly warmed up by the time it comes for questions and answers, grilling the Altman brothers on the finer points of their success as though it could be replicated to scale. One man asks if they\u2019d ever invest in Sydney. They should have, says Matt Altman: \u201cI\u2019m still angry about Barangaroo.\u201d They were advised to invest in the waterfront property complex (a controversial development still under way) on their last visit to Australia. \u201cThe answer is yes, and I should have done it last year.\u201d Josh Altman remarks on the \u201cextremely cool, sexy houses\u201d in Sydney, just like those in vogue in Beverly Hills. \u201cI\u2019d totally buy them \u2013 except yours are way too overpriced.\u201d Just about the only concession made to the school of thought that there might be more to life than closing deals and making money comes in the last five minutes. As much as he wants \u201cto sell every house in the world\u201d, Altman says he wouldn\u2019t be able to take 5% to the grave with him. He then turns his iPhone towards himself with the crowd in the background. He\u2019s going to take a video, and he wants a little bit of audience interaction. \u201cWhat do you guys do?\u201d he asks the camera. \u201cI sell the dream!\u201d the crowd shouts. The article was amended on 16 June 2016 to correct the figure in Josh Altman\u2019s dream. His 5% commission on $200m would have been $10m, not $1m.",

Perry told him he hadn\u2019t been to the house in more than a year.</p> <p>Altman made more than half a million dollars, he says, on a day when he had nothing to do.</p> <p>Another time, Altman sold a property to an NBA star he introduced himself to while in line at Starbucks, who volunteered that he was at that moment in the market for three: for himself, his family and his entourage. (Altman offered him $1,000 to get in his car there and then.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/30/the-rise-and-rise-of-barangaroo-how-a-monster-development-on-sydney-harbour-just-kept-on-getting-bigger\">The rise and rise of Barangaroo: how a monster development on Sydney harbour just kept on getting bigger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all their earlier reluctance to identify as real estate addicts, the audience is well and truly warmed up by the time it comes for questions and answers, grilling the Altman brothers on the finer points of their success as though it could be replicated to scale.
