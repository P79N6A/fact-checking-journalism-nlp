      "bodyText": "The head of Britain\u2019s accounting watchdog is to quit next year amid strong criticism of the regulator following the collapse of Carillion. Stephen Haddrill will depart after nine years in charge of the Financial Reporting Council, which is subject to multiple inquiries into its effectiveness and independence. In May, a committee of MPs described the FRC as \u201cchronically passive\u201d in an excoriating report into the construction group\u2019s failure, condemning the regulator as \u201ctoo timid to make effective use of the powers they have\u201d. Haddrill\u2019s departure is likely to hasten an overhaul of the FRC and may even presage its abolition. In an unprecedented move in June, the Treasury commissioned Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, to conduct a review of the regulator to make it \u201cfit for the future\u201d, which may recommend its abolition or merger with the Financial Conduct Authority. The exact timing of Haddrill\u2019s leaving will depend on the outcome of the Kingman review and the search for his successor. In a statement, Haddrill said: \u201cI am incredibly proud to have led the FRC for nearly nine years. However, I believe that it should be the job of a new CEO to lead the FRC when the way ahead is decided. In the meantime, I remain fully committed to taking forward the FRC\u2019s important programmes on audit reform, investor stewardship, corporate reporting and preparing the FRC for EU exit.\u201d Speculation about Haddrill\u2019s successor has focused on Sacha Romanovitch, who recently left as chief executive of Grant Thornton, the UK\u2019s fifth-biggest accountancy firm. Whoever takes over at the FRC or its successor faces a regulator and industry in crisis. Early responses to the Kingman review, published in August, highlighted widespread concerns that the FRC was too close to the industry it supervises and unwilling to issue serious penalties following wrongdoing in the sector. The UK Shareholders\u2019 Association and ShareSoc, the society of individual shareholders, said in their submission that the FRC \u201cgives the impression of being an organisation which, up to now, has been happy to accept the status quo.\u201d It added: \u201cLooking at the FRC\u2019s board and the background and interests of its members, one has to suspect that promoting change has not been high on the agenda \u2026 There are real concerns about regulatory capture at the FRC. Too many people at all levels in the organisation are perceived to be too closely associated with those the FRC is supposed to regulate.\u201d A shake-up at the FRC will intensify the pressure on the accountancy industry and the dominance of the the big four accountancy groups \u2013 KPMG, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and EY \u2013 in auditing Britain\u2019s biggest companies. Haddrill was behind calls for an investigation into whether the big four should have to spin off their UK audit arms into separate businesses. The big firms could also be banned from earning lucrative consultancy fees at businesses they audit. The FRC has admitted there is an \u201cunderlying falling trust in business and the effectiveness of audit\u201d. In October, it rebuked KPMG, the auditor of Carillion. The FRC said it found \u201ca deterioration in the quality of the audits that we inspected to an unacceptable level\u201d. KPMG earned about \u00a31.5m a year vouching for Carillion\u2019s accounts. Reacting to the FRC report last month, Michelle Hinchliffe, the UK head of audit at KPMG, said: \u201cWe are taking action to address these results. We are investing heavily in our audit business to ensure the highest standards of consistency and rigour are applied across all aspects of our work.\u201d Fines issued against auditing firms have gradually risen, although the FRC has persistently been seen as less dynamic than the FCA. In June, it fined PwC \u00a36.5m after the collapse of BHS and handed a 15-year ban to the senior accountant at the firm who audited the department store chain\u2019s accounts.",

      "bodyText": "A strong week for global stocks has ended on an uncertain note at a time of fears over delays to resolve the American trade dispute with China and concerns over rising US interest rates. The FTSE 100 closed down 18 points on Friday, while Wall Street dropped in afternoon trading in New York after the release of strong jobs market data that could push the US Federal Reserve towards raising interest rates next month. The US added 250,000 jobs in October \u2013 in the last jobs report before president Donald Trump faces midterm elections on Tuesday \u2013 while wages grew at their fastest rate for close to a decade. A disappointing Christmas sales forecast from Apple also dragged technology stocks lower. Analysts said the figures suggested further tightening in the labour market that could encourage the Fed to raise interest rates, which could trigger a renewed sell-off in the stock market. Investors have become increasingly concerned in recent months that an increase in borrowing costs could act as a drag on the world economy. Markets rallied over the course of the week, recovering some of the losses incurred during October, which was one of the worst months for financial markets in recent years. Almost $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) was wiped off Wall Street stocks last month, while the FTSE 100 slipped below 7,000 for the first time in six months as it entered correction territory, which is defined as a drop of 10% from its previous peak. Although markets have not clawed back all of their losses, the FTSE 100 gained more than 150 points over the course of the week. It closed down 0.3% on Friday to end the week at 7,094. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 200 points \u2013 just under 1% \u2013 on Friday afternoon after having rallied by more than 700 points since the start of the week. There was apparently positive news for global markets as Trump tweeted that he had held a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, while he also signalled that both countries were making progress towards settling their trade dispute. However, observers sounded a note of caution that the timing of Trump\u2019s comment could be intended to boost Wall Street before the midterm elections. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at the currency trading firm Oanda, said: \u201cTrump has been a cheerleader of the markets since his election victory and the timing of the sell-off will have really frustrated him.\u201d Analysts are also sceptical that the dispute can be easily resolved, while saying it stands to drag down the volume of world trade and trigger a slowdown in the global economy. Economists at Swiss bank UBS said: \u201c[The] US-China tensions run deep and will require more than a cheerful phone call to resolve.\u201d Gregory Daco, chief US economist at the consultancy firm Oxford Economics, said the American economy faced a \u201ctriple policy threat from fading fiscal stimulus, tightening monetary policy and increasing protectionism [that] will bring US GDP growth from a resilient 3% in 2018 below 2% in 2020\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Current and former employees of Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group have come forward to allege a climate of fear, bullying and harassment at the company and dismiss the mogul\u2019s claims that his behaviour was merely \u201cbanter\u201d. In interviews carried out by the Guardian since Green rejected claims of abusive behaviour and insisted \u201cthere was never any intent to be offensive\u201d, Arcadia workers claimed his conduct amounted to \u201cbullying\u201d and said its offices were subject to \u201ca culture of secrecy\u201d. Claims that Green acted inappropriately first emerged last week, but after the mogul insisted his behaviour was just banter, the former and current employees came forward to dispute that. One person who said they had been repeatedly verbally abused and screamed at said in their view the idea that Green\u2019s management style was good-humoured was untrue. \u201c\u2018Banter\u2019 suggests some kind of exchange, or jocular language, but it isn\u2019t,\u201d they claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s one-way, it\u2019s intense, you have to keep your mouth shut.\u201d In the interviews, the former and current employees alleged there was a workplace culture that ranged from the verbally abusive to the surreal, claiming that Green: \u2022 Harangued and threatened people in meetings with expletive-filled diatribes that left his staff feeling humiliated. \u2022 Benefited from an atmosphere where employees were expected to \u201cgrin and bear\u201d his treatment without complaint. \u2022 Flew off the handle in an unpredictable fashion, on one occasion using homophobic language to describe a marketing display involving male models that he then tore down. \u2022 Repeatedly grabbed the bottoms of senior female members of staff. One worker said Green was seen as immune to normal workplace rules. \u201cThe large part of why he\u2019s never held to account \u2013 he\u2019s seen as the owner, that\u2019s the beginning and end of it,\u201d they said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it you know where to go.\u201d \u201cYes there is a grievance procedure,\u201d they added, \u201cbut it\u2019s for everyone else.\u201d Green\u2019s legal team did not respond to a request for comment. Last week, the Guardian reported that Green had made a number of seven-figure payouts to employees who alleged the tycoon had sexually harassed or bullied them. His alleged behaviour was reported after Green was identified as the businessman who obtained an injunction against the Daily Telegraph, preventing the reporting of allegations of harassment that had been the subject of non-disclosure agreements. He has denied claims of \u201cunlawful sexual or racist behaviour\u201d and, in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been in business for more than 40 years. There has obviously from time to time been some banter and a bit of humour, but as far as I\u2019m concerned there was never any intent to be offensive.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m being used as target practice when there is zero [evidence] that anyone has turned up with.\u201d But one person who spoke to the Guardian suggested the reality of working for Green was very different. \u201cI saw so much bullying behaviour,\u201d the employee claimed. They said they had seen him repeatedly slapping employees\u2019 bottoms. They also said Green had been known to throw money at staff in meetings. They said the atmosphere in the Arcadia head office \u201cchanged as soon as [Green] stepped on the floor \u2013 everyone was silent, scared to speak. Nobody wanted to be the person where he finds something on the desk and makes a big thing of it.\u201d Another worker said Green\u2019s behaviour had remained the same for many years. On one occasion more than a decade ago, they alleged, Green said that he would throw the worker out of the window during a meeting. \u201cHe asked me if I could fly. I said no, and he said that\u2019s a pity because I\u2019m going to throw you out,\u201d the worker said. Green still flew into expletive-ridden tirades repeatedly, the worker said. In one recent meeting, they said, Green stormed in and flew into a rage at a senior employee: \u201cHe was shouting, \u2018What the fuck are you thinking? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? What a waste of time.\u2019\u201d The behaviour was seen as so extreme that eventually another senior employee intervened. On another occasion, a different source said, one senior employee was sent out of a meeting on to a balcony in the pouring rain because their results were considered disappointing. But they suggested Green did not appear to be concerned about the consequences of his management style. \u201cYou hear a lot about people crying,\u201d they said. \u201cI think he takes delight in it, he likes to be seen to have an effect.\u201d He has also sometimes appeared to become angry about anything he perceives as a negative brand association. Earlier this year, Topshop was forced to apologise and make a donation to charity after an in-store pop-up promotion for a feminist book was cancelled, allegedly after Green saw it and objected vigorously. On another occasion, a source was present when Green saw an advertising campaign featuring young male models during a presentation in head office and reacted badly. He is alleged to have said: \u201cTake down this gay shit, this isn\u2019t the gay shit I want in the building.\u201d He then started to rip the posters down from the display, the source claimed, before telling others to help because some were out of his reach. Green has felt at liberty to pinch the cheeks of men and women who work for him, the worker said, and regularly used patronising language when speaking to women. \u201cWhen he swears in meetings he says, \u2018Please excuse my French, girls,\u2019\u201d a source said. \u201cIt\u2019s language from the 1970s.\u201d The source said that on one occasion, Green refused to stop calling a female employee \u201clove\u201d and \u201cdarling\u201d and use her name instead, as she had asked. They added that senior members of staff were also to blame for failing to stop Green\u2019s behaviour. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they condone it, but they don\u2019t do anything to prevent it, they don\u2019t stop anything,\u201d they said. They said one employee was recently told to \u201cput on your game face\u201d when under attack from Green, which they added was a common phrase used in feedback. The employee summarised the message as: \u201cJust grin and bear it like you enjoy it. What a ridiculous thing to ask.\u201d Asked why the claims against Green had not previously been exposed or questions raised over his behaviour, the former workers said people\u2019s concern for their jobs and a climate of deference and fear were to blame. People were unwilling to be named, one source said, \u201cbecause no one is willing to lose their jobs. You can\u2019t take a stand.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a culture of secrecy,\u201d another said. \u201cPeople who worked closely with him turned blind eyes.\u201d An insider speaks Working for Sir Philip Green felt like being in an \u201cabusive relationship,\u201d a former senior insider at Arcadia Group told the Guardian. \u201cHe\u2019s been like this forever but none of us talk about it. There was all this development support and training and on that side the company was amazing. All the systems were in place to have a decent career. But I felt he was constantly abusive to me. \u201cI would get calls early in the morning and late at night and when I was on holiday. It was, \u201cWhat the fucking hell are you doing you fuckwit?\u201d It was a constant barrage of effing as if there was no other way of communicating. You just tried to avoid it. \u201cHe would [shout abuse] in front of everyone. He would stand in front of my team shouting down the phone [at me], it all seemed like bravado and show. It was like we were in an abusive, weird relationship because we were well paid and loved our jobs. We didn\u2019t want someone like that to take what we loved to do away from us. He is greedy and he doesn\u2019t really appear to understand fashion. He\u2019s a trader. He would make you deal with suppliers that we felt didn\u2019t have the right quality or infrastructure. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything to do with racial abuse or sexual harassment. I didn\u2019t think that of him. Verbal abuse, yes, bullying, absolutely; but the rest of it was way beyond me. It felt like he didn\u2019t care as long as you were making him money. You could have been yellow with blue stripes. \u201cI left because I couldn\u2019t bear it any more. I didn\u2019t want to be whipped any more. In my view he should never have been given that knighthood. This feels [like] it is about rich people getting away with stuff. It made him feel better to rant and shout and swear. That\u2019s his language.\u201d As told to Sarah Butler",

His alleged behaviour was reported after Green was identified as the businessman who obtained an injunction against the Daily Telegraph, preventing the reporting of allegations of harassment that had been the subject of non-disclosure agreements.</p> <p>He has denied claims of \u201cunlawful sexual or racist behaviour\u201d and, in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been in business for more than 40 years. There has obviously from time to time been some banter and a bit of humour, but as far as I\u2019m concerned there was never any intent to be offensive.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI\u2019m being used as target practice when there is zero [evidence] that anyone has turned up with.\u201d</p> <p>But one person who spoke to the Guardian suggested the reality of working for Green was very different. \u201cI saw so much bullying behaviour,\u201d the employee claimed.</p> <p>They said they had seen him repeatedly slapping employees\u2019 bottoms. They also said Green had been known to throw money at staff in meetings.</p> <p>They said the atmosphere in the Arcadia head office \u201cchanged as soon as [Green] stepped on the floor \u2013 everyone was silent, scared to speak. Nobody wanted to be the person where he finds something on the desk and makes a big thing of it.\u201d</p> <p>Another worker said Green\u2019s behaviour had remained the same for many years. On one occasion more than a decade ago, they alleged, Green said that he would throw the worker out of the window during a meeting. \u201cHe asked me if I could fly. I said no, and he said that\u2019s a pity because I\u2019m going to throw you out,\u201d the worker said.</p> <p>Green still flew into expletive-ridden tirades repeatedly, the worker said. In one recent meeting, they said, Green stormed in and flew into a rage at a senior employee: \u201cHe was shouting, \u2018What the fuck are you thinking? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? What a waste of time.\u2019\u201d The behaviour was seen as so extreme that eventually another senior employee intervened. On another occasion, a different source said, one senior employee was sent out of a meeting on to a balcony in the pouring rain because their results were considered disappointing.</p> <p>But they suggested Green did not appear to be concerned about the consequences of his management style. \u201cYou hear a lot about people crying,\u201d they said. \u201cI think he takes delight in it, he likes to be seen to have an effect.\u201d</p> <p>He has also sometimes appeared to become angry about anything he perceives as a negative brand association.

Builders blamed the uncertainty surrounding the government\u2019s Brexit talks for a jittery housing market and their response, which was to complete fewer homes than planned. However, a surge in infrastructure work and civil engineering meant the sector bounced back from a six-month low in September, though not to higher levels of activity seen in July. The IHS/Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the construction industry improved to 53.2 in October after dipping to 52.1 in September, from 52.9 in August and a 14-month high of 55.8 in July.

This followed robust gains over the previous three months that meant output was up 2.9% in the three months to August compared with the three months to May. Howard Archer, the chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said October\u2019s reading was below the third-quarter average of 53.6: \u201cWhile construction activity improved in October, there was a disappointing softening in new orders which grew at the slowest rate since May. This was reportedly influenced by concerns over Brexit and the economy. \u201cFurther worrying news saw construction companies\u2019 confidence about output prospects for the next 12 months weaken to the lowest level for nearly six years.\u201d Nevertheless, building companies are still on the lookout for more staff to overcome shortages that have been exacerbated by the Brexit vote and a decline in the number of skilled migrants from eastern Europe looking for work.",

The CMA added that the practice not only meant that rivals were unable to offer discounts, but also that it was more likely to lead to higher commission rates paid to the sites, with the costs being passed on to consumers.

      "bodyText": "With the words of Donald Trump, we are closing for the week. Thank you for following business live today. JJ US president Donald Trump wasted little time in hailing the jobs report, encouraging Americans to back his party in the upcoming midterm elections. Stock prices traded in New York opened mostly higher on Friday after employment data showed a healthy addition of jobs in the US economy and the strongest wage growth in almost a decade. Apple falls as US markets open Dow Jones Industrial average gains 140 points, or 0.5%, at the open. However, Apple shares fall by about 6% in early trading. December rate hike plus three more in 2019, says ING Unemployment in the US was last lower in 1969, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. Payrolls growth has accelerated from an average of 182,000 per month in 2017 to 213,000 per month in 2018. The economy is booming and the bigger struggle for companies is actually finding labour to fill their vacancies. More reaction from economists to the data, with thoughts turning to the next rate-setting meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting body. Josie Dent, an economist, Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Today\u2019s positive jobs data increase the likelihood that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise interest rates in the coming months from their current rate of between 2% and 2.25%. The central bank\u2019s boss, Jerome Powell, has been relatively hawkish in his rhetoric recently, paving the way to higher rates over the course of 2019. However, market volatility will give the FOMC pause, she added. Despite the strong jobs market data, higher than expected Q3 GDP growth and bullish narrative from Powell, FOMC members will be cautious going into the meeting next week due to the considerable stock market corrections seen over the past month. The pace of wage growth is good news for the US president, Donald Trump, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe in New York. In September wages were 3.1% higher than they were a year ago \u2013 the first time since April 2009 that wage growth has topped 3%. Despite the record-breaking streak of jobs growth, wage rises have remained stubbornly since the end of the recession. Americans go to the polls on 6 November, with both houses of Congress in play. Hurricane effects? The bumper 250,000 gain followed a more modest 118,000 increase in September, but Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, cautions that hurricane disruption in September may be affecting the data. It\u2019s possible that we could be in for another 200,000 plus number in November, as the remainder of those disruptions is reversed. While the headline US unemployment figure did not tick lower, there is a clear downward trend across demographic groups \u2013 a factor in the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking. The key question for investors is whether wage growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. Kully Samra, vice president at Charles Schwab, said: October\u2019s data shows the labour market is tightening even further. Significant wage growth since last month, combined with high consumer confidence, underpins our belief that the US will see solid economic growth into next year. However, despite a growing economy, there are signs that volatility is returning. Companies, especially tech giants, are reporting mixed earnings and the market still expects ongoing trade wars to hit stocks further. The chance of a rate rise in December has slipped slightly, but concerns remain that too many interest rate hikes too soon could impact domestic growth as the cost of borrowing increases. Inflation pressure building? Wage growth came in at 3.1%, the first time it has topped 3% since 2009. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added 250,000 jobs in October, far above consensus estimates of 190,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%. US non-farm payrolls are due shortly, at 12:30 GMT The US jobs gauge will be closely watched by economists and investors for signs of lower unemployment, which could spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a quicker pace. Reuters\u2019 poll of forecasters shows that economists believe the US economy added 190,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate is expected to stay steady at 3.7%, although some economists believe it could fall to 3.6%. Cold water on today\u2019s Trump bounce? US president Donald Trump\u2019s optimism on a trade deal with China at the end of the month may be overdone, according to CNBC\u2019s Washington correspondent, Eamon Javers. Remember, Trump\u2019s Republican party has mid-term elections imminent. European markets remain well into positive territory, however. Two people stabbed at Sony Music\u2019s London HQ Two people are believed to have been stabbed in an incident at Sony Music\u2019s London headquarters, with armed police on the scene. The incident at the High Street Kensington offices is ongoing. More details here. FTSE 100 hits three-week high London\u2019s blue-chip index hit its highest point since 10 October this morning, having gained just shy of 1%. Approaching midday in London, Standard Chartered is leading the FTSE 100 risers, with shares up by 4.7%. No danger of Italy leaving the EU says Juncker Amid the risk-on mood on European markets, it is worth remembering that significant political uncertainty is hanging over the EU in the form of the dispute between Italy and the European Commission. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker today told Austrian radio station ORF that there is no danger of Italy leaving the euro. Manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) data from the Eurozone earlier showed the Italian sector contracted during October, amid a broader economic slowdown. Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, described the PMI data as \u201cgrim\u201d reading. The alarming decline in in the Italian index is the stand-out detail to the downside, raising further downside risks for the economy amid an already stalling economy in Q3. An outright GDP contraction is now well within the realms of possibility in coming quarters. Apple concerns after earnings report While stock markets on the whole are still enjoying positive momentum from the Trump\u2019s optimism on trade with China, Apple is the unlikely outlier giving investors pause ahead of the open of US indices. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch have downgraded their rating of the stock from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d, after Apple reported lower shipments of iPhones than expected. The firm will also stop disclosing unit shipments in future, a warning sign for analysts. Jordan Chalfin, a technology analyst at US research house Creditsights, said the move will \u201cmake it harder to analyse operating trends, and we are disappointed with the reduced transparency.\u201d Apple shares fell by as much as 7% in after-hours trading, setting it up for a steep fall when the Nasdaq stock exchange opens in New York. The last note to be launched was the plastic tenner featuring Jane Austen, the author. She was chosen after a public campaign to nominate a woman. In money news of a different variety, the Bank of England today launched its campaign to nominate the new face of its \u00a350 note. Governor Mark Carney wants a scientist (and a dead one at that) to grace the new notes, which will be the latest to get a plastic makeover. Computing pioneer Ada Lovelace is one possible contender, alongside Stephen Hawking and Nobel prize-winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, write the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Collinson and Ian Sample. Midway through the morning, European indices are holding on to most of their early gains. Crossrail chief executive to leave Simon Wright, the chief executive of Crossrail, will be replaced by the head of the London Underground following the government\u2019s \u00a3350m bailout of the struggling project. The giant Crossrail project, officially known as the Elizabeth line, has been plagued by delays, meaning it will miss its scheduled opening in December by almost a year. Wright has only been in the role since March, after Andrew Wolstenholme stepped down. Crossrail initially said Wright would \u201csee out the remaining phase of our work through to the handover of completed assets to Transport for London\u201d. Transport for London and Crossrail have announced that Mark Wild will become chief executive, starting on Monday 19 November. Wild is currently managing director of London Underground. He will return to the role once the Elizabeth line has opened through the central London stretch. The construction PMI reading remains \u201cabove the magic 50 mark\u201d \u2013 indicating a continued expansion in output \u2013 says Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for infrastructure and construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. The October reading was \u201cfairly modest\u201d, he said, \u201cneither racing ahead nor stuck in the doldrums\u201d. The commercial segment appears to be being sustained by urban-focused developers responding to the still-buoyant growth of many regional cities, while the UK\u2019s insatiable appetite for online shopping is driving the construction of distribution space in and around key transport hubs. However, the possibility of Brexit disruption still looms, and the big construction firms who make up the survey (and the majority of UK building work) are also going to have to adapt to the end of the private finance initiative, after chancellor Philip Hammond announced its end at the budget on Monday. The current output figures look fairly solid for the construction industry \u2013 at least in comparison to the last two years \u2013 with the second-strongest expansion in the last 16 months. Civil engineering \u2013 big infrastructure projects like roads and railways \u2013 was the biggest driver of the output increase, after weakness earlier in the year, IHS Markit said. But the forward-looking indicators \u201cpaint a less rosy picture for the sector\u201d, said Trevor Balchin, the firm\u2019s economics director. New contracts increased at only a modest pace, and firms were the least optimistic regarding the 12-month outlook for nearly six years. Construction companies again linked uncertainty to Brexit negotiations, which influenced delays to final decisions at clients. Breaking: UK construction output rises but outlook weak The construction purchasing managers index (PMI), which is closely followed by economists, rose from a six-month low in September to a reading of 53.2 points for October, according to data firm IHS Markit. However, the index measuring business expectations fell to its weakest since December 2012. Sterling is on course for its second best week of the year so far in the wake of the Bank of England\u2019s latest interest rate decision. The pound had its best day of 2018 so far on Thursday thanks to a combination of positive reports on Brexit talks and a relatively sanguine Bank of England. Against the US dollar sterling edged up by around 0.2% this morning, hitting its highest since 23 October at $1.3037. Against the euro sterling was flat. The new optimism on Brexit followed a Times report that a deal on financial services trade between the UK and the EU had been agreed, although the reports were swiftly downplayed by the government. Some City economists think the Bank of England, meanwhile, is laying the groundwork for further rate hikes next year, provided there is a smooth Brexit transition. MUFG\u2019s Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research, and Fritz Louw, currency analyst, wrote: Given [signs of wage growth] and resilient household confidence and momentum, the BoE maintained that gradual rate hikes were appropriate but that they could quicken the pace of hikes in the event of an orderly Brexit. Bank deputy governor Ben Broadbent, Mark Carney\u2019s number two, did not reveal much further about the central bank\u2019s plans in an interview on the BBC\u2019s Today programme this morning. He reiterated the Bank\u2019s line that faster wage growth is coming, while saying that the European outlook may be less negative than recent weak GDP data might suggest. US president Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed has set the tone for early trading. He said his \u201clong and very good conversation\u201d with Chinese president Xi Jinping last night had \u201ca heavy emphasis on Trade\u201d, with a capital T. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said Trump wants to reach a trade agreement with China at the G20 meeting in Argentina, scheduled for the end of November. He has asked officials to start drafting possible terms, the report said. Markets across Europe appear to have welcomed the news, with synchronised index rises. The Stoxx Europe 600, which tracks the biggest firms (including London\u2019s FTSE 100), rose by 1%. However, the economists are doing their job and playing Cassandra. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, said: Before breaking out the beautiful chocolate cake, it is worth remembering that China would also have to agree, and has the capacity to hold out against current sanctions. The US has also been sending somewhat mixed messages, with the US Department of Justice accusing a Chinese state-owned firm of stealing semiconductor trade secrets. Trump has told rallies he wants the \u201cright\u201d deal with China. As Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote: \u201cIt all comes down to your definition of \u2018right\u2019.\u201d Note his comments came as the US Justice Department is stepping up actions against China in cases of suspected economic espionage and as trade dove [Larry] Kudlow cautioned that Trump would \u201caggressively\u201d pursue his agenda against China. It\u2019s worth taking a look at just how much Asia\u2019s stock exchanges gained overnight. A thawing in the relationship between the US and China could give investors a reason to get back into Asian equities after a punishing year \u2013 the Hang Seng is still down by 11% in the year to date. Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now. Combined with the prospects of more economic stimulus from China and reasonable valuations in Asian equities, investors could use this opportunity to reload on emerging market and Asia assets. The US dollar is still edging higher but Asia has been more resilient on handling greenback strength than other emerging markets. The FTSE 100 has taken its cue from Asian trading at the open, bouncing by more than 1% in its first few minutes before retreating to a 0.8% gain. The positive sentiment is spreading across Europe, with Italian shares up by 1.2%. Investors in Sweden, Poland and even Russia are having a good time. The agenda: Donald Trump trade deal hint Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. US president Donald Trump has already fired up stock markets this morning after showing optimism on the trade relationship with China. Trump spoke to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, appearing to give hope of progress at the G20 meetings at the end of this month. Asian markets have risen across the board. The CSI 300 index, which tracks stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rose by 3.56%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 3.79%. However, investors are not quite popping the champagne corks just yet. Robert Carnell, chief economist at ING, said: I\u2019m not entirely sure what to make of this. But it feels too big a change of direction following the [vice president] Mike Pence speech some weeks ago to be taken literally. It certainly isn\u2019t in synch with the latest charge of a Chinese company for conspiring to steal trade secrets. Whether Trump has set the tone for the day will in large part depend on the outturn of US employment data, which is closely scrutinised by traders across the world for signs of inflationary pressure in the American economy. The non-farm payrolls will be published at 12:30pm, with average hourly earnings and the unemployment rate the key data. In the UK the Bank of England\u2019s top officials are busy doing the media rounds to explain why they held back from raising interest rates \u2013 and warned they could go both ways in the event of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit. Bank deputy governor Ben Broadbent today told the BBC that faster wage growth will help real household incomes \u2013 a welcome sign for Britons after one of the worst decades for wage growth in the last century. In Europe, meanwhile, investors will be eagerly awaiting the results of the European Banking Authority\u2019s latest stress tests of the banking sector, to be published at 5pm in London, where the watchdog is based (for now). Some 48 banks have been put under the microscope, with the regulator looking at how risky the assets held by the lenders are \u2013 and how they would withstand a shock. Italian banks\u2019 results will be particularly scrutinised amid political uncertainty over the prospects for the country\u2019s public finances. The agenda \u20229am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing report for October \u20229:30am GMT: UK construction report for October \u202212:30pm GMT: US employment data for October \u20225pm GMT: European Banking Authority stress tests",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is to ask the public to nominate a scientist as the face of the new plastic \u00a350 note, with Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician known as the \u201cgrandmother of computing\u201d, an early frontrunner alongside Stephen Hawking and Nobel prizewinner Dorothy Hodgkin. In the light of the \u201cBoaty McBoatface\u201d fiasco, the Bank said it would not be bound by a public vote but would instead open a six-week window for names of scientists to be put forward for its \u201ccharacter selection process\u201d. The scientist must be British and dead, as the Queen is the only living person featured on a Bank of England note. The person could be either male or female, although as no woman has ever featured on the reverse side of the \u00a350 note the Bank is expected to come under pressure to select one. Women in the frame include Lovelace, the chemist Dorothy Hodgkin and Rosalind Franklin, who played a crucial role in decoding the structure of DNA. Hawking, who died in March, is likely to be a popular choice. The move immediately sparked debate among scientists with Prof Brian Cox tweeting his support for Hawking. Although the bank would generally expect candidates to have been deceased for 20 years or more, it said Hawking would still be eligible and it expected to receive nominations for him. The Bank governor, Mark Carney, said: \u201cI am delighted that the new \u00a350 will celebrate the UK\u2019s contribution to science. There is a wealth of individuals whose work has shaped how we think about the world and who continue to inspire people today.\u201d Venki Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, the UK\u2019s leading academy of scientists, said: \u201cI would personally pick Dorothy Hodgkin, the only female Briton to have won a science Nobel prize. We can thank Dorothy for revealing the three-dimensional structures of many biologically important molecules such as penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, as well as inspiring several generations of leading crystallographers.\u201d The decision to select a scientist ends a number of popular campaigns launched in recent weeks. A petition to have the \u00a350 note feature England and Leicester City football defender Harry Maguire riding an inflatable unicorn won the support of 53,000 people. It proved more popular than a rival petition to \u201cPut Maggie [Thatcher] on the Fifty,\u201d which garnered just 18,000 signatures. But it also rules out the campaign, supported by political figures including Sayeeda Warsi and the transport minister Nusrat Ghani, to honour Noor Inayat Khan who spied for Britain in occupied France during the second world war and was posthumously awarded the George Cross. She would have been the first Muslim, indeed the first member of any ethnic minority group, to feature on a Bank of England note. Despite the rise of the cashless society and popularity of contactless payments, the Bank of England said demand for the \u00a350 note is continuing to rise. There are 330m \u00a350 notes in circulation with a combined value of \u00a316.5bn. The current note features Matthew Boulton and James Watt, whose steam engines led to the mechanisation of factories and mills. The Bank is yet to set a date for the new note to go into circulation. It has only said that it will launch after the polymer \u00a320 is introduced in 2020, featuring the painter JMW Turner. Potential candidates Dorothy Hodgkin (1910-1994) The only British woman to become a Nobel science laureate. Hodgkin won the 1964 chemistry prize for her pioneering work on protein crystallography and the structures of vitamin B12 and penicillin. Her work helped to unravel the detailed 3D structures of proteins, including insulin. Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) Tutored in mathematics, Lovelace met Charles Babbage at a party in her teens and was wowed by a demonstration of his mechanical calculator, the Engine. She worked closely with Babbage and foresaw how computers might process more than mere numbers, and one day perhaps create music. She is credited with publishing the world\u2019s first computer program. Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) Franklin perfected her skills as an X-ray crystallographer in Paris before returning to King\u2019s College London where she took on the challenge of decoding the structure of DNA. During a visit to the lab, her Cambridge competitors James Watson and Francis Crick saw her beautiful, unpublished \u201cphoto 51\u201d, which helped them to create their model of the DNA double helix. After her death at 37 from ovarian cancer, Crick said her contribution had been crucial. Mary Anning (1799-1847) Born to a poor family in Lyme Regis, Anning spent her free time scouring the Dorset coastline for what she called \u201ccuriosities\u201d. These odd pieces of stone turned out to be fossils and Anning went on to identify spectacular ichthyosaur, plesiosaur and pterosaur skeletons, along with fossilised fish and other marine creatures. Alan Turing (1912-1954) Mathematician and computer scientist who played a pivotal role in cracking the top-secret German military Enigma codes while at Bletchley Park during the second world war. Along with fellow code-breaker Gordon Welchman he developed the \u201cBombe\u201d which from late 1940 was decoding all messages sent by the Enigma machines. After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. He was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, but rather than go to prison he accepted chemical castration. He took his own life in 1954 from cyanide poisoning. Fred Sanger (1918-2013) Born in Rendcomb, Gloucestershire, Sanger is the only Briton - and one of only four people in history \u2013 to win the Nobel prize twice. A Quaker and a conscientious objector in the second world war, he excelled at biochemistry and won his first Nobel in 1958 for identifying the amino acids that build up the insulin molecule. He went on to devise a way to sequence DNA earning his second chemistry prize in 1980. The Sanger Sequencing Method was the main technique used in the 1990 Human Genome Project which decoded the biological blueprints of human life. Stephen Hawking (1942-2018) The cosmologist spent 30 years as the Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge University, a post held by giants such as Isaac Newton, Charles Babbage and Paul Dirac. He became a towering figure in a career defined by insights into the origins of the universe, the nature of spacetime, and the perplexing mysteries of black holes, which Hawking famously concluded were not black after all. His 1988 book, A Brief History of Time, sold more than 10m copies. Sir Peter Medawar (1915-1987) The doctor, scientific philosopher, and writer is known as the \u201cfather of transplantation\u201d for research that won the Nobel prize in 1960. His work revealed how the immune system rejects foreign tissues and so cleared the way for modern transplant surgery.",

      "bodyText": "House prices are forecast to rise strongly in northern England, the Midlands, Wales and Scotland over the next five years, far outstripping London\u2019s single-digit rate and reversing the trend of previous decades, according to a report. Savills, the upmarket estate agent, predicts that prices will increase fastest in north-west England over the next five years, at 21.6%. Other areas where Savills forecasts above-average growth are Yorkshire &amp; Humberside (20.5%), followed by the east and west Midlands and Wales ( 19.3%), Scotland (18.2%) and the north-east (17.6%). By contrast, London prices are forecast to rise 4.5%, although prime central London is set for 12.4% growth, as the top end of the housing market bounces back from the price declines seen in recent months. House prices across the UK are expected to climb by 14.8% on average between 2019 and 2023. This increase would add about \u00a332,000 to the average house price by the end of 2023, taking it to \u00a3248,086. Savills said that stricter mortgage lending rules introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis would limit price increases but would also protect the market from a crash. The return to growth in London overall will take far longer than expected, with buyers struggling to afford purchases and interest rate rises expected to occur earlier than previously assumed. Savills forecasts that London house prices will fall 2% this year. They are expected remain flat in 2020 before rising by 2.5% in 2021. A year ago, it was predicting a flat outcome in 2019 and 5% price growth in 2020. This reverses the trend stretching back to the 1980s for house prices in the capital to grow at a faster rate than the rest of the UK. In the past 1o years, London values rocketed nearly 67%, putting it far ahead of all other regions. Property price growth in the south-east and east of England will also lag behind the UK average in the next five years, with a forecast of 9.3% growth for each region. There is likely to be a 12.6% increase in the south-west. Lucian Cook, Savills head of residential research, said: \u201cBrexit angst is a major factor for market sentiment right now, particularly in London but it\u2019s the legacy of the global financial crisis \u2013 mortgage regulation in particular \u2013 combined with gradually rising interest rates that will really shape the market over the longer term. \u201cThat legacy will limit house price growth but it should also protect the market from a correction.\u201d The forecasts come a day after a report from Nationwide, Britain\u2019s biggest building society, showed that UK house prices are rising at the slowest annual pace in more than five years. The average property value rose 1.6% in October to \u00a3214,534 from a year ago, down from September\u2019s 2%, and the lowest annual growth rate since May 2013. The squeeze on household budgets and the uncertain economic outlook is likely to have dampened demand, even though borrowing costs remain low by historic standards and unemployment is at 40-year lows, Nationwide said. It still expects house prices across the UK to rise by about 1% this year on average.",

      "bodyText": "Asian shares have surged on reports that Donald Trump wants to reach an agreement with Chinese president Xi Jinping about the trade dispute that has dogged markets for months. The US president spoke to Xi on Thursday and later tweeted that trade talks with China were \u201cmoving along nicely\u201d ahead of face-to-face talks between the pair at the G20 summit in Argentina later this month. But Bloomberg later reported that the phone call \u2013 in which Trump and Xi both expressed optimism about resolving their bitter trade disputes \u2013 prompted Trump to ask officials to begin drafting potential terms. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that the telephone call between the two leaders was quite positive and that the pair believed they should \u201cenhance trade relations\u201d. The reports lit a fire under stock markets that have beset by fears of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The Nikkei was up 2.5% in Tokyo, the Hang Seng climbed 3.7% in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite was up 3.3%. In South Korea, where the export-oriented economy has showed signs of a downturn, the Kospi index had its best day for seven years, jumping 3.5%. The ASX200 in Sydney had already closed up a more modest 0.14% when news of a possible deal came through. US stock futures rose 0.7% and the FTSE100 is set for a jump of almost 1% when it opens in London on Friday morning. France\u2019s CAC and Germany\u2019s DAX are expected to enjoy similar gains. In currencies the dollar eased, signalling some relief for emerging markets, while the pound climbed above $1.30. The US and China\u2019s tit-for-tat tariffs on each other\u2019s goods have rumbled on for months as Trump pledges to help create more US manufacturing jobs. The tariffs have been blamed for a weakening of China\u2019s mighty manufacturing sector which this week showed a marked slowdown in activity. Trump administration officials have said that trade talks with China cannot resume until Beijing comes up with specific actions it is willing take to meet US demands for sweeping changes to policies on technology transfers, industrial subsidies and market access. The two countries already have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods and Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on the remainder of China\u2019s $500 billion-plus exports to the United States if the disputes cannot be resolved. The trade dispute has also forced the yuan to fall in value but on Friday it was stronger for the first time this week, also helped by Xi\u2019s pledge on Thursday of more support for private firms. Tai Hui at JPMorgan Asset Management said a stabilising trade relationship between US and China and more stimulus from Beijing would be the key ingredients to revive market confidence in Asia. \u201cWhile we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now,\u201d he told Bloomberg.",

      "bodyText": "The number of households already in debt to their energy supplier before winter begins has grown by more than 300,000 in the past year, according to research, with a total of nearly \u00a3400m owed to power companies. Following a round of price hikes, the amount of debt collectively owed to energy companies in the UK hit \u00a3393m in October, an increase of almost a quarter on the same time last year. Fuel poverty campaigners said the figures were a reminder of the \u201chuge anxiety\u201d many people faced this winter, worrying whether they could afford to turn the heating on. Households are usually expected to be in credit by this time of year, ahead of the higher electricity and gas consumption to come in the colder months. But research by the consumer website uSwitch found a 10th of them, 2.93 million, were in debt to their supplier, up from 2.62 million in October 2017. They owed an average of \u00a3134 each. Consumers have been hit by two years of price hikes as wholesale costs have gone up, with some of the big six suppliers putting up tariffs twice this year. Rik Smith, an energy expert at uSwitch, said: \u201cWith winter just around the corner, it\u2019s important that households use this time to tackle rising bills. After so many price rises this year a lot of people may have received a price rise notification over the summer but not switched to a cheaper deal.\u201d Fuel poverty groups said the government, regulators and the industry must do more to help the poorest this winter. \u201cMillions of people are approaching this winter with dread and will face unmanageable situations. Those who are repaying large or growing energy debts often don\u2019t turn the heating on at all, despite knowing it could badly damage their or their families\u2019 health,\u201d said Peter Smith, the director of policy and research at National Energy Action. About half of those in arrears said they would either pay it off in a lump sum or by increasing their direct debit payments. The rest either hoped the debt would \u201cgo down naturally over time\u201d, or planned to agree a repayment plan with their supplier or fit a prepayment meter, or did not know. uSwitch arrived at the figures by extrapolating the results of an Opinium poll of 2,000 adults to the UK\u2019s 27 million households. Official forecasts expect fuel poverty to worsen this year because of tariffs going up. The industry body Energy UK said: \u201cIf customers are struggling, the most important thing is to get in touch with their energy supplier as soon as possible so they can provide help and support.\u201d",
