      "bodyText": "TSB customers must wait until Tuesday morning to find out if they can get into their online bank accounts. The bank itself seems to have gone quiet (customer service shut down at 11pm and reopens at 7am). So we\u2019re going to wrap up for the day too. Goodnight, and good luck to everyone affected by these problems. GW Photographer, and Green Party candidate, Nicola Albon confirms that the problems still aren\u2019t resolved.... TSB customer Nick Mays says he\u2019s finally got online.....but is still planning take his business elsewhere. Other customers are worried that the problems won\u2019t be fixed by Tuesday morning.... One TSB mortgage-holder got a rather nasty shock when she managed to log into her account: Becky Dracup of Liverpool is another less-than-satisfied customer tonight, after struggling to speak to anyone at TSB: TSB\u2019s IT woes make the front page of the Financial Times tomorrow. The FT focuses on the prospect that City and data watchdogs will savage the bank, saying: Regulators are probing computer problems at TSB that left many customers of the UK bank unable to check their accounts and gave some access to other people\u2019s money after it switched to new systems over the weekend. The problems, which provoked a flurry of complaints on social media, followed a scheduled shutdown of TSB\u2019s online and mobile banking applications over the weekend while it transferred 1.3bn customer records from its former parent Lloyds Banking Group. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office \u2014 the UK privacy watchdog \u2014 said: \u201cWe are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.\u201d The Financial Conduct Authority said it was \u201caware of the issue\u201d and was \u201cliaising with the firm\u201d.... More here. As we head into the night, TSB are still telling customers that they don\u2019t know when the IT outage will be fixed. TSB\u2019s chief executive Paul Pester has kept a low profile today - he\u2019s not tweeted about the IT problems at all. Liberal Democrat peer Paul Scriven has laid into Pester on Twitter this evening, calling for answers about what\u2019s gone wrong: Bookseller Isabel MacNeill would also like to hear from Pester: It\u2019s now 27 hours since TSB\u2019s migration to a new IT platform was meant to conclude - and some users, such as GMB official Rachelle Wilkins, are still in the dark: Data visualisation firm Bright Analytics is worried that it won\u2019t be able to pay its employees, or settle other bills, until TSB fixes its problems: Many users are still reporting that TSB is refusing to accept their login details, including PR and social media executive Cara Elizabeth: Time for a quick recap, for anyone tuning in or seeking the latest information. UK bank TSB is struggling to get to grips with a botched system upgrade that has left some customers unable to use online and mobile banking services. TSB\u2019s services were meant to come online at 6pm Sunday night, following a major IT migration over the weekend. But scores of users report that they\u2019re still unable to access banking services, more than a day later. There\u2019s no clarity on when the situation will be fixed, leaving customers unable to pay bills, check they have received money, or access other banking services. Some customers have even reported seeing the wrong account details, sparking fears of a data breach. TSB has repeatedly apologised, insisting that it is working as hard as it can to fix the issue. But many customers are demanding compensation, and threatening to leave the bank. The project involved moving TSB away from systems owned by Lloyds Banking Group (who spun out TSB in 2013), and onto a new IT platform. TSB\u2019s owner, Spain\u2019s Sabedell, has risked further anger by claiming that the migration has been a success - even as UK customers reported problems. UK regulators are now monitoring the situation. TSB could potentially be fined by the Financial Conduct Authority (the City watchdog) and the Information Commissioner. This is important. Any TSB customers who discover an unexpected windfall in their accounts this week should not rush out and spend it. If you do, you could be forced to pay it back... or worse. Lee Boyce of This Is Money explains: Legally, if a sum of cash is accidentally paid into your account and you know it isn\u2019t yours, you are liable to pay it back. Keeping and spending money wrongly placed into your account could lead to you being charged with retaining wrongful credit under the Theft Act 1968. Two sisters were sent to prison in 2008 after going on a spending spree with cash that wasn\u2019t theirs. The then Abbey Bank had wrongly credited \u00a3135,000 into one of their accounts. It took the bank two weeks to spot the mistake. The official advice is to contact your bank and alert it to the mistake - but many TSB customers say that call waiting times are currently extremely long as it battles the meltdown. Criminal paralegal James Ashton has found himself caught up in TSB\u2019s problems: TSB\u2019s hard-pressed social media team are repeating the same generic statement to scores of customers, along the lines of: We\u2019re really sorry to hear that you\u2019re experiencing problems accessing Online Banking. Unfortunately, there are some intermittent problems affecting this service so please bear with us. We\u2019re working as hard as we can to resolve this. In the meantime, please try again later and sorry once more for the inconvenience. That really isn\u2019t enough to address the concerns of customers who can\u2019t make payments, or even check how much money is in their account. For example: One of the most alarming elements of this mess is that some TSB customers say they saw the account details of other customers - a potentially serious breach. One account holder, called Matthew Neal, says he logged last night and found himself looking at someone else\u2019s \u00a335,000 savings account,plus an \u00a311,000 Isa, and a business account! TSB claims to have such issues, but other customers have reported similar problems today: Britain\u2019s financial ombudsman, which mediates on complaints between customers and financial firms, is also taking an interest: TSB\u2019s systems were meant to be up and running after its IT migration 24 hours ago. But instead, its social media account is being hammered by increasingly angry customers, who STILL can\u2019t get into their accounts. The list now includes a contestant from this year\u2019s series of MasterChef, furniture designer Fiona Harris: TSB risks being hit with a hefty fine for the problems suffered by its customers, says Iain Withers of the Telegraph. He writes: Both the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) said they were monitoring the situation. The watchdogs have the power to investigate and potentially fine TSB for a system failure or data breach respectively. Research technician Cameron Hill has found a way back into his TSB account...... I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t test it myself, but it might be worth attempting..... TSB\u2019s parent company, Banca Sabadell, thinks the IT migration is a success! It has released a press release trumpeting the move, even though TSB has admitted there have been problems. Apparently the new IT platform is a \u201cmilestone\u201d for the bank (although it may feel more like a millstone for some customers right now). It says: Banco Sabadell has successfully completed the TSB technology migration. The implementation of the new Proteo4UK platform represents a new milestone in the history of Banco Sabadell Group, and particularly in its progress in terms of the bank\u2019s internationalisation. It is also the first ever project outside of Spain in which the bank has created a new banking platform from scratch and completed a large scale migration of the platform. The Chairman, Josep Oliu, has emphasised that \u201cwith this migration, Sabadell has proven its technological management capacity, not only in national migrations, but also on an international scale. The new Proteo4UK platform is an excellent starting point for the organic growth of the business and the improvement of TSB\u2019s efficiency\u201d. Oliu also stated that \u201cmore than 5.4 million customers are now integrated into the new platform, which allows us to grow in a market as mature and highly competitive as the UK market.\u201d Equally, the Chairman has also stated that the migration will provide a \u201cgreater competitive capacity and increased value creation for our franchise\u201d. City AM\u2019s Emma Haslett points out that TSB hopes to slash its costs through this IT move. Perhaps some of those saving could be put towards a compensation pot for those who suffer losses through today\u2019s problems. It\u2019s now more than 21 hours since TSB\u2019s online banking systems were due to be working again... but some customers are still experiencing problems. Jewellery maker Barbara Adamiec reports that it\u2019s damaging her business today: Despite the IT disruption, TSB\u2019s online complaint form is still up and running. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d like to hear from anyone affected by today\u2019s problems.... The frustration of being locked out of one\u2019s own bank account is evident among TSB\u2019s customer base: Here\u2019s my colleague Patrick Collingson on the TSB problems: The internet and mobile banking services of TSB, which has five million customers, intermittently failed on Monday morning after a system upgrade went wrong, prompting widespread concern among users. The bank, carved out of Lloyds but now part of the Spanish Sabadell group, said it was working urgently to repair what it described as \u201cintermittent\u201d failures in its services. The crash came hours after the bank warned account holders that some services, including online banking, making payments or transferring money, would not be possible from 4pm on Friday to 6pm on Sunday because of a system upgrade. Some customers alleged over Twitter that transactions they have not made are being logged to their accounts, with some being credited sums of money, which are later deleted. More here: TSB has just issued a statement - blaming the \u2018large volumes\u2019 of customers trying to access its services for today\u2019s disruption. A spokesperson says: \u201cWe are currently experiencing large volumes of customers accessing our mobile app and internet banking which is leading to some intermittent issues with people accessing our services. We are really sorry for the inconvenience this is causing our customers and want them to know we are working as hard and as fast as we can to resolve this problem.\u201d TSB has around five million UK customers. And surely it expected a surge of activity this morning, after restricting services over the weekend?! Last weekend\u2019s (botched) IT work should have been a symbolic moment for TSB -- as it finally moved the bank away from its former owner, Lloyds Banking Group. TSB was spun out of Lloyds in 2013, but it has been using its former parent\u2019s backend technology systems ever since - even after being taken over by Spain\u2019s Sabadell in 2015. TSB had hoped to move onto a new IT system last November, but was forced to delay it. That proved costly, as it pays Lloyds a fee for using its systems - in February, TSB warned that profits would be hit by the delay. Under these circumstances, TSB will have been keen to take the plunge and move to its new IT systems. But were they completely ready? Today\u2019s problems suggest perhaps not.... Christopher Pavett, pastor of Calvary Church in Clydach, Wales, spoke for many customers caught up in the disruption last night: The Sun is also reporting that TSB customers have been left in limbo by its technology problems: Mark Ezeabasili, 24 a student from London studying sport science at Bedfordshire University told The Sun he hasn\u2019t had access to his account since 6pm yesterday. He said: \u201cI am a student and I tried to move some money from my TSB ISA to my current account so I would have money for the week.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t what I am going to do for money for the week now.\u201d \u201cI now have to all the way to town to get my money which really disrupts my life as I have exams and assignments and I don\u2019t really have time to go all the way to the bank.\u201d Some TSB customers report that today\u2019s IT problems are causing serious inconvenience, and even costing them money: Small businesses who use TSB\u2019s banking service are also worried.... I suspect TSB will be facing some claims for compensation, once this mess is sorted out.... TSB had warned customers that there might be disruption over the weekend, as it carried out its IT upgrade. However, that work was meant to be finished last night - before many customers headed back to work today. But as Sky News points out, something has clearly gone wrong: One customer said he could see other people\u2019s accounts totalling more than \u00a320,000, while another reportedly discovered he had been wrongly credited with \u00a313,000 after logging back in. It came several hours after the bank had warned its account holders that some of its services, including online banking, making payments or transferring money, would not be possible over the weekend because of a system upgrade. The upgrade window was scheduled between Friday at 4pm and Sunday at 6pm. However, a message on the TSB website on Monday morning said there were still \u201cintermittent issues\u201d with its services, while a number of customers reported they were still unable to access their money. UK \u2018challenger bank\u2019 TSB is suffering some challenging - and alarming - technical problems this morning, following IT changes over the weekend. Customers are taking to social media to complain that they can\u2019t access their accounts, or even see how much money is available to them. The problems have arisen following weekend IT work. There are even reports that some customers are seeing other customers\u2019 balances when they log in.... Here\u2019s some examples of the problems being reported: TSB have apologised, and say they\u2019re working hard to fix the problems.... Shares in outsourcing giant Capita have surged by 13% this morning, after it announced plans to raise \u00a3700m in fresh capital. This cash injection should help the company overhaul its operations, and avoid the same fate as Carillion - which slumped into liquidation three months ago. More here: Europe\u2019s stock markets are soporifically quiet this morning - perhaps traders have been lulled to sleep by the sunny weather. Most European indices have dipped into the red, following this morning\u2019s news that exports are being hit by the stronger euro. In the City, the FTSE 100 is basically flat. Wall Street is expected to dip when trading begins at 2.30pm BST - as the rise in US bond yields keeps investors cautious. I must confess that I\u2019d expected shares to rise this morning, after North Korea announced on Saturday that it will end its tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles But there\u2019s no sign of a relief rally, as Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst, at City Index, explains: Despite Wall Street closing a solid 0.8% lower at the end of last week and mixed trading in Asia overnight, the FTSE stumbled out of the blocks on Monday in a subdued start to the week. Some geopolitical developments over the weekend, including a further easing of fears of a US china trade war and North Korea agreeing to suspend missile testing and close a nuclear site failed to lift sentiment as much as might have been expected. Eurozone exporters will be pleased to hear that the euro has fallen against the US dollar this morning. The single currency has shed almost half a percent to $1.2235, as the dollar enjoys a strong morning - tracking the rise in US bond yields. The pound has also dropped against the dollar, to a two-week low of $1.3976. Back in the City, excitement is building as the interest rate (yield) on American 10-year government debt threatens to hit 3% for the first time since January 2014. It\u2019s really quite close now.... The 3% mark is turning into a psychologically important barrier, as it will highlight how US bond prices have dropped from recent record highs (yields rise as prices fall). Falling bond yields suggest that traders are expecting US inflation to pick up, forcing America\u2019s central bank - the Federal Reserve - to keep raising interest rates. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet is concerned by the slowdown among companies in smaller eurozone nations - and the impact of the stronger euro: Economist Nadia Gharbi says the eurozone is struggling to keep up with its recent expansion, as supply chains are being stretched hard: We don\u2019t get separate data from Italy and Spain until early next month; economist Ulrik Bie suspects they won\u2019t be great Danske Bank\u2019s Aila Mihr predicts that the eurozone PMIs will remain at their current levels for some time: Although France and Germany are holding up well, the eurozone\u2019s periphery is suffering a sharper slowdown -- to a 18-month low. This chart from Markit shows the details: Newsflash: growth among eurozone companies remained steady this month, as the strength of the euro hits export growth. Markit\u2019s Eurozone PMI was unchanged this month at 55.2, comfortably over the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. This leaves the eurozone economy in a \u201clower gear\u201d, Markit says, after the strong growth in 2017. The service sector picked up, with activity rising to two-month high of 55.0 (from 54.9 in March). But...manufacturing growth slowed to a 14-month low of 56.0 ( from 56.6 in March). Factories reported the smallest gains in both total goods orders and export orders for 18 months, partly due the recent strength of the euro against the US dollar. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says growth has \u201cdownshifted markedly\u201d in recent months: The Eurozone economy remained stuck in a lower gear in April, with business activity expanding at a rate unchanged on March, which had in turn been the slowest since the start of 2017. However, he doesn\u2019t see any signs that Europe is flirting with recession: \u201cThe April data are running at a level broadly consistent with Eurozone GDP growth of approximately 0.6% at the start of the second quarter. \u201cThe decline in the PMI from January\u2019s high is neither surprising nor alarming: such strong growth as that seen at the start of the year rarely persists for long, not least because supply fails to keep up with demand. With recent months seeing record delivery delays for inputs to factories and growing skill shortages, output is clearly being constrained. In France, strikes were also reported to have disrupted growth, and may continue to do so in coming months. But, the strength of the euro may hold growth back in the months ahead, Williamson adds: It\u2019s also clear that underlying demand has weakened, in part due to exports being hit by the stronger euro. With companies\u2019 future optimism having slipped to the lowest since last year, it looks likely that growth may well slow further in coming months.\u201d Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland is also encouraged by today\u2019s data: Financial portfolio manager Mario Cavaggioni is also encouraged by today\u2019s output data from the eurozone\u2019s two biggest members: Germany\u2019s economy is stabilising this month after suffering a slowdown earlier this year, according to today\u2019s PMI report. Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit explains: \u201cGrowth of Germany\u2019s private sector steadied in April, to arrest the loss of momentum seen in February and March. With both manufacturing and services seeing slightly quicker increases in output, the data show the economy making a solid start to the second quarter. \u201cThere was also a welcome pick-up in the rate of private sector job creation in April. Employment levels rose strongly on a broad-based basis by sector, albeit with the rate of hiring among manufacturers easing from the recent elevated levels. \u201cHowever, a further slowdown in new order growth to its weakest for over a year-and-a-half does raise some concerns. This seemed to be reflected in the survey\u2019s measure of business confidence, which slipped further from the highs seen in 2017.\u201d Here\u2019s more reaction: Newsflash: German\u2019s private sector is growing a little faster than expected, matching France\u2019s performance. Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 Germany Composite Output Index has risen to 55.3 in April, up from March\u2019s 55.1 - beating forecasts of a fall to 54.8. However, Markit warns that German business leaders are less optimistic, with new orders rising at their weakest level in18 months. They say: The rate of job creation picked up to its highest for three months; however, there was less optimism among businesses towards the outlook for activity in the year ahead amid a further slowdown in new order growth. After a stellar 2017, Germany\u2019s private sector does seem to have eased back a little. Reaction to follow.... The increase in the French PMI data this month should ease fears that the country\u2019s economy is weakening. Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe French private sector remained firmly in expansionary mode according to latest flash data. Indeed, at 56.9, the headline composite output figure signalled a sharper rate of growth than in March, and one that remained well above its long-run average (53.9). \u201cAfter having shown signs of slowing in recent months, the data will buoy hopes that the renaissance in the French economy has far from run its course. Further encouragement can be garnered from the broad-based nature of the acceleration, with sharper growth evident in both the manufacturing and services sectors, the former on the back of marked moderations in the prior two months.\u201d His colleague, Chris Williamson, says France seems to be growing at a solid rate: Newsflash: Growth across France\u2019s private sector has picked up this month, defying worries that the euro area is slowing. Data firm Markit has just reported that its \u2018flash\u2019 PMI survey on the French economy has risen to 56.9 in April, up from 56.3 in March. That\u2019s a stronger reading than expected - with many economists predicting that growth slowed this month. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Markit reports that growth accelerated in the service sector, although manufacturing growth did slow a little. Companies repotted that new orders have picked up this month, encouraging them to keep hiring staff. Here\u2019s the key findings: Flash France Composite Output Index at 56.9 in April from 56.3 in March (2-month high) Flash France Services Activity Index rises to 57.4 in April (56.9 in March), 2-month high Flash France Manufacturing Output Index up to 54.7 (53.9 in March), 2-month high Flash France Manufacturing PMI drops to 53.4 (53.7 in March) 13-month low More to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is the \u2018euroboom\u2019 alive and well? A new healthcheck on Europe\u2019s businesses this morning will highlight whether growth has slowed in 2018, as geopolitical tensions and trade spats hit confidence. The \u2018flash\u2019 eurozone PMI, calculated by data firm Markit, is expected to dip to 54.8 this month, down from March\u2019s 55.2. That would still show an expansion, but at a slightly slower pace. Investors would like to see a strong set of PMI data, to ease concerns that Europe might be entering a soggier patch. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why City investors will be examining the data: Over in Europe there has been some concern that economic activity has hit its high-water mark in recent months with the only debate over whether it is merely a pause for breath or an early indication of a more significant slowdown. Investors certainly appear concerned if last week\u2019s April investor sentiment ZEW reading was any indication coming in at a 5 year low of -8.2. Despite this scepticism markets in Europe are still sitting near a one month high, with the recent slide in the euro also helping a little. Today\u2019s publication of the latest German and French flash PMI data in manufacturing and services could well add further fuel to the debate about economic activity in Europe\u2019s two largest economies. These have shown signs of slowing in recent months and while it\u2019s not been particularly alarming in terms of the overall headline readings the lack of inflation does speak to a lack of demand on a wider scale. The data will be closely watched by the European Central Bank, which meets later this week to set monetary policy across the eurozone. ECB policymakers are pondering whether to end their QE stimulus programme, so weakening growth would create a headache for them. Also coming up today.... Investors are also looking edgily at the bond market this morning. US government debt has been selling off in recent days, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Treasury bills towards 3% - a crucial level for market confidence. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains why it matters: Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing cost for corporates, and another sharp spike would eat away a significant element of their profitability by increasing interest expense. Investors will also readjust their required cost of capital as risk-free rates rise, which could make equities less attractive.

Some customers alleged that the IT \u201cupgrade\u201d had left them with rogue credits and debits on their accounts, while others complained they had been given access to random accounts. TSB said its 1.9 million mobile and internet banking customers suffered \u201cintermittent\u201d failures to access their accounts on Monday, while for about half an hour a glitch gave some users a view of \u201cnominee\u201d accounts they would not normally see. The transfer had been planned for months, and was supposed to be completed by Sunday evening, but on Monday morning the bank was bombarded with complaints from customers unable to log on. TSB was carved out of Lloyds Bank and then bought in 2015 by Spain\u2019s Banco Sabadell. Initially, Lloyds continued to handle the IT infrastructure for TSB but over the weekend it moved all customer accounts to a system designed by Sabadell for its UK customers. Customers were warned that they would not be able to conduct transactions on the internet or their mobile phone over the weekend. When problems emerged on Monday morning, TSB said it hoped to have its systems \u201cup and running again soon\u201d but the outages persisted all day. By the end of the working day TSB was still unable to reopen all accounts. It told customers: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any timescales that we\u2019re able to provide at the moment. However, we are working to fix it as fast as we can.\u201d A spokesperson for TSB said if any customer was left out of pocket as a result of the IT transfer they would be reimbursed. However, TSB insisted customers were able to use their cards throughout the period. It said the planned transfer from 4pm on Friday through to 6pm on Sunday meant customers were not able to make payments into and out of their accounts using the internet or mobile phones, and apologised that for some customers the services remained unavailable on Monday. \u201cWe are really sorry for the inconvenience this is causing our customers and want them to know we are working as hard and as fast as we can to resolve this problem,\u201d TSB said. In an own goal, however, TSB\u2019s parent group, Sabadell, issued a press release with a statement from the group chair, Josep Oliu, saying it had \u201csuccessfully completed the TSB technology migration\u201d. On Twitter, customers shared images of rogue debts and credits on their accounts. One bemused account holder showed his TSB banking app recording a direct debit paid to Sky Digital \u2013 in 81 years\u2019 time. \u201cNow I know there are a lot of theories about time travel, but look I have actually gone 81 years into the future and paid a direct debit to Sky. Just thought you should know!\u201d Ben Stratton tweeted. Others were more unhappy about the prolonged outage. Paul Scriven, a House of Lords peer, tweeted that his account was wrongly showing a \u00a30 balance. He wrote: \u201cStop telling me and other customers you have an intermittent problem. You clearly have a major systems failure. Be honest. It\u2019s bad enough for us your customers without you taking us for mugs.\u201d",

Two years ago, the share price was \u00a310, the dividend was lifted 9% and the group boasted that its profit margins were about to get fatter. Capita, in short, was presenting itself as an oasis of calm in a sector already under stress. Now the company is issuing 1bn new shares at 70p to raise \u00a3701m to ensure it doesn\u2019t go the way of Carillion. Dividends have been canned for the time being. The latest collection of non-cash write-offs, in the form of goodwill impairment and suchlike, takes the tally to \u00a31.2bn since that last hurrah in 2016. The scale of the reappraisal of a business that was once a respected FTSE 100 outfit is astonishing. The way Lewis tells it, the disaster for shareholders has been a long time in the making. Capita has \u201cnever had a strategy\u201d, he says. Instead, the company is the product of 250 small acquisitions, with the operating businesses never integrated into coherent units. \u201cEveryone was accountable, therefore nobody was,\u201d he argues, in effect damning his predecessors. The tale has parallels with that of Serco, where crisis struck in 2014, and the underlying causes were not dissimilar. In the go-go years for outsourcing, life was easy. The arrival of stiffer competition and smarter customers (including in government) exposed the horrible truth that these firms, with their overleveraged balance sheets, were built only for bull markets. The crisis at Capita just took longer to be exposed. Lewis starts with a couple of advantages as he attempts a revival while cutting \u00a3175m from costs. First, even in a bad year such as 2018, he expects underlying pre-tax profits to be \u00a3270m-\u00a3300m. Second, he thinks another \u00a3300m can be raised from selling non-core business to further repair the balance sheet and plug the pension deficit. Capita, with its guaranteed \u00a3701m (or, rather \u00a3662m once the bankers, advisers and hangers-on have had their cut) will survive. Fine, but the figure that stands out is the \u00a3500m earmarked for spending over the next three years on technology and infrastructure to address \u201chistoric underinvestment.\u201d It sounds like essential stuff since Capita is skewed towards the back-office processing end of the market. But half a billion quid to become competitive again? It suggests recovery, as at Serco, will be hard and slow work. Prothena joins unlovely list The 13% bounce in Capita\u2019s share price was a relief for the under-pressure fund manager Neil Woodford, who was a holder of the stock all the way down. Then came the afternoon news from the US: Prothena, an Irish biotech company that is listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is one of Woodford\u2019s big bets, said its most important development drug failed its crucial clinical trial. Cue a 65% crash in Prothena\u2019s stock price. Upsets happen in biotech, of course. Woodford, in the jargon, is also a high-conviction investor, so one can\u2019t be too surprised that his funds own 29% of Prothena. But the oddity is that Prothena wasn\u2019t merely 8.56% of his Patient Capital fund, which is big in biotech. Some 2.67% of his main \u00a37bn Equity Income fund was also invested in the stock. A high-risk biotech firm that doesn\u2019t pay a dividend looks a very odd holding for an income fund. Woodford\u2019s folk point out that he\u2019s always allocated up to a fifth of his income portfolios to non-dividend-payers. Well, OK, but the policy looks more attractive when the sun is shining on the overall portfolio. Unfortunately for Woodfood, the rain hasn\u2019t stopped for a year. Prothena joins an unlovely list that comprises Provident Financial, the AA, Allied Minds and more. Sky Bet changes the market Sky Bet, one used to think, was one of those interesting but insignificant businesses that large parent companies sometimes create in idle moments. Then, in 2014, the satellite broadcaster Sky sold 80% of the business to private equity firm CVC in a deal that valued the operation at \u00a3800m, which was serious money. Now, though, Sky Bet is being sold for $4.7bn (\u00a33.4bn) to Stars Group, the Canadian firm behind the PokerStars website. Sky collects a few quid on the way but CVC has made a fortune. Did the broadcaster sell too soon? In retrospect, yes, obviously. It probably underestimated just how rapidly mobile betting, Sky Bet\u2019s specialism, is changing the market. But, to put the latest valuation in context, \u00a33.4bn is slightly more than the stock market value of grand old William Hill. Back in 2014, almost nobody would have predicted that.",

      "bodyText": "In March, a record percentage of Australians were in the labour force. The participation rate of 65.7% broke the record set in December 2010. But comparing the make-up of the workforce then and now reveals a rather different workforce today \u2013 one with winners and losers. In the latest labour force figures, the ABS estimated the trend participation rate to be 65.655%, which was rounded up to 65.7%, beating the December 2010 figure of 65.6%, and meaning that more of the adult population is now either working or looking for work than ever before: A few years ago most would not have thought the record would be broken. The aging population meant that the percentage of the population under 65 was shrinking and thus making it hard for the participation rate to get back to the level it was before the baby boomers began retiring. The reason a new record has been set is due mostly to two sets of workers \u2013 those same baby boomers, who were expected to head off to retirement; and prime-working aged women, whose influx into the workforce has more than offset the decline in male employment. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The participation rate of people aged 25-64 has actually been breaking records for some time now. Every month since February last year a new record has been set: Just a smidge under three quarters of women in that age bracket are now in the workforce. Such a figure was barely believable 20 years ago. In 1998 only 63% of women aged 25-64 were either working or looking for work. The difference is the equivalent of an extra 750,000 women in the labour force. So the workforce now compared with when the participation rate record was last set at the end of 2010 is more female and older. The percentage of those aged under 25 in work has fallen, and so too has the percentage of men in their prime-earning years \u2013 while there has been a surge of women gaining employment: The figures also demonstrate how much the type of work has shifted \u2013 with a greater percentage of people across all ages and genders working part-time now than was the case in December 2010. And as a result, while we have set a record for participation we remain a long way below the record for the average number of hours worked on a per capita basis. That record of an average of 90.4 hours worked in a month by all persons over the age of 15 was set in June 2008 \u2013 both prior to the GFC and the baby boomers hitting retirement age. At the end of 2010 there was another peak \u2013 at 88.6 hours it was well below the record, but even that figure is well above the current level of 86.1 hours: The decline in the per capita hours worked is also a sign that higher wages growth is probably not about to come rushing down the pipeline. There was a very strong growth in hours worked last year, but that looks to have dropped off over the past six months. If we look at how the rates of employment per age group have changed since the start of the century we can also see just how much more the GFC affected people under 25 compared with everyone else: There is a greater percentage of people aged over 25 working now than at the height of the mining boom. By contrast, there are fewer young people working, not only compared with the mining boom but even compared with January 2000. With the increase in part-time work and the overall fall in hours worked on average it is not surprising that the underemployment rate is higher now than it was in December 2010 \u2013 up from 7.1% to 8.3%. On this score every gender and age group is worse off \u2013 but clearly the underemployment of younger workers has increased by much more than others: At this point one could suggest something is amiss \u2013 too many migrant workers, something wrong with the IR system that is stopping employers from hiring younger workers. But the unfortunate reality is that youth workers are always more likely to be underemployed than older workers. Workers under 25 are much more likely to lose out in full-time work to older workers, and as a result, when there is less full-time work available, that means youth workers are going to be affected more. It also means that when the underemployment of older workers increases, it will generally increase by more for youth workers. If we compare the underemployment rates of workers under 25 with those aged 25 to 44, we find that the current levels of underemployment are high for both and essentially at the level you would expect given the overall rate of underemployment: The big change for youth since December 2010 has been the switch from those who were working but not studying, to those who are either both studying and working (and thus more likely to be working part-time) or just studying: The problem for younger workers is that since 2010 the four industries that have accounted for nearly three quarters of the growth in all employment have been healthcare, education, professional, scientific and technology, and construction \u2013 rather than the traditional youth-employing industries of retail trade, and accommodation and food: The youth of Australia have reacted to this changing labour market by staying in school or going on to tertiary education. Despite what some conservative commentators and politicans would have you believe, they have most definitely not sat around doing nothing. The rate of under 25s neither in the labour force nor in education is now almost as low as it was at the height of the mining boom: The new record level of participation in the labour force is a good time to take stock of how things have changed. Overall, the change has been towards part-time work and with an older labour force. For younger Australians it has meant a major shift in their experience in the labour force. Not only are they starting later, they are much more likely to be starting in part-time work. The one positive, however, is that now almost more than ever before they are either working or learning. The issue will be if the shift from earning to learning continues, and if it also leads to better work once they do enter the labour force.",

The difference is the equivalent of an extra 750,000 women in the labour force. </p> <p>So the workforce now compared with when the participation rate record was last set at the end of 2010 is more female and older. </p> <p>The percentage of those aged under 25 in work has fallen, and so too has the percentage of men in their prime-earning years \u2013 while there has been a surge of women gaining employment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in employment rates: Dec 2010 to March 2018\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7DRqT/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The figures also demonstrate how much the type of work has shifted \u2013 with a greater percentage of people across all ages and genders working part-time now than was the case in December 2010.</p> <p>And as a result, while we have set a record for participation we remain a long way below the record for the average number of hours worked on a per capita basis.</p> <p>That record of an average of 90.4 hours worked in a month by all persons over the age of 15 was set in June 2008 \u2013 both prior to the GFC and the baby boomers hitting retirement age.

There was a very strong growth in hours worked last year, but that looks to have dropped off over the past six months. </p> <p>If we look at how the rates of employment per age group have changed since the start of the century we can also see just how much more the GFC affected people under 25 compared with everyone else:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in employment to population ratio since Jan 2000\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9XNeB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There is a greater percentage of people aged over 25 working now than at the height of the mining boom. By contrast, there are fewer young people working, not only compared with the mining boom but even compared with January 2000. </p> <p>With the increase in part-time work and the overall fall in hours worked on average it is not surprising that the underemployment rate is higher now than it was in December 2010 \u2013 up from 7.1% to 8.3%.</p> <p>On this score every gender and age group is worse off \u2013 but clearly the underemployment of younger workers has increased by much more than others:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployment rate by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aCimT/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>At this point one could suggest something is amiss \u2013 too many migrant workers, something wrong with the IR system that is stopping employers from hiring younger workers. </p> <p>But the unfortunate reality is that youth workers are always more likely to be underemployed than older workers. Workers under 25 are much more likely to lose out in full-time work to older workers, and as a result, when there is less full-time work available, that means youth workers are going to be affected more. </p> <p>It also means that when the underemployment of older workers increases, it will generally increase by more for youth workers.</p> <p>If we compare the underemployment rates of workers under 25 with those aged 25 to 44, we find that the current levels of underemployment are high for both and essentially at the level you would expect given the overall rate of underemployment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployment rate 2003-2018 - youth &amp; prime-age workers\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GOJDC/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big change for youth since December 2010 has been the switch from those who were working but not studying, to those who are either both studying and working (and thus more likely to be working part-time) or just studying:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of 15-24yo population\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TiHXd/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The problem for younger workers is that since 2010 the four industries that have accounted for nearly three quarters of the growth in all employment have been healthcare, education, professional, scientific and technology, and construction \u2013 rather than the traditional youth-employing industries of retail trade, and accommodation and food:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of workers by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AtY1j/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The youth of Australia have reacted to this changing labour market by staying in school or going on to tertiary education.

      "bodyText": "Capita, the debt-laden outsourcing company behind the London congestion charge and the BBC licence fee, has been forced into a \u00a3701m cash call to shore up its finances. Less than four months after the collapse of Carillion raised concerns over the health of the British outsourcing sector, Capita flagged further distress by announcing a \u00a3513m loss for last year and a heavily discounted rights issue. The company is issuing 1bn new shares at 70p, compared with a share price of 181p at close of trading on Monday. The company\u2019s new chief executive, Jonathan Lewis, who took over in December, dismissed comparisons with Carillion, which went bust in January with only \u00a329m in the bank after it was brought down by hospital and road-building projects. \u201cI get frustrated with that comparison \u2013 we are a completely different business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have \u00a31bn in liquidity, strong cashflow and a new strategy with investor support. We are not in PFI contracts and have nothing like the risk profile.\u201d Capita said proceeds from the rights issue \u2013 \u00a3662m once fees to advisers are deducted \u2013 would be used to pay down a \u00a31.1bn debt burden, invest in technology and fund its turnaround plan. The company also announced its annual loss had ballooned from \u00a390m in 2016, owing to restructuring costs, write-offs and problems with several contracts. According to Tim Wainwright, industrial products sector leader at the global accountancy firm EY, outsourcers have been squeezed by the need to provide services ever more cheaply, even as their costs have risen. Capita\u2019s shares slumped in January when it issued a profit warning, cancelled its dividend and said it would need to tap investors for cash. News of the fundraising sent the shares 13% higher on Monday but they are still down by more than two-thirds over the past year. Key investors Investec and Woodford, run by the star investment manager Neil Woodford, who together own nearly a fifth of Capita, are backing the cash call. Capita, which employs 70,000 people around the world, reiterated that it expected to make underlying pre-tax profits, excluding restructuring costs, of \u00a3270m to \u00a3300m this year. It said its trading in the first quarter was consistent with this guidance, which included \u00a370m of cost savings for the first time. Lewis said: \u201cToday we have announced a new strategy to simplify and strengthen Capita. The rights issue is a key component of this new strategy. There is a lot to do but I am confident that the plan is clear and prudent.\u201d Capita is narrowing its focus from 40 sectors to five, looking to raise \u00a3300m from selling off non-core businesses this year, and is targeting \u00a3175m of cost savings by the end of 2020. Lewis aims to simplify and unify an unwieldy structure in which more than 250 different business units have operated separately. He said his reshaped Capita would focus on five divisions: software, HR, customer management, government and IT services \u2013 the areas where long-term profitable growth is available in the outsourcing sector. The company said it had been hit by cost overruns on a contract to provide NHS England\u2019s primary care support services, penalties and extra costs related to the Transport for London congestion charge contract and contractual disputes in relation to its mortgage servicing deal with the Co-operative Bank. In recent years, Capita has developed software for some clients that could not be used elsewhere, often became obsolete quickly and led to write-offs. City analysts gave the new strategy a cautious welcome. Andrew Gibb at RBC said: \u201cAll the strategic commentary looks sensible \u2013 namely changing divisional structure again and focusing on areas with competitive advantage. \u201cAs trading [is] no worse than feared and rights [issue is] underwritten, there is some relief. However, a very complicated and costly transformation plan needs to be executed in market conditions that will remain tough.\u201d Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at the spreadbetting firm CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cOnly last week the company renewed its contract with the BBC to collect the licence fee, so while this week\u2019s loss doesn\u2019t make for pleasant reading, the announcement does appear to suggest that management have a turnaround plan that might work, and the confidence of shareholders in pulling it off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A claim from the UK\u2019s City minister that the EU is softening its opposition to giving the country\u2019s financial services sector a special Brexit deal has been dismissed in Brussels. John Glen, a minister in the Treasury, suggested on Monday that the EU had shown a new willingness in recent months to offer a deal to protect the Square Mile when the UK withdraws from the bloc. Glen added that the transition deal agreed by Britain and the EU last month would allow financial firms to move forward and plan for their future with confidence. He insisted the UK\u2019s high regulatory standards would remain and allow a close relationship between regulators on either side of the English Channel to prosper. \u201cWe do not intend to rip up the rulebook after Brexit,\u201d Glen told a conference in the Guildhall, in the heart of London\u2019s financial district. \u201cThe fog is clearing \u2026 We are already seeing progress. The EU have now recognised that there will be some form of market access in financial services having previously dismissed the idea.\u201d However, EU officials in Brussels said the UK appeared unwilling to accept the reality of their position. The EU has already dismissed the UK government\u2019s proposals of mutual recognition of each other\u2019s regulations in the financial services sector. The EU\u2019s guidelines on its vision of a future trade deal published last month makes no reference to the financial services sector. Plans for the sector are only cursorily mentioned in an internal annex to the document that suggests the 27 EU member states could unilaterally improve the equivalence regime it offers non-EU countries. \u201cThat\u2019s an internal matter, and ambiguous as well,\u201d one diplomat involved in drafting the paper said. An equivalence regime is a one-sided system whereby the bloc grants market access if a foreign country\u2019s rules are fully aligned with its own. Such access can also be terminated by Brussels at short notice. The EU is looking at expanding the number of areas where an equivalence decision could give firms located outside the bloc the ability to operate on the continent. However, the outcome is set to fall short of the status quo and offer none of the security against a policy change in Brussels. Catherine McGuinness, the policy chief for the City of London, the municipal body representing the capital\u2019s financial district, warned that the suggestion of mutual recognition of regulations was the \u201conly game in town\u201d. A second diplomat in Brussels involved in the Brexit negotiations told the Guardian: \u201cEveryone knows that that the City of London is going to relocate to New York.\u201d However, the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, gave a bullish assessment of the City\u2019s prospects last week, saying a damaging haemorrhage of finance jobs had been halted by the transition agreement. Mujtaba Rahman, a former Treasury and European Commission official, and now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said the City minister was wrong. Rahman said: \u201cOf course there will be access for the UK financial services sector to the EU\u2019s single market after Brexit but it certainly won\u2019t be preferential and it will be significantly inferior to the status quo. \u201cGlen\u2019s notion that the EU is softening is simply wrong: the EU can\u2019t give the UK a \u2018sweetheart\u2019 deal in services while allowing it to control free movement of labour, as many other EU countries will then line up to demand the same thing.\u201d",

A post first published in 2013 and still available on the company\u2019s official Weibo account as of January, featured photos of female Alibaba employees in suggestive poses. \u201cThey want to be your coworkers. Do you want that too?\u201d the ad said. A 2012 recruitment video showed a female employee pole dancing, and a montage of female employees saying, \u201cI love tech boys.\u201d These are some of more than 36,000 job postings reviewed by Human Rights Watch (HRW) between March 2017 and January this year that demonstrate the predominance of sexist attitudes towards women in the Chinese workplace. HRW, which reviewed job ads on company and government websites and social media sites since 2013, found both private and public sector employers frequently specified \u201cmen only\u201d or \u201cmen preferred\u201d applicants. Even China\u2019s globally known tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, used women to attract talent, HRW said. \u201cSexist job ads pander to the antiquated stereotypes that persist within Chinese companies,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, China director at HRW, at the release of their report. \u201cThese companies pride themselves on being forces of modernity and progress, yet they fall back on such recruitment strategies, which shows how deeply entrenched discrimination against women remains in China,\u201d she said. Alibaba said in an emailed statement that it has \u201cclear and well-defined guidelines on providing equal opportunity regardless of gender\u201d and would conduct stricter reviews of recruiting advertisements. The company said 47% of its employees are women, who also account for one-third of management positions. \u201cAlibaba exemplifies one of the best practices in our industry when it comes to gender equality,\u201d the statement said. HRW researchers found jobs from college counsellors to teachers and delivery managers were earmarked for men. This year, 19% of civil service job ads listed \u201cmen preferred\u201d or \u201csuitable for men\u201d in their descriptions. Last year, 13% of civil service jobs specified male only applicants, according to the report. When job ads are specified for women they often come with physical appearance requirements. A 2015 job ad for assistants for a court in Beijing sought women between the ages of 18 to 25, with \u201cgood skin tone\u201d and \u201cno obvious scars\u201d. The ad said they should be between 162cm and 173cm (5\u20193\u201d and 5\u20196\u201d) in height and weigh less than 65kg (143 lb). Some employers were looking for only married women with children, based on the logic that they would not leave their posting to have children or get married. China\u2019s communist party has named gender equality as one of the pillars of the party\u2019s ideology \u2013 former Chinese leader Mao Zedong famously said women \u201chold up half the sky\u201d in China. Just 20% of heads of Chinese government agencies and companies were women, according to a 2010 report from the All-China Women\u2019s Federation.

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest makers of liquids for e-cigarettes is aiming to cash in on the boom in vaping by listing its shares on the London stock market. Manchester-based Supreme, which is 100% owned by its chief executive, Sandy Chadha, is expected to have a market value of \u00a3150m when it floats on Aim, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s junior market, in mid- to late May. The float will raise \u00a310m, which will be used to expand its factory in Manchester and pay down debt. Supreme is the first UK vaping company to go public. Supreme owns the KiK and 88vape brands and makes more than 130,000 bottles of vaping e-liquids a day. It also sells hardware kits and vaping accessories, along with lightbulbs and 200m batteries in the past year. The firm supplies retailers such as Asda, Halfords, B&amp;M, Poundland, Iceland, Home Bargains and wholesalers including Booker, Bestway, Costcutter and Nisa. Supreme made revenues of \u00a370.7m in the past year and earnings before interest and tax of \u00a37.2m in the year to the end of March. Chadha, who paid himself a dividend of \u00a34.5m last year, is expected to retain a majority stake after the firm goes public. The business was set up by his father in 1975 after the family moved to Britain from Delhi when he was two years old. His father started selling toys and other products imported from east Asia from a van and later moved into batteries. Chadha, a millionaire, recently honoured a 10-year bet by handing over a \u00a3130,000 Bentley to corporate turnaround expert Iain Johnston. In 2007, Supreme went bust but Johnston, an adviser to Chadha\u2019s lenders, confidently predicted the firm would recover. He asked Chadha to bet his Bentley on the Supreme\u2019s recovery, and the businessman pledged to hand over the luxury car if the firm made an annual profit of \u00a31m. The two men lost contact, but after hunting him down on LinkedIn, Chadha handed over a Bentley Flying Spur to Johnston in January. Nearly 3 million Britons are now vaping. UK sales of vaping products surged by 50% last year to reach \u00a31bn, and are on course to exceed \u00a32bn by 2020. The latest evidence suggests that while e-cigarettes are not harmless, they are far safer than smoking because they don\u2019t contain tobacco. 2017 saw the publication of the first longer term study of vaping. Another study suggested a cancer risk from vaping of about 1% of that from smoking. Chadha said: \u201cOver the last two decades we have established Supreme as a leading manufacturer and distributor of batteries and lighting, and more recently vaping, demonstrating our ability to leverage our extensive distributor and customer relationships to drive growth.\u201d",

The two men lost contact, but after hunting him down on LinkedIn, Chadha handed over a Bentley Flying Spur to Johnston in January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly 3 million Britons are now vaping. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/30/ten-years-after-the-smoking-ban-vaping-is-a-1bn-business\">UK sales of vaping products surged by 50% last year to reach \u00a31bn</a>, and are on course to exceed \u00a32bn by 2020.<br></p> <p>The latest evidence suggests that while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/dec/29/e-cigarettes-vaping-safer-than-smoking\">e-cigarettes are not harmless, they are far safer than smoking</a> because they don\u2019t contain tobacco. 2017 saw the publication of the first longer term <a href=\"http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2599869/nicotine-carcinogen-toxin-exposure-long-term-e-cigarette-nicotine-replacement\">study</a> of vaping.

This week\u2019s first-quarter GDP figures are expected to show growth of just 0.2%-0.3%, according to EY Item Club economists, mainly due to the severe weather the hit the country at the end of February and beginning of March. This compares to quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.4% in the final three months of 2017. The forecasters have cut their estimate for full-year growth from 1.7% in their winter prediction to 1.6%, despite an expected pick-up to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter growth in the second three months of the year. For 2019, they have kept their estimate for GDP growth at 1.7%. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club said: \u201cThe UK economy is chugging along at a fairly steady but uninspiring rate. On the surface, the outlook appears stable. Inflation, which impacted consumer spending last year, continues to drop and we expect a tight jobs market to deliver some uptick in pay growth. \u201cSignificantly, a transitional Brexit agreement between the UK and EU has been agreed which should also bring some certainty to businesses and support investment, although it still needs to be ratified. However, these factors may be offset by rising interest rates, a recovery in sterling\u2019s value and still appreciable Brexit uncertainties bringing new headwinds over the year.\u201d The EY Item Club expects two interest rate rises in 2018, with another two the following year.",
