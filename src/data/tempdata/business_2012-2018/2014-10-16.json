    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Strong US factory output growth and the intervention of a senior American central bank official brought some relief to markets following three days of turmoil that have knocked billions of pounds off the value of the FTSE 100. On another day of wild swings in stock prices, James Bullard, the hawkish president of the St Louis federal reserve, said the US central bank should consider maintaining its policy of pumping funds into the economy as inflation expectations eased. Bullard, an influential member of the central bank\u2019s decision-making committee, made his remarks as investors sought havens in German and US bonds, sending the Dow down more than 200 points in early trading and pushing leading shares in London at one point to a year low of 6072. By the close the FTSE was 16 down at 6196, while the Dow ended down 24.5 points at 16,117. The intervention and US data showing a monthly 0.5% rise in industrial production triggered a rally that left most stock markets only slightly down on the day. The FTSE 100, which has lost almost 10% of its value since the middle of last month, clawed back most of its early losses to close down 16 points, at 6196. Global shares have been hard hit by mounting concerns about the prospects for economic growth, the spread of Ebola and geopolitical tensions, fears that have also hit the oil price, sending it to a four-year low. Overnight, Asian stock markets had tumbled in reaction to the losses in Europe and the US on Wednesday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei losing 2.2% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng down 0.7%. The Federal Reserve was expected to end its purchases of bonds under its programme of quantitative easing within a few months as a prelude to a first increase in interest rates. While the economy remains robust, a lack of wage rises has undermined demand on the high street and pushed down prices. Bullard said that to keep consumers spending the Fed should consider maintaining the cheap credit. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a note to clients: \u201cThe reasons for this new jitteriness are not hard to find with the global economic outlook turning darker, and growth downgrades coming thick and fast from all angles, while concerns about the spread of Ebola are inducing fears about travel bans prompting changes in consumer behaviour across the US.\u201d A lack of job creation in France and Italy and diving business confidence in Germany added to investors\u2019 fears. Inflation figures this week showed several countries, including Italy and Sweden, had fallen into deflation, reflecting weakening domestic demand and the impact of sanctions on Russia. European leaders were forced to pledge their support for Greece amid growing concerns that the country\u2019s spiralling debt interest bill endangered its recovery. Greek bond yields, which determine the cost of financing Athens\u2019s debt, soared past 9% as weak figures from the eurozone combined with a succession of downwards revisions to global growth to unsettle stock and bond markets. European stock markets dived in early trading before rallying late in the afternoon after the strong industrial production numbers from the US. In Germany the Dax closed up 0.4% but France\u2019s CAC was down 0.3%. Investors seeking a haven for their cash sent the yield on German 10-year bonds to a new low of 0.718%. Last weekend leaders of Greece\u2019s fragile coalition had been in Washington attempting to persuade the International Monetary Fund that they should be released from their draconian austerity programme. They told IMF director Christine Lagarde they could prosper without the need for further rescue funds. Days later the suggestion appeared fanciful as reports of a weakening eurozone economy and fractious budget row between Berlin, Paris and Rome undermined investor confidence. Jyrki Katainen, the Finnish vice-president of the European Union\u2019s executive commission, said Greece had made \u201cimmense progress\u201d since the \u20ac240bn (\u00a3190bn) rescue programmes started in 2010. \u201cThere should be no doubt that Europe will continue to assist Greece in whatever way is necessary so the government can keep financing itself,\u201d he said. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe further dip in eurozone consumer price inflation in September will clearly be of serious concern to the European Central Bank as it keeps the deflation spectre very much in sight, especially given current stuttering eurozone economic activity and sharply falling oil prices.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ross McEwan, the boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, has warned day that the bailed-out bank\u2019s customers are concerned about the impact of rising interest rates on mortgage payments and said the number of complaints about the industry was \u201cnothing short of appalling\u201d. RBS intends to research the effect of rate rises as 1.5 million people have bought their homes since 2007 so have never experienced the impact of a rise in interest rates. A year into his role running the 81% taxpayer-owned bank, McEwan told an audience of bankers they could win back the trust of customers by preparing them for a rise in mortgage rates. Admitting that the timing of a rise from the historic lows of 0.5% was difficult to predict, he said: \u201cIn particular we know that our mortgage customers are seeing conflicting reports about the timing of interest rate rises and they are concerned that they might not be able to balance their household budgets when the day comes, even if that is some time well into the future. \u201cThis anxiety comes despite the fact that, like most banks, RBS and NatWest have stress-tested our customers\u2019 affordability in the event of a significant rise in interest rates up to 7%.\u201d Speaking at the annual conference of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, McEwan said there had been 2.5m complaints by customers against the industry this year, he said, which was \u201cnothing short of appalling\u201d. He said: \u201cIn any other industry that would be regarded as a crisis.\u201d With RBS facing a slew of regulatory issues \u2013 including fines dating back to the subprime mortgage crisis, the bank\u2019s IT meltdown in June 2012 and an investigation into foreign exchange rigging \u2013 McEwan said he would need a \u201c500-day plan\u201d to root out \u201call past problems, practices and related fines\u201d. The City minister, Andrea Leadsom, said her aim was \u201cto move the debate forward, away from banker bashing and poor behaviour of the past and toward the exciting innovative ways in which the financial services sector will be serving the nation\u201d. In Washington two former UK traders for Dutch bank Rabobank were charged with manipulating the benchmark interest rate Libor. The charges against Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti came after two other Rabobank staff pleaded guilty in the US. The level of fines being imposed on banks \u2013 described by the BBA chief, Anthony Browne, as the $100bn question \u2013 has led to a warning that banks are pulling out of business areas because they could expose themselves to fresh penalties. Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, a former ambassador and now a senior adviser to HSBC\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, said a new wave of financial industry regulation was forcing the bank to embark on what he called a \u201cpreemptive cringe in front of regulators\u201d. HSBC has faced criticism for shutting accounts of Muslim organisations, such as the Finsbury Park mosque. He spoke after the shadow Treasury minister, Labour MP Cathy Jamieson, said bankers who opposed regulation were \u201cin the wrong line of work\u201d. John Griffith-Jones, chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority, appeared to acknowledge the impact a tough stance by regulators could have on banks. He said banks had told him they were nervous and pointed to the lack of new pension products as evidence of anxiety about fines from regulators. Asked if authorities were \u201chooked\u201d on regulation, he said: \u201cI do think there is a moment in time which is probably around now although you can never be sure \u2026 to change and move on.\u201d This would involve working with the banks, Griffith-Jones added. \u201cI really want to move from the work we have done [preventing markets working badly] into making markets work well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to that tipping point which is not going to be easy,\u201d he said.",

Rossi\u2019s answer is old-fashioned thirst for income. The yield on the S&amp;P 500 index in the US is now 2.3%, which is better than the 2.1% available on 10-year US Treasuries. What\u2019s more, dividends from US companies are rising at a rate of 10% in aggregate. He\u2019s looking to buy US equities and expects the S&amp;P 500, which has now fallen 10% from its top last month, to record a new high in 2015.

The \u201clast remnants of the 2003-08 bull market are being swept away\u201d, as Rossi puts it.

All the main indices in Europe and the US are still down, but have recouped some of their earlier losses. In London, the FTSE 100 index is now down some 40 points at 6170, a 0.7% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax is trading 0.3% at 8544.76 lower while France\u2019s CAC has slid 0.9% to 3904.31. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones lost 0.8% to 16,006.76 and the S&amp;P 500 shed 0.75 to 1849.45. US Treasuries rose for a second day as investors sought out safe haven assets from sliding stock markets, despite upbeat jobs and industrial production data. With that, I\u2019m off. Thankyou for all your great comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Spain struggled to fill its target at a double bond auction. It sold \u20ac3.2bn of debt, falling short of the top end of the Spanish Treasury\u2019s target range of \u20ac2.5-3.5bn. Spain usually meets or even tops the high end of its target range. Rabobank analysts said: This weakness is unsurprising given the very chunky increase seen in all eurozone spreads versus the [German] Bund. France, on the other hand, had no trouble selling \u20ac7.5bn of debt, benefiting from its relative safe-haven status. There was demand for nearly double the amount sold. European officials are vowing continued support for Greece as investors sell off the bailed-out country\u2019s stocks and bonds, reports AP. The country is being buffeted by a range of concerns, including that the government will struggle to wean itself off international aid and that its banks remain shaky. Investors have also been spooked by the prospect of new elections that could bring to power the left-wing Syriza party, which wants to renege on a part of Greece\u2019s debt. A broader global market sell-off has only made matters worse. Jyrki Katainen, vice-president of the European Union\u2019s executive Commission, said: There should be no doubt that Europe will continue to assist Greece in whatever way is necessary\u201d so the government can keep financing itself. European officials are currently reviewing Greece\u2019s progress in complying with bailout loan conditions requiring economic reforms and restrictions on government deficits. Katainen said the commission would work closely with Greece to complete the review and \u201censure a smooth evolution of European support\u201d even after the bailout ends. The European Central Bank is also ready to make more credit available to Greek banks, according to a person familiar with the matter [see earlier post 9:09]. The ECB would do that by providing more credit against collateral such as Greek government bonds. Greece ran up too much debt and needed \u20ac240bn in bailout loans in 2010 and 2012 from other countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund. The bailout enabled the government to finance itself after market borrowing costs rose higher than it could afford and threatened to push the country out of the euro currency union. The country had earlier appeared on the way to recovery and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras had expressed hopes of leaving the bailout program early by doing without remaining installments of bailout loans. Instead, the country would borrow normally on the bond market. The possibility of such an early exit appeared to recede this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year rose 0.98 percentage points to 8.71%, from around 5.6% as recently as September. That is a sign investors see an increased risk of not being repaid. The main stock index in Athens was faring somewhat better, down only 0.6% but that came after a stunning 12% loss over the previous two days. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones lost nearly 190 points to 15958, a 1.2% fall, in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 is down 1% and the Nasdaq nearly 2%. More good news on the American economy, where industrial production jumped 1% in September, the biggest rise since November 2012 (versus expectations of a 0.4% gain). ING economist James Knightley said: Today\u2019s data suggests that the US economy remains in pretty good shape even if bond and equity markets have their doubts. Jobless claims plunged to 264,000 last week, the lowest reading for over 14 years, which indicates that payrolls growth should accelerate. Manufacturing rose 0.5% even while auto output fell 1.4%MoM. Utilities output rose 3.9% and mining jumped 1.8%. All in all these are a really strong set of numbers that point to very decent GDP growth numbers for both 3Q and 4Q14, especially when you add in the huge boost to household spending power from plunging gasoline prices. Falling mortgage rates in the wake of the bonds market moves should also be supportive for growth. The risk that we have to be alert to is that the fall in equities and Ebola concerns sap confidence and households save this windfall. Here is a handy round-up of the market action from independent City analyst Louise Cooper. Safe assets in demand: 10yr German bunds fall to record intraday low of 0.716% 10 year UST yield fallen 58bp to 2.06% in one month Gold has gone from $1190 at beginning of October to $1240 (up 4.2% in just over a week) Risky assets spurned: FTSE100 currently down 1.6% today DAX down 1.3% today CAC down 1.8% today US futures currently indicating that the Dow Jones will open 1% lower at 2.30pm London time (after closing 1% lower last night). Greek stock market fallen 35% since mid June Greek 10yr bonds up from around 5.6% at beg Sept to 8.75% yield ICE Brent crude has fallen from $88.25 to $83 in the last three days Ross McEwan, the boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, has warned that the bailed out bank\u2019s customers are concerned about the impact of rising interest rates on their mortgage repayments and described the number of complaints about the industry as \u201cnothing short of appalling,\u201d writes Jill Treanor. A year into his role running the 81% taxpayer-owned bank, McEwan told the BBA conference that 1.5m people have bought their homes since 2007 so have never experienced the impact of a rise in interest rates and the bank intended to conduct extensive research on how customers react to rate rises. The information will be handed to regulators.McEwan said this was a moment for RBS to win back trust from its customers about how they would treated once mortgage rates started to rise and it might make it difficult for them to manage their household budgets. Admitting that the timing of a rate rise from the historic lows of 0.5% was difficult to predict, McEwan said: In particular we know that our mortgage customers are seeing conflicting reports about the timing of interest rate rises and they are concerned that they might not be able to balance their household budgets when the day comes, even if that is some time well into the future. This anxiety comes despite the fact that, like most banks, RBS and NatWest have stress tested our customers\u2019 affordability in the event of a significant rise in interest rates up to 7%. He said RBS would explain to customers how it would manage interest rate rises. Our customers expect us to handle this issue with transparency and with thoughtfulness. That is what our bank intends to do and what I think we as the UK banking industry need to do. McEwan said the 2.5m complaints against the industry this year was \u201cnothing short of appalling\u201d. \u201cIn any other industry that would be regarded as a crisis,\u201d said McEwan. He also warned that RBS faced a slew of regulatory issues, signalling fines for forex trading and the IT meltdown in 2012. Amid all the gloom in markets, data just showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to a 14-year low last week. But European stock markets seem to be ignoring the news. The FTSE 100 is still down over 100 points, or 1.7%, at 6107.12. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1.7% and France\u2019s CAC is 2.2% lower. The FTSE is heading for its sharpest two-day fall in three years, but some people think it could bounce back soon. Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi, told Reuters: I don\u2019t think there is any real, clear thing that is creating this anxiety. It seems [this is due to] general fears and people worried about the valuation so I think we\u2019re going to start to see a bounce fairly shortly. My colleague, Angela Monaghan, has looked at the reasons why stock markets are falling: Markets have fallen sharply across the world with a range of anxieties looming large: US economic slowdown, Ebola, German industrial woes, geopolitical tension, the eurozone crisis and fears that a major institution is about to collapse \u2013 and it\u2019s October. You can read the full article here. The FTSE is down more than 100 points now, taking it into technical correction territory, as we observed earlier (a correction being a fall of 10% from recent highs). The recent high of 6,878 was achieved on 4 September. The dividend yield on the UK market is now over 3.6%, while the 10 year gilt is yielding just under 2%. The Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio of the UK market suggests UK stocks are now cheaper than they were in 2003, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The market free fall has continued today, and the FTSE 100 has now suffered a technical correction, falling over 10% since the beginning of September. Markets are in fretful mode, heightened by the spectres of 2008 and 2011, which still haunt investors. However, long term investors should recognise there will be times like these which are uncomfortable, but when the best policy is to grin and bear it. Indeed, they might well see a glimmer of opportunity in current stock prices. The UK market now looks cheaper than it did at the bottom of the bear market in 2003, according to one long term valuation measure. Things could get well get worse before they get better. But when equities are yielding almost twice as much as gilts, you do have to stop and think where you want your long term savings invested. Banks \u201ccringing\u201d in front of regulators More from the BBA conference where a senior advisor to HSBC chairman Douglas Flint has warned that the new wave of regulations is forcing the bank to perform what he called \u201cpreemptive cringe in front of regulators\u201d, writes Jill Treanor. Describing the way the bank is pulling out of risky business areas, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles said \u201crisk appetite was shrinking\u201d as a result of new rules. HSBC was fined \u00a31.2bn by US regulators in 2012 to settle money laundering claims. Cowper-Coles is on a panel alongside regulators including deputy governor of the Bank of England Sir Jon Cunliffe, who said that consideration about the size of fines was needed. Cowper-Coles said the \u201cpunishment should suit the crime\u201d. Goldman Sachs profit boosted by pickup in bond market Goldman Sachs has reported a 50% jump in third quarter profit, thanks to last month\u2019s sudden pickup in bond market activity, which boosted trading revenue. Profits for the quarter beat analysts\u2019 expectations, at $2.24bn and earnings were $4.57 per share. Analysts had expected around $3.21 per share. The bank\u2019s total net revenue rose 25 percent to $8.39 billion. Here\u2019s some more detail courtesy of Reuters: Revenue from bond-trading, a notoriously volatile business, increased 74 percent to $2.17 billion as strong U.S. economic data, stimulus measures by the European Central Bank, and the surprise exit of trading superstar Bill Gross from giant bond-trading firm Pimco jolted what had been a listless market. But Goldman\u2019s fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) business has been on a declining trend since 2009 as new rules discourage banks from trading on their own book, and many in the industry wonder whether the business will ever truly rebound. \u201cThe combination of improving economic conditions in the U.S. and a strong global franchise continued to drive client activity across our diverse set of businesses,\u201d Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement, while acknowledging that \u201cconditions and sentiment can shift quickly.\u201d Wall Street is set to join the European sell-off, according to stock futures. The Footsie is now down more than 10% from its recent peak of 6878, reached on 4 September. The all-time high for the index was 6950, hit on 31 December 1999. The sell-off on European stock markets is gathering pace. Germany\u2019s Dax is now down nearly 2% and earlier broke through the 8400 level, while France\u2019s CAC has slid 2.8%. All the main European indices are nursing heavy losses, with banks among the biggest fallers. October is the cruellest month... ? The Wall Street crash of 1929 happened in October, as did Black Monday in 1987. However, it is worth noting that September has had its share of Black Days too, and sometimes the reaction is simply delayed into October (the catalysts that set off both the 1929 crash and the 1907 panic happened in September or earlier). More here on Investopedia. Greek 10-year bond yields rose by one percentage point today 8.86%. The euro has sunk to the day\u2019s low of $1.2756, down 0.6%. Against the yen, it hit an 11-month low of 134.98 yen. European banks and construction stocks are the worst hit, as they are sensitive to economic conditions. The eurozone\u2019s banking index tumbled 5.2% while the European construction index lost 3.2%. it\u2019s all kicking off again. German ten-year Bund yields have hit a new record low of 0.718%. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.9%, France\u2019s CAC has slid nearly 2%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has tumbled 3.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has fallen 2.8%. The FTSEurofirst 300 has tumbled 2.5% and it hits worst level since early September last year. The Footsie continues on its downward path, now down more than 130 points at 60821.73, a fall of over 2%. There are only four risers on the index. In volatile trading, the FTSE 100 is now down 1.1%, a fall of more than 70 points, at 6137.44 \u2013 having started the day up 1.1%. Returning to the 0.3% inflation figure for the eurozone, ING economist Martin van Vliet says: The very low inflation reading for September will reinforce concern that the Eurozone remains on a slippery slope to deflation. Until recently the consensus view was that headline inflation in the Eurozone would gradually start to pick up again from Q4 onwards. But now that oil prices have tanked, headline inflation may stay close to zero for longer and not reach 1% before Q4 of next year (if at all). Financial markets also seem increasingly concerned that Eurozone inflation could get stuck below the ECB\u2019s 2% target ceiling. Indeed, the ECB\u2019s favourite gauge of inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year forward inflation-swap rate is currently trading at a record low of 1.72%, which will not be received with much enthusiasm at the ECB. All in all, with the cushion against deflation getting smaller and smaller and economic growth in the Eurozone stagnating, pressure on the ECB to extend its purchase programmes by adding government bonds may become overwhelming over the next few months. Oil extended yesterday\u2019s heavy losses and dropped more than $1 a barrel to a four-year low. Growing worries over the global economy sent Brent crude, the global benchmark, to $82.72 a barrel earlier this morning, the lowest since November 2010. It is now at $83.09 a barrel. Brent has lost more than 28% since June when it hit a high of $115.71. Analysts at JBC Energy said: The $30 fall since June has led to an intense discussion whether prices could be in for a new norm. Markets are all over the place today. The FTSE 100 index has moved into the red, trading nearly 40 points lower, or 0.6%, at 6174.91. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are also in negative territory. More from the BBA conference. Jill Treanor reports: Andrea Leadsom, City minister, has told the BBA conference that she \u201cwants to move the debate forward, away from banker bashing of the past\u201d. A former member of the Treasury select committee, Leadsom is a former banker and did plenty of bashing of bankers when she sat on the committee until taking her current post in April. Leadsom said the government was pleased with the switching service - set up to make it easier for customers to guarantee they can move their bank account in seven days - and the new criminal rules being introduced. \u201cIf you manipulate a benchmark you can end up in prison,\u201d Leadsom said. Separate Eurostat figures show the eurozone recorded a trade surplus of \u20ac9.2bn in August, up from \u20ac7.3bn a year earlier, but down from July\u2019s revised figure of \u20ac21.6bn. Seasonally adjusted exports dropped 0.9% while imports tumbled 3.1%. Annual inflation in the 18-nation eurozone has come in at 0.3% for September, a five-year low (in August it was 0.4%). Eurostat confirmed an earlier flash estimate. Economists worry that price growth could soon turn negative, with the eurozone stuck in a feeble recovery. This is adding pressure on the European Central Bank to act. UK government bond prices edged lower today after yesterday\u2019s stellar gains when a market panic drove investors into safe haven assets. Yields on ten-year gilt yields rose to just over 2% while 30-year yields increased to 2.77%. The latter hit a record low of 2.704% yesterday, while ten-year yields lost more than 18 basis points. RBS bond strategist Simon Peck said there had been little fundamental economic news to justify yesterday\u2019s moves. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has sold more Tesco shares, after admitting earlier this month that he had made a \u201chuge mistake\u201d. Sean Farrell has all the details. In the meantime, UK drugmaker Shire \u2013 whose US suitor AbbVie abruptly changed its mind after the Obama administration got tough on tax inversions \u2013 put out a terse statement: The board of Shire notes the announcement by AbbVie of its board\u2019s decision to withdraw its recommendation of the offer for Shire. The board of Shire is considering the current situation and a further announcement will be made in due course. Back to the BBA\u2019s annual conference. Jill Treanor reports: Cathy Jamieson, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, has put banks on notice that Labour\u2019s aim is to create two new challenger banks and introduce a market share test for competition to bolster competition on the high street. Labour also intends to tell banks to publish the number of employees earning more than \u00a31m, she said. Jamieson also set out her concerns about the upcoming referendum on Europe. She said she was \u201cconcerned that the referendum timetable is creating huge uncertainty for business and financial services\u201d and stressed that Labour thinks that the UK \u201cshould have a seat at the table\u201d. She added \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful\u201d that the government is challenging the EU bonus cap. Asked about fines and said she took no pleasure in seeing fines but stressed that \u201cif there was wrongdoing, people have to take the consequences\u201d Bowler concludes: The closing months of 2014 mark the five-year anniversary of the end of the greatest economic slump since the 1930s. While we at The EIU are not expecting another worldwide crash, we have once again lowered our estimate for global GDP growth in 2014 and our forecast for 2015. What began as a promising year for the global economy will end on a sombre note. The bleak conditions in the euro zone continue to be the greatest drag on global growth according to The Economist Intelligence Unit, which has further lowered its 2015 global GDP forecast from 2.4% to 2.3% and its eurozone GDP growth forecast from 1.2% to 1.1%. According to John Bowler, director at The Economist Intelligence Unit: Despite the fact that weakness is apparent on a number of fronts, Europe is at the heart of the latest global slowdown. Only a handful of member states in the European Union, led by Poland, have seen output recover to the level reached before the recession. While Germany, France and the UK have regained what they lost, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Ireland remain in negative terrority. Germany, traditionally the engine of the European economy continues to be hurt by the Russia sanctions, with its August industrial production falling by the fastest rate since January 2009. The EIU believes the US recovery remains on track, keeping its 2015 GDP growth forecast at 3.2%. Employment continues to soar, which should in turn start to push up wages, further supporting the recovery. However the slowdown in other countries poses a risk to the US next year, the EIU judges. China\u2019s economy, after stabilising at mid-year, is softening again and as a result the EIU has cut its 2014 GDP growth estimate from 7.5% to 7.3% but maintains its 2015 global forecast of 7%. China should successfully manage a measured slowdown as it squeezes excesses from its financial system. Looking at financial markets, the EIU says: Global financial markets have been retreating as fears of the slower economic growth take hold. The crippling slowdown in Europe\u2019s economy and the unsettled state of emerging markets are pushing some investors close to panic. Of the four traditional asset classes (stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities), the most worrying is the price of oil, which has consistently been above US$100/barrel for the last two years. Weak growth, particularly Europe and China, is curbing demand for energy at a time when production, especially in the US, is rising rapidly. As a result the EIU has reduced its forecast for the price of oil (dated Brent) to US$97.60/barrel in 2015 from US$102.50 previously. Anthony Browne, boss of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, has kicked off the annual conference of the industry\u2019s lobby group by discussing what he calls the \u201c$100bn question,\u201d our banking correspondent Jill Treanor reports. Browne said: One question that is particularly topical that we have today called the $100bn question - is the level of fines coming out of the US. So I\u2019m looking forward to the discussions of the impact those huge fines are having on banks\u2019 behaviour as they try to derisk their businesses, ending services that could expose them to balance sheet altering penalties. Banks such as HSBC have warned about the fear of fines making them less likely to take risks and Browne picked up on this theme, popping to banks pulling services from people wanting to send home to sub-Saharan Africa, exporter and charities trying to get money to worn-torn countries because of fear they are processing money for \u201cterrorists or drug traffickers\u201d. Yields on Greek 10-year government bonds have topped 8% for the first time since February, amid concerns over early elections and Athens\u2019 plans to wean itself off international aid. Reuters is reporting that the European Central Bank has reduced the haircut it applies on bonds submitted by Greek banks as collateral to borrow funds, to boost their access to liquidity. A Greek central bank official told Reuters: The move was decided late on Wednesday evening after talks between the government, the ECB and Greece\u2019s central bank governor. It\u2019s a supportive move given the pressures in the last two days. The official said this means that an extra \u20ac12bn of liquidity could be tapped by Greek banks. Bank of Greece governor Yannis Stournaras was in Frankfurt on Wednesday. The recovery in European stocks has already petered out, less than an hour into trading. Some indices are tumbling again, such as Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB which is now down 1.1%, and Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 1.3%. France\u2019s CAC has also turned negative, and is trading 0.7% lower. The FTSE 100 index is still in positive territory but has pared gains, trading 18 points higher at 6230.10, a 0.3% increase. Germany\u2019s Dax is flat. The AbbVie-Shire deal is the biggest so far to be wrecked by new US rules on tax inversions, designed to make it harder for American multinationals to shift their tax base abroad to cut their tax bills. ...so whither AbbVie? It\u2019s an embarrassing, and costly, failure for boss Rick Gonzalez \u2013 especially because he had insisted that the deal wasn\u2019t just about tax savings. \u201cWe now know AbbVie was flying by the seat of its pants,\u201d says Neophytou at Panmure Gordon. With reputation at stake and possible litigation to face, why did AbbVie\u2019s board have such a dramatic change of heart? Perhaps it hopes to recoup its costs by suing the US government. Its intention is possibly hinted by \u201c...impact of the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s unilateral changes to the tax rules...target specifically a subset of companies that would be treated differently than either other inverted companies or foreign domiciled entities...\u201d in this morning\u2019s press release. The only consolation for Shire is that it will get a big break fee of $1.6bn. But its executives are losing out on retention payments worth \u00a319m. Where next for the rare diseases specialist? Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou says: In our view the fundamentals of the [Shire] business remain strong and valuation now looks attractive. We upgrade our recommendation to Buy (from Hold) and set a new price target of \u00a342. Investors will worry that Shire\u2019s defence plans are too ambitious. As part of its defence, Shire made a compelling case to revenue base of $10bn by 2020. For a company growing consistently in double digit range, the implied CAGR [compound annual growth rate] of 12-13% appears achievable. The company remains acquisitive... It is possible that the loss of four months strategic direction may have damaged those plans. Key staff may have made their own exit plans. However, Shire\u2019s rare diseases business remains an attractive asset and we expect Shire to have multiple suitors. European stock markets have bounced back more strongly than expected. The FTSE 100 index in London gained more than 60 points, a 1.1% rise, to 6280 in the first few minutes of trading. Shares in Shire are the only loser: they\u2019ve slumped another 11% to \u00a335.68 after yesterday\u2019s 22% drop, after the UK drugmaker was spurned by US rival AbbVie. After the surprise news yesterday that it was reconsidering its agreed \u00a334bn takeover of Shire, the AbbVie board called on shareholders to reject the deal in a statement this morning. Shire makes hyperactivity drugs and treatments for rare diseases, while AbbVie produces the world\u2019s top-selling medicine, Humira for rheumatoid arthritis. Germany\u2019s Dax increased 0.6% in early trading, France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s Ibex both added 0.7% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is up 0.8%. Oil prices have fallen further today. Brent crude is down 0.85% at $83.07 a barrel while New York light crude has lost 1.4% to $80.67 a barrel. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, believes the panic in financial markets is overdone. The growing sense of market panic evident in the sharp declines in equity prices and the strong rally in US Treasury bonds over the past week is hard to square with the solid outlook for US economic growth. We would still argue that the declines in oil prices and long-term interest rates will provide a net boost to real US GDP growth, even after allowing for the sell-off in stock markets. While the prospects for economic growth in the euro-zone have deteriorated, the outlook for global economic growth hasn\u2019t changed that much at all. The impact of that eurozone slowdown on the US economy will be modest anyway. The US economy hasn\u2019t suddenly gone into a nosedive. The slump in oil prices will also help to boost real incomes and, consequently, real consumption of other goods and services. Retail gasoline prices should slip below $3.00 a gallon soon. Lower long-term interest rates will boost investment and housing. We calculate that GDP increased by around 3.0% annualised in the third quarter and we anticipate a similar sized gain in the fourth. If US economic growth remains close to 3%, as we expect, then there is a strong likelihood that these latest market moves will be reversed sooner rather than later and that the Fed will still begin to hike rates sometime in the first half of next year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. European stock markets are expected to open slightly higher today after yesterday\u2019s sell-off. Poor US economic data triggered fresh fears over global growth, compounded by the rapid spread of Ebola in west Africa. US, UK and German bond yields also fell sharply and the price of oil hit a four-year low. Asian stock markets extended the losses seen in Europe and the US, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei tumbling 2.2% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng down 0.7%. We will get eurozone inflation data for September later, as well as US weekly jobless claims, industrial production for September and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey for October. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Fed Beige Book overnight did manage to paint a fairly positive outlook for the US economy, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be enough anymore to keep stocks at the levels we\u2019ve become used to in recent weeks.",

Indeed, the ECB\u2019s favourite gauge of inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year forward inflation-swap rate is currently trading at a record low of 1.72%, which will not be received with much enthusiasm at the ECB.

The crippling slowdown in Europe\u2019s economy and the unsettled state of emerging markets are pushing some investors close to panic. </p> <p>Of the four traditional asset classes (stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities), the most worrying is the price of oil, which has consistently been above US$100/barrel for the last two years. Weak growth, particularly Europe and China, is curbing demand for energy at a time when production, especially in the US, is rising rapidly. As a result the EIU has reduced its forecast for the price of oil (dated Brent) to US$97.60/barrel in 2015 from US$102.50 previously. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-16T09:00:16.796Z\">at 10.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-543f80c5e4b01d51bd0b04d5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-16T08:30:05.158Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The $100bn question</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Anthony Browne, boss of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, has kicked off the annual conference of the industry\u2019s lobby group by discussing what he calls the \u201c$100bn question,\u201d our banking correspondent Jill Treanor reports.

We would still argue that the declines in oil prices and long-term interest rates will provide a net boost to real US GDP growth, even after allowing for the sell-off in stock markets. <br></p> <p>While the prospects for economic growth in the euro-zone have deteriorated, the outlook for global economic growth hasn\u2019t changed that much at all. The impact of that eurozone slowdown on the US economy will be modest anyway. <br></p> <p>The US economy hasn\u2019t suddenly gone into a nosedive. The slump in oil prices will also help to boost real incomes and, consequently, real consumption of other goods and services. Retail gasoline prices should slip below $3.00 a gallon soon. Lower long-term interest rates will boost investment and housing. We calculate that GDP increased by around 3.0% annualised in the third quarter and we anticipate a similar sized gain in the fourth. <br></p> <p>If US economic growth remains close to 3%, as we expect, then there is a strong likelihood that these latest market moves will be reversed sooner rather than later and that the Fed will still begin to hike rates sometime in the first half of next year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-16T07:18:55.379Z\">at 8.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-543f62c9e4b0ebfb2a1bf31f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-16T06:41:01.571Z\">7.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone.</strong></p> <p>European stock markets are expected to open slightly higher today after yesterday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/15/ebola-economic-concerns-european-us-stockmarkets\">sell-off.

      "bodyText": "Wonga, the controversial payday lender, has hired a new finance director. The company, which was this month forced to write off the debts of 330,000 borrowers that it admitted it should never have been given loans, has appointed experienced debt management executive Paul Miles as its new chief financial officer. Miles, who is currently finance director of debt management company Capquest Group, will join Wonga before the end of the year, the company said. He is the second recent appointment by Wonga\u2019s new chairman, Andy Haste, who was brought in to overhaul the tarnished brand this summer. Both the appointees \u2013 Miles and Tara Kneafsey, managing director of Wonga UK \u2013 have previously worked with Haste at insurer RSA where he was chief executive. Haste is now searching for a new Wonga chief executive to replace Niall Wass, who quit in May just six months after taking over from founder Errol Damelin. Miles vowed to put \u201cgood governance and superior operating processes at the heart of everything Wonga does\u201d following a string of scandals at the company, including being censured by the regulator for sending threatening letters to its customers from fake law firms named after its employees.

      "bodyText": "The US drugs group AbbVie has pulled out of its proposed $54bn (\u00a334bn) takeover of Britain\u2019s Shire after the Obama administration introduced rules to clamp down on overseas acquisitions driven by tax avoidance. AbbVie said its board had withdrawn a recommendation to shareholders to vote for the deal. It said it made the decision after a detailed examination of the Treasury\u2019s measures, which made Shire less valuable to AbbVie. Shire said it was considering the situation before making a further announcement. Shire\u2019s shares fell 6.7% on Thursday morning to \u00a337.43, having fallen 22% on Wednesday after AbbVie announced it was reconsidering its offer. AbbVie\u2019s withdrawal from the deal, agreed in July, will cost it a $1.64bn break fee which it must pay to Shire under the companies\u2019 takeover agreement. Shire had rejected AbbVie\u2019s approach at first, saying the proposed tax arrangements made completion risky. The deal is the biggest to be scuttled by the White House\u2019s clampdown on so-called tax inversions by US companies buying overseas to secure a lower tax rate. The Chicago-based company had planned to shift its tax base from the US to Britain as part of the deal to cut its corporation tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: \u201cAlthough the strategic rationale of combining our two companies remains strong, the agreed upon valuation is no longer supported as a result of the changes to the tax rules and we did not believe it was in the best interests of our stockholders to proceed.\u201d Shire waived a requirement for AbbVie to give it three days\u2019 notice before its board meeting so that the US company could make its position clear. Under the UK\u2019s takeover code, the offer still stands but analysts said the deal was now over. Shire had agreed to be bought after two months of talks. As part of its defence, Shire said it had a strong independent future and set a target of doubling annual sales to $10bn by 2020. Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said Shire\u2019s targets could prove too ambitious after the company and its researchers were distracted by the takeover. But he held out the prospect of further offers for the company, which is best known for its hyperactivity treatments but increasingly concentrates on rare diseases. Neophytou said: \u201cIt is possible that the loss of four months\u2019 strategic direction may have damaged those plans. Key staff may have made their own exit plans. However, Shire\u2019s rare diseases business remains an attractive asset and we expect Shire to have multiple suitors.\u201d US Treasury officials unveiled new rules last month to make it harder for US companies to complete tax inversion deals. The measures bar companies from using cash held overseas to fund such takeovers. Burger King\u2019s planned $11bn purchase of Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons reignited the furore over inversions, which Barack Obama has said are unpatriotic. Other US companies looking to redomicile abroad to save tax include Pfizer, whose \u00a369bn attempt to buy AstraZeneca, Britain\u2019s second-largest pharmaceutical firm, failed in May. The Viagra maker could come back with a new bid late next month after a six-month cooling-off period expires. In its statement, AbbVie said it had pulled out because of \u201cthe unexpected nature of the exercise of administrative authority to impact longstanding tax principles\u201d and said the White House\u2019s measures treated particular types of company differently from other inverted companies or foreign-based businesses.",
