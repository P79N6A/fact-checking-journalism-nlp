    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The German government has run out of patience. It was obvious at the EU summit on Friday when the German delegation let it be known that the second rescue package for Greece must be the final word. If it proves too small, and Greece cannot afford to pay public sector wages, then it must default on its debts. Talking to senior German negotiators last week, I found a change in attitude that was shocking for its clear and cold-hearted resolution. Not so long ago Berlin was concerned to be viewed as a champion of European unity. There was a genuine fear that a Greek default would terminate 50 years of building towards a European super state. Now Greece, in its enfeebled state, fails two tests. First, German officials are convinced it remains riddled with corruption, grift and racketeering such that it is impossible to make any agreements stick. Second, there is a better firewall to protect the eurozone from further shocks. The firewall is the \u20ac440bn European financial stability facility and the prospect of accelerated payments by member states into its successor the ESM, which is enough to insure against a Greek bankruptcy when placed alongside the \u20ac219bn of sovereign loans by the European Central Bank and \u20ac1 trillion in ECB loans to tide the banking system through the worst of the crisis. With a firewall in place and no confidence Athens can implement a serious reform agenda, Greece is robbed of its negotiating power. \"There is no standing still for Greece. It must either move forward with reforms or leave,\" said one official. This leaves Greece in an impossible position. With sky-high debts, a five year recession stretching into at least another two and loan interest to pay, there is no way Athens can meet Brussel's demands. Even after the deal to write down its private sector debt to 120% of GDP, the economic situation can only improve with the kind of asset fire sale and mass wage cuts that leaves the political situation desperately unstable. As Terry Smith of money broker Tullet Prebon recently wrote: \"Greek budget numbers show government revenue decreased 4.9% in January and spending rose 8%. Revenues fell from \u20ac5.122bn to \u20ac4.872bn. Spending rose from \u20ac4.967bn to \u20ac5.362bn. Apparently this is a different budget to the one that the Euro budget police look at.\" The German finance ministry under Wolfgang Schaeuble knows it has failed to put Greece in a sustainable position \u2013 with a platform from which it can bring forward reforms \u2013 but it doesn't care. In a tragi-comic twist, the view from Berlin echoes that of many Greeks, including Taki, the Spectator's High Life columnist, who took time out in his 25 February article to document his compatriots' faults. He said: \"They still believe in the most thieving politicians this side of Nigeria,\" who, in turn, protect a vast army of overpaid civil servants that operate through patronage and bribes. The German foreign ministry is of a similar view. Zsolt Darvas, an economist at the Breugel research institute in Brussels agrees that the Germans have done enough to isolate Greece, but says their argument that the eurozone can now plan for growth is flawed. There are the Spanish youth unemployment figures, at 49.9%. No wonder prime minister Mariano Rajoy has already told his German counterpart Angela Merkel he needs respite from her demands for cuts. Not for more than a century has medical science recommended bleeding patients to make them better, yet some economic scientists cling to this remedy. Germans, keen to protect their wealth, are slavish adherents. In Italy, where a clampdown on spending has brought plaudits, unemployment is rising and national politics is becoming more polarised. The technocrat in charge, Mario Monti, has plans to end age-old restrictive practices, but there are plenty of politicians in Silvio Berlusconi's party and the leftist New Democracy waiting to wreck them: not because they are delinquent, but because they represent people who will suffer huge falls in living standards. Portugal, the Germans reassure themselves, is knuckling down in a way the Greeks can only dream of. Likewise the Irish. Yet while many Irish politicians consider the pain of austerity a much deserved penance for past sins, the Portuguese are clear they have nothing to apologise for. Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citigroup, points out that weaker members of the eurozone collectively need to borrow some \u20ac2tn over the next two years. He argues that the only way to borrow this sum is for a more collective plan. One that entails some form of joint liability for countries' debts. \"A proposal from the German council of economic experts for a European debt redemption fund, which would mutualise all eurozone members' debts above 60% of GDP, with strict rules to pay them off over 25 years, is gaining traction in some quarters. Germany itself remains staunchly opposed to anything that smells of Eurobonds, and the current period of calm has only reinforced that resistance.\" Everything the Germans want could be undone without a more forgiving attitude. If the EU presses ahead with fines for countries that fail to meet new tough deficit targets, the riots in Barcelona last week could be the first round in a widespread revolt.",

      "bodyText": "Has the behemoth had its day? After years of relentless expansion, the UK's biggest retailer, Tesco, last week saw its market share fall to the lowest level since 2005. The supermarket gained the upper hand over its rivals by ambitiously opening ever-larger stores across the country. That strategy may now be coming back to bite it. As internet shopping becomes ever more popular, hypermarkets and enormous warehouse-style stores are beginning to look as futuristic as the woolly mammoth. When you can order online for delivery to your home, why spend money on expensive petrol to drive to a cavernous store and drag the kids along aisles as long as a football pitch in search of items that may not be in stock? In January, when Tesco delivered a shock profits warning, chief executive Phil Clarke indicated that the days of massive new stores were over. He told reporters: \"Do you need to build large hypermarkets in the UK when the internet is taking so much growth in electricals, in clothing, in general merchandise?\" Industry insiders say that it was probably a mistake for any supermarket to open stores over 60,000-70,000 sq ft, as it is becoming a challenge to fill them with enticing products when many things sell better online. Most supermarkets do not offer a particularly inspiring shopping experience or well-informed staff. Their main selling points are convenience, reliability and price. The internet has ratcheted up competition on all those measures, particularly in music, electrical goods, books and even clothing. Of course supermarkets are not alone. Retailers across the UK are realising that they have too much physical space. The economic downturn, which has dampened retail sales growth, has only exaggerated a strategic shift towards the internet. Consultancy Verdict Research says online sales have more than doubled to \u00a326.3bn in the last five years and will rise to \u00a340bn by 2015. The pace of change has varied dramatically for retailers in different sectors. The most dramatic shift is in music and film retail where more than half of physical products, not including downloads, are now sold online, according to Verdict. HMV has announced the closure of 40 stores while rivals Music Zone, Virgin and Borders have all disappeared from the high street. Electricals stores are also under pressure with just over a quarter of their goods, from washing machines to hi-fis, now sold online. US retailer Best Buy pulled out of the UK last year closing all 11 stores while rival Comet was sold for just \u00a32 and Dixons Retail, which owns Currys and PC World, saw underlying sales in the UK and Ireland fall by 7% for the 12 weeks to 7 January. In fashion, just 9% of sales are online, according to Verdict, yet several retailers including Philip Green's Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Bhs, are looking at store closures. Big department stores like Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, House of Fraser and Debenhams are fighting back against online competition with clever multi-channel strategies. New services are merging the physical and virtual shopping experience such as \"click and collect\", where shoppers can order online and pick up in a store of their choice and \"quick response\" (QR) labels which, if scanned with a smartphone, can take shoppers straight to a mobile online store to get information or make a purchase. Some stores, such as Apple and House of Fraser, are experimenting with giving staff mobile internet devices such as iPads so that they are better able to answer queries from shoppers who now have access to a wealth of information via their mobile phone. House of Fraser and rival John Lewis are also trying out much smaller stores supported by internet kiosks which give the opportunity to buy and get delivered a bigger range of products beyond those on display. Even in DIY, where less than 6% of sales go online, retailers are preparing themselves for the future. DIY giant B&amp;Q revealed last week that it is to refurbish its entire 358-store estate to improve the experience for shoppers. It is also investing heavily in internet and multi-channel services. Ian Cheshire, chief executive, says: \"Everyone has got to worry about the internet. Our biggest single investment in the UK is going to be multi-channel systems and infrastructure this year. If you are not investing in that you are going to be in trouble.\" Supermarkets have not ignored online retailing. Tesco and rivals Asda, Sainsbury's and Waitrose all offer groceries and non-food online with \"click and collect\" services. They have been able to attract new shoppers to buy a massive range of fashion, homewares and electricals online, some of which does not appear in their stores. All the major supermarkets are also rapidly expanding into small local stores to take advantage of the trend towards more frequent small shopping trips rather than a weekly blow-out at a hypermarket. Judith McKenna, chief operating officer, at Asda says: \"People are shopping at large hypermarkets less frequently. That's partly because of the internet but also because they don't want to spend money on driving out there. We've recognised that change and that is why we are opening more small local stores that offer convenience.\" But those grocers have also been unwilling to give up on their addiction to new physical space. Supermarkets were working on the development of 40% more new space in the first half of 2011 than they were in 2008 according to property company CBRE, all offering more room for general merchandise. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino, says the supermarkets, and particularly Tesco, need to switch their focus into investing in their existing portfolio rather than opening new stores. \"Although you may think people go for the lowest price, most people are questioning whether to buy things at all at the moment and they need cajoling or inspiring into spending. If the setting is not interesting or inspirational it's easy to leave an item on the shelf,\" he says. All supermarkets have been slow to realise that shoppers now want more from a store, but Saunders says: \"Tesco was more aggressive than anyone else in opening new space and so they have found themselves with more of an issue than a lot of other retailers.\" Tesco has clearly recognised it has a problem. Last week it announced plans to spend \u00a3300m on improving its stores and customer service. Ideas include beauty counters, electrical sales areas similar to the popular Apple stores and healthy eating centres similar to Holland &amp; Barrett. It will take some effort to improve the stores but there is every chance for Tesco to succeed. For all the hype about the internet, physical stores remain important, claiming 90% of all retail sales. Physical retailers offer more flexibility, excitement and convenience than pure-play online stores. Even Amazon, the world's most successful online retailer, has its own struggles. The retailer has warned that it expects to make a full-year loss this year. While music and books can be delivered digitally or popped through the letterbox, there is a whole range of products that are much trickier to deliver to a home. It's much easier to pick up clothing, DIY equipment or big electrical goods from a store. McKenna at Asda says: \"People browse in store but might choose to shop online. You have to think of a joined up offer.\" Enormous stores may need rethinking, but they are unlikely to become extinct in the near future.",

      "bodyText": "When MPs call on shareholders to rein in runaway executive pay, and the public wonders in exasperation why investors in RBS didn't tame Fred Goodwin's overweening ambition, or block the American takeover of Cadbury, they probably imagine a group of enlightened owners carefully shepherding the firms they control. The reality of today's equity markets is very different. Deep-seated structural forces favour hands-off ownership, short-term myopic decision-making and quick sell-outs. The interim report by the Kay review of Equity Markets, chaired by economist John Kay and published last week, set out the problem perfectly. According to Kay, there was a striking consensus among the hundreds of experts who responded to his review about the kind of role shareholders ought to play in UK plc \u2013 and similarly strong agreement that we are a very long way away from it. In fact, as Kay explains, this idea of \"stewardship\" is far from the reality of today's economy. Share ownership in UK plc is widely dispersed; a growing proportion of trades are executed automatically by computer; and fund managers often have to account for their performance each quarter, despite the fact many of their clients, not least pension fund members, are only interested in returns over a much longer period. All this tends to militate against investors spending time building up an intimate knowledge of the firms they own, and thinking about their long-term strategy. As Kay says, some shareholders take a long-term perspective and are closely engaged with the companies they hold stakes in; many others are not. Tellingly, former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy told the review he had \"missed the opportunity\" for more constructive engagement with his shareholders. David Swensen, who manages Yale University's $16bn endowment fund, says he likes to \"kick the tyres\" of the businesses in which he takes a stake; but many fund managers go nowhere near the companies they invest in. The ultimate owners, often pension fund beneficiaries, are even more removed. There are many reasons for the lack of a culture of stewardship by the owners of today's companies; but Vince Cable, who commissioned the report, has rightly identified it as one of the bugbears of the British economy. Kay takes aim at two of the treasured fixed beliefs of financial markets. The first is the idea that investors must be treated equally. Firms with two classes of shareholders used to be common, and still exist in the US: for instance News International, where the Murdoch family holds a minority stake, but a majority of the so-called B shares that carry voting rights. But in the UK, the notion of treating one group of shareholders differently has become anathema. Kay signals that it may be time for that to change. Perhaps, for example, the short-term \"arbitrageurs\" who pile into shares after a corporate bid is announced and can then help push through a takeover could be denied voting rights. But as Kay suggests, \"the principle of a qualifying period before voting rights are acquired might be applied generally, and not just in the context of a takeover.\" Placing short-term traders at a disadvantage to longer-term investors would be controversial; but it could start to sow the seeds of a cultural change in the City. The second, perhaps even more cherished, principle that Kay appears willing to ditch is quarterly reporting: the idea that companies, and the asset managers who buy and sell many of their shares, must produce a deluge of information every three months about their financial performance. In theory, quarterly reporting enhances transparency and focuses bosses' minds on the sacred idea of \"shareholder value\". But as became clear during the credit crisis, what's good for the share price in the short term isn't necessarily to the benefit of the company, let alone the wider economy, in the long run. The tyranny of chasing the quarterly numbers can cloud more considered strategic thinking, and has helped to spawn the byzantine executive pay schemes that claim to align bosses' interests with those of the shareholders but can end up rewarding them handsomely for meaningless financial engineering, for instance tarting a firm up for sale to a ruthless foreign predator, or for driving their company to the edge of a cliff and baling out just in time. Even Jack Welch, the legendary GE boss regarded as the father of the idea of \"shareholder value\", has since disowned his offspring, telling the FT three years ago that he now regarded chasing quarterly returns as \"the dumbest idea in the world\". \"Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy,\" he said. \"Your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.\" Abandoning quarterly reporting would seem like a backward step if you assume that more information must always be a good thing; but short-term targets will inevitably distort decision-making. In the worst cases, as Enron's sorry tale showed, the frenzied pursuit of \"the number\" can lead to outright fraud. But even in the best, it can lead to the corporate equivalent of the kind of initiative-itis that afflicts chancellors when there's a budget in the offing. Judging by these musings, Kay is ready to think the unthinkable about the inner workings of capitalism, UK style. The cult of boardroom excess that's built up over 20 years, the desperate bailout of the financial sector that once accounted for a major chunk of FTSE100, and the sell-off of many of our proudest firms is ample evidence that such a fundamental rethink is long overdue.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leading the crusade against global poverty in 2012 might seem a thankless task, as austerity-racked taxpayers in the west lose sympathy with needy foreigners and China bestrides Africa brandishing its chequebook. But Jeffrey Sachs, the US celebrity economist, has already put his hat in the ring for the soon-to-be-vacant post of president of the World Bank \u2013 and he's enthusiastic about the challenge. \"This is potentially a time of remarkable breakthroughs in development,\" he says. \"We're seeing so many demonstrations and so many success stories. There are clusters of knowhow and technology that are extremely powerful.\" As one example, he says new developments in healthcare mean that \"we are on the edge, if we manage and implement it properly, of a tremendous decline in infant, child and maternal mortality\". What's required, he says, is not expanding the World Bank's reach \u2013 its 9,000 employees already operate in more than 100 countries and it has lent more than $103bn since the financial crisis in 2008 \u2013 but narrowing its focus, rolling out new technologies and spreading development best practice. \"It's a nitty-gritty problem to go from the idea to the implementation, and that's where I really believe my 25 years of sleeves-rolled-up, directly engaged in on-the-ground problem-solving, will help.\" Long before the current incumbent, Robert Zoellick, announced last month that he would step down this summer, two names had been widely suggested as Washington's choice for his successor: the former treasury secretary Larry Summers and secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Development advocates are deeply sceptical about both: Summers will forever be tainted by his vocal support for financial deregulation when he was Bill Clinton's economic adviser, while Hillary Clinton is so closely associated with promoting US foreign policy \u2013 it is her day job, after all \u2013 that she might struggle to endear herself to China, India and the bank's other increasingly powerful middle-income shareholders. The job at the top of the Washington-based bank has long been handed to an American, under a stitch-up agreed at the postwar Bretton Woods conference which puts a European \u2013 currently Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde \u2013 at the top of the IMF. The \"Brics\" countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 have declared that they would like to see a more open process for the bank job this time, but they may struggle to unite around a non-American candidate. Sachs, clearly not someone who struggles with self-doubt, says he has been overwhelmed by calls from heads of state welcoming his candidacy. He feels that it is America he'll need to convince if he is to get the job. \"I'm not a Washington insider. I'm working closely with governments all over the world. That's what I have been doing for 25 years.\" He's never been a run-of-the-mill, ivory tower academic. Along with Nobel prizewinners Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, he is one of the few economists who have built careers in the US as public intellectuals as well as professors, wading into political debate, in Sachs's case often to remind the insular US about the importance of the world outside. Time magazine has called him \"the world's best-known economist\". He is based at Columbia University's Earth Institute and acts as an adviser to the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, on how to achieve the millennium development goals, which set the world targets on poverty, education and health. But Sachs's role in development hasn't always been uncontentious. As a consultant in the late 1980s and early 1990s while an academic at Harvard, he advised Poland, then Russia, on their economic reforms. The strategy adopted by the Kremlin, under the tutelage of the IMF and the US treasury, involved a headlong dash towards privatisation and liberalisation that became known as \"shock therapy\". The consequences were disastrous, enriching a tiny coterie of oligarchs who bought up public assets on the cheap, and driving Russia towards defaulting on its debts. However, Sachs now disowns the extreme policies for which many have since blamed him. \"People who really know me know that I have always believed from the first days of my work as an economist in a middle path, and a moderate course of how economies should work.\" Today, he says his recipe for beating severe poverty is not to go around world capitals with a begging bowl, asking for a bigger budget, but to make existing resources work harder. \"I don't think the bank is achieving its potential. It's spread over so many things right now, and it isn't mobilising the kinds of partnerships that I think would make a definitive difference to achieving the millennium development goals.\" He makes no bones about the fact that many of the \"partnerships\" he has in mind would be with multinational companies. \"I think the private sector is obviously essential for success on so many grounds,\" he says. \"These companies know what they're doing. They're the most global actors in the world; they're often operating in more than 100 countries and they hold the technologies that are the key to development \u2013 with information technology, with broadband, with healthcare, with agriculture, with infrastructure.\" Private sector involvement in development has become increasingly common, but remains highly controversial. Campaigners fear that the firms involved are more interested in marketing spin than saving the world, and fret that their involvement only increases the costs of development. But Sachs insists: \"You can work with these companies in a way that says, 'this isn't where our profit motive is right now', but where they make their technology available, and the public sector helps to diffuse it.\" Above all, he's realistic about the limits of compassion in the west. \"I'm not seeking this job with the idea of making an appeal for massive increases in foreign aid: it's not going to happen.\"",
