      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has reported a new \u00a37bn loss \u2013 its ninth consecutive year deep in the red \u2013 which has taken its total losses since the 2008 financial crash to more than \u00a358bn. The 73% taxpayer-owned bank said it would not return to profit until 2018 and announced a \u00a32bn cost-cutting plan, which will mean more job losses and branch closures to put the bank back in the black. Ross McEwan, the chief executive who was paid \u00a33.5m last year, said: \u201cThe bottom line loss we have reportedis, of course, disappointing but given the scale of the legacy issues we worked through in 2016, it should not come as a surprise.\u201d The 2016 loss was caused by \u00a310bn of one-off items, including \u00a35.9bn set aside for looming fines and legal costs, largely related to a forthcoming penalty from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) for mis-selling toxic bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis. McEwan pointed the finger of blame for the continuing losses at the regime of former RBS boss Fred Goodwin, who was in charge of the bank when it needed a taxpayer bailout: \u201cThese costs are a stark reminder of what happens to a bank when things go wrong and you lose focus on the customer, as this bank did before the financial crisis.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a bank that has been on a remarkable journey. We still have further to go. But the next three years will not be the same as the past three.\u201d Once one of the biggest banks in the world, RBS has embarked on a dramatic downsizing since the crisis. Staff numbers have fallen from 170,000 to 80,000 and McEwan conceded that his latest plan to cut cost \u2013 including \u00a3750m in 2017 \u2013 would lead to cuts in branches and jobs. While refusing to disclose the scale of redundancies, McEwan admitted: \u201cThere will be job losses that we have to go through.\u201d Union officials urged RBS to introduce a moratorium on branch closures. The bank has 1,200 RBS and NatWest branches, not including 300 branches that the EU had demanded it should sell in return for its state bailout. Rob MacGregor, the Unite union\u2019s national officer, said: \u201cIts ruthless approach to pay for the mistakes of the past jeopardises customer service and risks leaving communities and businesses reliant on their local bank branch high and dry.\u201d McEwan, who took over when Stephen Hester left in 2013, said he intended to stay at RBS until the bank was back in the black: \u201cWe\u2019ve done all the hard work in the last three and half years. I can sense this bank is on the turn.\u201d His \u00a33.5m pay was the same as 2015 while bonuses for staff fell 8% to \u00a3343m. A total of 87 RBS bankers received more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3850,000). However, the bank said the average salary across the organisation was \u00a332,620. The bank also handed \u00a3496,000 to its previous boss Hester, three years after he quit the bank, as a final payment. Chairman Sir Howard Davies said McEwan and current bank staff should not be penalised for \u201csins of the past\u201d, but the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, which campaigns for a tax on banks to tackle poverty and climate change, described the payments as an insult. The two main issues hanging over RBS is settlement with the DoJ and the sale of 300 branches \u2013 known as Williams &amp; Glyn. The Treasury hopes that sale can now be avoided by other measures to inject competition into the small business market, although these may not be approved by Brussels until later this year. Until these problems are resolved, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said he will not be able sell off RBS shares, which fell 4% to 246p on news of the latest loss. That is less than half the 502p average price that taxpayers paid for them. \u201cWhile progress is being made, there is still work to do and RBS must continue to deal with its legacy issues,\u201d a Treasury spokesperson said. The annual report lists a range of legal matters, including a case by shareholders over the 2008 rights issue. RBS intends to fight the case which McEwan said \u201c could go on for years\u201d. RBS has settled with four other shareholder groups and set aside \u00a3800m. McEwan was critical of former directors attempting to join the proceedings. Among other items weighing on the bank are compensation for the sale of interest-rate hedging products to small businesses, investigations related to terrorist financing in the US and providing redress to small businesses badly treated by its now-defunct global restructuring group, GRG. RBS has set aside \u00a3400m for GRG. \u201cRBS is showing a bit of top-line income growth in its core UK banking operations,\u201d said Sandy Chen at Cenkos, an independent specialist securities firm.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Howard Davies, chair of Royal Bank of Scotland, described the \u00a37bn loss the bank rang up last year as \u201cstark\u201d. But it is just a fraction of the bank\u2019s towering total losses of \u00a358bn over the nine years since it was bailed out by the taxpayer. And the bank will rack up even more losses this year. The reported losses hide the true extent of the problems inside the Edinburgh-based bank, because they have been offset by the cash RBS has continued to generate since its \u00a345bn rescue. The total cost of disastrous lending, over-paying for takeovers, fines and legal bills actually tops \u00a390bn. Some of the key causes of RBS\u2019s long period in the red are: Troubled takeovers \u2014 which required more than \u00a316bn of goodwill write downs in 2008. That was the year of the banking crisis and the year after RBS took over Dutch bank ABN Amro, which left the UK bank with inadequate capital levels. Fred Goodwin, who left at the time of the bailout, was famously dubbed a megalomaniac by an analyst. Included in the writedowns was \u00a37.6bn for ABN and \u00a34.3bn for buying the Charter One US bank in 2004. Restructuring charges \u2014 have left the cost of shrinking the bank at \u00a313bn, as RBS has sold businesses and slashed costs in an effort to stem losses. An estimated 90,000 jobs have gone from the business since 2008, when RBS had operations in 54 countries that spanned all areas of financing, from aircraft leasing to current accounts. As a penalty for the state aid required to keep the bank in business. the EU forced RBS to sell off businesses including commodity broker Sempra, the money transmission business WorldPay, insurer Direct Line and US bank Citizens. All these took thousands of staff with them. The EU also demanded RBS get rid of 300 UK branches. They were separated and RBS tried to sell them, but that effort has now been abandoned \u2013 at a cost of \u00a32.5bn. Bad lending and other poor trading decisions \u2014 caused impairment charges \u2014 to cover loans that will never be repaid in full, or at all \u2014 of more than \u00a340bn. These peaked at \u00a314bn in 2009, but have continued to gouge deep holes in the bank\u2019s profits well into to 2014. Ulster Bank lending was a big source of these bad debts, along with loans made by Citizens in the US, and losses in the UK on mortgages, credit card losses and to major British companies. Fines and legal costs \u2014 have amounted to \u00a315bn. They started to bite in 2011 when RBS \u2014 like other banks \u2014 began setting aside bilions to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. Its bill for PPI has now reached almost \u00a35bn, while the industry\u2019s has topped \u00a330bn. In 2013 RBS was also fined \u00a3390m for rigging Libor and \u00a3800m for manipulating foreign exchange markets. The bank has just set aside a new \u00a35.9bn to cover a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the decade-old scandal in the US over mis-selling residential mortgage backed securities. Credit losses \u2014 some \u00a37bn was lost on complicated credit derivatives trades in the 2007 credit crunch, which turned toxic.",

Betting companies have largely rejected suggestions that their ads are seen by too many vulnerable people and children, but William Hill\u2019s finance director said he understood people\u2019s concerns. \u201cI have teenage children and we are sympathetic to some sort of curb or some sort of review around the level of advertising,\u201d said Philip Bowcock. Asked if companies were glamourising gambling, he claimed William Hill was more cautious than some high street rivals. \u201cYou could say that we are a little bit more corporate, but we try and be responsible about what we promote,\u201d he said. Bowcock, the interim CEO after the departure of James Henderson last July following successive profit warnings, is among the favourites to be named chief executive, with a decision due within weeks. His comments on advertising, as the company announced a 1% increase in pre-tax profit to \u00a3226m, come as the government reviews the potential harm caused by fixed-odds betting terminals and TV advertising. The gambling industry has largely been defensive about the impact on children of TV advertising, which is banned before the 9pm watershed, except during sports events. The Remote Gambling Association, which counts William Hill among its members, rejected the need for curbs on the industry last year. And the Association of British Bookmakers has pointed to voluntary measures such as scrapping adverts for free bets before the watershed. But one industry source said backing restrictions on daytime TV ads may benefit William Hill. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got hundreds of shops with your name in the window, you\u2019ve got much greater exposure than someone like Sun Bets, who have to do stunts with pies to get their name into the market,\u201d said the source, referring to the controversial incident involving the Sutton United reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw. GambleAware recently launched adverts highlighting the risks of addiction.

      "bodyText": "New US home sales rose less than expected, up 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted 555,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 6.3% increase. December\u2019s number was also revised down slightly to 535,000 units from 536,000. The median price for a new home increased 7.5% annually to $312,900 in January. On that note we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for your comments, and have a good weekend. Trading is underway on Wall Street with the major US indices all down: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 20,788 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,356 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 5,315 Back with Greece now, where Yannis Stournaras, the Bank of Greece governor, has been giving his annual address to shareholders. The central bank boss echoed the message from prime minister Alexis Tsipras: Greece is on the road to recovery. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Casting recent prognostications of catastrophe to the winds, the Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras said Greece had not only shown \u201cremarkable resilience\u201d over the past two years but was well on the road to economic recovery. Addressing the bank\u2019s 84th annual meeting of shareholders, Stournaras said GDP contracted by just 0.2 % in 2015 despite \u201cthe particularly adverse conditions\u201d that prevailed during the first half of the year when debt-stricken Greece came closest yet to exiting the euro area and capital controls were ultimately imposed. In 2016, a whole, he said, GDP rose by 0.3 %, deflationary pressures were contained, employment picked up and joblessness (though at 23 % still the highest in the EU) dropped. These developments are a strong indication that the Greek economy has growth potential, which after remaining idle for so long, stands ready to be tapped into, as soon as the right conditions are in place. Besides, despite the mistakes and the backsliding, despite the heavy economic and social costs of the crisis, the economic adjustment programmes implemented over the past years have succeeded in addressing chronic weaknesses and structural shortcomings of the Greek economy, thereby facilitating the improvement in the medium-to-long term growth potential. Listing the country\u2019s achievements he said the primary fiscal deficit and current account deficit had both been eliminated, the substantial cumulative loss in labour cost competitiveness had been recouped, exports as a percentage of GDP had almost doubled, banks had been recapitalised and the labour and product markets subjected to major structural reforms. There were risks, starting with a volatile global environment, the rise in euroscepticism across the EU and potential changes in US foreign and economic policies under the new Trump administration. Delays in implementing reforms and concluding the latest bailout review also posed dangers. But he insisted Greece had \u201creached the final stretch.\u201d Very little remains to be done compared to the massive changes made since 2010. The process of economic adjustment has largely been completed. Bank of England governor Mark Carney held a meeting with US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington on Thursday. In his capacity as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, Carney discussed international financial regulation with the newly appointed and fellow Goldman Sachs alumnus Mnuchin. According to a statement from the US treasury, Mnuchin stressed that Donald Trump\u2019s administration would promote US interests in global talks on financial regulation: Secretary Mnuchin underscored that he looked forward to working with governor Carney on international financial regulatory issues and noted that one of the administration\u2019s core principles for financial regulation is to promote American interests in international financial regulatory negotiations and meetings. The secretary stressed the importance of cooperation between the United States and other G-20 and Financial Stability Board members to achieve our common goals of addressing financial stability risks, fostering efficient global financial markets, and promoting a global level playing field. Trump has appointed several Goldman Sachs almuni to senior positions in the White House, a fact that was not lost on RBS chairman Sir Howard Davies during his Q&amp;A with analysts earlier today: Wall Street is expected to open lower on the back of lower oil prices and a fading \u201cTrump rally\u201d. Brent crude oil prices are down 1% at $55.97 a barrel, after US crude inventories rose for a seventh week in a sign of over supply. The business secretary Greg Clark is the latest person to receive assurances from the Peugeot boss about the future of Vauxhall car manufacturing. Earlier on Friday, Carlos Tavares told Unite boss Len McCluskey the French company was not here to close plants. Clarke said: I had a constructive meeting with the chief executive in which I made the case for how important Vauxhall is to the UK, the excellence of its plants and operations across the UK and how successful they have been. The meeting was reassuring, we discussed how PSA\u2019s approach is to increase market share and expand production, rather than close plants. I was assured that the commitments to the plants would be honoured. There was also recognition that members of the Vauxhall pension fund will be no worse off. Mr Tavares said no deal has been done, discussions continue and he and I agreed to stay in close touch. This is a very important company and workforce which has been successful and we all want it to be just as successful in the future. Banks based in Britain will probably have to move some of their operations to the EU post Brexit to retain market access. That is the view of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret. Speaking in London, he said: In the end, there might well be two separate jurisdictions in which (banks) operate, and these jurisdictions might diverge over time \u2013 or instantly, once the divorce has gone through. So it seems that the prospects for EU market access through the UK look rather dim. I expect London to remain an eminent global financial centre. Nevertheless, I also expect a number of UK-based market participants to move at least some business units in order to hedge against all possible outcomes of the negotiations. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson says equities are beginning to look tired. European markets look set to finish the week on the back foot as the air starts to slowly come out of the recent rally. The German DAX has continued to pull back after hitting its highest levels since April 2015 earlier this week. The FTSE 100 has also come under pressure, hitting a two week low as a number of earnings reports disappointed. After spending the last few days climbing a wall of expectation, are investors starting to lose their footing, on heightened political concerns and a reassessment of the reflation trade? With gold also at four month highs it would appear that caution is back at the forefront today. He points out the implications of new record lows for yields on two-year German government bonds: German 2 year prices hit new record highs and yields go to an incomprehensible -0.95%. With German inflation currently at 2%, that equates to a real yield of -3%. German savers will love that! After a low-key start, market falls have accelerated as the afternoon trading session gets underway. In the UK, RBS, Standard Chartered and the miners are dragging the FTSE 100 down. Across the Channel, uncertainty surrounding the French election appears to be weighing on sentiment. The latest scores: FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,222 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.5% at 11,769 France\u2019s CAC: -1.4% at 4,822 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 18,616 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.7% at 9,426 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -1.1% at 369 The Robin Hood Tax Campaign is commenting on the RBS results, which revealed a \u00a37bn loss for 2016, making a total loss of \u00a358bn since 2008. David Hillman spokesperson for the campaign, described Ross McEwan\u2019s\u00a33.5m pay as an \u201cinsult\u201d. RBS has racked up astronomical losses of over \u00a358bn since UK taxpayers bailed it out. Ordinary people struggling to get by will feel angry that the bank has come up with the cash to pay chief executive Ross McEwan a whopping \u00a33.5m. For a bank 72% owned by the public this is an insult. There is no other part of the economy where such abject failings are so richly rewarded. The government needs to get a grip on a sector that operates in a parallel universe to everyone else. Standard Life published full-year results this morning. Julia Kollewe reports: Standard Life boss Keith Skeoch took a pay cut last year \u2013 he made \u00a32.7m, down from \u00a33.5m in 2015. His annual bonus was cut to \u00a3988,000 from \u00a31.5m while another bonus, paid out under the long-term incentive plan, dropped to \u00a3883,000 from \u00a31.2m. The insurer explained that despite a forecast-beating performance last year, the maximum targets were not hit. Another factor was the \u00a3175m provision related to the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s review into non-advised annuity sales. Even so, Standard Life had a good year, posting a 9% rise in operating profit before tax to \u00a3723m for 2016. The Brexit vote in June \u201ctriggered very substantial [fund] outflows for the industry,\u201d Skeoch said, but the firm only saw a modest \u00a31.7bn outflow over the year. Its fund management arm has a branch in Germany and subsidiaries in Ireland and may hire a few more people in Frankfurt or Luxembourg in the wake of the referendum, but \u201cwe are talking about tens, not hundreds,\u201d Skeoch said. It is too early to say whether jobs would move from the UK. Back in the UK, Unite has issued a statement following its meeting with French car group PSA. Here is the statement in full: The leader of Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, Len McCluskey met with the chief executive officer of PSA group Carlos Tavares to discuss the proposed takeover of Vauxhall today (Friday 24 February). Commenting after his meeting with the chief executive officer of PSA group Carlos Tavares Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: I\u2019ll be meeting over 100 Unite shop stewards from Ellesmere Port, Luton and Toddington on Monday to report back fully on my meeting with Carlos Tavares. It was a relatively positive first meeting in which Mr Tavares gave assurances that current production commitments would be met should the takeover with PSA go-ahead. It was also heartening to hear that PSA group wants to work with Unite and recognises the skill and efficiency of our members who make the world class Astra and Vivaro vans. Going forward both Unite and PSA have agreed to work together and engage constructively as developments unfold. Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been defending the controversial deal the government has struck with its creditors to unblock stalled bailout talks. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: A confident Alexis Tsipras told the Greek parliament this morning that the preliminary agreement reached at Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting was an \u201chonourable compromise\u201d worthy of praise, not criticism, from the leftist-led government\u2019s opponents. Addressing the 300-seat house, Tsipras said the accord, which now paves the way for auditors to return to the capital to resume stalled bailout talks, was a decisive step towards completing a bailout review that only last week was cause for renewed speculation that Greece was teetering towards euro exit. When you negotiate you win [some things] but you are also obliged to give ground. We always lost and never won. What we achieved was an honourable compromise. It was the end of the beginning of continual austerity. For \u201cevery euro\u201d that creditors demanded in extra pension and income tax measures, counter policies would be enacted that would offset the cost, he said. \u201cMeasures and counter measures will be legislated at the same time. That means they will be fiscally neutral.\u201d Tsipras not only has to face austerity-weary Greeks but members of his own Syriza party who are reluctant to be associated with passage of yet more gruelling austerity. PSA has told Len McCluskey, the boss of Britain\u2019s biggest union, Unite, that its plan to buy General Motors\u2019 European business is not about closing car plants in the UK. If the deal goes ahead, the French car maker which owns Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS, will become the new owner of Vauxhall, GM\u2019s UK subsidiary. It has sparked fears about the future of Vauxhall\u2019s factories in Luton and Ellesmere Port. PSA boss Carlos Tavares told McCluskey on Friday that the French company was \u201cnot...here to shut plants\u201d. The union boss said the talks were \u201crelatively positive\u201d and that he was \u201cpleased with some of the assurances given\u2019. McCluskey added there were still a lot of issues to be hammered, with pensions high on the agenda. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the rise in mortgage approvals for house purchase might not last... The pickup in mortgage approvals in January to their highest level since February 2016 confirms that the closure in December of the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which helped lenders to offer 5% deposit mortgages for purchases of existing homes, has not weighed on housing market activity. The recovery in mortgage lending, however, likely will run out of steam soon. Admittedly, the renewed decline in swap rates over recent weeks has eased the pressure on lenders to raise mortgage rates. Nonetheless, timelier indicators show that households\u2019 appetite for making big financial commitments is fading. Mortgage approvals for house purchase (rather than remortgage) hit a 12-month high of 44,657 in January according to the British Bankers Association. It was 2.5% higher than December, but 2.5% lower than January 2016. The snapshot of lending by Britain\u2019s high street banks showed the number of remortgages approved was almost 16% higher than a year ago at 28,862 in January. It was lower than December, but above the average of 25,987 in 2016. Eric Leenders, managing director for retail banking at the BBA, said homeowners were taking advantage of ultra low borrowing costs: The new year saw homeowners make the most of historically low interest rates by taking advantage of competitive re-mortgage offers. Nearly 29,000 of these deals were approved last month \u2013 16% higher than January last year. Beijing has hit back at Donald Trump, after the US President accused China of being the \u201cgrand champion\u201d of currency manipulation. Trump told Reuters: I think they\u2019re grand champions at manipulation of currency. So I haven\u2019t held back. We\u2019ll see what happens. Geng Shuang, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said he hoped the US could \u201cfully and correctly\u201d view the exchange rate issue. China has no intention of seeking foreign trade advantages via an international devaluation of the renminbi. There is no basis for the continued devaluation of the renminbi. If you must attach the label \u2018grand champion\u2019 to China, then I think China is a grand champion. But we are the grand champions of economic development. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, brings this market update: It was another somnolent start to trading this Friday, with things livened up only slightly by the latest annual report from the UK\u2019s banking sector. The FTSE, seemingly stuck in its own Groundhog Day, opened just below 7,300 once again this morning, the index now sitting around 40 points from that level after a late slide yesterday afternoon. The pound, meanwhile, largely held onto the growth it posted on Thursday, with sterling flat at 1.25-ish against the dollar and down 0.2%, but still above 1.18, against the euro. Over in the eurozone there wasn\u2019t much joy, the DAX and CAC both falling 0.2% as the day got underway. The political situation in France appears to be to blame, even if consumer confidence in the country was revealed to be at a 9 year high this morning. Major markets across Europe are down this morning, with the exception of Spain. The scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,259 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 11,911 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 4,876 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 18,753 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,498 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 372 Since RBS was bailed out in 2008, a whopping 90,000 jobs have gone, with the workforce more than halving over the period from 170,000 to 80,000 today. Some of those losses were attributable to businesses being sold off and branch closures. CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson says that RBS boss Ross McEwan must feel that he is stuck in a \u201cdystopian nightmare\u201d: Nine years and counting as Royal Bank of Scotland announced its ninth successive annual loss in a row. Chief executive Ross McEwan must feel that he is trapped in a dystopian nightmare with RBS as no sooner does he overcome one obstacle than he encounters another. In comments that accompanied today\u2019s results Ross McEwan stated that \u201cthese costs are a reminder of what happens when things go wrong\u201d, which is somewhat of an understatement. So far we\u2019ve had nine reminders of the costs of what happens when things going wrong and Mr McEwan like the rest of us must be hoping that we don\u2019t get a tenth. Here is a handy graphic detailing RBS\u2019s losses over the past nine years: RBS is one of the FTSE\u2019s biggest fallers in early trading, down 2% at 244p after the bailed out bank revealed a \u00a37bn loss for 2016. The FTSE 100 is faring better overall, down just one point at 7,270. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Over in France, consumer confidence was at the highest level for more than nine years in February for the second month in a row. As the jobs market finally turns a corner in France, consumers shrugged off uncertainty surrounding the presidential election and felt it was good time to make a major purchase. The headline index was unchanged from January at 100, the highest since October 2007. We\u2019ll get the latest snapshot of the UK housing market at 9.30, when the British Bankers\u2019 Association publishes mortgage approvals figures for January. Rounding off a week of bank results, RBS has just revealed a \u00a37bn loss for 2016. The bailed out bank (still 72% owned by the taxpayer) hasn\u2019t made an annual profit since 2017. It was hit with \u00a36bn in conduct and legal costs. Here\u2019s our story: Later on in the US we get new home sales data for January.",

      "bodyText": "Exports of British gin surged to record levels last year, reaching nearly \u00a3500m. Figures from HMRC show exports of the juniper-based spirit rose by 12% to \u00a3474m, outperforming exports of British beef and soft drinks. The increase is mirrored in domestic gin consumption and a rise in the number of new distilleries, a trend noticeable enough to spark a gin-based storyline in BBC Radio 4\u2019s rural soap The Archers. \u201cThe quality of the gin combined with the world\u2019s love for brand Britain has seen British gin breaking records both at home and abroad,\u201d said Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. \u201cBritain is by far the biggest exporter of spirits in the world.\u201d Gin exports have risen by 32%, or \u00a3114m, over the past five years. The WSTA predicts that 2017 exports will pass \u00a3500m within the year at the current \u201cmeteoric\u201d growth rate. The US displayed the biggest thirst for the spirit, with Spain the largest importer in Europe, although Britons still drank most of it. Domestic gin sales hit \u00a31.1bn last year, with the equivalent of 34m bottles sold last year, an increase of 12% on 2015. Beale called on the government to capitalise on the increase by offering the industry a 2% cut on excise duty for spirits in next month\u2019s budget. The WSTA points to figures that show UK drinkers pay the fourth highest duty rates for spirits in the EU, accounting for more than a quarter of all spirits duties in the single market. The sales and export figures for last year confirmed the WSTA\u2019s assessment in December that 2016 was a \u201cyear of gin\u201d, and was unparalleled since the body began recording sales of alcoholic drinks. The growing popularity for a drink once maligned as the cause of Britain\u2019s worst social ills has also convinced budding distillers to take the plunge. Last year 44 new distilleries opened in the UK, taking the total openings in the past two years to 100, including a fictional distillery illegally opened by Toby Fairbrother in The Archers. Neil Everitt, who co-founded Brockmans gin in 2008, said much of the growth was being driven by demand for upmarket brands. \u201cDrinking habits have changed dramatically in the past five years and the premium gin market has been one of the biggest winners,\u201d he said. \u201cYounger customers are falling in love with new-style gins and premium mixers, extending its popularity from the golf and cricket club to restaurants and nightclubs.\u201d The love of gin also spilled over into products themed around the spirit, with online retailer Not on the High Street reporting a 51% increase in sales of gin-related products.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of PSA Group, which is in talks to buy General Motors\u2019 loss-making Opel business in Europe, including Vauxhall, has given assurances to the UK government and Britain\u2019s biggest union that production will be guaranteed until at least 2021. Carlos Tavares has been on a charm offensive with politicians and unions in the UK and Germany, trying to soothe fears over factory closures and job losses if the takeover goes ahead. A day after he talked about \u201cspeedy\u201d cost savings from the deal, the former Nissan executive headed to London for talks with the UK business minister, Greg Clark, who described the meeting as constructive and reassuring. Clark said: \u201cWe discussed how PSA\u2019s approach is to increase market share and expand production rather than close plants. I was assured that the commitments to the plants would be honoured. There was also recognition that members of the Vauxhall pension fund will be no worse off.\u201d The pension fund has a deficit of about \u00a31bn. The Unite leader, Len McCluskey, was also pleased with some of the assurances given after his meeting with Tavares. He said: \u201cIt was a relatively positive first meeting in which Mr Tavares gave assurances that current production commitments would be met should the takeover with PSA go ahead. \u201cIt was also heartening to hear that PSA group wants to work with Unite and recognises the skill and efficiency of our members who make the world-class Astra and Vivaro vans.\u201d The comments suggest production of the current Vauxhall Astra at Ellesmere Port will be guaranteed until 2021, while the Vivaro van in Luton would be guaranteed until 2025. Unite will be seeking to clarify whether previous assurances from Tavares that PSA would respect existing labour agreements indicate that jobs would be safe until 2020. Tavares has also discussed the Opel acquisition with Theresa May and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, in separate telephone calls. McCluskey said he would meet more than 100 Unite shop stewards from Ellesmere Port, Luton and Toddington on Monday to report back on his meeting. He told reporters: \u201cHe [Tavares] talked in terms of not being here to shut plants. That\u2019s not his nature.\u201d The union leader added that there were still a lot of issues to discuss, notably pensions. Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port and Luton factories, headquarters and warehouse employ about 4,600 people, with a further 20,000 working in the carmaker\u2019s showrooms; they also support a further 18,000 supply chain job. Vauxhall accounts for 14% of the UK car market. Opel has about 35,600 employees in Europe, including more than 18,250 in Germany. Clark said: \u201cMr Tavares said no deal has been done, discussions continue and he and I agreed to stay in close touch. This is a very important company and workforce which has been successful and we all want it to be just as successful in the future.\u201d PSA and GM are expected to announce an outline agreement before the Geneva motor show starts on 6 March. The takeover would make PSA Europe\u2019s second biggest carmaker after Volkswagen. Comments from Tavares on Thursday \u2013 his first public remarks on the deal \u2013 suggested he would carry out a major restructuring of GM\u2019s Opel operations in Germany and Vauxhall in the UK, similar to the one he oversaw at PSA, which nearly went bankrupt three years ago. The French carmaker was bailed out by the government and Chinese investors, and bounced back under Tavares, whose cost-cutting efforts included a pay freeze, factory closure and thousands of job cuts. GM\u2019s European car-making operation has been loss-making since 1999.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ministers should establish a new energy commission to spur on construction of power stations because successive governments have failed to encourage enough fresh power capacity in the UK, according to a House of Lords report. Subsidy-backed growth in renewable energy projects, such as windfarms, has deterred the construction of new conventional power plants, the economic affairs committee claimed. The peers envisage the new energy commission would oversee auctions where all technologies, including fossil fuel power plants, competed for guaranteed electricity prices. The auctions would cap carbon emissions. At present the government only allows low-carbon power, such as windfarms and new nuclear power stations, to compete in auctions for such deals, known as contracts for difference. The influential cross-party group of peers concluded that successive governments have got their priorities wrong on energy policy by giving priority to carbon emissions cuts \u2013 a statutory duty under the Climate Change Act \u2013 over keeping costs down and keeping the lights on. The report has sparked an angry response. Robert Gross, director of the centre for energy policy and technology at Imperial College, London, said: \u201cThe term \u2018post truth\u2019 has become over-used. Yet it would be possible to take all the evidence the committee presents and tell a completely different story: there\u2019s been huge success in growing renewables and reducing emissions from the power sector.\u201d Lord Hollick, the committee\u2019s chair, said: \u201cWe are critical of the drift that\u2019s taken place over the last 15 years or so, which has delivered on the decarbonisation agenda but very much at the expense of consumers paying 58% more than they were in 2003. On the affordability front we haven\u2019t looked after consumers.\u201d However, as the report acknowledges, most of the price increases came from higher gas prices, not the 10% added by renewable energy subsidies. The peers, who include the former chancellor Norman Lamont, and a former head of the civil service, Andrew Turnbull, said security of supply should become the key aim of energy policy, above decarbonisation and cost. \u201cLow-carbon but chronically unreliable electricity is not acceptable. Similarly very cheap prices at the expense of frequent shortages would be unacceptable,\u201d the report says, which also claims fossil fuels have remained cheaper than renewable sources. But Paul Massara, the former chief executive of npower who now runs the renewable energy firm North Star Solar, said the committee was simply wrong to say fossil fuels were always cheaper than renewables, and condemned the report as \u201cbackward looking\u201d. Darren Baxter, a researcher at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, said: \u201cA failure to keep the pace up with decarbonisation, as suggested in this report, would be a disaster for the north [of England] and its growing low-carbon economy.\u201d Hollick told the Guardian that the government had micromanaged the energy market and did not need to interfere as much. He said the government \u201cshould now allow the energy commission to move forward, to run auctions, to fill the gap and to build a properly balanced [energy system]\u201d. Hollick denied the report was anti-renewables. \u201cExactly the opposite. We see renewables very much as the way forward,\u201d he said, arguing that more public money should go into R&amp;D in renewables and energy storage. The committee also urged the government to publish its plan B if the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is expected to provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity from 2025, is delayed or even cancelled. Hollick said the biggest surprise during the committee\u2019s inquiry was the \u201cfragility\u201d of the government\u2019s nuclear ambitions, which envisage new nuclear reactors in Somerset, Suffolk, Anglesey and Cumbria. \u201cIt is imperative that the government publishes it contingency plans for how it will make up the capacity due to be provided by these plants in the event one or more does not succeed or is delayed,\u201d the report says. Hollick said he expected the government\u2019s energy back-up plan to be made up largely of new gas power stations and offshore windfarms. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cKeeping the lights on is non-negotiable. Our top priority is making sure UK families and businesses have secure, affordable energy supplies.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is under growing pressure to overhaul the business rates system rather than just offer help for small firms affected by the revaluation of properties. Theresa May, the prime minister, and Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, told parliament on Wednesday that small businesses facing a sharp increase in their business rates bill from April could receive support in the budget next month. However, business leaders and MPs are now pushing the chancellor for a wider review of the controversial tax. Eleven leading trade bodies \u2013 including the CBI, the British Retail Consortium and the British Chambers of Commerce \u2013 have written to MPs calling for an overhaul of business rates. The letter says the system is \u201cunfair, outdated, and deters investment\u201d and warned that the tax will be a \u201ckey factor in shaping investment and growth in the UK economy for decades to come\u201d. Retail bosses met with Greg Clark, the business secretary, to discuss the government\u2019s industrial strategy earlier this week. There have also been separate discussions with Clark about business rates. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cOne of the key pillars of the [industrial] strategy is to drive growth around the country. Yet under the current business rates system the divide between the most prosperous and deprived areas will get bigger as a result and more businesses will decide to close in those less successful communities. The burden needs to fall across the board by recognising that the current system is no longer workable for the retail industry as a whole, or indeed any type of business.\u201d Gareth Thomas, the Labour and Co-operative MP, has tabled an amendment to the local government finance bill that calls for a review into business rates and the impact on local authorities from changes to the tax. Thomas is understood to be hopeful of winning support from some backbench Tory MPs in a vote next week. A rally in Hackney, east London, to protest about business rates on Friday is expected to be attended by local MP Meg Hillier and the mayor of the borough. The boss of Intu, which owns some of the UK\u2019s biggest shopping centres including the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Metrocentre in Gateshead, said the \u201cextreme\u201d business rates climate was a bigger deterrent to international retailers considering opening shops here than the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. David Fischel, chief executive of Intu, said: \u201cRetail has become a more global business. Retailers have choices, they don\u2019t have to come to the UK. If they think it\u2019s tougher here because of extreme business rates they will deploy capital where they can make the most profit.\u201d Fischel added that the core issue was that the multiplier \u2013 which determines what proportion of a property\u2019s value is charged for business rates \u2013 is too high at 48p in the pound and the government needs to develop a long-term plan to bring it down to a level competitive with international peers. He also said the government needed to come up with a \u201cfair\u201d way of determining the appropriate rateable value for \u201csheds masquerading as shops\u201d. There has been anger in some quarters at the smaller bill increases faced by online retailers such as Amazon, who operate from out-of-town warehouses.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pearson has reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.6bn for 2016, the biggest in its history, after a slump at its US education operation. The world\u2019s largest education publisher, which in January saw almost \u00a32bn wiped from its stock market value after issuing its fifth profit warning in two years, reported the record loss after taking a \u00a32.55bn non-cash charge for \u201cimpairment of goodwill reflecting trading pressures\u201d in its North American businesses. A spokesman said the charge related mainly to historic acquisitions of Simon &amp; Schuster Education and National Computer Systems, purchased in 1998 and 2000 respectively, as a \u201cnecessary consequence\u201d of the lower profit expectations announced last month. In January, the company slashed its profit forecast for this year by \u00a3180m and scrapped its target of \u00a3800m for next year. It also announced that it planned to sell its stake in the world\u2019s largest book publisher, Penguin Random House, to strengthen its balance sheet. The profit warning was prompted by the collapse of its US higher education business, which is struggling with a decline in textbook sales and the transition to digital learning. The US business accounts for two-thirds of Pearson\u2019s revenues and profits. The news earlier this year led to Pearson\u2019s biggest ever one-day share price fall and prompted speculation that John Fallon, the chief executive, may be forced out of the company. \u201cI am a shareholder and I share the frustration of all shareholders,\u201d said Fallon, when asked whether he should continue to lead the company. \u201cMy conversations with the chairman and the board are all about ensuring we lead Pearson through this transition as quick as possible. My job is to get on and stay very focused.\u201d On Friday, Pearson said that after stripping out the multibillion-dollar impairment charge adjusted operating profits were down by 21% to \u00a3635m. Revenues fell by 8% to \u00a34.5bn. The company has advised that operating profits would be \u00a3570m-\u00a3630m in 2017 and that it was \u201crebasing\u201d its dividend policy. Fallon said: \u201c2016 was a challenging year for Pearson, but we remain the global leader in education, with a strong market position. Education like every other sector and sphere of life is going through this digital transformation. There is going to be a big winner in the transformation in education. We are absolutely determined to make Pearson that winner.\u201d The company said it was looking to sell its English test preparation business in China, Global Education, which it acquired in 2011 for $155m (\u00a3123m), and to find a strategic partner for the English-language learning business Wall Street English, which it acquired in 2009 for $145m. The two businesses contributed \u00a3253m of revenues and \u00a33m of adjusted operating income last year. Pearson has already announced that it intends to sell its 47% stake in Penguin Random House, which publishes titles ranging from Fifty Shades of Grey and The Girl on the Train to Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver\u2019s recipe books, in a deal that is likely to net the company more than \u00a31.2bn. Pearson\u2019s 47% share of PRH netted it \u00a3129m of the publisher\u2019s total profits last year, up 23% on 2015, as revenues dipped after a strong 2015. Investors had been prepared for the poor annual results and Pearson\u2019s share price dropped by less than 2% in early trading. The main concern for many had been the financial leverage of the group as profits fell and net debt rose. Net debt almost doubled from \u00a3654m to \u00a31.09bn, which the company blamed on the strengthening of the US dollar against the pound and restructuring costs, much lower than the analyst consensus of \u00a31.3bn. \u201cThe results show that the group\u2019s financial position is much more robust than expected/feared by investors,\u201d said the Citi analyst Thomas Singlehurst. \u201cThere are of course niggles. Even if current trading is in line, the outlook is hardly stellar and the impairment of goodwill is unwelcome. But having had a tough start to the year we expect these results will provide a lot of relief.\u201d Despite the poor performance of the company, senior executives will still enjoy splitting \u00a355m in bonus and incentive payments as Pearson reached some goals including profit targets. In 2015 no incentive pay was awarded and this year the company is setting aside \u00a3110m for payouts \u201cto ensure our workforce is properly incentivised\u201d. The company made more than \u00a3350m in cost savings last year, cutting 4,000 jobs, 10% of its global workforce. Staff will be braced for further losses this year with Pearson saying that it intends to \u201ctake further action to improve the overall efficiency of the company\u201d. Pearson was founded in 1844 as a construction company which switched to the publishing sector in the 1920s. A spokesman for the company, which listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969, said he could not be definitive but believed it was the largest loss Pearson has ever reported.",

    "webTitle": "Barclays: triple the profits, but still a work in progress | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays has cut its dividend in half. Bonuses are running at three times the level of distributions to shareholders. And the investment bank, even after a round of pruning, still isn\u2019t earning returns greater than its cost of capital. A couple of years ago, under hapless former chief executive Antony Jenkins, Barclays would have been hammered for turning in such statistics. Under his successor, Jes Staley, however, all is apparently bright. He says Barclays is \u201cjust months\u201d away from completing its restructuring and that 2016 was a year of \u201cstrong progress\u201d. Hold the champagne. Yes, pre-tax profits nearly tripled to \u00a33.2bn as misconduct charges fell way, which is undoubtedly encouraging for shareholders. It is also true that the UK retail bank is purring nicely and that Barclaycard is as reliable as ever. And the cut in the dividend can be deemed old news: it was signalled a year ago as a prudent way to clear the decks and enable \u201cnon-core\u201d assets to be shed faster. But, come on, Staley\u2019s biggest call as the incoming boss was to retain the ambition to go head-to-head with the big Wall Street investment banks. He is not yet close to justifying that decision. On the published figure, return on tangible equity in the unit was just 6.1% last year. Staley can theoretically spirit the figure to 8% by excluding the cost of closing an office and adjusting for an accounting rejig on bonuses. But that still doesn\u2019t get returns to the target of 10%-plus. The refrains that bonuses still have to flow to stay \u201ccompetitive\u201d and that \u201cI like the talent in that business\u201d are wearingly familiar and weak. Staley\u2019s other big call has been to refuse a settlement with the US Department of Justice over distributing mortgage junk between 2005 and 2007. Barclays thinks the department\u2019s claims are \u201cdisconnected from the facts\u201d and that it has a duty to defend itself \u201cagainst unreasonable allegations and demands\u201d. Top marks for fighting your corner; applause will be entirely merited if shareholders end up better off by a billion dollars or two. But let\u2019s see it happen first. In the meantime, the note of triumphalism that accompanied Thursday\u2019s results jarred. To be fair to Staley, he\u2019s talking the right language of rapid digital transformation and Barclays feels a more confidently managed operation than in the Jenkins years. But this remains a work in progress. Before Staley takes too much comfort from the 50% improvement in the share price since last summer, he should take a step back. The shares were 260p on the day Jenkins was fired in 2015 and are 229p now. RSA, best in class? \u2026 On the other hand, Stephen Hester, once of Royal Bank of Scotland, can claim the turnaround programme at insurer RSA has been well and truly achieved. Two years ago, when Zurich Insurance showed up waving a 550p-a-share offer, RSA looked to be a sitting duck at 400p. It was an unloved sprawl of international operations and Hester\u2019s self-help decluttering programme was too young to be trusted. City fund managers would have flogged RSA, the folk behind More Than, in an instant. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t get the chance. Zurich, facing problems on the home front, got cold feet and walked away. Since then, RSA\u2019s recovery has run consistently ahead of schedule. The latest evidence is the 25% increase in operating profits to \u00a3665m, which included record underwriting profits. The share price seems to have left the (non) bid price behind. It is 605p and investors have received 15.5p of dividends on the way. It remains to be seen how much further RSA can travel as it attempts to switch gears from recovery mode to what Hester calls \u201cbest in class\u201d levels. In theory, there could be more speedy gains. RSA\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 claims versus income from premiums \u2013 is 94%. A ratio of 92%, which doesn\u2019t seem a huge stretch, would imply a one-third improvement in earnings. Whether or not it materialises, RSA is already a textbook example of why the City should be less dazzled by bids for supposedly clapped-out companies. The idea that salvation for RSA implied submission to the big insurers\u2019 fashion for consolidation couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. A dangerous tariff Are standard tariffs at British Gas a raging rip-off or are they are \u201cactually decent value\u201d, as Iain Conn, boss of parent Centrica, maintains? We\u2019ll await regulator Ofgem\u2019s next views on interplay between fixed and standard tariffs. But Conn is probably correct to think that the government, with a green paper on consumer markets in the offing, won\u2019t have the appetite to fix energy prices. If business rates can damage a minister\u2019s career, who would want direct responsibility for setting every household\u2019s energy bill?",

Yes, pre-tax profits nearly tripled to \u00a33.2bn as misconduct charges fell way, which is undoubtedly encouraging for shareholders. It is also true that the UK retail bank is purring nicely and that Barclaycard is as reliable as ever. And the cut in the dividend can be deemed old news: it was signalled a year ago as a prudent way to clear the decks and enable \u201cnon-core\u201d assets to be shed faster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/23/barclays-profits-bank-uk-us-brexit\">Barclays' profits almost triple but chairman says many challenges await</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, come on, Staley\u2019s biggest call as the incoming boss was to retain the ambition to go head-to-head with the big Wall Street investment banks. He is not yet close to justifying that decision. On the published figure, return on tangible equity in the unit was just 6.1% last year. Staley can theoretically spirit the figure to 8% by excluding the cost of closing an office and adjusting for an accounting rejig on bonuses. But that still doesn\u2019t get returns to the target of 10%-plus. The refrains that bonuses still have to flow to stay \u201ccompetitive\u201d and that \u201cI like the talent in that business\u201d are wearingly familiar and weak.</p> <p>Staley\u2019s other big call has been to refuse a settlement with the US Department of Justice over distributing mortgage junk between 2005 and 2007. Barclays thinks the department\u2019s claims are \u201cdisconnected from the facts\u201d and that it has a duty to defend itself \u201cagainst unreasonable allegations and demands\u201d. Top marks for fighting your corner; applause will be entirely merited if shareholders end up better off by a billion dollars or two. But let\u2019s see it happen first.</p> <p>In the meantime, the note of triumphalism that accompanied Thursday\u2019s results jarred. To be fair to Staley, he\u2019s talking the right language of rapid digital transformation and Barclays feels a more confidently managed operation than in the Jenkins years. But this remains a work in progress. Before Staley takes too much comfort from the 50% improvement in the share price since last summer, he should take a step back. The shares were 260p <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\">on the day Jenkins was fired in 2015</a> and are 229p now.</p> <h2>RSA, best in class? \u2026</h2> <p>On the other hand, Stephen Hester, once of Royal Bank of Scotland, can claim the turnaround programme at insurer RSA has been well and truly achieved. Two years ago, when Zurich Insurance showed up waving a 550p-a-share offer, RSA looked to be a sitting duck at 400p. It was an unloved sprawl of international operations and Hester\u2019s self-help decluttering programme was too young to be trusted. </p> <p>City fund managers would have flogged RSA, the folk behind More Than, in an instant. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t get the chance. Zurich, facing problems on the home front, got cold feet and walked away. Since then, RSA\u2019s recovery has run consistently ahead of schedule. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/may/05/rsa-on-the-rise-as-restructuring-boosts-profits\">RSA on the rise as restructuring boosts profits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest evidence is the 25% increase in operating profits to \u00a3665m, which included record underwriting profits. The share price seems to have left the (non) bid price behind. It is 605p and investors have received 15.5p of dividends on the way.</p> <p>It remains to be seen how much further RSA can travel as it attempts to switch gears from recovery mode to what Hester calls \u201cbest in class\u201d levels. In theory, there could be more speedy gains. RSA\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 claims versus income from premiums \u2013 is 94%. A ratio of 92%, which doesn\u2019t seem a huge stretch, would imply a one-third improvement in earnings.</p> <p>Whether or not it materialises, RSA is already a textbook example of why the City should be less dazzled by bids for supposedly clapped-out companies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/aug/06/rsa-results-make-independence-credible-zurich-buyout\">The idea that salvation for RSA implied submission to the big insurers\u2019 fashion for consolidation couldn\u2019t have been more wrong</a>.</p> <h2>A dangerous tariff</h2> <p>Are standard tariffs at British Gas a raging rip-off or are they are \u201cactually decent value\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/23/british-gas-standard-tariffs-not-evil-empire-centrica-chief-executive-iain-conn\">as Iain Conn, boss of parent Centrica, maintains</a>? We\u2019ll await regulator Ofgem\u2019s next views on interplay between fixed and standard tariffs. But Conn is probably correct to think that the government, with a green paper on consumer markets in the offing, won\u2019t have the appetite to fix energy prices. If business rates can damage a minister\u2019s career, who would want direct responsibility for setting every household\u2019s energy bill?</p>",
