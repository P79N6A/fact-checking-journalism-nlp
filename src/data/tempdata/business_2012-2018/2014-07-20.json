      "bodyText": "The hot property market and a pick-up in housebuilding is expected to have buoyed British brickmaker Michelmersh Brick Holdings when it reports half-year results on Monday. The AIM-listed company has been ramping up production at its brickworks as builders complain of materials shortages now that the construction sector is climbing out of recession. Michelmersh, which is made up of centuries-old brickworks acquired since the late 1990s, has benefited from rising demand and prices. Investors will be looking for more news that the company is expanding production. The results follow news of 120 new jobs in the UK at rival Wienerberger. The Austrian company, the world's largest producer of bricks, announced plans to re-open two mothballed factories and increase production in the UK by 200m bricks a year, the equivalent of about 25,000 homes. Harald Schwarzmayr, the firm's managing director, said: \"This capacity increase shows our absolute commitment to ensuring that enough new housing is built to meet the requirements of the market. \"The UK needs a minimum of 200,000 new homes to be built each year, approximately 35,000 more than will be started in 2014. With our capacity increases equating to approximately 25,000 homes each year, Wienerberger is capable of manufacturing the core material for more than 70% of that extra housing requirement needed.\" He added: \"These are big numbers, and we hope it shows exactly how serious we are about giving our customers and the industry the best possible service. Likewise, we are very much aware that we need to attract more young people into construction, and the 120 new jobs created should help provide opportunities to the next generation of construction industry workers.\"",

The economy probably maintained momentum rather than accelerated between April and June, according to economists' forecasts of GDP data from the Office for National Statistics on Friday. They expect growth of 0.8%, unchanged from the first three months of the year, according to a Reuters poll. That will see the economy return to its pre-crisis peak in overall terms, though not when measured per head because of population growth over the past six years. Disappointing figures from the construction and manufacturing sectors in recent weeks have forced analysts to scale back predictions, and some think the 0.8% forecast may prove too punchy. \"If there is going to be a surprise, we think it is more likely to be on the downside than the upside,\" said Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank. \"While the disappointing industrial and construction output data for May on their own are not enough to cause the pace of GDP to slow, they could be an early warning of how the services sector also performed in May.\" The thinktank Capital Economics is not expecting anything spectacular from Friday's figures either, but if the pace of growth is kept up, output will be 0.2% higher than its previous peak at the start of 2008, marking \"another milestone for the recovery\", it said. While the latest official data has disappointed, business surveys have been more upbeat. The mixed picture overall has clouded the outlook for interest rates. Financial markets are pricing in a rise by the end of the year from the current record of low of 0.5%, but economists are more divided. Minutes from the Bank of England's latest policy meeting released on Wednesday will be pored over for clues of when the first hike might come. There have been warnings, however, that the economy is over-reliant on consumers and that overall growth could lose momentum in the second half of the year.",

    "webTitle": "Former Co-operative Group chairman rejects plans for boardroom reform", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group chairman who resigned over the Paul Flowers scandal has broken his silence to urge members of the supermarkets-to-funeral homes group to reject the plans for corporate governance reforms. Len Wardle, who quit in November after the former Co-op bank chairman Flowers was exposed for buying illegal drugs, is concerned that the way the Co-op board could be constituted in the future means it risks damaging the traditional status of a co-operative organisation. He emailed members of the seven regional boards, which represent the views of the group's 7 million members, before a meeting on Saturday at which the reforms were debated as part of the process of drawing up final plans. The UK's largest mutual organisation made losses of \u00a32.5bn last year after problems in its once-cherished banking arm, in which it now has just a 20% stake. Although the group voted for reform at a crunch meeting in May after proposals were drawn up by the former City minister Lord Myners, who quit in the face of opposition to his ideas, his proposals are still being finalised. Wardle, in an email to 100 regional members, said that the ideas as they stood would \"remove any effective member control from the Co-operative Group\" and he saw a \"fundamental flaw\" in the way new board members would be elected. Plans are being discussed to replace the current board \u2013 made up entirely of Co-op members \u2013 with representatives from the regional boards, which own the bulk of the business, and from the independent societies that own the remaining 22%. Under the proposals, the chief executive, and other full-time managers and non-executives would have a seat on the board. But they would be appointed by a subcommittee, which is proving controversial as the board is elected by members. The way members are represented is being changed in turn, with a members' council replacing the area boards, which feed into the regional boards. Wardle said: \"If the numbers of elected members on the board are to be reduced, then it is imperative that the proposed members council has the power of appointment over Ineds [independent non-executive directors]. \"It is not acceptable for the board , advised by management,to retain control over nominations. That these would be presented for ratification to our millions of members on a take it or leave it basis is not co-operative. It may well satisfy the bare legal requirements to permit registration, but it does not provide for any meaningful democratic control of our society.\" The Co-op said it was working on proposals that will be published and voted on by members later this year. Wardle added: \"The feature of ultimate member control is fundamental to co-operatives in our country and differentiates us from building societies for example, where boards are very distant from their members.\" He urged them to reject the idea until the issue could be addressed. The ex-chairman's intervention follows remarks last week by Nick Eyre, a former company secretary of the Co-op, who also warned about the impact of entrenching power in the hands of management. Eyre told a meeting of the National Federation of Progressive Co-operators that if the management were given powers to name directors then \"all who cherish the co-operative and mutual models in a diverse economy might as well pack up and go home\".",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail will this week face a stormy shareholder protest when the company holds its first annual meeting since its controversial privatisation. The 500-year-old company is likely to face questions about the \u00a31.35m pay package awarded to the chief executive, Moya Greene, and its warning that the universal service obligation \u2013 the pledge to deliver to every address in the country for the same price six days a week \u2013 is under threat. The company, which the government privatised in October 2013 at a \u00a31bn loss to the taxpayer according to a committee of MPs, will hold its first annual meeting as a FTSE 100 firm in Birmingham on Thursday. It will also update the City on its latest financial performance, which has been worrying some analysts, in an interim management statement on Tuesday. Royal Mail's chairman, Donald Brydon, also chairs the FTSE 100 software firm Sage Group. Pirc, the investor advisory group, is concerned about multiple chairmanships and Brydon's ability to do both jobs, and is urging shareholders to vote against his appointment. Serial boardroom director Sir John Peace, who chaired three FTSE 100 firms \u2013 fashion house Burberry, Standard Chartered bank and credit-checking company Experian \u2013 faced a hat-trick of rebellions in recent meetings. Greene's pay is likely to be among the biggest issues for Royal Mail's private shareholders at Thursday's meeting in the National Exhibition Centre. The Canadian chief executive collected total pay, bonuses and pension contributions of \u00a31.35m in the last financial year. Her pay would have been higher if it were not for the intervention of the business secretary, Vince Cable, who queried a \u00a3250,000 housing allowance, which she handed back. Despite the reduction, her total pay was still 50 times the average \u00a327,036 collected by her 150,000 staff. The average bonus handed to postal workers was \u00a3514 \u2013 compared with Greene's long- and short-term bonuses of \u00a3873,000. She was also handed 65,880 bonus shares in the company worth an additional \u00a3328,000 at Friday's share price. However, the share award is subject to conditions and will not pay out for three years. Although she voluntarily repaid her housing allowance, Greene said she was \"deeply offended\" by the criticism over her pay and benefits. Brydon has previously described Greene as the worst-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100 and that Royal Mail must improve her remuneration package or risk losing her. \"I think it's only fair to pay Moya the right market rate for her job,\" he has said. Research by the High Pay Centre put the average total pay of FTSE 100 bosses in 2013 at \u00a34.2m. Shareholders are also likely to express anger at the company's warning that postal deliveries to rural areas are under threat because rivals are being allowed to cherrypick easy and profitable deliveries in towns and cities without having to run services to homes in isolated areas, such as the isles off Scotland. Greene issued the warning over the universal service obligation (USO) as the company reported a 12% rise in full-year operating profits to \u00a3671m in May. She said rival TNT Post UK's ability to pick off profitable routes in big cities was \"striking at the economics of the universal service obligation\". TNT Post UK has launched \"final mile\" delivery services in London, Manchester and Liverpool, and plans to deliver to up to 42% of addresses by 2017. Ofcom, the regulator, said it does not believe the universal service is at risk. It is due to review the service next year, but Labour has called for the regulator to begin the review early and said it will commit to safeguarding the USO if it wins the next election. Royal Mail will also face a tough time over revelations last week that it could be fined up to \u00a3160m over an investigation into \"breaches of antitrust laws\" by its parcels division GLS in France. While Royal Mail's big institutional shareholders made substantial profits buying up and immediately selling the company's shares, which soared by 38% on the first day of trading, most of the thousands of private investors have held on to their holdings. The shares, which were floated at 330p and rose to a peak of 615p in January, closed at 471.7p on Friday. Analysis of trades by stockbroker Peel Hunt suggests that 76% of individual investors still own the 227 shares they bought.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When interest rates begin to rise, we're told they will top out at 3%. Don't worry, homeowners, say the rate-setters, crippling monthly payments are a thing of the past. Charlie Bean, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England and one of the rate-setters until last month, made it clear that the scale of household debts made it impossible to return to something like normal within the next 10 years. Almost casually, this picture painted by Bean has become generally accepted: that monetary policy will be determined largely by how long it takes to nurse homeowners back to health. Not just this year and next, when the recovery is sustainable, but for much longer, by which he means until their finances are considerably more robust. There are several critics of this view, including Boris Johnson's economic adviser Gerard Lyons, who said last week that rates should canter towards 6%. Lyons, a former City analyst, is among a minority in the Square Mile who subscribe to a more optimistic outlook for the nation's economic health and the consumer's ability to shop and pay their debts at the same time. Yet this possibly London-centric view underestimates the sheer scale of debts already accumulated and, after a brief period of repayment, the need to feed consumption with debt. There is also the government balance sheet to consider. With increasing burdens on its spending, the ability of governments to support consumer spending \u2013 as they have done in recent years with a constant diet of tax credits and tax cuts \u2013 will become limited. A report published this month by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) mapped out how Whitehall faces a massive squeeze on its finances over the next 45 years just to cope with an ageing society. The report said this would amount to 4.8% of GDP, or \u00a379bn a year in today's terms. It's a guesstimate, yet it is only a partial view of the total mismatch between income and expenditure. In recent months, anti-poverty campaigners have grown agitated about the broader legacy of debt. Since its inception, private finance initiatives have created about \u00a3239bn of liabilities for the taxpayer, with costs being carried forward over the next 20 to 30 years. The university tuition-fee reforms, which allowed the government to transfer almost the entire cost to undergraduates, also kicked the repayments well into the future. Earlier this year, the House of Commons public accounts committee reported current outstanding student debt of \u00a346bn on the government's books, a figure set to rise to \u00a3200bn by 2042 with an estimate attached that shows more than \u00a370bn will never be repaid. Costs for the National Health Service are also growing rapidly and a \u00a330bn shortfall on current spending is predicted by health chiefs as early as 2020. The pension protection fund (PPF), which looks after the pensions of 6,150 schemes of crashed companies, has a shortfall of about \u00a3110bn. Despite the firepower that comes with managing more than \u00a31.1tn of assets, the PPF is dependent on strong growth from the corporate sector in the UK and beyond. At the moment that gap is growing. As we are on the subject of pensions, there is also the collective deficit of the UK's solvent private-sector schemes, which according to the pension provider JLT currently stands at \u00a3177bn. Technically, it is shareholders that are on the hook for the PPF's deficit. History, and the banking crash in particular, tells us that there could come a time when the shortfall looks permanent and the taxpayer is called in for another bailout. Next in line are the UK's public-sector pensions. Some are partly funded, some not. All are on the taxpayers' mounting bill, which is officially estimated to be \u00a3600bn over the next 60 to 80 years and \u00a31tn by more conservative pension experts. Of course, governments, businesses and households will continue to enjoy incomes and on current projections, they will be able to afford debt payments. The point is that they won't be able to afford much else. The funding gap is growing and with deficits on so many fronts, it is hard to see how promises to pensioners and health service users can be met without a dash for growth that is unsustainable, a switch to dramatic cost-cutting in other areas or higher taxes on those who came through the recession relatively unscathed. George Osborne, by common consent, has been more lenient with cutting the deficit than his rhetoric would lead most people to believe, mostly because he is complicit in dodging many politically unpalatable decisions. To close the widening public-sector funding gap that he has forecast up to 2020 will take severe cuts in spending, such that even Ed Miliband talked on Saturday about how to run a government when budgets get smaller every year. To some extent the answer will be to dodge many of the debts steadily piling up. Look at how consumers react. To keep spending on the high street, households are returning to a form of hire purchase popular during the inter-war years. Just like the people who pay for interest-only mortgages, finance plans for car purchases mean that they are in effect leasing the vehicle rather than buying it. In 2013, all the growth in car sales hail from the manufacturer's low-interest offers. Soon we'll begin to hear that young middle-income families are marrying their newfound love of Aldi and Lidl to renting their fridge and washing machine to avoid upfront costs. Many are turning to self-employment, and as a study published last week by the Pensions Policy Institute showed, are not saving for a pension at all. More than one million of the 10 million employed people without a pension have joined the government's new scheme, but are paying such pitifully low contributions that it will not add up to much when they retire. The Intergenerational Foundation, which aims to highlight the shift in incomes and wealth to favour the older generation, recently published research showing the struggle that graduates will face in gaining a masters degree or PhD under the new funding scheme [PDF]. The foundation's report shows how hard the next few years will be for anyone without well-off parents or a trust fund to enter the higher reaches of academia. Not only must they take out a loan to pay the fees and living costs, their first higher education teaching job will be on a zero-hours contract. When they are more experienced, they may become staff, but on a pension worth a fraction of the current scheme after the shocking \u00a313bn deficit forced managers to cut longstanding benefits. Britain has become expert at putting off decisions and hoping for something to turn up. Without a return to ultra-cheap commodities, another technological/productivity revolution, or a return to more modest living and delayed gratification, it's a plan that is running out of time.",

      "bodyText": "It was when he found a long scratch on the cover of his white MacBook that Min Kyu-choi discovered the problem. What could he do with the plug, which had caused the damage? At a time when laptops, mobile phones and tablets were becoming progressively thinner, it struck the Korean design student that the humble three-pin British plug had not moved far from its bulky form over the years. After toying with prototypes and two years in production, the solution to the problem is the Mu, also known as the folding plug, a smartphone charger that claims to have cut the size by 70% and has sold some 40,000 units since it was launched at the beginning of 2012. To look at it straight on, the Mu is a flat rectangular device with curved edges and is slightly thicker than a smartphone. When two flaps are pulled back from the front, the three pins are revealed. By twisting a pivot on which the live and neutral pins are attached by 90 degrees, the full form of the plug emerges. The lightbulb moment for Choi came at around the same time as the first MacBook Air was released by Apple. While laptop design had resulted in machines which could fit into an envelope, they were still stuck with a plug which was multiple times the size. Matthew Judkins, Choi's business partner, says: \"The problem was then bloody obvious and you kind of go through a process saying how does one solve it. When you look at the plug, the problem is that you have got three pins and they are in a triangular formation and it is fairly obvious what to do then \u2013 you just make them flat and in a line and that gets rid of the bulk issue.\". The pair met when the designer was completing a course iat the Royal College of Art, and Judkins, who had a history in startups, was looking for his next project. By that stage, the idea had taken shape in Choi's mind. \"A beautiful sketch is one thing but it is not a business. It was just two dudes with an idea,\" says Judkins. At the same time as grappling with the engineering questions of whether it could actually be made, the pair also considered whether they should make a plug that could fit on the end of any cable or make a charger, which could then be sold at a premium price and the design licensed out. They went down the charger route. \"We have a business where we make and sell stuff and make a margin and we have a licensing business where we supply the solution for someone else to put with their product,\" says Judkins. After two years wrestling with the design and production of the unit in Korea, the Mu \u2013 the name, chosen by a fan, derives from the 12th letter in the Greek alphabet which is used as a symbol for many things, including small or \"micro\" \u2013 emerged in February 2012 priced at \u00a325. On the side is a USB port so that smartphones, digital cameras and speakers can be powered by plugging in a cable. Some 40,000 have now been sold of the original design and plans are in place over the coming months to bring out coloured chargers, a more powerful plug for tablets and travel adaptors for Europe and the US. While the retail range of the plugs is growing, however, it is in effect a showcase for what could prove to be the most lucrative part of the enterprise \u2013 licensing out the design. When they were working on the idea for the plug during the initial stages in 2010, the partners considered not actually making the product but instead simply licensing out the technology to mobile phone giants. \"But in order to articulate the product well, we needed to get people to use it,\" says Judkins. The ultimate goal would be to have the plug in a box with a phone, he said, so that after the initial interest from a consumer when they get their new phone, they are then surprised to find a foldable plug alongside it. Seeing the slimmed down plug, Judkins says consumers would get an additional 15 seconds of wow factor when they open the packaging. The packaging itself would also be slimmed down for shipping, yielding savings in logistics and carbon emissions. \"The whole time that this has been a sketch to [being] a product, we have thought about the moment that this will be a licensing play for these guys because that is how we make money,\" he said. Talks are ongoing with smartphone companies at present while the firm behind the Mu expects to be in profit in the last three months of this year. Judkins and Choi each own one third of the venture while investors have another third. There have been sacrifices along the way. A pure rounded design of the closed plug is interrupted by the earth pin sticking out. An idea to put in a cog mechanism to slide the pin in and out would have proved too expensive. \"You are faced with a classic example of having a well engineered idea which has hit a cost point versus the absolute beauty of industrial design,\" says Judkins. It is unlikely however that the foldable plug will be seen at the end of cable for a table lamp or on a toaster in the near future. There is no problem there to solve, it seems. \"If you are never going to use it, like in the wall, then there is no reason to have a folding plug, only when you are lugging it around,\" he said. What makes it different At the heart of the foldable plug is a pivot system, where the live and the neutral pins can be twisted around so that they are in a line with the earth one. The casing of the plug unit can be enclosed around them, flattening the device. Internal connecting points in the pivot mean the plug can operate when it is opened as normal but also when folded up, enabling international adaptors to be attached. When shut, the Mu is 14mm (0.5in) thick and rounded, while a standard plug is about 45mm according to the creators. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 July 2014. It originally said the name of Mu was chosen by a fan and is the Greek word for small or micro. In fact it derives from the 12th letter in the Greek alphabet which is used as a symbol for small or micro. This has been corrected.",
