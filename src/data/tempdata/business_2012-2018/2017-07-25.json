      "bodyText": "Britons have downed \u00a3158m more alcohol in the last three months compared with 2016, as they enjoyed sunny weather and a string of major sporting events including Wimbledon, the British and Irish Lions rugby tour and the British Grand Prix. A 6% rise year-on-year rise in alcohol sales, a continuing boom in sales of sun cream and ice-cream as well as higher prices on essentials including butter and fish all helped boost supermarket sales by more than 3% for the fourth consecutive period, according to the market researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Sales of cider and gin were both particularly strong \u2013 up 20% and 29% in value terms. A year on from the vote to leave the EU, grocery price inflation remained steady at 3.2% in the three months to 16 July, the same as reported by Kantar last month. The Kantar figures are not the official inflation figures but are based on 75,000 identical products compared year on year in the proportions purchased by shoppers. \u201cJune\u2019s hot spell was good news for UK grocers, with sales particularly buoyant around the hottest June day for 40 years. Ice-cream sales were up 34% in June alone, while sales of suncare products increased by 40% year on year as Brits enjoyed the unexpected sunshine,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Fruit and vegetable sales rose by 7%, or \u00a3170m, as Brits tried to offset the summer indulgence. \u201cWith the likelihood of eating and drinking outside also increasing, people are more inclined to indulge and treat themselves,\u201d said Mike Watkins of Nielsen UK, which also monitors supermarket spending. It found that monthly ice-cream sales were up 45%, alcohol mixers up 44%, fresh beef burgers up 29% and soft drinks up 16%. Overall, Nielsen found that supermarket sales rose 5.1% in the four weeks to 15 July, the highest year-on-year rise in at least four years, helped by the June heatwave. There were also continued signs of attempts to save money as rising inflation dented disposable income. Sales of supermarkets\u2019 own-label goods rose by nearly 7% year on year in the last three months, according to Kantar, to account for just over 51% of spending, a record high marking a switch away from more expensive brands. Meanwhile, discounters Aldi and Lidl were by far the fastest-growing chains in the UK, with sales up 17.9% and 19.4% respectively. Lidl is now neck and neck with Waitrose on 5.1% market share, raising the prospect of the German chain becoming the UK\u2019s seventh largest grocer next month. All the major supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons, increased sales for the fourth consecutive period. Tesco was the fastest growing of the big four, with sales up 2.3%, and Asda the slowest, with sales up 1%, but all four lost market share compared with a year ago as the discounters opened more stores. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said the weather was a bonus to supermarkets, helping to boost demand where better management, a rising volume of sales and manageable inflation were already boosting cash generation. \u201cWhile we are alive to the strong performance of the discounters, their free lunch has ended and so their combined threat is more manageable,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Uber, Deliveroo and other representatives of the \u201cgig economy\u201d face fresh inquiries by British MPs, which will involve their senior executives being grilled by a parliamentary committee over the companies\u2019 working conditions. Rachel Reeves, the new chair of the House of Commons business committee, told the Financial Times (\u00a3) one of her priorities was to look at the world of self-employment. The committee will scrutinise a recent report by Matthew Taylor into modern working practices that demanded better protections for self-employed workers. However, Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair, disappointed trade unions by not demanding full employment rights for people who work for companies such as Uber, Deliveroo, Hermes, DPD and UK Mail. Many workers have complained of low pay, job insecurity and harsh treatment during sickness. The TUC estimates about 3 million people are in insecure work in Britain, including workers on zero-hours contracts. Reeves said the business committee would call executives from Uber and Deliveroo and some of their workers, including those involved in court cases over their employment status. Uber lost a case last year in an employment tribunal brought by two drivers who claimed they were not genuinely self-employed. In a damning verdict, the tribunal said the drivers should be guaranteed the minimum wage and other basic employment rights. The US cab-hailing firm is appealing against the ruling. \u201cI don\u2019t really buy this idea that Deliveroo and Uber go down the self-employed model because it\u2019s so great for the workers and that\u2019s the only thing the workers want to do,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cThere are clearly some big disadvantages to being self-employed in terms of missing out on certain rights.\u201d After questioning companies including Uber, Amazon, Hermes and Deliveroo, the work and pensions committee published a damning assessment of the gig economy in May, accusing it of forcing workers into bogus self-employment and free-riding on the welfare state. The inquiry was cut short when Theresa May called a snap election. Reeves said the business committee had had its best moments in recent years when it held \u201cthe feet to the fire of some of our business tycoons\u201d over their treatment of staff. Retail billionaires Sir Philip Green, whose empire includes Topshop and the now-defunct BHS, and Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, appeared in front of the committee to face questions during the last parliament. Reeves, the MP for Leeds West, also stressed she was \u201cpro-business\u201d and believed that companies could be a force for good by creating jobs and wealth for the country. \u201cBut I think, like any power, it [business] needs to be held to account, and be scrutinised.\u201d Another of her priorities will be to give business a voice during the Brexit negotiations, Reeves said. \u201cI think business\u2019 voice has been lost so far in the debate about what our exit from the European Union looks like.\u201d The committee is likely to investigate how Brexit will affect various sectors of the economy, and may focus on three or four sectors. It will also look at the possibilities of Britain staying under the remit of Euratom, the European nuclear regulator. \u201cI want us to explore further whether there really is a legal impediment for us staying in Euratom,\u201d Reeves said, describing as \u201ccrazy\u201d the idea of creating parallel regulatory structures.",

      "bodyText": "The news that Greece has put its toe back into the financial markets, and not seen it bitten off, helped cheer investors in Europe today. All the main stock markets rallied, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 ending 57 points (0.8%) higher. The euro also gained ground today, hitting a new two-year high against the US dollar at $1.17. Naeem Aslam of Think Market thinks the euro may head higher. The biggest news for the European markets which improved the sentiment among investors was Greece returning to the bond markets. The borrowing cost was much lower purely because the risk level is not the same where it used to be. The Greek news also provided fresh tail wind for the euro which broke its 2015 resistance. Now the route is clear and the target which everyone is looking and talking about is $1.20 against the dollar. A few robust economic readings and some hawkish comments from the ECB would simply do the job. The DAX index particularly performed well today as the result for business confidence surged to a record highs for three months straight. And that\u2019s a good moment to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Journalist Paul Waldie of the Globe and Mail tweets: Dimitri Sofianopoulos, capital markets partner at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, believes today\u2019s auction is a boost for Athens. \u201cGreece\u2019s successful return to the capital markets sends a clear signal that the country is finally turning a corner following its recent bailout programme. The level of investor appetite in the bonds will give Greece further confidence in its future finances.\u201d Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics takes a more sceptical approach to today\u2019s bond sale. She says today\u2019s foray into the bond market went \u201cpretty well\u201d, as Greece borrowed at a cheaper rate than in 2014. The sale was well timed, she explains: The return to markets was timed to take advantage of the drop in borrowing costs following the resumption of Greece\u2019s bailout earlier this month. That, in turn, was the result of reform and austerity on the part of the Greek government and signs of an economic recovery. However, McKeown reminds us that we have been here before. That 2014 bond sale was followed by the drama of 2015, when the left-wing Syriza government clashed with creditors and nearly took Greece out of the euro area. Things look somewhat more promising this time around, she continues - Syriza has largely caved in to its creditors\u2019 demands and the economy is growing again. But a new government might fall out with Brussels, the ECB and the IMF - creating another crisis. And even if it doesn\u2019t, the Greek economy remains fragile - and another loan may be needed... McKeown says: Banks are in a very precarious state, with deposits yet to return and non-performing loans a serious burden. And crucially, the public debt mountain remains huge, at about 180% of GDP. The Greek government might therefore struggle to finance itself even at current market borrowing costs, which remain significantly higher than the average of 1.5% interest that it now pays on its largely officially-held debt. Unless euro-zone creditors agree to much deeper debt relief than that which is now on the table, it seems fairly likely that Greece will require a fourth bailout when the current one expires next August. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has interrupted his trip to Athens to welcome the bond sale results: Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has hailed the success of today\u2019s bond auction. Reuters has the details: Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said Tuesday\u2019s bond sale was \u201ca beginning\u201d and a first sign of confidence in the country\u2019s economy. He said Greece remained focused on August 2018 to exit its worst crisis in decades. \u201cFrom now on, we are focused on August 2018,\u201d Tsakalotos said in a televised statement. \u201cWe know that Greek people have suffered a lot, more than they deserved.\u201d \u201cThere will be a second and a third (market foray), to approach August 2018 with confidence and emerge from the bailouts.\u201d It\u2019s official! Greece has made a successful return to the financial markets. Athens has sold \u20ac3bn worth of its new five-year bond, at a yield (or interest rate) or 4.625%. That\u2019s lower than the 4.95% that Greece last sold five-year bonds for, in 2014. Government officials say that 200 bids were received, a sign that confidence is returning (or that the relatively high yield acted like catnip to investors....) A government official says the sale was an \u201cabsolute success\u201d, adding: \u201cIt reaffirms the positive trajectory of the Greek economy which is making steady steps to exiting crisis and bailout programmes,\u201d There is already talk of further sales in the months ahead. Greece\u2019s current bailout programme expires in summer 2018. Athens is desperate to avoid a fourth rescue deal, so is hoping that today\u2019s deal could be the first step towards gaining market access. But... Greece still has a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 180%, and insists that its official creditors (who hold most of its bonds) must grant it significant debt relief. Boom! US consumer confidence has hit its second highest level since 2000. The monthly measure of American morale, from the Conference Board, has jumped to 121.1 this month from 117.3 in the previous month. That\u2019s a four-month high, and beats Wall Street expectations of 116.5. Separately, US house prices jumped by 5.7% per year in May, according to the latest S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index. That\u2019s down from 5.8% in April, but still faster than earnings growth. America\u2019s stock market has hit another record high in early trading: Back to Greece....and the latest word is that it has repriced today\u2019s bond sale again! The yield (interest rate) on the five-year debt has been trimmed to 4.625%, down from the original goal of 4.875% (which was cut to 4.75% this morning). That\u2019s another sign that investor are backing Greece\u2019s offer - as Athens can then cherry-pick the best offers with the lowest yields. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, has welcomed BMW\u2019s decision: Just in: BMW has decided to build its fully electric version of the Mini in the UK, ending worries that Brexit drive the project overseas. The German carmaker has announced that the new new battery-electric, three-door hatch will be built at its Cowley plant, on the edge of Oxford, from 2019. The decision follows months of speculation that Britain\u2019s impending exit from the EU would deter BMW from investing in the UK. Frank Bachmann, managing director of Plant Oxford, told the Oxford Mail that: \u201cThis is good news for everybody on the team at Plant Oxford and this addition to the model line-up marks an important next step in the evolution of Mini. \u201cAs the main manufacturer of the Mini three-door, with production expertise built up over many years, it makes sense for us to build this all-electric model. \u201cI know that everyone on the plant is looking forward to the project that lies ahead.\u201d The Mini will always have a special place in the nation\u2019s heart, of course, partly thanks to antics like this... A video clip of Alexis Tsipras meeting commissioner Pierre Moscovici in Athens has now arrived. It shows Tsipras telling Moscovici that this is a \u201cspecial day, the day that Greece is coming back to the markets in a successful way.\u201d It\u2019s not all hunky dorey in Greece today, reports Helena. Firefighters, demanding renewal of short-term contracts, have been out on the streets protesting this morning. The protestors, some in full rescue gear, demonstrated in front of the Greek parliament in Syntagma square demanding that some 1,320 workers be immediately re-hired. Fire-fighters have been among those affected by the hiring freeze imposed by the country\u2019s creditors in exchange for emergency bailout funding. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough .... to the consternation of Greece tourist confederation, striking cultural ministry officials have announced they will close ALL archaeological sites when they walk off the job this weekend. The news has prompted the confederation\u2019s head, Yiannis Retsos, to write a letter to the cultural minister, Lydia Koniordou, imploring her to intervene. The 48-hour closure of sites that belong to world heritage will be a huge blow for the nation\u2019s reputation at the height of the tourist season, he argues. Retsos wrote: \u201cGreece\u2019s cultural treasures, are part of world heritage and one of our competitive tourist advantages. Archaeological sites and museums in Attica and Athens are one of the most basic reasons for the decision to make the journey. For many travellers, visiting the sites is a life goal since they won\u2019t have the opportunity to make such a journey again.\u201d Nicholas Wall, portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, says everyone involved in the Greek debt crisis will be crossing their fingers and hoping for a good result today: Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, left behind \u2018collision economics\u2019 a long time ago, and has apparently decided that the best strategy for re-election in 2019 is to exit the bailout programme. For this, he needs economic growth, access to markets and cooperation with European partners. A successful Greek exit from the aid programme would also be a boon to European policymakers, who have long faced criticism about their approach to the Greek crisis and don\u2019t want to ask their taxpayers for more cash when this bailout package expires next summer. In this environment, it seems to be in everyone\u2019s interest for this bond sale to go well. Analysts at Barclays have predicted that Greece will soon receive \u201cmeaningful\u201d debt relief, and (finally) be included in the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying stimulus scheme. In a client note about today\u2019s bond sale, they say: The IMF Board approved last week in principle a precautionary Stand-by programme (\u20ac1.6bn), to become effective once specific and credible assurances on debt relief are received from Greece\u2019s European partners to restore debt sustainability. Public debt in Greece continues to be deemed unsustainable by the IMF without sizeable further debt relief. We do not expect debt relief measures to be delivered by Europe before the German elections (24 September). We also think that specific and credible assurances on debt relief measures are also a necessary condition for the ECB to include GGBs [Greek government bonds] into the PSPP programme, which is our baseline for 2018. The orders are still coming in.... The apparent jump in UK factory output in the last quarter has been welcomed by City experts. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says it could ease concerns over Britain\u2019s economy. However, the EU negotiations remain critical to the manufacturing sector\u2019s future. \u201cAfter expectations for UK growth were revised down by the IMF yesterday, today\u2019s survey data for the manufacturing sector offers some light relief. \u201cDespite dipping from 16 to 10, the orders balance is sitting at its second highest level in three years and the sector appears to be expanding at a healthy pace. \u201cHowever, all aspects of the UK\u2019s economy, particularly manufacturing, will rely heavily on the success of Brexit negotiations. Until we have any clarity on how the UK may fit in, if at all, to the single market, it is difficult to be overly bullish on the country\u2019s economic future.\u201d Howard Archer of the EY Item Club is encouraged that the price pressures faced by manufacturers are easing. But Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics is sceptical, pointing out that the CBI\u2019s survey has been more optimistic than the official data this year. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factories have just posted their strongest quarter of growth since 1995! That\u2019s according to the latest healthcheck on the sector from the CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s bosses. According to the CBI\u2019s survey, production among UK manufacturers grew at the fastest pace since January 1995 in the three months to July. The survey of 397 manufacturers also found that employee headcount increased at the fastest rate for three years, and firms expect to keep hiring over the next few months. They\u2019re also optimistic about export prospects over the next year, although new order growth has slowed. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, believes that the slump in the pound since last June\u2019s referendum is helping UK industry compete overseas. She says: \u201cOutput growth among UK manufacturers is the highest we\u2019ve seen since the mid \u201890s, prompting the strongest hiring spree we\u2019ve seen in the last three years. Cost pressures are easing and firms are upbeat about the outlook for export orders. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the benefits from the decline in sterling for UK exporters feeding through. But the flipside is the broader hit to consumer spending power across the economy from stronger inflation, which is likely to have fuelled the slowdown in the economy in Q1 and is expected to pull down growth in Q2.\u201d Here are the key findings from the report: 18% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 13% were less optimistic, giving a balance of +5%. Optimism about export prospects for the year ahead grew (+13%) at a solid pace 43% of firms said the volume of output over the past three months was up and 12% said it was down, giving a balance of +31%, the highest since January 1995 (+33%) 35% of businesses reported an increase in total orders, and 21% a decrease, giving a balance of +14% Domestic orders (+19%), expanded at a broadly similar pace to the previous quarter, with export orders growth remaining strong, despite slowing (+17%) 32% of manufacturers said employee numbers were up, and 13% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of +18% - the highest since July 2014 (+26%) Average unit costs grew at a more subdued pace (+20%). Growth in average domestic prices (+21%) and average export prices (+24%) was broadly unchanged Stock building of raw materials (+20%) was the strongest since April 1977 (+22%), whilst stocks of work-in-progress rose (+16%) Last night the Greek prime minister\u2019s office issued a statement explaining why the government had moved ahead with the sale. It attributed the timing to \u201ca series of positive developments for Greece\u201d, and called the market foray an important strategic step in the country\u2019s quest to regain \u201cviable and stable access\u201d to international markets. Several factors prompted today\u2019s test run in the markets, including Moody\u2019s decision to upgrade Greece\u2019s credit rating to Caa2 last month, and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s approval \u201cin principle\u201d to participate in the country\u2019s current bailout programme, provided adequate debt relief is pledged by EU governments Ending two years of speculation over whether it should join the programme, the Washington-based body approved what was described as a $1.6bn standby loan arrangement, or credit line, for Athens last Thursday. EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has now begun talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, following this morning\u2019s press conference. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, reports: The visiting commissioner was greeted by a beaming Tsipras at Megaron Maximou, the prime minister\u2019s residence, where the discussions are now taking place. Senior members of Tsipras leftist Syriza party are describing a \u201cmood of jubilation.\u201d One insider told us: \u201cInterest in the bond sale is very high, there is a sense of real optimism. If it goes as well as we hope we can start talking of the beginning of the end of darkness.\u201d Financial journalist Owen Sanderson of GlobalCapital has made an important point about today\u2019s bond sale: This explains why Greece is offering to buy back its old five-year bonds, at a profit. To get that profit, investors need to sign up for the new bonds too: Newsflash! Greece\u2019s bond sale seems to be going well. Reuters is reporting that more than \u20ac5.5bn of bids have been received for Athens\u2019 new five-year debt. And this means Greece may get a better deal! It has changed its guidance, and is now aiming to sell these bonds at a yield of 4.75%, down from 4.875% earlier today. A lower yield means smaller debt repayments, and is a larger vote of confidence from the markets... Shares in posh tonic maker Fever-Tree has surged by 9% to a new record high after hiking its profit forecasts again. Fever-Tree shares are now changing hands at \u00a318.94, having floated at 134p in November 2014. That\u2019s a remarkable rise, which turned its co-founders into multi-millionaires. Back in the City of London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 57 points, erasing most of yesterday\u2019s losses. Mining shares are leading the rally, with BHP Billiton and Antofagasta up 3.2% and Anglo American jumping by 6%. That\u2019s due to a rise in commodity prices, as the US dollar weakens ahead of tomorrow\u2019s American interest rate decision. Joshue Mahony of IG explains: As we approach tomorrow\u2019s conclusion to the July FOMC meeting, there is likely to be an increased degree of hesitancy for traders, with the FX markets in particular seeing recent trends turn to consolidation given the clear event risk ahead. The FTSE is being helped by gains in the commodity sector, with the likes of Anglo American, BHP Billiton, and Antofagasta amongst the firms near the top of the leader board. The dollar weakness story of late is certainly a help for commodity prices, with copper and gold in particular gaining ground this week. Finally, Pierre Moscovici is asked about the collapse in support for the socialist party in France, for which he was a former finance minister. There is a need for social democracy in Europe, he replies, but we need to have ideas that are attractive, credible, reformist and pro-European. There is \u201cno future for the left out of the pro-European scope\u201d, he declares. He then tells his audience that it is vital for Brussels to speak with \u201call parts\u201d of the Greek political spectrum. That\u2019s why he\u2019s meeting with both prime minister Alexis Tsipras and opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis. I\u2019m a friend of Greece, with friends in all political parties, Moscovici insists, adding: What matters first and foremost is the future of this great country, inside the eurozone, inside Europe whoever runs it. I think Pierre Moscovici may have been watching the Tour De France. He tells the press conference in Athens that Greece needs to successfully conclude its bailout, to build on its recent success. As he puts it: Confidence in Greece is really coming back, but we need to continue the good work. We need to be on the bicycle, and keep on pedalling. That\u2019s the case for Europe as a whole. If you don\u2019t go that way, then the bicycle falls. Moscovici is also asked about debt relief, a long-held demand for Athens. He says that Greece\u2019s creditors must respect the measures agreed at the latest eurogroup meeting (they agreed to \u2018recalibrate\u2019 Greece\u2019s debt pile, extending the maturity of some bonds) European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is giving a press conference in Athens now. Moscovici says Greece is at a \u201cturning point\u201d, thanks to \u201cseveral important and very positive developments\u201d since his last visit in February. Today\u2019s bond sale is a \u201cpositive\u201d signal, he continues, adding that he\u2019s confident that Greece will successfully end its bailout programme in 2018. But he also sticks to the Brussels\u2019 script, saying Athens must stick to its reform efforts, and implement the latest austerity measure demanded by its creditors. The press conference is being streamed online, here. Newsflash: Greece\u2019s five-year bond sale has begun. And we can now see that Athens has priced this debt sale at a yield of 4.875%. That\u2019s below the the interest rate it paid in 2014, allowing prime minister Tsipras to argue that Greece is indeed on the road to normality. Bond yields move inversely to prices, so a higher yield means a bond is seen as riskier. And this price reflects the fact that Greece is still in a bailout, with no certainty that it won\u2019t need a fourth rescue deal eventually. In comparison, Portugal\u2019s five-year bonds are currently trading at a yield of 1.1% while Italy\u2019s are trading at just 0.75%. Even so, one City analyst thinks this pricing doesn\u2019t fully reflect Greece\u2019s riskiness: Pierre Moscovici has also met with Greek opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy party are leading the opinion polls. According to this tweet, they discussed how to \u2018ensure the success\u2019 of Greece\u2019s bailout programme. After that, Moscovici popped in to see central bank chief Yannis Stournaras for a quick discussion about Greece\u2019s economic prospects. Stournaras was Greece\u2019s finance minister back in 2014, when it held its last bond sale. At the time, Stournaras hailed that sale as a \u201ccatalytic undertaking\u201d, after Athens was swamped with demand from investors. However, many were left with burned fingers after Syriza stormed to power in an election in January 2015.... European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is visiting Athens today to hold talks with top political figures, and discuss Greece\u2019s future. He has already met with president Prokopios Pavlopoulos, who reminded Moscovici that Greece is determined to get debt relief. The Athens-Macedonian News Agency has the details: We will meet our commitments and when the time comes the partners will do what they have to do on the debt issue, Greek President Prokopios Pavlopoulos said on Tuesday in a meeting with EU Commissioner for Economic and Finance Affairs Pierre Moscovici who is paying a visit to Athens. On his part, Moscovici said: \u201cWe want Greece to return to normality and stay on course. You can count on us.\u201d Some financial experts have given Greece\u2019s bond sale a thumbs-up. Lutz Roehmeyer of Landesbank Berlin Investment says it is \u201cperfect timing\u201d. Roehmeyer is planning to take part in the deal, and believes that things are looking up for Greece: \u201cIt is after getting bailout money, after getting the go ahead for a debt reduction next year, after IMF said it is likely to join the bailout finally, after S&amp;P rating action and still before ECB ends QE and started raising rates.\u201d Mohit Kumar, head of interest rates strategy at Credit Agricole, has also backed the sale. Kumar explains: \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing well,\u201d \u201cPsychologically, yields are below levels when they last came to the market. And it\u2019s a good time to issue because if ECB starts tapering post summer, peripherals would come under pressure.\u201d Bloomberg has more details. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece is taking a significant step towards exiting its long debt crisis today, as it makes its first return to the financial markets since 2014. Athens is attempting to raise fresh funds by issuing new five-year bonds to international investors. The deal is the Greek government\u2019s first attempt to break its reliance on bailout loans since it accepted a third rescue package two years ago. Six (count \u2018em!) investment banks have been signed up to coordinate the sale, so it should go smoothly. Greece\u2019s current bailout runs for another year, so it doesn\u2019t actually need to tap the markets. But psychologically, this deal is really important as Athens drives to put the worst of its debt crisis behind it. The key is how much demand Greece finds for its debt, and what price investors are prepared to pay..... As we wrote yesterday, Greece is also offering to buy back the five-year bonds it issued in 2014. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is facing political pressure at home, where his Syriza party is trailing in the polls, so he needs this deal to fly. Tsipras\u2019s office said last night that: \u201cThis decision is a significant step, part of Greece\u2019s strategy to regain viable and steady access to international markets.\u201d I suspect Tsipras will also be hoping to sell his bonds at an interest rate below 4.95% - the level which his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, sold his five-year bonds in 2014. Also coming up today Yesterday was a bad one for European traders, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 shedding 75 points (or 1%). Things should be better today, with the Footsie expected to rise this morning. Technology shares could come under pressure, after Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet posted a 28% drop in net profits last night.

That, in turn, was the result of reform and austerity on the part of the Greek government and signs of an economic recovery.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, McKeown reminds us that we have been here before. That 2014 bond sale was followed by the drama of 2015, when the left-wing Syriza government clashed with creditors and nearly took Greece out of the euro area.</p> <p>Things look somewhat more promising this time around, she continues - Syriza has largely caved in to its creditors\u2019 demands and the economy is growing again.</p> <p>But a new government might fall out with Brussels, the ECB and the IMF - creating another crisis. </p> <p>And even if it doesn\u2019t, the Greek economy remains fragile - and another loan may be needed...</p> <p><strong>McKeown says:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Banks are in a very precarious state, with deposits yet to return and non-performing loans a serious burden. And crucially, the public debt mountain remains huge, at about 180% of GDP. The Greek government might therefore struggle to finance itself even at current market borrowing costs, which remain significantly higher than the average of 1.5% interest that it now pays on its largely officially-held debt. Unless euro-zone creditors agree to much deeper debt relief than that which is now on the table, it seems fairly likely that Greece will require a fourth bailout when the current one expires next August. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:58:13.947Z\">at 4.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59775d02e4b0b17230f38a77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:08:03.415Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jul/25/greece-bond-sale-tsipras-moscovici-uk-industry-business-live?page=with:block-5976fc2ae4b0be0b850d4f3e#block-5976fc2ae4b0be0b850d4f3e\">interrupted his trip to Athens</a> to welcome the bond sale results:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862780635017216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ 2 Greek return to the markets welcomed by financial investors: this is good news &amp; another positive signal of trust in the Greek economy.</p>&mdash; Pierre Moscovici (@pierremoscovici) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862780635017216\">July 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862888407666694\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/2 Let&#39;s prepare the full return to markets in summer 2018! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>&mdash; Pierre Moscovici (@pierremoscovici) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862888407666694\">July 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59775d44e4b052d29bd8f81a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:02:16.133Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has hailed the success of today\u2019s bond auction.</p> <h2>Reuters has the details:</h2> <p>Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said Tuesday\u2019s bond sale was \u201ca beginning\u201d and a first sign of confidence in the country\u2019s economy.</p> <p>He said Greece remained focused on August 2018 to exit its worst crisis in decades. </p> <p>\u201cFrom now on, we are focused on August 2018,\u201d Tsakalotos said in a televised statement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe know that Greek people have suffered a lot, more than they deserved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere will be a second and a third (market foray), to approach August 2018 with confidence and emerge from the bailouts.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:06:50.807Z\">at 4.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59775799e4b052d29bd8f7f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T14:48:53.380Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GREECE PULLS OFF FIRST BOND SALE SINCE 2014</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s official!

      "bodyText": "The popularity of Ed Sheeran, elevated by the launch of his latest album, Divide, and his headline Glastonbury spot, helped drive total UK music sales 11.2% higher to \u00a3564m in the first half of 2017. Sheeran continues to divide critical opinion, not least with his recent cameo in hit TV series Game of Thrones, but there is no denying the fillip the Suffolk-raised artist has given to the UK music industry, entertainment retailers and services. Divide is the biggest-selling entertainment product in the UK in the year to date, selling more than 2m units, ahead of film release Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, with 1.18m. The success of Sheeran\u2019s album \u2013 which at one point overwhelmed the official charts with all 16 songs making the Top 20 singles list \u2013 helped push music streaming and downloads on services such as Spotify and Apple Music up by 16.6% year on year to \u00a3366.6m. For comparison purposes the industry uses a measure of 1,000 music streams or 10 singles as the equivalent to the cost of one album sold. The value of physical music sales climbed 2.5% to \u00a3198m overall \u2013 the first rise in a decade \u2013 as the ongoing revival in vinyl more than made up for the inexorable decline in the popularity of the CD. The value of vinyl sales grew by 37.6% to \u00a337.3m in the first six months, led by Divide with the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack and the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band also making the top five sellers. Sales of CDs have been in decline since 2007, when the once mighty market was worth \u00a31.12bn. It is now worth less than 18% of that, \u00a3198m. While the number of vinyl records sold increased by 35.7% to 1.9m year on year in the first half of 2017, the overall volume of sales of physical music continues to decline. Adding the buoyant vinyl sales to those of CDs of albums and singles there was still an overall decline of 4% from 22.7m to 21.8m copies. Revenue from streaming and downloads of films, TV and music, and sales of CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray, video games and vinyl records surged 6.4% in the first half to \u00a32.98bn, up \u00a3180m and double the 3% growth rate in the same period last year. The video sector, which includes sales of DVDs as well as paid-for film and TV downloads and streams from the likes of Netflix, Amazon, iTunes and Sky Store, increased by 1.2% year on year to \u00a3978m. However, paid-for digital content and services rose 15% to \u00a3669m year on year. Physical sales of DVDs and Blu-rays fell by almost 20%, or some \u00a378m, to \u00a3321m. \u201cEntertainment has now seen over four years of continuous growth thanks to a combination of digital services pioneering new ways of consuming music, video and games,\u201d said Kim Bayley, the chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association, which published the market report. \u201cTo now deliver another \u00a3180m worth of sales in the first half of 2017 is really extraordinary.\u201d Video games, the largest sector of the entertainment market as categorised by the ERA, grew by 8.4% to \u00a31.44bn. Within this, digital sales of video games and content rose 11.9% to \u00a31.226bn. Physical sales of games fell by 8% to \u00a3235.7m. Overall, three-quarters of the \u00a33bn of entertainment sector revenues are now accounted for by digital services and content. Last year, Britain\u2019s growing appetite for services such as Netflix and Amazon helped push streaming and downloads of films and TV shows ahead of sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for the first time.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers increased production last month at the fastest rate since the mid-1990s, according to the latest CBI industrial trends survey. The business lobby group said the fall in sterling over the last year \u2013 a 12% decline against the dollar \u2013 continued to bolster export orders while domestic demand for manufactured goods remained strong. Firms were optimistic about the prospects for future orders and planned to increase employment after a resurgence across most manufacturing sectors in recent months. The report found 43% of firms said the volume of output increased in the three months to July, compared with 12% that said it was down, giving a balance of +31%, the highest since January 1995. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cOutput growth among UK manufacturers is the highest we\u2019ve seen since the mid-90s, prompting the strongest hiring spree we\u2019ve seen in the last three years. Cost pressures are easing and firms are upbeat about the outlook for export orders. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the benefits from the decline in sterling for UK exporters feeding through. But the flipside is the broader hit to consumer spending power across the economy from stronger inflation, which is likely to have fuelled the slowdown in the economy in the first quarter and is expected to pull down growth in the second quarter.\u201d Manufacturers were also busy amassing raw materials at the strongest rate since April 1977, while expectations for output growth stood at the highest since April 2014. Some analysts said the effects of a broader economic slowdown were already being felt in the manufacturing sector and the CBI survey failed to capture this trend. Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the survey had been far too upbeat over the last six months. Official figures have shown manufacturing output down 1.1% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months. Tombs said: \u201cMarkit\u2019s manufacturing survey \u2013 which has been more closely aligned with the official data than the CBI\u2019s survey in the past \u2013 also has weakened significantly recently. Indeed, manufacturers in June were the least optimistic about future production since November 2016, according to Markit. \u201cThe CBI\u2019s survey has a small sample size and it is not seasonally adjusted, despite showing a strong seasonal pattern. Its measure of orders also reflects the number of manufacturers reporting them to be above or below \u2018normal\u2019, which is a moving target. For now, then, we\u2019re inclined to place less weight than usual on the CBI\u2019s survey.\u201d Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, was also sceptical about the rosy picture painted by the CBI survey. \u201cDespite the largely upbeat July CBI survey, the outlook for manufacturing appears mixed. On the domestic front, increased prices for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable goods, diminished consumer purchasing power, and economic and political uncertainty look likely to hamper manufacturers.\u201d Dennis de Jong, the managing director at trading platform UFX.com, said the CBI survey offered \u201csome light relief\u201d after a run of GDP growth downgrades by the International Monetary Fund and Bank of England. But the headwinds of high inflation and the uncertainty created by the Brexit negotiations would take its toll over the coming months, he said. \u201cAll aspects of the UK\u2019s economy, particularly manufacturing, will rely heavily on the success of Brexit negotiations. Until we have any clarity on how the UK may fit in, if at all, to the single market, it is difficult to be overly bullish on the country\u2019s economic future,\u201d De Jong said.",

    "webTitle": "BMW pledges to build new e-Mini at UK car plant", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A fully electric version of the Mini is to be built in the UK, giving a huge boost to the British car industry and relief to the government as it pursues an exit from the European Union. The move ends worries the new model could be made overseas after a warning in February from German owner BMW that it may look outside the UK because of the uncertainties caused by Brexit. BMW now says the electric drivetrain will be built at its plants in Bavaria before being integrated into the car at Cowley, near Oxford. The car will be a variant of its three-door hatch model and will go into production in 2019. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the news, saying: \u201c[This is] a landmark decision that is a vote of confidence in the workforce and in the determination of our industrial strategy to make Britain the go-to place in the world for the next generation of vehicles.\u201d The news comes a day after Clark launched a \u00a3246m fund to invest in battery technology in Britain, a key factor in the progress of electric vehicles. Frank Bachmann, managing director at Cowley, told the Oxford Mail: \u201cThis is good news for everybody on the team at Plant Oxford and this addition to the model line-up marks an important next step in the evolution of Mini. \u201cAs the main manufacturer of the Mini three-door, with production expertise built up over many years, it makes sense for us to build this all-electric model. \u201cI know that everyone on the plant is looking forward to the project that lies ahead.\u201d BMW, along with other manufacturers, had strongly opposed a leave vote before the referendum in June 2016. In February this year, the company said: \u201cThe BMW group has always made clear that we believe integration of the UK into the EU single market, maintaining free movement of goods, services, capital and talent, would be best for business. What\u2019s important for us is that the UK\u2019s negotiations with the EU result in uncomplicated, tariff-free access to the EU single market in future.\u201d The motor industry has warned that Brexit could be seriously damaging for manufacturing in Britain, should any tariffs be introduced. Many car components cross borders between suppliers and plants, sometimes more than once, before final assembly. The plant\u2019s local MP, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, said she had urged the government to heed the car industry and seek an interim deal that keeps the UK in Europe\u2019s customs union and single market, adding: \u201cI hope this vote of confidence by BMW is a sign that ministers have listened.\u201d Unite, which represents the 4,500 workers at the Cowley plant, said the decision on the Mini was \u201cdown to the tremendous skills and efficiency of BMW\u2019s UK workers and our members\u201d. Len McCluskey, the union\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThis announcement is a huge and totally deserved boost to a world class workforce that has endured a tough few months.\u201d McCluskey urged the government to invest faster in the developing electric car industry, particularly in charging infrastructure. \u201cWe urge the government to waste no more time \u2013 in bringing forward an industrial strategy of the scale and scope to ensure UK manufacturing stays in the fast lane,\u201d he added.",

In February this year, the company said: \u201cThe BMW group has always made clear that we believe integration of the UK into the EU single market, maintaining free movement of goods, services, capital and talent, would be best for business. What\u2019s important for us is that the UK\u2019s negotiations with the EU result in uncomplicated, tariff-free access to the EU single market in future.\u201d</p> <p>The motor industry has warned that Brexit could be seriously damaging for manufacturing in Britain, should any tariffs be introduced. Many car components cross borders between suppliers and plants, sometimes more than once, before final assembly. </p> <p>The plant\u2019s local MP, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, said she had urged the government to heed the car industry and seek an interim deal that keeps the UK in Europe\u2019s customs union and single market, adding: \u201cI hope this vote of confidence by BMW is a sign that ministers have listened.\u201d</p> <p>Unite, which represents the 4,500 workers at the Cowley plant, said the decision on the Mini was \u201cdown to the tremendous skills and efficiency of BMW\u2019s UK workers and our members\u201d. <br></p> <p>Len McCluskey, the union\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThis announcement is a huge and totally deserved boost to a world class workforce that has endured a tough few months.\u201d</p> <p>McCluskey urged the government to invest faster in the developing electric car industry, particularly in charging infrastructure. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe urge the government to waste no more time \u2013 in bringing forward an industrial strategy of the scale and scope to ensure UK manufacturing stays in the fast lane,\u201d he added.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The response to Bill Shorten\u2019s move to make inequality front and centre of his re-election campaign has the highlighted how utterly stuck conservatives are in a pre-financial crisis mindset. Rather than address the issue that has been a clear concern of households during a period of flat real wages growth, the response has been to argue the problem doesn\u2019t exist and that all we really need to do is reduce government spending, keep the minimum wage low and cut workers wages. Bill Shorten\u2019s speech on Friday in which he argued that inequality was \u201cthe biggest threat to our health as an economy and our cohesion as a society\u201d certainly rustled the jimmies of the conservatives. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, responded by clutching at the take put forward by the Australian and the Australian Financial Review on the weekend, that Shorten was overstating the problem of inequality and that it was \u201ca lie\u201d to say inequality had got worse. As with all economic data, measurement is an issue. Roger Wilkins, the deputy director of the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research on the weekend suggested that the ABS\u2019s measure of income share and Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality) was unrealisable because the ABS had \u201cchanged its method of collecting this data\u201d, a claim the ABS\u2019s Dean Adams disputed. The Melbourne Institute\u2019s Gini coefficient since 2000 is quite stable, whereas the Bureau of Statistic\u2019s Household Income and Wealth survey, which has been run irregularly since 1994, shows that inequality rose during the mining boom, but has flattened since the global financial crisis hit: Generally, those who dispute the problem of inequality, rather like climate change deniers, focus mostly on the short term. Shorten\u2019s argument is not that inequality is higher this year than last year \u2013 or even five years ago (or, as he has been falsely accused of arguing, that it has been \u201cever rising\u201d), but that it has been clearly rising in the long term. For example, in his speech he noted correctly that \u201cworkers\u2019 share of income is at its lowest level in a half a century.\u201d In the latest GDP figures, 51.5% of income went to employees \u2013 the lowest since September 1964: Shorten\u2019s main claim that inequality is as bad as it has been for 75 years (something he did first in 2015 on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A) is based on research done by the ALP\u2019s assistant treasury spokesperson, Andrew Leigh. Leigh\u2019s research is also used in the World Wealth and Income database set up by French economist Thomas Piketty. That data shows that the share of national income held by the richest 1% is indeed at the highest since the second world war \u2013 if you exclude the abnormal spike which occurred due the Korean war boom: The share held by the richest 10% tells much the same story: Professor Wilkins argued that looking at the share of income going to the richest 1% could be misleading because it was pre-tax and not equalivalised \u2013 meaning the figure did not take into account household sizes. He told the Australian that \u201cit\u2019s conceivable all of these people in the top 1 per cent are the only earners in their households and live in large households.\u201d However, it rather beggars belief that a greater share of income going to the top 1% would also see inequality falling \u2013 especially given it is much less likely that people in the top 1% are single breadwinners compared to those in the 1960s and 1970s when women\u2019s employment participation was much lower. And of course the issue of income inequality is not just about who has the most money, but how entrenched is that situation. On this score, the Hilda release last year noted the problem of falling income mobility \u2013 which meant that people who were within one income were unlikely to improve their situation in the future. The report noted that while this was good for people with high incomes, it was not for poor households as it meant \u201cthey are more likely to have persistently low incomes\u201d: Certainly the OECD thinks we should be worried about the issue. In its latest survey on Australia in March, rising inequality was a major focus. It noted that: \u201cAustralia\u2019s adjustment to the end of the commodity boom has not been painless. Unemployment has risen, and there are increasing concerns about inequality.\u201d It compared Australia with other nations in the OECD since 1991, and found its Gini coefficient has risen significantly: It also found that in the decade from 2004 to 2014, the tide lifted a hell of a lot faster for the rich than it did the poor: Morrison has also taken the short-term view. He told the ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly that \u201cthe latest census\u201d showed that the Gini coefficient \u201chasn\u2019t got worse, it has actually got better.\u201d Andrew Leigh responded that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d which measure you use \u2013 whether it be Gini coefficent or share of income \u201cyou get the same answer \u2013 inequality has risen over the past generation\u201d. One of the more odd responses from the conservative side was by chief executive of the Business Council of Australia. Jennifer Westacott, who addressed the issue of fairness by asking rhetorically, \u201cHow fair is it to let the country fall behind and be unable to compete globally and attract investment, to create jobs, better jobs and higher incomes?\u201d This about an economy in which real incomes have been flat for four years and the real unit cost of labour has just plunged to a record low: Is there thanks to the workers whose purchasing power is now lower than it was four years ago? No, of course not. Labour productivity in the past four years has risen nearly 6% while real wages have fallen 0.6%: Any thanks? Of course not. Westacott also argued bizarrely that the way to address the issue was to cut government spending because she asked \u201chow fair is it to lumber our future generations with debt if we go on spending and expect them to pay for it?\u201d Similarly, the editorial of the Australian Financial Review laughably argued that we not have a problem with inequality, and that Labor should look with longing to the time of Bob Hawke when he \u201cforged a consensus around restoring profits and job growth by deliberately cutting real wages\u201d. Yep, lower wages, less purchasing power for workers and lower government spending is always the answer. And the reflexive responses by those on the right highlights why Labor must continue this campaign \u2013 the push to cut workers\u2019 incomes and services they use is ongoing.",
