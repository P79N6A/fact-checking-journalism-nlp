    "webTitle": "Co-operative Group: banks could sway the vote on reform of the board", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Get ready for the biggest vote in the Co-op's 170-year history. Amid the squabbles, resignations and rows over pay, the poll on 17 May on boardroom reform will take place with the organisation's finances looking ghastly. This is where attention will soon be concentrated once the Co-op Group publishes its accounts for 2013. It is also why the group's lenders, who have remained silent so far, could yet influence the struggle for power. Group debts were \u00a31.2bn at the half-year stage. That was a reduction on six months earlier but achieved largely by mortgaging the swanky new head office in Manchester. Once the cost of meeting the Co-op Bank's call for an extra \u00a3400m is factored in, borrowings could soon be higher: the Group's share of that bill is \u00a3120m. It appears as if Group debts could be about three times the annual top-line profits from the supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral service. That ratio would be considered aggressive even for a large retailer trading strongly. But Co-op's supermarkets profits fell 10% last year and competition is becoming stiffer. Aldi is even taking bites out of Tesco. Remember, too, that trading profits for 2013 will be overwhelmed by huge write-downs from the Co-op Bank and a harder-headed appraisal of the real value of past acquisitions, such as the Somerfield supermarket chain. All-in-all a bottom-line loss of about \u00a32bn is on the cards. So far the Co-op's lenders \u2013 led by Barclays, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 have stayed in the background. But they may feel obliged to act if the Co-op votes no to reform. They would be lending to an organisation that is spitting out reform-minded directors at a rate of knots \u2013 first chief executive Euan Sutherland and now Lord Myners. Nor will Myners' verdict on Co-op finances have escaped their notice. In his interim report he wrote: \"Debt has reached levels that are no longer sustainable without the sale of treasured assets. Sale and leaseback transactions represent an expensive addiction the cost of which does not appear, even now, to be fully appreciated by the board.\" In that context, the Co-op board's decision to force a vote on reform in six weeks' time is sensible. This saga has run a long time already. For Myners, it's a tactical victory of sorts: having put a lot of noses out of joint at the Co-op, he has agreed to go in May but has ensured a vote will happen. It is baffling why a resignation was required to achieve that advance, but internal politics at the Co-op have long defied logic. The board's public support of his review is also significant. Painted as a bunch of stick-in-the-muds who hadn't recognised the size of the Co-op's financial crisis, the directors have now acted. They will back the principles of a proposal that would pave the way for a plc-style board, complete with non-executive directors drawn from outside the Co-op. Instead of \"back us or sack us\", it's a case of \"back us by sacking us\". Yet this is the Co-op and nothing is straightforward. It remains possible that Myners' proposals will be diluted beyond recognition before 17 May. Note that Ursula Lidbetter, the Co-op chair, did not give exactly whole-hearted support for all Myners' ideas. She said his report \"will provide invaluable stimulus for the changes we need to make\". That's not quite the same thing. It's also an open question where Thursday's drama leaves Ben Reid, the boss of Midcounties Co-operative and chief critic of Myners' plans. The Midcounties has voted to oppose the reforms, wanting \"measured\" changes instead, yet Reid is a member of the Co-op Group board that issued the statement on Thursday. There's another source of confusion. The big question, of course, is whether the Co-op will actually choose reform, whatever the final version of the proposals. Until Thursday, no was the way to bet. The Midcounties lobby was making the running and the Group board seemed split at least three ways. There were Myners supporters, Midcounties sympathisers and waverers in search of a compromise, such as continuing to allow a few elected members to serve on a reformed board. The waverers, at least, will now be obliged to get off the fence. But that does not mean that traditionalists on the regional committees will be swayed, especially if the Midcounties grouping continues to oppose Myners-style reform. A majority of two-thirds is required and a yes vote still looks very hard to achieve. Indeed, it looks as if the Myners camp, by forcing an early vote, is gambling that when push comes to shove the Co-op electorate will not dare risk a meltdown and trigger yet more resignations. But that strategy could backfire.",

      "body": "<p>Get ready for the biggest vote in the Co-op's 170-year history. Amid the squabbles, resignations and rows over pay, the poll on 17 May on boardroom reform will take place with the organisation's finances looking ghastly.</p> <p>This is where attention will soon be concentrated once the Co-op Group publishes its accounts for 2013. It is also why the group's lenders, who have remained silent so far, could yet influence the struggle for power.</p> <p>Group debts were \u00a31.2bn at the half-year stage. That was a reduction on six months earlier but achieved largely by mortgaging the swanky new head office in Manchester. Once the cost of meeting the Co-op Bank's call for an extra \u00a3400m is factored in, borrowings could soon be higher: the Group's share of that bill is \u00a3120m.</p> <p>It appears as if Group debts could be about three times the annual top-line profits from the supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral service. That ratio would be considered aggressive even for a large retailer trading strongly. But Co-op's supermarkets profits fell 10% last year and competition is becoming stiffer. Aldi is even taking bites out of Tesco.</p> <p>Remember, too, that trading profits for 2013 will be overwhelmed by huge write-downs from the Co-op Bank and a harder-headed appraisal of the real value of past acquisitions, such as the Somerfield supermarket chain.</p> <p>All-in-all a bottom-line loss of about \u00a32bn is on the cards.</p> <p>So far the Co-op's lenders \u2013 led by Barclays, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 have stayed in the background. But they may feel obliged to act if the Co-op votes no to reform. They would be lending to an organisation that is spitting out reform-minded directors at a rate of knots \u2013 first chief executive Euan Sutherland and now Lord Myners.</p> <p>Nor will Myners' verdict on Co-op finances have escaped their notice. In his interim report he wrote: \"Debt has reached levels that are no longer sustainable without the sale of treasured assets. Sale and leaseback transactions represent an expensive addiction the cost of which does not appear, even now, to be fully appreciated by the&#xa0;board.\"</p> <p>In that context, the Co-op board's decision to force a vote on reform in six weeks' time is sensible. This saga has run a long time already. For Myners, it's a tactical victory of sorts: having put a lot of noses out of joint at the Co-op, he has agreed to go in May but has ensured a vote will happen. It is baffling why a resignation was required to achieve that advance, but internal politics at the Co-op have long defied logic.</p> <p>The board's public support of his review is also significant. Painted as a bunch of stick-in-the-muds who hadn't recognised the size of the Co-op's financial crisis, the directors have now acted. They will back the principles of a proposal that would pave the way for a plc-style board, complete with non-executive directors drawn from outside the Co-op. Instead of \"back us or sack us\", it's a case of \"back us by sacking us\".</p> <p>Yet this is the Co-op and nothing is straightforward.</p> <p>It remains possible that Myners' proposals will be diluted beyond recognition before 17 May. Note that Ursula Lidbetter, the Co-op chair, did not give exactly whole-hearted support for all Myners' ideas. She said his report \"will provide invaluable stimulus for the changes we need to make\". That's not quite the same thing.</p> <p>It's also an open question where Thursday's drama leaves Ben Reid, the boss of Midcounties Co-operative and chief critic of Myners' plans. The Midcounties has voted to oppose the reforms, wanting \"measured\" changes instead, yet Reid is a member of the Co-op Group board that issued the statement on Thursday. There's another source of confusion.</p> <p>The big question, of course, is whether the Co-op will actually choose reform, whatever the final version of the proposals. Until Thursday, no was the way to bet. The Midcounties lobby was making the running and the Group board seemed split at least three ways. There were Myners supporters, Midcounties sympathisers and waverers in search of a compromise, such as continuing to allow a few elected members to serve on a reformed board.</p> <p>The waverers, at least, will now be obliged to get off the fence.</p> <p>But that does not mean that traditionalists on the regional committees will be swayed, especially if the Midcounties grouping continues to oppose Myners-style reform. A majority of two-thirds is required and a yes vote still looks very hard to achieve.</p> <p>Indeed, it looks as if the Myners camp, by forcing an early vote, is gambling that when push comes to shove the Co-op electorate will not dare risk a meltdown and trigger yet more resignations.</p> <p>But that strategy could backfire.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A business Olympics? A modern version of the Great Exhibition of 1851? Both claims have been made by promoters about the International Festival for Business, a 50-day jamboree in June and July. Such is the scale of the event that the fanfare has already started, with CBI director general John Cridland and former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy on trumpet duty. The ambition is not small either: the festival is described as a key part of the government's ambition to \"promote economic growth, rebalance the economy and double UK exports by 2020.\" To that, Leahy would add another goal. He is a Liverpudlian and the festival will take place in Liverpool, with spillover events across the north-west. \"It's about what comes next for Liverpool, which is to portray a starkly different image to the outside world where it is at the centre of a business event, a business discussion,\" he says. \"So much about Liverpool in the past has been about industrial decline and industrial disputes and social deprivation. The physical regeneration has very successfully caused people to look again at Liverpool and be more open-minded about what kind of city it is. This is a really positive move, to be the host of a major business festival. It's not just a regional thing, it's a national event.\" Leahy is an \"ambassador\" for the festival and will speak at a few of the 200 events. \"The long jump is very different from the high jump,\" says Cridland. \"Each day there will be something which reflects a different part of the British business community on parade.\" Just don't expect a lecture on today's Tesco from the former boss \u2013 Leahy's comments are brief (see panel). But isn't talk of a rebalancing economy and export-led recovery a little premature? A recent survey showed four out of five private-sector jobs in the past two years had been created in London and the south-east. Cridland says he is not surprised. \"London at the moment is reminiscent of an ancient Greece-style city-state. It is entirely self-generating growth, it is cosmopolitan, a lot of it is international money, and it doesn't depend on the rest of the country. \"It is great to have a world capital but it is not sufficient to have that. The failed policies of the past were to try to get jobs moved from London to other parts of the country. I don't think that will work, London is always going to be its own dynamo, its own pumping heart. I think the regions of the UK need to celebrate their own strengths and build on what they are good at.\" Leahy concurs. He thinks Liverpool and Manchester, \"instead of throwing buns at each other, should work together and see what can be done when you have 7 million people, lots of industrial assets, lots of industrial heritage, and make use of the fact that people understand industry up in the north-west, they are more supportive of investment and use of resources\". He points to two north-west-based businesses in which he is involved \u2013 online retailer The Hut, where he is an investor, and discount retailer B&amp;M, where is chairman. \"They are going to become very large companies,\" he predicts. \"Liverpool is a city that can be repopulated. Its got an infrastructure for a population twice its size. That's a very valuable asset.\" How about HS2? Here the pair are not quite in unison. Leahy: \"I can understand why there is a strong demand for it in the north-west. So why am I open minded? It's the time \u2013 it's a long way away. And the cost. For me, it's the opportunity cost. Could that be invested sooner in other R&amp;D and infrastructure? Also, though I think the business case can be made, I am not sure it has been made yet.\" That's Cridland's cue to try to make the case. The CBI, unlike the Institute of Directors which called HS2 a \"grand folly\", is a strong supporter. Even Cridland, though, concedes \"there has been too much emphasis on speed and not enough emphasis on capacity\" so far. \"I think you have to demonstrate what it does for economic development along the route and particularly what it does for economic development in the north. If you go through those stages you come to a conclusion that HS2 has a place in a national infrastructure strategy but it is by no means the only thing in that national infrastructure strategy. I am as excited about the northern hub \u2026 We need to connect across the Pennines. That is a great benefit to Manchester and Liverpool and that can be done relatively quickly.\" What about Labour? There is \"concern in entrepreneurial Britain\" about the \"new tone\" from Ed Miliband on markets, says Cridland, before launching into a traditional argument that competition and new entrants drive greater choice and quality for consumers. But isn't Miliband in favour of more competition and more entrants? Isn't that the whole point of his plans to overhaul the energy and banking markets? \"Yes, he would say that,\" replies Cridland. \"So then you come down to judgment about what is most likely to have a good effect for the country. So if you take energy, does a retail price cap encourage investment in new energy capacity or does it cause investors to stand back and press the pause button? \"In my view if you artificially restrict the rate of return on investment you are likely to get less investment. Small businesses in the CBI membership I have talked to are predominately concerned about keeping the lights on. They don't want a California moment. So I think in all of these questions you are looking at the law of unintended consequence\" Leahy's criticisms are directed at Labour's plan to reintroduce a 50p income tax rate for high earners. \"The best thing you can have is low rates that are broadly applied so that everybody pays their tax,\" he argues. \"The recent example [of a 50p rate] demonstrated that if you want to increase your yield \u2013 your tax taken \u2013 you have a lower rate.\" But shadow chancellor Ed Balls has suggested \u00a310bn could be raised. \"He's not going to win that argument, and him trying to win that argument probably explains why there has been such a strong reaction [from business.] It feels more political than economic.\" We're back on rebalancing, with Cridland keen to explain why the position is better than it appears in the trade figures. \"I think people's expectations are unrealistic. If 50% of all of your exports are going to Europe and Europe remains in great difficulty, you need an awful lot of Liverpool entrepreneurs on planes to Mexico and Indonesia for the first time in their working lives, chasing growth in the markets where there is money to be spent, before you make a material difference. But it is happening. Goods exports outside of Europe are nearly 30% higher than they were at the peak of the last economic cycle in 2007. So that march of the makers that George Osborne is looking for is beginning to happen.\" Leahy wants politicians to do less. \"They have to trust citizens more, and trust them to make mistakes over their own lives and stop rushing to regulate and legislate over every part of our lives. There is basically too much legislation, too much regulation, too much government.\" What about last year's horsemeat scandal, which hit his old shop, Tesco? Wouldn't consumers welcome more regulation there? \"That was a crime,\" says Leahy bluntly. Planning is top of his list for reform. \"The cost of land is far too high, and then the process of development is far too uncertain, which increases the development cost. What it tends to produce, typically, is that built development, whether commercial or housing, takes so long to get approval that it ends up at the wrong time of the economic cycle.\" As for the \"medieval\" system of property-based business rates, he would rip it up. \"Come up with a new rate, if you must have a tax on business, and base it on how an economy really works. So that would mean a lower tax rate, probably, but spread across a much larger part of the economy and it would catch online business as well as traditional businesses. Why should a chain of shops pay a tax and a chain of mobile phone masts not pay a tax? Or a chain of ATM machines not pay a tax? It makes no sense.\" Leahy's final recommendation is for the next generation: go it alone. \"We also need a shift from working for professions and organisations to working for yourself. We have got wonderful universities and they produce incredibly bright kids and then they all march off to work for Accenture, McKinsey, Tesco, whatever, and a few of them should start businesses. Far too few start businesses. I have advised my kids to do that.\" Leahy's legacy \"If you had put a pound in Tesco [when I became chief executive], as opposed to any other retailer, or most other businesses, you'd be quite happy,\" says Sir Terry Leahy. On a big-picture view, he's right, of course. Tesco's profits, dividends and earnings per share doubled and doubled again during his 14\u2011year tenure. But the share price has fallen by a quarter since he left and successor Philip Clarke has described the UK business as being run \"too hot\". Clarke also abandoned Fresh &amp; Easy, the US chain that was the flagship investment of Leahy's final years. Lord MacLaurin, Leahy's predecessor, made strong criticisms at Tesco's annual meeting last year: \"When you judge the performance of a chief executive, you not only judge the performance of his day-to-day operation, but you also have to judge his legacy, and I think we're all very sad to see the legacy Sir Terry Leahy has left.\" Leahy declined to reply forcefully. \"I think that you have to allow the new team there to do the job and be judged on that,\" he says. \"I am happy to be judged on what I have done at Tesco.\"",

      "bodyText": "The scale of the challenge facing the Co-operative Group will be underlined on Friday when its banking arm reveals how it crashed \u00a31.3bn into the red last year. The loss will be revealed as the Co-op Group battles to heal internal divisions caused by the reforms being proposed by Lord Myners, who resigned on Wednesday in the midst of a fractious two-day board meeting. Myners \u2013 parachuted in to the troubled chain of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes only in December \u2013 resigned after just four months in the role following criticism of his proposals to scrap the current boardroom structure and replace it with one akin to a stock market-listed company. At the end of the tumultuous board meeting, the chair of the Co-op, Ursula Lidbetter, attempted to demonstrate a united front. She said the board still hoped to drive through the Myners reforms and would bring forward the date for the vote on his plans to next month. \"We are committed to reforming our governance and know that Lord Myners' report will provide invaluable stimulus for the changes we need to make,\" she said. Myners, who has warned the group could collapse if his reforms are not endorsed by the 8 million members and array of independent societies that own the business, will stay until the vote at the annual meeting on 17 May. \"I am confident that there is a good future for the Co-operative Group if it commits to doing the right things on governance and leadership,\" Myners said. But the departure of Myners \u2013 who had been cited as potential future chairman of the mutual \u2013 was described as a \"worrying sign\" by the Institute of Directors, a business lobby group. \"During the last few years, the board of the Co-op has proved itself to be a poor steward of the organisation's resources,\" said Roger Barker, the IoD's director of corporate governance. Myners rushed out a rough outline of his reform proposals last month in the wake of the shock resignation of chief executive Euan Sutherland following a leak of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal. But they provoked sustained criticism in their initial form. As recently as Tuesday the Midcounties Co-op pledged to vote against the reforms as one of the independent societies which together control 22% of the votes at the AGM. The chief executive of the Midcounties, Ben Reid, sits on the board of the Co-op Group. Myners was the only independent director on the board, made up of five members from independent societies and 15 representatives from the seven regional boards. The regional boards represent the views of 8 million members. Chairman of Guardian Media Group until 2008, when he resigned to join the Labour government, Myners was appointed in December when the Co-op's bank unit was mired in the scandal surrounding allegations of drug buying by its former chairman Paul Flowers. The bank is now just 30% owned by the group after last year's \u00a31.5bn cash injection from its parent and bondholders led by US hedge funds. The focus will now turn to the bank and how its new boss \u2013 Niall Booker \u2013 is being paid. Part of the team assembled by Sutherland, Booker stunned the City last month by admitting the bank needed another \u00a3400m to cover the cost of misselling scandals. The bank is expected to stress it is withholding pay from previous directors in an attempt to calm any fresh controversy over pay. The group needs to decide if it can find another \u00a3120m to pump into the bank as part of its fundraising. Richard Pennycook, who is standing in as chief executive and himself receiving \u00a3900,000 of retention packages, told the Evening Standard. \"We look forward to seeing the outcome of his review. I'm sure people will take its findings seriously.\" Myners will not be the only one to leave the board at the upcoming annual meeting as at a series of meetings over the weekend, the members of the regional boards who elect their 15 representatives to the group board also voted off three of their representatives who had sat on the pay committee that ratified the payments to Sutherland and other members of his executive team. They are Steven Bayes, who was deputy chair, Patrick Grange and Liz Moyle. Lidbetter was re-elected along with Mark Smith while five new regional representatives will join after the AGM. These are Andrew Donkin, Bob Harber, David Morrow, Frank Nelson and David Smith. Myners has a wide range of business interests and while a statement was being drawn up about his resignation at the Co-op another business he chairs, Nomad Holdings, was floating on the stock market with a view to making acquisitions.",

Conventional wisdom, supported by rates in the City's money markets, suggests that the bank rate stays where it is until the early part of 2015. The annual rate of inflation is likely to fall again next week to around 1.5%, which means the Bank can allow the recovery to embed itself before acting. It won't be until just before or just after the next general election that rates rise. A second camp holds that it will be even later than that before policy changes. Deflationary pressures stemming from a strong pound, the lack of real income growth and cut-throat competition in the high street mean that it won't be until late 2015 that the first move comes. At the other end of the spectrum are those who think the Bank is playing with fire by not already starting to tighten policy. The ultra-hawks believe falling unemployment and a booming housing market are signs that the economy is on the point of overheating. Given that monetary policy takes time to work, they want a rate rise before parliament breaks up for its summer recess. Finally, there are those who think there is still a bit of spare capacity in the economy that can be used up before rates need to rise, but not as much as the Bank forecasts suggest. Accordingly, rates will start to rise by the fourth quarter of 2014. Sentiment is only gradually swinging behind the last camp but would do so more quickly under three conditions: growth continues at its present rate, wage inflation starts to rise, and the spring house-buying season goes off with a bang.",

      "bodyText": "The US stock market showed signs of nervousness Thursday as three major indexes took a simultaneous dive, with little or no prompting from any noticeable bad news. The Nasdaq composite index, in particular \u2013 a measure of the health of major US technology companies \u2013 fell hard, dropping 3% at some points during the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 30-company index of blue-chip corporate well-being, dropped 215 points to 16,221, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 34 points to 1,838 in midday trading. While the Dow and S&amp;P dropped less than 2% each, the Nasdaq's precipitous fall was largely blamed for it. The Nasdaq, which includes companies like Facebook, Apple and Google, has had a rough ride during most of 2014, hitting a peak of around 4,300 in February before dropping to Thursday's levels of closer to 4,070. The Nasdaq hit its peak on 5,408.62 on 10 March 2000, and has never come close to recovering, although the recent excitement around the tech industry in the US and companies like WhatsApp had led many to hope the good times would return. The sudden dip fueled fears that the good times are over for the US stock market in general and the high-flying tech industry in particular, both of which enjoyed a ride to record or near-record peaks over the past five years. Many analysts attributed the can't-fail stock market to the largesse of the US Federal Reserve, which supported an aggressive stimulus of buying so many billions of dollars in bonds for government coffers that investors ran to buy stocks instead. That program has caused the central bank's balance sheet to swell with bonds to the tune of $4tn this year, from $1tn in 2007, before the financial crisis. Since December, however, the Federal Reserve has pulled back on that stimulus, known as quantitative easing (QE). Markets have responded with predictable nervousness about what lies ahead when the government is no longer sending more buyers \u2013 and more money \u2013 into the stock market. The result has been periodic queasiness and volatility in the stock market. \"The impact of easy money is always temporary and there is always a sobering up when it reverses,\" warned the Lindsey Group chief market analyst Peter Boockvar to investors on 25 March. \"Bottom line: I believe it is no coincidence that all of a sudden biotech and other very expensive Nasdaq names are experiencing a sharp correction just as the [Fed] is one meeting away from basically cutting [quantitative easing] in half.\" Boockvar suggested that the lack of the Fed as a safety net made investors less willing to gamble. \"QE turns on all matter of speculative risk-taking and the reversal of it does the opposite,\" Boockvar concluded. Barclays analysts reminded investors to \"Recall [that] high-fliers were also hit in January, though not to this extreme,\" when the markets responded to the December news from the Federal Reserve. Those Barclays analysts, Moyeen Islam and Joe Wynne, predicted this week that we are \"approaching the ceiling for US equities,\" and suggested that it was an end to the days of soaring stocks led by Silicon Valley's technology and biotechnology sectors. \"Frothy parts of the equities have collapsed, including what we consider the 'disruptive trade',\" they wrote on 8 April. \"Biotech has been the hardest hit, and industries tied to the housing trade.\" They predicted the bad news will continue: \"For the broad market \u2026 we believe the second quarter will prove difficult for equities,\" they wrote.",

The company said that better designed spring clothing ranges, more exclusive products and improved weather had all helped pull back sales declines at its UK stores open more than a year to 0.3% in the last three months. Over the previous three months sales had slumped 4%. Overseas, sales in constant currency rose 9.8% in the latest quarter after a disappointing 3.3% rise in the previous three months. . The better than expected performance is a fillip for Mothercare, whose chief executive Simon Calver departed in February just weeks after the company was forced to issue a profits warning. The retailer has now brought in Mark Newton-Jones, the former boss of Littlewoods owner Shop Direct, as interim chief executive. Its shares have more than halved in value since January.

After the bomb blast outside the Bank of Greece earlier today, the Greek government is expected to throw an iron ring around the Greek capital. Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If security was draconian last time the German chancellor visited it will be doubly so this time, Greek officials say. All day on Thursday, officers at Athens\u2019 central police headquarters have been detailing the security blanket they will throw around the capital during the eight hours Angela Merkel is expected to be here. Protest rallies and public gatherings will be banned between 11:30 AM to 9:30 PM. Thousands \u2013 although how many we still don\u2019t know \u2013 of riot police and sharp shooters are also expected to be deployed across the city centre.</p> <p>This is the second time Angela Merkel is visiting Greece, the country that triggered the crisis that has chafed at Berlin for the past four years.</p> <p>In October 2012, it was all about furious protestors, dressed in Nazi garb, greeting the leader with placards proclaiming \"Raus! Raus!\"</p> <p>This time it's a love-in with Merkel already saying she is visiting Athens to show her \"admiration\" for the Greek people and support for fellow conservative leader Antonis Samaras. In the sign of the shift in sentiment, the German media was enthusiastic in its praise of the country\u2019s foray into international borrowing markets today, with some describing the economic progress Athens has made as a \u201cmiraculous recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Greek officials \u2013 no longer wont to speak of Berlin with the bitterness of old \u2013 will also be on their best behavior.</p> <p>\"Greece has delivered fiscally and with this visit she wants to show, yet again, that Germany is not only admiring of Greece's efforts but is there standing right behind us,\" said one government insider. \"It's been a roller-coaster but in the end Germany helped us. That cannot be denied.\"</p> <p>Athens' Ministry of Press and Information says Merkel will be driven from the airport straight to the Hilton Hotel to participate in a \"forum with young entrepreneurs at 3:15 PM with the Greek prime minister.\" A second forum will follow with representatives of small and medium sized businesses at 4:20 PM. The German chancellor will then hold talks with Samaras in his office before speaking to the press. An official at the German embassy, confirming the time-table added: \"She will fly back to Berlin after that. She will not be spending the night in Athens.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1e6aefb4-e4d6-4233-b063-774bd1258286\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/10/1397145754622/7db30737-d27a-423b-9574-07c0cf2c89c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Protesters in Athens holding a banner against Friday's visit by German chancellor Angela Merkel.

Photo: ReutersAlkis Konstantinidis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike her last visit when talk was dominated by the need for austerity, the German leader will put the emphasis on growth and development - in line with demands in Germany itself for recession-ravaged Greece to be cut some slack. As a result, talks are expected to focus on a Development Bank for Greece - a German inspired idea that has taken the best part of a year to germinate and now looks, finally, as if it about to get off the ground. Officials have hinted that Berlin will allocate around \u20ac100m to the bank which is expected to finance long-term infrastructure projects that the private sector is reluctant to support.</p> <p>Such projects - desalination plants are believed to be among them - are essential if Greece is to deal with its record unemployment levels (at 26.7% the highest in the eurozone) not least among youth. \"It is highly symbolic that Merkel should meet young entrepreneurs,\" Constantine Papadopoulos, an adviser on economics affairs at Geniki Bank, told me. \"Why? Because after all these years of austerity and recession that is where Greece's future lies - in the hands of young entrepreneurs.\"</p> <p>Entrepreneurs are seen as key to kickstarting exports - the lack of which are widely seen as the Achilles heel of the Greek economy. Exports of goods have dropped precipitously in the last year - despite a surge in some areas, like the food industry, and petroleum products. The average eurozone country exports goods and services worth around 45% of GDP whereas Greek exports amount to not more than half of that, including shipping and tourism.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d562bd4a-9cf7-4bde-9048-491656faaaa3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/10/1397145929009/08f4c4ac-65ca-43b3-acbb-f7600e3f9be6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Posters signed by main opposition party Syriza depicting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.

Policy is on autopilot for the next few months though. The BoE, as expected, left monetary policy unchanged today and is likely to remain in a holding pattern until the Autumn, when we see a good chance that one or more of the rate setters will begin voting for rate hikes. With guidance still in force, which means the BoE will not raise rates for the next few months, the key policy questions are not about the next few month\u2019s policy decisions.</p> <p>The big policy issues are how far and how fast the BoE will hike rates and sell assets when they do tighten. The recovery is moving onto a firmer footing now. There is every sign that the UK is set for a period of above-trend growth. Encouragingly business investment is rising strongly again and investment intentions are surging. We expect growth to accelerate into 2015 and see upside as well as downside risks to our above-consensus growth forecasts of 3.0% for 2014 and 3.3% for 2015. As a result we expect the BoE to tighten earlier and faster than the central bank itself seems to be planning on.</p> <p>Emergency policy settings will not be needed for much longer. In fact, whether they are still needed right now is questionable. We expect the first 25bp hike in Q1 2015, followed by three more 25bp hikes in 2015 and four in 2016.

Greece successfully returned to the bond markets, but industrial output from Italy and France was disappointing and Chinese exports fell for the second month. The US Federal Reserve made dovish noises about interest rates in the minutes of its last meeting, but geopolitical worries remained given the continuing tensions in Ukraine. So the closing scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished just 6.36 points or 0.1% higher at 6641.97 \u2022 Germany's Dax dipped 0.54% to 9454.54 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.66% lower at 4413.49 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1.33% to 21,429.09 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 1.42% lower at 10,336.1 \u2022 Despite Greece's success in the bond market the Athens market fell 0.74% to 1283.96 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 140 points or 0.85% lower. On that note, it's time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow, with Co-op Bank's results and Angela Merkel's visit to Athens on the schedule. Over to Greece again where police officials have announced draconian security measures ahead of the German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s visit to Athens tomorrow. After the bomb blast outside the Bank of Greece earlier today, the Greek government is expected to throw an iron ring around the Greek capital. Helena Smith reports from Athens: If security was draconian last time the German chancellor visited it will be doubly so this time, Greek officials say. All day on Thursday, officers at Athens\u2019 central police headquarters have been detailing the security blanket they will throw around the capital during the eight hours Angela Merkel is expected to be here. Protest rallies and public gatherings will be banned between 11:30 AM to 9:30 PM. Thousands \u2013 although how many we still don\u2019t know \u2013 of riot police and sharp shooters are also expected to be deployed across the city centre. This is the second time Angela Merkel is visiting Greece, the country that triggered the crisis that has chafed at Berlin for the past four years. In October 2012, it was all about furious protestors, dressed in Nazi garb, greeting the leader with placards proclaiming \"Raus! Raus!\" This time it's a love-in with Merkel already saying she is visiting Athens to show her \"admiration\" for the Greek people and support for fellow conservative leader Antonis Samaras. In the sign of the shift in sentiment, the German media was enthusiastic in its praise of the country\u2019s foray into international borrowing markets today, with some describing the economic progress Athens has made as a \u201cmiraculous recovery.\u201d Greek officials \u2013 no longer wont to speak of Berlin with the bitterness of old \u2013 will also be on their best behavior. \"Greece has delivered fiscally and with this visit she wants to show, yet again, that Germany is not only admiring of Greece's efforts but is there standing right behind us,\" said one government insider. \"It's been a roller-coaster but in the end Germany helped us. That cannot be denied.\" Athens' Ministry of Press and Information says Merkel will be driven from the airport straight to the Hilton Hotel to participate in a \"forum with young entrepreneurs at 3:15 PM with the Greek prime minister.\" A second forum will follow with representatives of small and medium sized businesses at 4:20 PM. The German chancellor will then hold talks with Samaras in his office before speaking to the press. An official at the German embassy, confirming the time-table added: \"She will fly back to Berlin after that. She will not be spending the night in Athens.\" Unlike her last visit when talk was dominated by the need for austerity, the German leader will put the emphasis on growth and development - in line with demands in Germany itself for recession-ravaged Greece to be cut some slack. As a result, talks are expected to focus on a Development Bank for Greece - a German inspired idea that has taken the best part of a year to germinate and now looks, finally, as if it about to get off the ground. Officials have hinted that Berlin will allocate around \u20ac100m to the bank which is expected to finance long-term infrastructure projects that the private sector is reluctant to support. Such projects - desalination plants are believed to be among them - are essential if Greece is to deal with its record unemployment levels (at 26.7% the highest in the eurozone) not least among youth. \"It is highly symbolic that Merkel should meet young entrepreneurs,\" Constantine Papadopoulos, an adviser on economics affairs at Geniki Bank, told me. \"Why? Because after all these years of austerity and recession that is where Greece's future lies - in the hands of young entrepreneurs.\" Entrepreneurs are seen as key to kickstarting exports - the lack of which are widely seen as the Achilles heel of the Greek economy. Exports of goods have dropped precipitously in the last year - despite a surge in some areas, like the food industry, and petroleum products. The average eurozone country exports goods and services worth around 45% of GDP whereas Greek exports amount to not more than half of that, including shipping and tourism. Silvio Berlusconi has asked to serve his one-year sentence for tax fraud by helping the disabled, Reuters has reported. A hearing beginning on Thursday and expected to report by next Tuesday will decide whether the former Italian prime minister goes to prison - considered highly unlikely - or is sentenced to house arrest or community service. The UK Treasury has waded back into the issue of Scottish independence, saying that the latest IMF forecasts show that an independent Scotland would run a much higher deficit than the rest of the UK. In a statement, the Treasury declared that Scotland would have a fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent in 2016-17, equivalent to \u00a39.5bn, or \u00a31,760 per head. That's around \u00a31000 greater than the UK\u2019s deficit per head in the same year, it says, adding: Only the US would have a larger fiscal deficit than an independent Scotland in 2016, and only just. And Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, pointed to today's warning from Fitch that the UK's credit rating would come under more pressure if Scotland goes it alone. Alexander said: \"All these reports confirm that both the UK and Scotland would be worse off apart. Being part of the larger UK economy provides Scotland with jobs, stability and security. Independence would mean higher taxes and lower spending on public services.\" As also flagged up at 12.08pm, a poll by UKForex found that 53% of people in the rest of the UK oppose an independent Scotland using the pound, and 42% would be more likely to move money out of a Scottish-based bank. What, exactly, is the IMF's Plan B if America continues to refuse to give emerging nations like Brazil and China more power? (as Chris Giles asked Christine Lagarde earlier) Well, two former Assistant Secretaries of the US Treasury for International Affairs have proposed two ways that the Fund could get round the US's roadblock. In a letter to the FT today, Dr C Fred Bergsten and Dr Edwin M Truman wrote: If Congress persists in its refusal, we propose two ways for the Fund to move ahead by raising funds from others while depriving the US of some or all of its longstanding power to block major Fund actions. One way would be to make permanent the 2012 initiative by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde to arrange temporary bilateral credit lines of nearly $500bn from 38 countries augmenting the Fund\u2019s capability to finance its lending. The US opposed that proposal, but the IMF and other countries could convert it into a permanent arrangement, placing decision-making in the hands of the funding countries, not the US. A more radical approach would be to increase total country quota subscriptions in a manner that would also not allow the US on its own to stop the Fund from reforming its governance. The US deserves to lose influence if it continues to fail to lead. Does Christine Lagarde think Greece will need a debt restructuring, following today's successful bond sale? Lagarde replies that Greece is making progress in its reform programme. She replies that she sees the fact the debt issuance was \"massive oversubscribed\" as an indication that Greece is \"heading in the right direction\", and a show of support for the government's plans. It also shows that the return to markets, the objective of all IMF programmes, is on the horizon, she added. Is Christine Lagarde losing faith in Abenomics? She says that the Japanese PM's first two arrows have delivered results. The third arrow, structural reforms, has seen some progress - but more needs to be done. Lagarde cites the plan to get more women into the Japanese labour market. Chris Giles of the FT asks about the US Congress's failure to approve reforms that would give developing nations more influence within the IMF. Is it time for a Plan B? Speaking carefully, Christine Lagarde says she hopes the Fund can exhaust all the opportunities in \"Plan A\" first. We cannot move to plan B until we have full certainty and massive disappointment that plan A is dead. She adds that she very much hopes that pressure can be brought against all members who haven't yet ratified the reforms, to \"deliver fruit in the not too distant future\". On Monday, George Osborne urged America to ratify the reforms, so that nations such as Brazil get the power they merit. On aid talks with Ukraine, Christine Lagarde says the IMF does not expect to fail, and hopes to submit a plan to its board in late April or early May. China Daily News asks Christine Lagarde about weak trade figures released from China today (details here). Is she worried that the value of the renminbi is being pushed down by Beijing? Lagarde says she recent widening of the renminbi's trading band is a sign of the 'internationalisation' of the Chinese currency, not its depreciation. We welcome this 'internationalisation'. China is playing a key role in the global economy, she adds, expected to grow by 7.5% this year. Onto questions..... On the deflation risk, Christine Lagarde says it is \"encouraging\" that the European Central Bank has reiterated its commitment to unconventional monetary tools if needed. Last week, ECB president Mario Draghi was most unhappy that Lagarde called for the ECB to ease monetary policy, a day before its governing council met. Christine Lagarde begins her press conference by reminding the audience that the IMF's latest forecast show that emerging markets will continue to drive economic grow, and advanced economies are strengthening a bit. Our overall message is that the global economy is turning the corner, but the recovery is still too weak and too slow, Lagarde says. We still have 200 million people unemployed across the globe. We need more growth, she added. The priority for this week's meeting in Washington must be to create more rapid growth. The IMF press conference is starting now -- here's the livefeed. From Washington, my colleague Phillip Inman has analysed the IMF's financial stability report, and writes: Head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde issued a warning to world leaders on Thursday that they need to do more to deal with huge government and bank debts that continue to drag on growth and undermine the stability of the financial system. Ahead of a set-piece address at the organisation's spring conference in Washington, Lagarde said leaders need to co-operate in their efforts to repair government and bank finances to protect against a repeat of the 2008 crash. Lagarde also vented her frustration at persistent delays to the IMF's own reform programme, which was agreed in 2010 to increase representation from developing nations but has yet to be implemented. She described the delay as \"utterly disappointing\" and pledged to press ahead \"to ensure the continued legitimacy, relevance, financial strength, and effectiveness of the Fund\". Here's the full piece: Christine Lagarde: huge government and bank debts risk new financial crash The IMF just released its new financial stability report, and it's stuffed with warnings and advice for world leaders and central bankers. Here's the Reuters snaps: IMF SAYS UNWINDING LARGE CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEETS WILL BE COMPLEX, COULD RISK LARGE SPILLOVERS VIA MARKET AND EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IMF CALLS FOR MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN CENTRAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL REGULATORS IMF SAYS MAJOR EMERGING MARKETS SEE ROOM FOR MORE COOPERATION ON SPILLOVERS FROM MONETARY POLICY IMF SAYS DELAY IN RATIFYING 2010 QUOTA REFORM PACKAGE 'UTTERLY DISAPPOINTING' IMF SAYS FURTHER ACTIONS NEEDED FROM SURPLUS AND DEFICIT COUNTRIES TO MAKE SURE IMBALANCES KEEP FALLING IMF SAYS CHINA STILL NEEDS TO REIN IN SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM TO STEM FINANCIAL RISKS IMF SAYS HARD LANDING IN CHINA A RISK, WOULD HAVE LARGE IMPACT ON OTHER EMERGING MARKETS IMF SAYS SLOWING PROGRESS ON COMPLETION OF FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORMS 'GROWING CONCERN' IMF SAYS ADVANCED ECONOMIES SHOULD CALIBRATE PACE OF AUSTERITY TO SUPPORT RECOVERY IMF SAYS EMERGING MARKETS LIKE BRAZIL, INDIA, INDONESIA MAY NEED TO TIGHTEN MONETARY POLICY TO REIN IN INFLATION IMF SAYS REFORM FATIGUE COULD PUSH GLOBAL ECONOMY INTO PROLONGED SLUMP What a ride: After receiving a fearful drubbing at Capitol Hill last week over safety problems, US automaker GM has just announced a new programme to reward staff who report glitches. Two staff have also been put on paid leave. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell to its lowest level in almost seven years last week. Just 300,000 new claims were filed last week, down from 332,000 the previous seven days. That's the lowest total since May 2007. The number filing 'continuing claims' also fell, to 2.776m -- which is the lowest since January 2008. Heads-up. The International Monetary Fund's Christine Lagarde will hold a press briefing in 30 minutes to discuss the \"global agenda\", ahead of this weekend's Spring Meeting in Washington. She'd like you to watch (livestream will be here). It's BP's annual general meeting today, and worried shareholders are asking the oil giant whether it could lose its stake in Russia's Rosneft. BP is insisting that it is safe from Vladimir Putin's clutches. Jennifer Rankin is there, tweeting the key points: Today's Bank of England rate decision was a snoozer, but in a few months there could be much more excitement, especially as the minutes of the monthly meetings are published. Rob Wood of Berenberg bank reckons some MPC members will start voting for rate hikes this autumn, and borrowing costs will actually increase within the year. Wood also predicts that Britain's interest rates will have risen to 2.5% by the end of 2016, from 0.5% today. Here's his take: The UK recovery has much more momentum that the BoE thinks so they will need to hike interest rates within the next twelve months, in our view. Policy is on autopilot for the next few months though. The BoE, as expected, left monetary policy unchanged today and is likely to remain in a holding pattern until the Autumn, when we see a good chance that one or more of the rate setters will begin voting for rate hikes. With guidance still in force, which means the BoE will not raise rates for the next few months, the key policy questions are not about the next few month\u2019s policy decisions. The big policy issues are how far and how fast the BoE will hike rates and sell assets when they do tighten. The recovery is moving onto a firmer footing now. There is every sign that the UK is set for a period of above-trend growth. Encouragingly business investment is rising strongly again and investment intentions are surging. We expect growth to accelerate into 2015 and see upside as well as downside risks to our above-consensus growth forecasts of 3.0% for 2014 and 3.3% for 2015. As a result we expect the BoE to tighten earlier and faster than the central bank itself seems to be planning on. Emergency policy settings will not be needed for much longer. In fact, whether they are still needed right now is questionable. We expect the first 25bp hike in Q1 2015, followed by three more 25bp hikes in 2015 and four in 2016. We look for the BoE to stop reinvesting gilt redemptions in Autumn 2015 and to start selling assets in 2017. It is possible to justify a rate rise now given rapidly falling slack and inflation close to target. So we think the central bank will need to play catch-up next year. Fitch, the credit rating agency, has warned that Britain will face a longer haul to regain its AAA rating if Scotland votes for independence. Fitch said it expects the \"No\" side to win in September's referendum, but will review the UK's credit rating (currently AA+ with a stable outlook) if there is a 'yes' vote. A vote for independence would mean \"additional, albeit moderate risks\" for the UK's public debt, external finances, currency arrangement and banking sector, Fitch said. The UK Treasury's promise to take on the total British debt pile would drive up the national debt, measured as a percentage of GDP, Fitch explained: This would lead to a one-off increase of 9.5% of GDP in the UK gross public debt ratio as Scotland was stripped from UK GDP from 2016. As we have previously emphasised, the UK's gross debt ratio will need to be lower than its current level and steadily declining before any upgrade back to 'AAA'; a prospect that would be delayed by such a debt shock. Fitch also suggests that some Scottish banks (RBS perhaps) would move their HQs south of the border - which would also mean rUK's banking sector would be larger, as a percentage The full statement is here. Separately, a poll by UKForex found that many customers with money in Scottish banks would move their accounts in the event of a Yes vote. Here's the topline: 42% of those with money in Scottish institutions would be likely to move to an England-based provider if Scotland lost the pound \u2013 up to \u00a3280bn could move south of the border 3x more people think Scotland has no Plan B if it can\u2019t keep the pound than think it does (52% v. 18%) 2x more people oppose an independent Scotland keeping the pound than support it (53% v. 26%) The Bank of England's monetary policy committee has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.5%. It also made no change to its quantitative easing programme. There's no further statement, and not much reaction in the markets either (understandably). Drama in the world of UK retail, after Tesco disinvited the FT's senior retail correspondent, Andrea Felsted, from a media dinner tonight. No, she didn't pass the port the wrong way last time (those FT hacks know their stuff!). Instead, she's been frozen out after revealing that finance director Laurie McIlwee was leaving, and writing on Tuesday night that the company's head of loyalty had also departed. In 2012, Centrica first barred and then unbarred our energy editor, Terry Macalister (CEO Sam Laidlaw presenting Terry with a can of baked beans after fellow hacks revolted). Sainsbury's PR guys have a better idea: Back in the UK, the Institute of Directors has issued a sobering warning over the chaos at the Co-operative Group. The IoD says the shock resignation of Lord Myners from the Co-op board last night, along with three other directors, is a worrying development as the troubled mutual needs to make radical changes. Dr. Roger Barker, Director of Corporate Governance at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cThe resignation of Lord Myners is a worrying sign for the troubled mutual. During the last few years, the board of the Co-op has proved itself to be a poor steward of the organisations\u2019 resources. Decisions have been made which have destroyed large amounts of value and threatened the Co-op\u2019s very existence. Their current model doesn\u2019t work. \u201cA clear lesson from recent problems is that the board of the Co-op needs to become a competent and professional decision-making body. This requirement is not limited to the Co-op, with its distinctive mutual structure. Such competences are needed by all types of organisation if they are to survive and flourish\u201d. More bullish talk from Greek ministers, who are clearly delighted to have raised \u20ac3bn in today's heavily oversubscribed bond sale (details at 9.45am) . Emerging from talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras, Greece\u2019s deputy PM Evangelos Venizelos has said the bond sale should \u201cshut up\u201d those who continue to peddle \u201cnegative stereotypes\u201d about the country. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Saying that the auction was over-subscribed eight times, Venizelos described it as the \u201cofficial, triumphant, tangible confirmation of change.\" \u201cWe haven\u2019t just been spared from bankruptcy and catastrophe, we are once again becoming the Greece that we know,\" he told reporters gathered outside the prime minister's office. \"We will regain the quality of life that we had. And all of this has happened with the sacrifices and hard work of the Greek people,\u201d he said. Another sign that some investors shunned Greece's debt sale: European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has declared that Greece's bond issue will boost hopes that Europe can overcome its debt crisis. Speaking in Athens, where he met with finance minister Yannis Stournaras, Joaquin Almunia said: \"It's extremely good news... and it will reinforce confidence in Europe to overcome the crisis\". Greece has also fallen deeper into deflation. Prices fell by another 0.2% in March compared with February, driving the annual consumer prices index down to -1.3%, Elstat reported. Greece's unemployment rate has fallen, but still remains punishingly high, according to the latest data released by Elstat this morning. Greece's jobless rate dipped to 26.7% in January, down from 27.2% in December 2013 but higher than the 26.5% recorded a year ago. Having hovered above the 27% mark through 2013, the jobless rate is finally dropping -- which could bolster confidence that the Greek economy will finally start growing this year after a long recession. The number of people in work across Greece increased by 40,119 during January to 3,613,826, while the unemployment total fell by 17,446 to 1,317,848. A further 3,386,498 people are classed as \"inactive\" , down by 26,844 compared with December. The youth unemployment rate came in at 56.8%, down from 60.4% a year ago. Just under a quarter of men are unemployed, while the female unemployment rate is over 30%. Greece has made a successful return to the financial markets, as news breaks that it has raised \u20ac3bn in its first bond sale in four years. Inside the Greek government, officials are already hailing the bond sale as \u201cmore than a triumph.\u201d Strong demand has pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on the five-year bonds to just 4.95%, as investors scurry to take part in the debt auction. That's a lower rate of return than expected, which has pleased the Athens government. The sight of a car bomb in Greece overnight did not deter bidders. Bankers in Greece confirmed to our Helena Smith in Athens that the order book hit the \u20ac20bn mark this morning, making it six-times oversubscribed. One finance ministry insider told Helena: \u201cTo great degree this was all about proving that Greece is on the verge of exiting the crisis and in that we have been more than successful,\u201d. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is meeting with his junior partner, deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos to discuss the government\u2019s future steps in the wake of the warm reception the bond sale has received. Greece had initially been expected to raise around \u20ac2bn, before seeing the level of interest in its debt -- unthinkable two years ago when the country appeared to be on the brink of leaving the eurozone. The bond sale is an important step for Greece, establishing that it has regained the trust of the markets. As flagged up earlier, some fund managers believe Greece doesn't really merit a yield below 5% -- as it is still conducting a painful austerity programme, and may possibly need further debt relief this year. Some seasoned eurozone crisis watchers are alarmed: LNG Capital's Gary Jenkins argues that Greece's debt pile remains unsustainable, at 180% of GDP, but any restructuring will not occur for many years: The vast majority of the debt is owed to its European partners and you could argue that the incredibly generous terms of a very low interest rate, a very long maturity (coupled with a holiday repayment which is longer than most loan terms) just reflect the view that the debt still looks unsustainable and that the terms are indicative of a situation that will only be solved at some stage by a further debt restructuring. Any such event though is probably years away and thus the most likely outcome for this new bond issue is that it will be repaid long before the EU/ECB/IMF consider what action to take with their loans. The Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has just made an announcement on the bond sale, reports Helena Smith in Athens. \"Today we've returned to international borrowing markets for the first time in four years. In a short while we will announce the results of this catalytic undertaking,\" he said addressing a conference attended by the EU commissioner for European and Financial affairs Joaquin Almunia in Athens. Not to be outdone by the spoiler of the early morning bomb blast and guerilla gangs trying to ruin the day, the finance minister pressed upon his audience that the debt-stricken country had made \"the biggest fiscal adjustment ever recorded [by the OECD] since the second world war.\" Bankers contacted by the Guardian in Athens this morning say foreign investors are behind the scramble for bonds. \"The government was not interested in Greeks or the ECB snapping them up, but foreign investors so that the sale would send a message. That confidence has returned and Greece is on the mend,\" said one. We're also hearing that the order book on the bond sale has swelled to \u20ac20bn. Remarkable - but worth cautioning that investors often bid for more than they actually want, to avoid missing out altogether. Shares are rising across European stock markets this morning, as investors welcome the dovish tone of last night's Federal Reserve minutes. The FTSE 100 is leading the way, up 0.7%. The minutes showed that Fed policy makers remain cautious about raising US interest rates from their current record lows (more details here). Kit Juckes of Societe Generale isn't impressed, warning that the US central bank could be creating more trouble in the future. The very dovish tone to the Minutes will undermine the dollar, boost equities, boost emerging markets assets, drag credit spreads even tighter and make markets a more dangerous pace. Eventually, the Fed will need to hike rates. The more dovish air they pump into markets now, the bigger the reaction when they do hike. Another flash from Reuters -- the Greek five-year bond is being priced at a yield of around 5%, as the order prices heads into its climax. Reuters is reporting that investors have kept flocking to Greece's five-year bond sale -- it reckons that \u20ac17.8bn of orders have now been received. That's up from \u20ac11bn yesterday afternoon, suggesting strong demand from American firms. Some European fund managers, though, have been cautioning that bidders are being a bit reckless. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have jumped more than 2% in early trading, after the retailer ended its long decline in clothing, thanks to stronger demand for womenswear. The 0.6% rise in clothing sales in January-March looks like the highlight from the last quarter's financial results, as overall like-for-like sales dipped 0.1%. My colleague Julia Kollewe writes: Marks &amp; Spencer's efforts to turn fashion sales around have paid off, with clothing sales recovering in the last quarter, helped by women's clothes. But overall UK like-for-like sales slipped 0.2%, and the retailer warned that promotions would drag down profit margins in the UK. The chief executive, Marc Bolland, who took the helm four years ago, said womenswear was showing \"clear signs of improvement\", lifting total clothes sales 1.3% in the 13 weeks to 29 March, the chain's fourth quarter. They were up 0.6% on a like-for-like basis. More here: Marks &amp; Spencer's clothing sales recover Food sales only crept up by +0.1% - which M&amp;S blamed on Easter falling later this year. We should get the details of Greece's bond sale in a few hours. The Financial Times's Ralph Atkins has a good take on the auction, saying Athens would be foolish not to take advantage of the recent tumble in eurozone borrowing costs. But he warns: Inflows into Greek bonds may prove fickle. Wait for the next bout of investor nervousness and yields could quickly rise. The trigger could be political tensions in Athens \u2013 the bond launch coincided with a nationwide anti-austerity strike. Or it could be stronger than expected polling in next month\u2019s European elections by anti-euro and nationalist political parties \u2013 or a global sell-off as the US Federal Reserve moves towards higher interest rates. Atkins flags up that Greece currently pays rather less than 5% on its bailout loans; today's sale is about regaining market access, not cutting debt costs. But there could be a downside.... The danger is that a rush of capital market success distracts from essential reforms such as overhauling a bloated public sector, implementing a meaningful privatisation programme and improving tax collection \u2013 building an efficient advanced economy, in other words. Some of the early reaction on Twitter: Here's Kathimerini's early take on the car bomb: Police cordoned off the area, but did not immediately approach the actual site of the explosion. As dawn broke, television footage from the area showed the remnants of a car in the middle of an Athens street, with debris strewn around. It was unclear whether nearby buildings were damaged. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. Greece's long-awaited return to the financial markets today has been overshadowed by a car bomb, detonated overnight outside a Bank of Greece building in Athens. The explosion, at around 6am local time, smashed windows but doesn't appears to have caused any casualties. Two anonymous calls were made, warning of the bomb, before it went off. Police are now combing the scene. Reuters has more details: There was no immediate claim of responsibility but police believed leftist or anarchist groups were behind it, the official said. Witnessess saw debris strewn across the street in a busy part of the capital lined with banks, shops and a mall. Makeshift bombings and arson attacks have escalated since Greece adopted unpopular austerity measures in exchange for multibillion euro bailouts by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in 2010. The car bomb comes just hours before Greece sells its first long-term bond since 2010, a key milestone in its journey through the debt crisis. As we covered yesterday, the auction has seen decent demand, and Athens could sell the bond at an interest rate as low as 5.25%. Greek return to financial markets attracts flock of investors A successful sales is a symbolic move towards (eventually) loosening the grip of its international lenders, although \u20ac2.5bn of bonds is dwarfed by Greece's total debts. The explosion also comes a day before German chancellor Angela Merkel visits Athens. Otherwise, it's a fairly busy day today: The International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, will outline her policy agenda for the global economy around 1.45pm BST (8.45am Washington). Europe's financial markets are expected to open higher, after the minutes of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting calmed fears that US interest rates might rise early next year. In the UK, several retailers are reporting financial results - including Marks &amp; Spencer. It has beaten City expectations with a 0.6% rise in clothing sales, but overall like-for-like sales dropped a little. We'll also be watching the Co-op Group, which fell deeper into crisis last night with the resignation of Lord Myners, the senior independent director brought in to stabilise the organisation. Lord Myners quits Co-operative Group And Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister who was brought down during the heights of the eurozone crisis, will learn how he will serve his one-year sentence for tax fraud (he's too old for prison). I'll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The World Bank has urged developing-world countries to fund social security programmes to lift the incomes of their poorest people, ending a reliance on growth to end poverty. In a report the bank said that while economic growth remains vital for reducing poverty, it has its limits. \"Countries need to complement efforts to enhance growth with policies that allocate more resources to the extreme poor,\" it said. \"These resources can be distributed through the growth process itself, by promoting more inclusive growth, or through government programmes, such as conditional and direct cash transfers.\" The World Bank has spent billions of dollars attempting to improve the infrastructure and education systems of low-income countries to promote growth and tackle poverty. Its support for large-scale, expensive projects has long come under fire from anti-poverty groups, which have accused the bank of forcing poor countries to borrow heavily to adopt expensive solutions designed in the west. And the bank's latest initiative was quickly criticised for lacking action on the ground. The Bretton Woods Project, which monitors the work of the bank, said: \"While it is welcome to have the World Bank talking about 'inequality' instead of fuzzy language on 'shared prosperity', the bank is putting more of its money into the financial sector than any other sector. \"The private sector arm's biggest investment destination is Russian banks, hardly a way to reach the 33% of the world's poor that live in India.\" Earlier this week Oxfam reacted angrily to comments by International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde that inequality should be a central issue for policymakers. She said the social and political problems caused by extreme inequality of wealth and incomes was beginning to cause economic problems and hindering growth. Max Lawson, head of policy at Oxfam, accused the World Bank and IMF of promoting policies that make people poorer. He cited support by the bank for private education and health, which become unaffordable for poorer people and force them to borrow or forgo the service. \"Economic growth has been vital for reducing extreme poverty and improving the lives of many poor people,\" said World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim. \"Yet even if all countries grow at the same rates as over the past 20 years, and if the income distribution remains unchanged, world poverty will only fall by 10% by 2030, from 17.7% in 2010. This is simply not enough, and we need a laser-like focus on making growth more inclusive and targeting more programmes to assist the poor directly if we're going to end extreme poverty.\" Kim added: \"To end extreme poverty, the vast numbers of the poorest \u2013 those earning less than $1.25 a day \u2013 will have to decrease by 50 million people each year until 2030. This means that 1 million people each week will have to lift themselves out of poverty for the next 16 years. This will be extraordinarily difficult, but I believe we can do it. This can be the generation that ends extreme poverty.\" The bank said the top five countries, in terms of numbers of poor, are India (with 33% of the world's poor), China (13%), Nigeria (7%), Bangladesh (6%) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5%), which together are home to nearly 760m of the world's poor. Adding another five countries \u2013 Indonesia, Pakistan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Kenya \u2013 would encompass almost 80% of the extreme poor, the bank said. \"Hence, a sharp emphasis on these countries will be central to ending extreme poverty,\" says the paper. The top five countries in terms of poverty density are the Democratic Republic of the Congo (where 88% of the population is below the poverty line), Liberia (84%), Burundi and Madagascar (81% each), and Zambia (75%). \"Reducing poverty in these places is as important as making progress in countries where the absolute number of poor people is much bigger,\" it said.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Chancellor will try to debunk claims that a further five years of austerity will restrict growth and hurt living standards", 
      "body": "<p>George Osborne is to tell an audience of free-market campaigners in Washington that the UK's economic turnaround will defy those who say austerity and low wage growth will lead to long-term stagnation. In his first major speech in the US, the chancellor will attempt to demolish claims that a further five years of austerity will restrict growth and hurt workers' living standards.</p> <p>Osborne will argue at the American Enterprise Institute that low interest rates, the Bank of England's creation of new money through massive bond purchases under its quantitative easing programme and a strengthened banking sector can secure a bright future for the UK.</p> <p>The speech is an attempt to head off concerns that Britain's recovery is built on an unsustainable housing boom.</p> <p>Osborne will also address the wider debate with Keynesian economists concerned that workers face years of low wages and insecure jobs. He will call critics \"pessimists\" who have been proved wrong when they claimed that austerity would trigger a second recession.</p> <p>He will say: \"The pessimists are on the march again with their predictions of stagnation. We, the optimists, can prove them wrong again. Our nations' best days lie ahead.\"</p> <p>Osborne's speech comes after head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, issued a warning to world leaders that they need to do more to deal with huge government and bank debts that she said continue to drag down growth and undermine the stability of the financial system. Speaking at the IMF's spring conference, Lagarde said leaders needed to co-operate in their efforts to repair public sector and bank finances to protect against a repeat of the 2008 crash.</p> <p>Osborne is due to meet finance ministers and central bankers at the IMF spring conference after a whistlestop tour of Brazil to promote British business interests. Before his arrival in the US capital he was praised, along with David Cameron, by Jim Yong Kim, the head of the World Bank, for maintaining aid spending during a time of difficult budget cuts.</p> <p>Kim said the prime minister and chancellor were brave to spend 0.7% of GDP on aid, which he said made a huge difference to developing countries starved of private sector funds.</p> <p>The chancellor is keen to go into the next election contrasting his more optimistic outlook with gloomy predictions from Labour that a race for growth will lead to another crash.</p> <p>Larry Summers, the former economic adviser to Barack Obama, famously wrote last year that the west was about to enter a \"secular stagnation\" characterised by a lack of consumer demand that will restrict wages and business investment. He argued that governments need to intervene to educate workers and cope with ageing populations.</p> <p>Osborne will say: \"Proponents of 'secular stagnation' argue that over recent decades monetary policy has had to work harder and harder to sustain growth, and has now reached its limits.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is to tell an audience of free-market campaigners in Washington that the UK's economic turnaround will defy those who say austerity and low wage growth will lead to long-term stagnation. In his first major speech in the US, the chancellor will attempt to demolish claims that a further five years of austerity will restrict growth and hurt workers' living standards. Osborne will argue at the American Enterprise Institute that low interest rates, the Bank of England's creation of new money through massive bond purchases under its quantitative easing programme and a strengthened banking sector can secure a bright future for the UK. The speech is an attempt to head off concerns that Britain's recovery is built on an unsustainable housing boom. Osborne will also address the wider debate with Keynesian economists concerned that workers face years of low wages and insecure jobs. He will call critics \"pessimists\" who have been proved wrong when they claimed that austerity would trigger a second recession. He will say: \"The pessimists are on the march again with their predictions of stagnation. We, the optimists, can prove them wrong again. Our nations' best days lie ahead.\" Osborne's speech comes after head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, issued a warning to world leaders that they need to do more to deal with huge government and bank debts that she said continue to drag down growth and undermine the stability of the financial system. Speaking at the IMF's spring conference, Lagarde said leaders needed to co-operate in their efforts to repair public sector and bank finances to protect against a repeat of the 2008 crash. Osborne is due to meet finance ministers and central bankers at the IMF spring conference after a whistlestop tour of Brazil to promote British business interests. Before his arrival in the US capital he was praised, along with David Cameron, by Jim Yong Kim, the head of the World Bank, for maintaining aid spending during a time of difficult budget cuts. Kim said the prime minister and chancellor were brave to spend 0.7% of GDP on aid, which he said made a huge difference to developing countries starved of private sector funds. The chancellor is keen to go into the next election contrasting his more optimistic outlook with gloomy predictions from Labour that a race for growth will lead to another crash. Larry Summers, the former economic adviser to Barack Obama, famously wrote last year that the west was about to enter a \"secular stagnation\" characterised by a lack of consumer demand that will restrict wages and business investment. He argued that governments need to intervene to educate workers and cope with ageing populations. Osborne will say: \"Proponents of 'secular stagnation' argue that over recent decades monetary policy has had to work harder and harder to sustain growth, and has now reached its limits. Demand can only be sustained with further fiscal stimulus and higher government debt. \"But developments make this argument increasingly difficult to sustain. The evidence increasingly shows that monetary policy, broadly defined and effectively deployed, can work, but with two caveats. Banks need to be well capitalised so that the monetary transmission system is working, and there needs to be credible fiscal policy.\" Osborne will cite job creation in the UK, which has been \"better than anyone expected: three times faster than any previous UK recovery, with more than four new jobs in the private sector for every job lost in the public sector\". However, critics have pointed out that self-employment accounts for a majority of new private sector jobs, and that one of the fastest-growing areas is estate agency. Lagarde's warnings against complacency echoed an IMF report earlier in the week that chastised Brussels for failing to put in place a financial lifeboat capable of rescuing more than a few small banks.

She said global growth could be as much as two percentage points higher over the next five years if the G20 fulfil promises made in Sydney at the last leaders' summit. Lagarde also vented her frustration at persistent delays to the IMF's own reform programme, which was agreed in 2010 to increase representation from developing nations but has yet to be implemented. She described the delay as \"utterly disappointing\" and pledged to press ahead \"to ensure the continued legitimacy, relevance, financial strength, and effectiveness of the Fund\".

      "bodyText": "A second monthly drop in exports is fuelling financial market concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Analysts said they were shaving their growth forecasts for the world's second biggest economy as it emerged that trade would provide much less of a boost than expected in the first quarter of 2014. But China's premier, Li Keqiang, insisted policymakers would not rush into panic measures to stimulate activity despite signs that the annual growth rate in the first three months of the year would be below the government's 7.5% target. \"We will not take, in response to momentary fluctuations in economic growth, short-term and forceful stimulus measures,\" Li said in a speech. \"We will instead focus more on medium- to long-term healthy development.\" Li's comments followed the release of official data showing that exports fell by 6.6% in March, following an 18.1% drop in February. Imports fell by 11.3% \u2013 China's biggest decline in more than a year. Economists were most worried by the fall in imports, which was seen as confirming weakness in manufacturing and consumer demand. Some of the fall in exports was attributed to figures early last year being inflated by fake invoices before a government crackdown around the middle of 2013. \"My bigger concern is imports. It suggests a weakening in China's own economy,\" said Louis Kuijs, economist at RBS in Hong Kong. Prakash Sakpal, economist with ING, said that despite Li's remarks, he expected the Chinese government to introduce measures to ensure growth met its official 7.5% target for 2014. While cutting ING's growth forecast for the first quarter from 7.6% to 7.3%, Sakpal added: \"We are retaining our full-year GDP growth forecast at 7.5% on the view that, as occurred last year, a mini-stimulus will produce a small bounce in growth. However, we consider the risk to our forecast skewed to the downside.\"",

    "webTitle": "Greek bond sale hailed a success after raising \u20ac3bn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece has made a successful return to the financial markets, raising \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.4bn) in its first bond sale in four years. Inside the Greek government, officials are already hailing the bond sale as \"more than a triumph.\" Strong demand has pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on the five-year bonds to just 4.95%, as investors scurry to take part in the debt auction. That's a lower rate of return than expected, which has pleased the Athens government. The sight of a car bomb in Greece overnight did not deter bidders. Bankers in Greece confirmed to our Helena Smith in Athens that the order book hit the \u20ac20bn mark on Thursday morning, making it six-times oversubscribed. One finance ministry insider told the Guardian: \"To great degree this was all about proving that Greece is on the verge of exiting the crisis and in that we have been more than successful.\" Deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos told reporters in Athens that the auction was \"official, triumphant, tangible confirmation of change\" in Greece. \"We haven't just been spared from bankruptcy and catastrophe, we are once again becoming the Greece that we know,\" he told reporters gathered outside the prime minister's office. \"We will regain the quality of life that we had. And all of this has happened with the sacrifices and hard work of the Greek people,\" he added. Greece had initially been expected to raise around \u20ac2bn, before seeing the level of interest in its debt \u2013 unthinkable two years ago when the country appeared to be on the brink of leaving the eurozone. The bond sale is an important step for Greece, establishing that it has regained the trust of the markets. As flagged up earlier, some fund managers believe Greece doesn't really merit a yield below 5% \u2013 as it is still conducting a painful austerity programme, and may possibly need further debt relief this year. Some seasoned eurozone crisis watchers are alarmed. LNG Capital's Gary Jenkins argues that Greece's debt remains unsustainable, at 180% of GDP, but any restructuring will not occur for many years: \"The vast majority of the debt is owed to its European partners and you could argue that the incredibly generous terms of a very low interest rate, a very long maturity (coupled with a holiday repayment which is longer than most loan terms) just reflect the view that the debt still looks unsustainable and that the terms are indicative of a situation that will only be solved at some stage by a further debt restructuring. \"Any such event though is probably years away and thus the most likely outcome for this new bond issue is that it will be repaid long before the EU/ECB/IMF consider what action to take with their loans.\" Irish bond sale also flies Meanwhile Ireland sold \u20ac1bn of 10-year debt as planned on Thursday, bettering the record low yields achieved last month at its first regular auction in four years. Dublin is already fully funded for 2014 and is aiming to raise \u20ac8bn this year to complete pre-funding for 2015, over 70% of which it has already collected from the two auctions and a 10-year issue in January. The speedy progress towards that target continued on Thursday when \u20ac1bn of the 10-year bond was sold at a yield of 2.917%, lower than last month's 2.967%, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said on its website. The auction received 2.8 times more bids than needed to complete the auction. March's debt sale, also of the bond maturing in 2024, was the first auction since September 2010, before Ireland was locked out of bond markets and hurtled towards a European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout after a property crash led to a deep recession and austerity. Ireland has been raising debt periodically for over two years through debt swaps and syndicated issues, a strategy that has been copied by Portugal which hopes to follow Ireland out of its bailout next month.",

And all of this has happened with the sacrifices and hard work of the Greek people,\" he added.</p> <p>Greece had initially been expected to raise around \u20ac2bn, before seeing the level of interest in its debt \u2013 unthinkable two years ago when the country appeared to be on the brink of leaving the eurozone.</p> <p>The bond sale is an important step for Greece, establishing that it has regained the trust of the markets.</p> <p>As flagged up earlier, some fund managers believe Greece doesn't really merit a yield below 5% \u2013 as it is still conducting a painful austerity programme, and may possibly need further debt relief this year.</p> <p>Some seasoned eurozone crisis watchers are alarmed.</p> <p>LNG Capital's Gary Jenkins argues that Greece's debt remains unsustainable, at 180% of GDP, but any restructuring will not occur for many years: \"The vast majority of the debt is owed to its European partners and you could argue that the incredibly generous terms of a very low interest rate, a very long maturity (coupled with a holiday repayment which is longer than most loan terms) just reflect the view that the debt still looks unsustainable and that the terms are indicative of a situation that will only be solved at some stage by a further debt restructuring.</p> <p>\"Any such event though is probably years away and thus the most likely outcome for this new bond issue is that it will be repaid long before the EU/ECB/IMF consider what action to take with their loans.\"</p> <h2>Irish bond sale also flies</h2> <p>Meanwhile Ireland sold \u20ac1bn of 10-year debt as planned on Thursday, bettering the record low yields achieved last month at its first regular auction in four years.</p> <p>Dublin is already fully funded for 2014 and is aiming to raise \u20ac8bn this year to complete pre-funding for 2015, over 70% of which it has already collected from the two auctions and a 10-year issue in January.</p> <p>The speedy progress towards that target continued on Thursday when \u20ac1bn of the 10-year bond was sold at a yield of 2.917%, lower than last month's 2.967%, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said on its website.</p> <p>The auction received 2.8 times more bids than needed to complete the auction.</p> <p>March's debt sale, also of the bond maturing in 2024, was the first auction since September 2010, before Ireland was locked out of bond markets and hurtled towards a European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout after a property crash led to a deep recession and austerity. Ireland has been raising debt periodically for over two years through debt swaps and syndicated issues, a strategy that has been copied by Portugal which hopes to follow Ireland out of its bailout next month.</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "What the Tamiflu saga tells us about drug trials and big pharma", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Today we found out that Tamiflu doesn't work so well after all. Roche, the drug company behind it, withheld vital information on its clinical trials for half a decade, but the Cochrane Collaboration, a global not-for-profit organisation of 14,000 academics, finally obtained all the information. Putting the evidence together, it has found that Tamiflu has little or no impact on complications of flu infection, such as pneumonia. That is a scandal because the UK government spent \u00a30.5bn stockpiling this drug in the hope that it would help prevent serious side-effects from flu infection. But the bigger scandal is that Roche broke no law by withholding vital information on how well its drug works. In fact, the methods and results of clinical trials on the drugs we use today are still routinely and legally being withheld from doctors, researchers and patients. It is simple bad luck for Roche that Tamiflu became, arbitrarily, the poster child for the missing-data story. And it is a great poster child. The battle over Tamiflu perfectly illustrates the need for full transparency around clinical trials, the importance of access to obscure documentation, and the failure of the regulatory system. Crucially, it is also an illustration of how science, at its best, is built on transparency and openness to criticism, because the saga of the Cochrane Tamiflu review began with a simple online comment. In 2009, there was widespread concern about a new flu pandemic, and billions were being spent stockpiling Tamiflu around the world. Because of this, the UK and Australian governments specifically asked the Cochrane Collaboration to update its earlier reviews on the drug. Cochrane reviews are the gold-standard in medicine: they summarise all the data on a given treatment, and they are in a constant review cycle, because evidence changes over time as new trials are published. This should have been a pretty everyday piece of work: the previous review, in 2008, had found some evidence that Tamiflu does, indeed, reduce the rate of complications such as pneumonia. But then a Japanese paediatrician called Keiji Hayashi left a comment that would trigger a revolution in our understanding of how evidence-based medicine should work. This wasn't in a publication, or even a letter: it was a simple online comment, posted informally underneath the Tamiflu review on the Cochrane website, almost like a blog comment. Cochrane had summarised the data from all the trials, explained Hayashi, but its positive conclusion was driven by data from just one of the papers it cited: an industry-funded summary of 10 previous trials, led by an author called Kaiser. From these 10 trials, only two had ever been published in the scientific literature. For the remaining eight, the only available information on the methods used came from the brief summary in this secondary source, created by industry. That's not reliable enough. This is science at its best. The Cochrane review is readily accessible online; it explains transparently the methods by which it looked for trials, and then analysed them, so any informed reader can pull the review apart, and understand where the conclusions came from. Cochrane provides an easy way for readers to raise criticisms. And, crucially, these criticisms did not fall on deaf ears. Dr Tom Jefferson is the head of the Cochrane respiratory group, and the lead author on the 2008 review. He realised immediately that he had made a mistake in blindly trusting the Kaiser data. He said so, without defensiveness, and then set about getting the information needed. First, the Cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the Kaiser paper. By reply, they were told that this team no longer had the files: they should contact Roche. Here the problems began. Roche said it would hand over some information, but the Cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. This was tricky: Cochrane reviews are built around showing their working, but Roche's proposed contract would require them to keep the information behind their reasoning secret from readers. More than this, the contract said they were not allowed to discuss the terms of their secrecy agreement, or publicly acknowledge that it even existed. Roche was demanding a secret contract, with secret terms, requiring secrecy about the methods and results of trials, in a discussion about the safety and efficacy of a drug that has been taken by hundreds of thousands of people around the world, and on which governments had spent billions. Roche's demand, worryingly, is not unusual. At this point, many in medicine would either acquiesce, or give up. Jefferson asked Roche for clarification about why the contract was necessary. He never received a reply. Then, in October 2009, the company changed tack. It would like to hand over the data, it explained, but another academic review on Tamiflu was being conducted elsewhere. Roche had given this other group the study reports, so Cochrane couldn't have them. This was a non-sequitur: there is no reason why many groups should not all work on the same question. In fact, since replication is the cornerstone of good science, this would be actively desirable. Then, one week later, unannounced, Roche sent seven documents, each around a dozen pages long. These contained excerpts of internal company documents on each of the clinical trials in the Kaiser meta-analysis. It was a start, but nothing like the information Cochrane needed to assess the benefits, or the rate of adverse events, or fully to understand the design of the trials. At the same time, it was rapidly becoming clear that there were odd inconsistencies in the information on this drug. Crucially, different organisations around the world had drawn vastly different conclusions about its effectiveness. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it gave no benefits on complications such as pneumonia, while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it did. The Japanese regulator made no claim for complications, but the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said there was a benefit. There are only two explanations for this, and both can only be resolved by full transparency. Either these organisations saw different data, in which case we need to build a collective list, add up all the trials, and work out the effects of the drug overall. Or this is a close call, and there is reasonable disagreement on how to interpret the trials, in which case we need full access to their methods and results, for an informed public debate in the medical academic community. This is particularly important, since there can often be shortcomings in the design of a clinical trial, which mean it is no longer a fair test of which treatment is best. We now know this was the case in many of the Tamiflu trials, where, for example, participants were sometimes very unrepresentative of real-world patients. Similarly, in trials described as \"double blinded\" \u2013 where neither doctor nor patient should be able to tell whether they're getting a placebo or the real drug \u2013 the active and placebo pills were different colours. Even more oddly, in almost all Tamiflu trials, it seems a diagnosis of pneumonia was measured by patients' self-reporting: many researchers would have expected a clear diagnostic algorithm, perhaps a chest x-ray, at least. Since the Cochrane team were still being denied the information needed to spot these flaws, they decided to exclude all this data from their analysis, leaving the review in limbo. It was published in December 2009, with a note explaining their reasoning, and a small flurry of activity followed. Roche posted their brief excerpts online, and committed to make full study reports available. For four years, they then failed to do so. During this period, the global medical academic community began to realise that the brief, published academic papers on trials \u2013 which we have relied on for many years \u2013 can be incomplete, and even misleading. Much more detail is available in a clinical study report (CSR), the intermediate document that stands between the raw data and a journal article: the precise plan for analysing the data statistically, detailed descriptions of adverse events, and so on. By 2009, Roche had shared just small portions of the CSRs, but even this was enough to see there were problems. For example, looking at the two papers out of 10 in the Kaiser review that were published, one said: \"There were no drug-related serious adverse events\", and the other doesn't mention adverse events. But in the CSR documents shared on these same two studies, 10 serious adverse events were listed, of which three are classified as being possibly related to Tamiflu. By setting out all the known trials side by side, the researchers were able to identify peculiar discrepancies: for example, the largest \"phase three\" trial \u2013 one of the large trials that are done to get a drug on to the market \u2013 was never published, and is rarely mentioned in regulatory documents. The chase continued, and it exemplifies the attitude of industry towards transparency. In June 2010, Roche told Cochrane it was sorry, but it had thought they already had what they wanted. In July, it announced that it was worried about patient confidentiality. By now, Roche had been refusing to publish the study reports for a year. Suddenly, it began to raise odd personal concerns. It claimed that some Cochrane researchers had made untrue statements about the drug, and about the company, but refused to say who, or what, or where. \"Certain members of Cochrane Group,\" it said, \"are unlikely to approach the review with the independence that is both necessary and justified.\" This is hard to credit, but even if true, it should be irrelevant: bad science is often published, and is shot down in public, in academic journals, by people with good arguments. This is how science works. No company or researcher should be allowed to choose who has access to trial data. Still Roche refused to hand over the study reports. Then Roche complained that the Cochrane reviewers had begun to copy in journalists, including me, on their emails when responding to Roche staff. At the same time, the company was raising the broken arguments that are eerily familiar to anyone who has followed the campaign for greater trials transparency. Key among these was one that cuts to the core of the culture war between evidence-based medicine, and the older \"eminence-based medicine\" that we are supposed to have left behind. It is simply not the job of academics to make these decisions about benefit and risk, said Roche, it is the job of regulators. This argument fails on two fronts. First, as with many other drugs, it now seems that not even the regulators had seen all the information on all the trials. But more than that, regulators miss things. Many of the most notable problems with medicines over the past few years \u2013 with the arthritis drug Vioxx; with the diabetes drug rosiglitazone, marketed as Avandia; and with the evidence base for Tamiflu \u2013 weren't spotted primarily by regulators, but rather by independent doctors and academics. Regulators don't miss things because they are corrupt, or incompetent. They miss things because detecting signals of risk and benefit in reviews of clinical trials is a difficult business and so, like all difficult questions in science, it benefits from having many eyes on the problem. While the battle for access to Tamiflu trials has gone on, the world of medicine has begun to shift, albeit at a painful pace, with the European Ombudsman and several British select committees joining the push for transparency. The AllTrials campaign, which I co-founded last year, now has the support of almost all medical and academic professional bodies in the UK, and many more worldwide, as well as more than 100 patient groups, and the drug company GSK. We have seen new codes of conduct, and European legislation, proposing improvements in access: all riddled with loopholes, but improvements nonetheless. Crucially, withholding data has become a headline issue, and much less defensible. Last year, in the context of this wider shift, under ceaseless questions from Cochrane and the British Medical Journal, after half a decade, Roche finally gave Cochrane the information it needed. So does Tamiflu work? From the Cochrane analysis \u2013 fully public \u2013 Tamiflu does not reduce the number of hospitalisations. There wasn't enough data to see if it reduces the number of deaths. It does reduce the number of self-reported, unverified cases of pneumonia, but when you look at the five trials with a detailed diagnostic form for pneumonia, there is no significant benefit. It might help prevent flu symptoms, but not asymptomatic spread, and the evidence here is mixed. It will take a few hours off the duration of your flu symptoms. But all this comes at a significant cost of side-effects. Since percentages are hard to visualise, we can make those numbers more tangible by taking the figures from the Cochrane review, and applying them. For example, if a million people take Tamiflu in a pandemic, 45,000 will experience vomiting, 31,000 will experience headache and 11,000 will have psychiatric side-effects. Remember, though, that those figures all assume we are only giving Tamiflu to a million people: if things kick off, we have stockpiled enough for 80% of the population. That's quite a lot of vomit. Roche has issued a press release saying it contests these conclusions, but giving no reasons: so now we can finally let science begin. It can shoot down the details of the Cochrane review \u2013 I hope it will \u2013 and we will edge towards the truth. This is what science looks like. Roche also denies being dragged to transparency, and says it simply didn't know how to respond to Cochrane. This, again, speaks to the pace of change. I have no idea why it was withholding information: but I rather suspect it was simply because that's what people have always done, and sharing it was a hassle, requiring new norms to be developed. That's reassuring and depressing at the same time. Should we have spent half a billion on this drug? That's a tricky question. If you picture yourself in a bunker, watching a catastrophic pandemic unfold, confronting the end of human civilisation, you could probably persuade yourself that Tamiflu might be worth buying anyway, even knowing the risks and benefits. But that final clause is the key. We often choose to use treatments in medicine, knowing that they have limited benefit, and significant side-effects: but we make an informed decision, balancing the risks and benefits for ourselves. And in any case, that \u00a3500m is the tip of the iceberg. Tamiflu is a side show, the one place where a single team of dogged academics said \"enough\" and the company caved in. But the results of clinical trials are still being routinely and legally withheld on the medicines we use today and nothing about a final answer on Tamiflu will help plug this gaping hole. More importantly, for all that there is progress, so far we have only sentiment, and half measures. None of the changes to European legislation or codes of conduct get us access to the information we need, because they all refer only to new trials, so they share a loophole that excludes \u2013 remarkably \u2013 all the trials on all the medicines we use today, and will continue to use for decades. To take one concrete and topical example: they wouldn't have made a blind bit of difference on Tamiflu. We have seen voluntary pledges for greater transparency from many individual companies \u2013 Johnson &amp; Johnson, Roche, GSK, now Roche, and more \u2013 which are welcome, but similar promises have been given before, and then reversed a few years later. This is a pivotal moment in the history of medicine. Trials transparency is finally on the agenda, and this may be our only opportunity to fix it in a decade. We cannot make informed decisions about which treatment is best while information about clinical trials is routinely and legally withheld from doctors, researchers, and patients. Anyone who stands in the way of transparency is exposing patients to avoidable harm. We need regulators, legislators, and professional bodies to demand full transparency. We need clear audit on what information is missing, and who is withholding it. Finally, more than anything \u2013 because culture shift will be as powerful as legislation \u2013 we need to do something even more difficult. We need to praise, encourage, and support the companies and individuals who are beginning to do the right thing. This now includes Roche. And so, paradoxically, after everything you have read above, with the outrage fresh in your mind, on the day when it feels harder than any other, I hope you will join me in saying: Bravo, Roche. Now let's do better. \u2022 Ben Goldacre is a doctor and the author of Bad Pharma.",

Putting the evidence together, it has found that Tamiflu has little or no impact on complications of flu infection, such as pneumonia.</p> <p>That is a scandal because the UK government spent \u00a30.5bn stockpiling this drug in the hope that it would help prevent serious side-effects from flu infection. But the bigger scandal is that Roche broke no law by withholding vital information on how well its drug works.

Because of this, the UK and Australian governments specifically asked the Cochrane Collaboration to update its earlier reviews on the drug. Cochrane reviews are the gold-standard in medicine: they summarise all the data on a given treatment, and they are in a constant review cycle, because evidence changes over time as new trials are published. This should have been a pretty everyday piece of work: the previous review, in 2008, had found some evidence that Tamiflu does, indeed, reduce the rate of complications such&#xa0;as pneumonia.

Photograph: Adrian Bradshaw/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More importantly, for all that there is progress, so far we have only sentiment, and half measures. None of the changes to European legislation or codes of conduct get us access to the information we need, because they all refer only to new trials, so they share a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.alltrials.net/news/carl-heneghan-and-ben-goldare-review-efpia-and-phrma-report/#Ben-Goldacre\" title=\"\">loophole</a> that excludes \u2013 remarkably \u2013 all the trials on all the medicines we use today, and will continue to use for decades. To take one concrete and topical example: they wouldn't have made a blind bit of difference on Tamiflu. We have seen voluntary pledges for greater transparency from many individual companies \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.alltrials.net/2014/johnson-johnson-gives-clinical-trial-data-to-researchers-a-game-changer/\" title=\"\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>, Roche, <a href=\"http://www.alltrials.net/supporters/gsk-statement/\" title=\"\">GSK</a>, now Roche, and more \u2013 which are welcome, but<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1484602/\" title=\"\"> similar promises </a>have been given before, and <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmsctech/104/104vw14.htm\" title=\"\">then reversed a few years later</a>.</p> <p>This is a pivotal moment in the history of medicine. Trials transparency is finally on the agenda, and this may be our only opportunity to fix it in a decade. We cannot make informed decisions about which treatment is best while information about clinical trials is routinely and legally withheld from doctors, researchers, and patients. Anyone who stands in the way of transparency is exposing patients to avoidable harm. We need regulators, legislators, and professional bodies to demand full transparency. We need clear audit on what information is missing, and who is withholding it.</p> <p>Finally, more than anything \u2013 because culture shift will be as powerful as legislation \u2013 we need to do something even more difficult. We need to praise, encourage, and support the companies and individuals who are beginning to do the right thing. This now includes Roche. And so, paradoxically, after everything you have read above, with the outrage fresh in your mind, on the day when it feels harder than any other, I hope you will join me in saying: Bravo, Roche. Now let's do better.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ben Goldacre is a doctor and the author of Bad Pharma.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's property market recorded the highest level of sales in more six years over the first three months of this year \u2013 but the surge came with a health warning from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Surveyors sold an average of 22.7 homes each in the three months to March \u2013 the highest number since February 2008 \u2013 with strength in the market spread throughout the UK, according to the Rics. However, Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist, said that rising prices would put home ownership out of reach for those hoping to get on the ladder unless a shortage of properties was urgently addressed: \"We desperately need more homes in areas where people want to buy and want to live. Until this happens we're likely to see prices to continue to increase and it is going to be ever harder for many first time buyers to conceive of ever owning their own home.\" The number of properties coming on to agents' books fell marginally for a third consecutive month in March. He added: \"Now that the housing market recovery is well and truly underway and mortgage finance is more readily available, buyers seem to be looking to test the market right across the country, not just in the usual hot spots of the south-east.\" The Rics reported a rise in house prices across all regions in March, with 57% more surveyors reporting an increase in prices than a fall. Outside London and the south-east the sharpest rise in prices was in the south-west and the east midlands. The report will refuel concerns that a house price bubble is building in the UK. Last week Nationwide reported an 18% rise in London house prices over the past year, with prices up more than 9% in the rest of the country. Responding to the Rics survey, Labour's shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds, said: \"It is welcome that we are seeing a recovery in house sales but it is clear that home ownership is increasingly unaffordable for many low to middle income families and this government has failed to take the action needed to tackle the cause \u2013 a massive housing shortage. Under this government house building has fallen to its lowest levels in peacetime since the 1920s.\" With no indication that the imbalance between buyer demand and homes on the market is going to change any time soon, surveyors expected house prices to continue to rise into the summer months. They predicted average house prices would rise by about 6% a year over the next five years. The number of buyer enquiries increased across the whole of the UK with the exception of Wales where interest levels were flat.",
