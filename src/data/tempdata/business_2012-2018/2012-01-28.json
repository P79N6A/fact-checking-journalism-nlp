      "bodyText": "Pressure was mounting on David Cameron on Saturday to rein in pay at the Royal Bank of Scotland after it emerged that more top members of staff could be in line for bumper bonuses in the coming weeks. Amid widespread public anger over lavish rewards at the taxpayer-backed bank, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is calling on Cameron to appear before the House of Commons to justify the bonus of almost \u00a31m awarded to RBS's chief executive, Stephen Hester. The row has also divided the coalition. Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott told the Observer: \"Every single Lib Dem I know is against Hester getting a penny of bonus.\" The political row is likely to intensify over the next few weeks as the RBS board decides whether to pay out bonuses to other senior staff members. Finance director Bruce van Saun would be handed 2.25m shares, worth about \u00a3600,500 at the current price, if his 2011 bonus is handled in the same way as that of Hester \u2013 who is getting 60% of his entitlement for 2011. Other senior staff who do not sit on the board are also expecting bonuses for 2011 \u2013 and in addition, waiting to learn how many shares will be paid out from awards they received in 2009. John Hourican, head of RBS's investment bank, could be handed shares worth \u00a34m in April. The precise value will depend on the share price and whether performance criteria have been met. Four bankers were allotted shares in 2009 that will be due after the bank's results next month. One was awarded 6m shares (worth about \u00a31.6m at the current price) and the other three about 1.8m each (\u00a3500,000), though the actual number of shares the bankers receive will be based on performance targets. \"Freezing the pay of a nurse or hospital porter, while allowing a publicly owned bank to pay million pound bonuses, is the last nail in the coffin of this prime minister's claim that we're all in it together,\" Miliband said this weekend. \"Having spent weeks boasting he would block bonuses, David Cameron refuses to even publicly explain why he has changed his mind.\" Labour is calling on UK Financial Investments, the body that manages the government's shareholding in RBS, to register a protest about Hester's bonus at the bank's forthcoming annual general meeting. The prime minister sought to defuse the issue on Saturday, as sources claimed that the business secretary Vince Cable was furious about the government's failure to block it. Speaking from his Chequers country retreat, Cameron said: \"The government has made its views known and that's why his bonus was cut in half compared with last year. But we do have to bear in mind that the alternatives to what's happening now could be even more expensive if you had a whole new team coming into RBS.\" Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman, was awarded 5.2m shares when he joined in 2009, which he was due to receive next month, subject to performance criteria. It is thought that those were not met, although Hampton had already decided to ask the board not to consider releasing the award to him. The fresh controversy at the taxpayer-backed bank erupted as a new survey reveals widespread public scepticism about whether Britain's bosses are worth their bumper pay packages. Just 7% of more than 2,000 people questioned by pollsters ICM for the High Pay Centre, an independent inquiry set up by the Compass thinktank, thought that top executives should earn more than \u00a31m, including bonuses and pension contributions. Only 1% thought they should earn more than \u00a34m, the average level for FTSE100 bosses. Deborah Hargreaves, the centre's chair, said: \"Our polling shows the public do not believe executives, even of the biggest companies, should be awarded multimillion pound pay packages. It is time for boardrooms to wake up to what is fair and act now to rebuild public trust.\" The timing of the RBS row is particularly unfortunate for David Cameron, who made a high-profile speech earlier this month calling for \"responsible capitalism\", and is planning to introduce rules to increase shareholders' control over boardroom pay.",

      "bodyText": "Plans to commit \u20ac22bn to tackling the scourge of youth unemployment across Europe will be considered by EU leaders on Monday as international pressure mounts for action to help young people chart a way through the deepening economic crisis. The difficulties of young people leaving school for a world that offers ever more limited job opportunities were highlighted last week when youth unemployment in Spain reached 51.4% among those aged 16 to 24. The issue was high on the agenda at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Saturday where politicians, economists and bankers said action was essential to stimulate demand and prevent a generation becoming strangers to work. Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said youth joblessness was not just a problem for the west, but was also evident in emerging economies, in many of which the proportion of young workers was rising. \"If people don't get the right start it can affect them their whole lives. It is not enough to muddle through. It is not enough to do a fiscal fix.\" Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, held private talks in Davos with union leaders to discuss unemployment. She said on Saturday it was vital to kickstart growth in the eurozone. \"Growth is critical for many reasons \u2013 for the jobs issue, for fiscal consolidation and to encourage value creation.\" At Monday's EU summit in Brussels \u2013 likely to be dominated by attempts to safeguard the euro's future and to control spending by eurozone members \u2013 EU leaders, including David Cameron, will discuss a plan to guarantee all young people either work, training or further education within four months of leaving school. A draft conclusion of the summit, likely to be agreed by all 27 heads of state and government, states: \"The objective should be that within four months of leaving school young people receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship.\" EU sources said \u20ac22bn of as yet unspent money in the EU's social fund could be provided. The commission would work with member states to draw up \"country specific\" programmes on how to address the problems and use the funds. While the plans would not be legally binding, as the EU has no power to enforce such schemes, a unanimous agreement would place countries under strong peer pressure to deliver results. Demands for more to be done on jobs highlight the tension between the EU's demands for austerity in the eurozone and the desire of many in Europe to kickstart flagging national economies with extra spending. As Spain's unemployment figure rose above 5 million last week, the new government of Mariano Rajoy called on Brussels to ease the country's deficit targets. Its 51.4% youth unemployment level means that for the first time in a modern European country the majority of young people are out of work. In Greece the figure is 46.6% and in Portugal it is 30.7%. In November youth unemployment in Britain passed 1 million for the first time in 15 years, equivalent to 22% of those aged 16 to 24. On Saturday chancellor George Osborne and Labour leader Ed Miliband joined the leaders of the World Bank and the IMF in urging action to create jobs amid warnings that youth unemployment was a timebomb under the global economy. Peter Mandelson, business secretary in the last Labour government, said: \"I've not been in a meeting or speech where the subject didn't come up. Why? People recognise that it is a massive waste of resource, a ticking timebomb and a loss of consumer demand. It is one of the most important issues this year.\" Osborne, who is under pressure to announce job creating measures in his March budget, said on Saturday in Davos: \"It is incredibly important. We are doing everything we can to increase the capacity of the economy and make sure young people have the skills they need. It is a question of demand and supply. You can't just look at one of them.\" Miliband agreed with Osborne about the importance of tackling the issue, highlighted by the International Labour Organisation last week when it said there would be a need to create 600m jobs worldwide over the next decade. \"It is a massive issue,\" said Miliband, lambasting the government for its inaction. \"That's why we are calling for a tax on bonuses and want to use the money to get people to work. The government has been hopeless and allowed youth unemployment to rise.\"",
