      "bodyText": "The warships have been replaced by spreadsheets. Back in 1850, Greece knew it was in trouble when the Royal Navy arrived at Piraeus. This time, the pressure comes from banks, hedge funds and the team of officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the EU, who will take up residence at one of the swankier hotels in Athens. For students of history, what is happening in Greece this week has echoes of the Don Pacifico affair, the classic case of British gunboat diplomacy in the mid-19th century. David Pacifico was a Portuguese Jew who had never set foot in Britain but had British citizenship by virtue of being born in Gibraltar. He became the Portuguese consul in Athens, where his house was burned down by an antisemitic mob. After unsuccessfully appealing to the Greek government for compensation, he asked Britain for help, and his case was taken up, with gusto, by the foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston. A naval squadron was sent to the Aegean, Greek ships were seized and Piraeus, Athens' port, was blockaded. Don Pacifico got his compensation. Greece's modern-day international creditors will not be so successful with their power play and are reconciled to writing off some of the money they are owed. A three-way game of bluff is currently in progress between the Greek government, the hedge funds and bankers, and the troika (the IMF, the ECB and the EU). The troika is seeking to put pressure on Athens and the creditors to agree to a deal that would result, eventually, in Greece's national debt falling from 180% to 120% of national output. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, is warning both sides that they have much to lose if the talks, which broke up on Friday without agreement, collapse. The Greek government will not get the next tranche of its bailout and will be unable to pay its bills within a couple of months. That would almost certainly trigger a debt default in Greece, with knock-on effects across the rest of the eurozone. The creditors are being told that it will be a pyrrhic victory if turning the screw too tightly on Greece deepens the crisis in Italy and Spain. The Greek government, for its part, is aware that it could hold the fate of the entire eurozone (and perhaps even the global economy) in its hands. Greece is a small country with a history of economic mismanagement, so there is no real reason why its problems should spread. Then again, Lehman Brothers was a small investment bank with a history of mismanagement, and there was no real reason why its problems should have spread either. Banks and hedge funds are playing hardball because they know that Athens needs the debt writedown and that the troika is desperate to avoid a Greek default. It is international finance's version of Sartre's Huis Clos, a vision of hell where three people who loathe each other are stuck in a room for eternity. Despite the current hiatus, some sort of deal still looks likely. It will be a fudge, with the Greeks getting some debt relief but not enough to make a real difference to their economy. Old bonds will be exchanged for new bonds, but according to Professor Costas Lapavitsas at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, the new debt will be made subject to British law so the Greek parliament cannot change that the payment terms. \"There is rising despair in Athens,\" Lapavitsas says. \"There is sullen anger and a lot of fear. The mix is combustible.\" The troika arrives in Athens on Tuesday and is expected to try to bang heads together when the debt talks restart on Wednesday. In reality, though, the best that can be achieved is to prolong the agony by buying Greece a little more time. Unemployment is above 18%, private and public investment is collapsing, exports are weak and consumers are hoarding what little money they have. Greece needs far deeper debt relief than what is on the table if it is to have even the remotest chance of a sustained recovery both in its economy and its public finances. Greece's lesson for policymakers across the world is simple: you can't cut your way back to prosperity. A country's debt to GDP ratio is made up of two parts, national debt and the size of the economy. If you make the economy smaller (and Greece's economy has shrunk by more than 15%), it is terribly hard to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, even if you raise taxes and slash spending. Belatedly, perhaps, this was the message from Standard &amp; Poor's last week when it downgraded nine eurozone countries. S&amp;P said it was a mistake to blame fiscal profligacy alone for the monetary union's crisis and noted, quite correctly, \"divergences\" in economic performance between peripheral eurozone countries and those at its core. It then added: \"A reform process based on a pillar of fiscal austerity alone risks becoming self-defeating, as domestic demand falls in line with consumers' rising concerns about job security and disposable incomes, eroding national tax revenues.\" It is worth thinking through what the consequences of this are likely to be. First, Greece will test policymakers' ability to rethink an approach hitherto dominated by austerity. At the moment, it looks as if the test will be failed. Second, there will be further downgrades during the course of in 2012 as the eurozone economy contracts. S&amp;P could hardly have been more explicit about the \"self-defeating\" nature of what is happening. Fresh downgrades will push up the cost of borrowing, making recovery even more difficult. Third, the credit-rating agencies face a backlash, which in this case is completely unjustified. S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch were legitimately criticised for giving AAA ratings to the US sub-prime mortgage market, but they are quite right to point out the deteriorating state of public finances in the eurozone. Fourth, the ECB will be ever more active in an attempt to buy the eurozone some time. It may prove sporadically successful in doing that but the single currency's structural problems will continue to surface. Fifth, those who favour the teachings of the \"Austrian school\" may be right when they say that the debt crisis will only be ended by a purging of the rottenness from the system, but they should be explicit about what this means: a break-up of the single currency. The strains will simply be too great for the weaker members. Finally, the warning from S&amp;P has implications for countries outside the eurozone. It will be interesting to see whether Britain remains the poster child for the ratings agencies, because at best the economy will stagnate this winter and a double-dip recession is a very real threat.",

After unsuccessfully appealing to the Greek government for compensation, he asked Britain for help, and his case was taken up, with gusto, by the foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston.

      "bodyText": "A lone electrician is pressing ahead with a multibillion-pound legal claim against BP with a hearing in Siberia. Andrey Prokhorov, a tiny shareholder in BP's Russian joint venture TNK-BP, is fronting a minority shareholder action following the UK-listed firm's failed efforts to sign a separate Russian partnership with the state oil group Rosneft last year. In two cases that currently total around R500bn (\u00a310bn) Prokhorov is claiming that BP damaged TNK-BP \u2013 which is jointly owned by the British-based oil group and a collection of Russian billionaires \u2013 by preventing it from participating in the proposed Arctic alliance with Rosneft. That deal collapsed last year, causing huge embarrassment to BP, when the Russian billionaires fought their own successful legal action against their British partners to block the deal. Both of Prokhorov's two claims have already been rejected by the Russian courts, but in an appeal hearing in the appellate court in Omsk, Siberia, the minority shareholder will seek to invalidate a resolution by the TNK-BP board not to join a class action against the TNK-BP directors nominated by BP, who Prokhorov says must have known about BP's Rosneft intentions. The electrical engineer is believed to own 0.0000106% of TNK-BP, which his lawyers Liniya Prava say he acquired when the forerunner to TNK-BP was privatised by the Russian government.

      "body": "<p>Sir Robert Horton, who has died aged 72, was an energetic, outspoken and ambitious business manager whose successful industrial career took him to the chairmanship of two major British institutions: BP and Railtrack. He left both in disarray.</p> <p>He won his reputation as an effective troubleshooter at BP, where he reorganised loss-making businesses. But his time as chairman ended after just two years when the oil price slumped and his management reorganisation floundered as he alienated colleagues. In his ascent at BP, few had any doubts that his sights were set on the top job, and he behaved accordingly. He conceded that \"the two words people used about me were arrogant and abrasive. I don't think that I am. I tend to say what I think and I don't intend to disguise it.\"</p> <p>However, his colleagues were less than impressed when he told Forbes magazine: \"Because I am blessed by my good brain, I tend to get the answer rather quicker and more often than most people. That will sound frightfully arrogant.\" Nonetheless, those of us who interviewed him found him accessible and almost touchingly frank at a time when businessmen were notoriously unavailable.</p> <p>Born in London, he was the son of William and Dorothy Horton. The family had a timber business, but Horton, impressed by the possibilities of oil in the years following the Suez crisis, took BP sponsorship to read engineering at St Andrews University. He flirted with politics, chairing the Unionist Society and debating with opponents who included the future Labour party leader John Smith. But Horton's divided ambitions, to be either prime minister or chairman of BP, were resolved by his wife, Sally Wells, a maths teacher, whom he married in 1962. She told him she could not stand a political career.</p> <p>Horton's abilities were recognised in BP and, in 1975, he was given the job of sorting out its tanker fleet, in trouble because of overbuilding during the oil slump and the increase in directly piped North Sea oil. Horton cut almost two-thirds of the ships.</p> <p>Next came chemicals. In 1980 he was appointed chief executive and concentrated on products in which BP had a technical edge and sites that benefited from cheap North Sea oil. Thousands of jobs went, and he gained the nickname, which he hated, of \"Hatchet\" Horton.</p> <p>This reputation preceded him when, in 1986, he was sent across the Atlantic to chair Standard Oil of Ohio, BP's problematic US subsidiary, based in Cleveland. It was a difficult start, since BP, with 55% of the equity, had just sacked its American bosses. The company, nicknamed \"the mistake on the lake\", was losing money after unsuccessful exploration and expensive diversification. Horton unexpectedly succeeded in charming Cleveland, investing in regeneration projects, refusing to move the company's headquarters and being held up to the mayor as the example for other foreign companies. It was his most successful period. He believed the Americans appreciated his direct style. As the company became profitable, BP bought out what was now the US's largest oil producer.</p> <p>Returning to London in 1988, widely seen as heir apparent, he was appointed chairman in 1990. By now the company had been changed for ever, by effectively a privatisation \u2013 the sale of the government's 32% share in 1987. Traditionally BP had been almost a branch of the civil service with its bureaucracy and stately ways of proceeding. Horton initiated \"Project 1990\" to make BP \"the most successful oil company in the world\".</p> <p>Managers attended empowerment workshops; the company promised to listen; new performance appraisals allowed employees to suggest to managers what to do. The headquarters was reduced from 2,000 people to 350. Management layers were flattened.

The French leader had made it a point of pride that only he was capable of preserving France's credit status and is said to have remarked in a recent meeting of ministers: \"If the rating goes, I'm dead.\" But as he summoned ministers to a crisis meeting, the message seemed to be: \"Keep calm, carry on \u2026 and create a diversion\". It was not the French economy that was to blame, said Sarkozy's chief adviser, Henri Guaino, but \"the responsibility of all those players in the eurozone\".</p> <p>Sarkozy is between an economic rock and a political hard place. He is already committed to bringing down France's public spending to within the 3% limit imposed by the European Union by 2013. The government has already voted in a series of austerity measures, including savings of \u20ac65bn by 2016, announced in November, on top of a \u20ac12bn deficit reduction package announced in August.</p> <p>The government has said it needs to make savings of \u20ac100bn-plus to balance France's budget by 2016. All this at a time when the country is gearing up for elections, unemployment is at a 12-year high and the economy has virtually ground to a halt \u2013 and, to pile on the agony, when growth is expected to be considerably lower than the 2% forecast.</p> <p>Although his finance minister Fran\u00e7ois Baroin pledged on Friday night that there would be no more \"austerity measures\", only a fool, or someone who expected to be out of office later this year, would promise otherwise.</p> <p>Political rivals rushed to put the boot in, from Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who said it was the Sarkozy government that had been downgraded, to the far-right Front National, which said it was the beginning of the end for the euro and the shattering of the \"myth of a president who protects\".</p> <p>The French enjoy a high standard of living, and generous social and employment benefits. Its strengths are carmaking, aerospace, railways, cosmetics, nuclear power, insurance and pharmaceuticals. It is also the world's number one tourist destination. About 25% of the workforce is in the public sector and, until now, largely cushioned from the economic downturn.</p> <p>In the three-decade period between 1945 and 1975, known as <em>les trente glorieuses</em> (\"the glorious thirty\"), the French economy grew much faster than that of the UK or US, through a series of government four-year plans. Political leaders of all colours supported nationalisation of whole industries, including banking and pharmaceuticals, and state intervention. But France began privatising under Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in the late 1980s and carried on until well into the centre-right presidency of Jacques Chirac, who was replaced by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007, though the state remains a major shareholder in key utility companies.</p> <p>Its infrastructure, healthcare and social services, the envy of many European neighbours, however, have proved a black hole for the country's finances. To fund them, taxes, particularly on French businesses, are high \u2013 which has led the corporate sector to outsource employment to low-wage countries where the same levels of job protection are unheard of.</p> <p>Paradoxically, France's productivity levels are rated consistently higher per hour than for workers in the UK and the US, but economists say this is because a far smaller proportion of the French population is in full-time work. Students begin their working lives later and a large number of people retire in their mid-50s.</p> <p>Though France was able to ride out the 2008 recession better than many other European Union economies because of its large government sector, this has made recovery sluggish.</p> <p>In a report entitled 'Doing Business 2012\" in Europe, the World Bank rated France 29th in terms of ease of doing business, compared with the US, which ranked 4th, Norway, 6th, Britain, 7th, Ireland, 10th, Sweden, 14th, and Germany, 19th.</p> <p>When France was warned last year that its credit rating was threatened, Sarkozy's response was a variation on his 2007 election theme: \"Work more to earn more\". The French, he added, had to be more like the Germans.</p> <p>But the downgrade has exposed the mirage of balance in the Franco-German relationship that Sarkozy and German chancellor Angela Merkel \u2013 known together as \"Merkozy\" \u2014 have been keen to promote as the core of Europe.</p> <p>\"We need the French or else this will be seen as Germany bossing everyone else,\" said a German official before one of many crisis summits, in Paris in December.</p> <p>Now it will certainly be harder for France \u2013 and Sarkozy \u2013 to offer other European partners lessons in good housekeeping.</p>",

Although his finance minister Fran\u00e7ois Baroin pledged on Friday night that there would be no more \"austerity measures\", only a fool, or someone who expected to be out of office later this year, would promise otherwise. Political rivals rushed to put the boot in, from Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who said it was the Sarkozy government that had been downgraded, to the far-right Front National, which said it was the beginning of the end for the euro and the shattering of the \"myth of a president who protects\". The French enjoy a high standard of living, and generous social and employment benefits. Its strengths are carmaking, aerospace, railways, cosmetics, nuclear power, insurance and pharmaceuticals. It is also the world's number one tourist destination. About 25% of the workforce is in the public sector and, until now, largely cushioned from the economic downturn. In the three-decade period between 1945 and 1975, known as les trente glorieuses (\"the glorious thirty\"), the French economy grew much faster than that of the UK or US, through a series of government four-year plans. Political leaders of all colours supported nationalisation of whole industries, including banking and pharmaceuticals, and state intervention. But France began privatising under Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in the late 1980s and carried on until well into the centre-right presidency of Jacques Chirac, who was replaced by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007, though the state remains a major shareholder in key utility companies. Its infrastructure, healthcare and social services, the envy of many European neighbours, however, have proved a black hole for the country's finances. To fund them, taxes, particularly on French businesses, are high \u2013 which has led the corporate sector to outsource employment to low-wage countries where the same levels of job protection are unheard of. Paradoxically, France's productivity levels are rated consistently higher per hour than for workers in the UK and the US, but economists say this is because a far smaller proportion of the French population is in full-time work. Students begin their working lives later and a large number of people retire in their mid-50s. Though France was able to ride out the 2008 recession better than many other European Union economies because of its large government sector, this has made recovery sluggish. In a report entitled 'Doing Business 2012\" in Europe, the World Bank rated France 29th in terms of ease of doing business, compared with the US, which ranked 4th, Norway, 6th, Britain, 7th, Ireland, 10th, Sweden, 14th, and Germany, 19th. When France was warned last year that its credit rating was threatened, Sarkozy's response was a variation on his 2007 election theme: \"Work more to earn more\". The French, he added, had to be more like the Germans. But the downgrade has exposed the mirage of balance in the Franco-German relationship that Sarkozy and German chancellor Angela Merkel \u2013 known together as \"Merkozy\" \u2014 have been keen to promote as the core of Europe. \"We need the French or else this will be seen as Germany bossing everyone else,\" said a German official before one of many crisis summits, in Paris in December. Now it will certainly be harder for France \u2013 and Sarkozy \u2013 to offer other European partners lessons in good housekeeping.",

The most high-profile casualties were France and Austria, which lost their prized AAA ratings \u2013 the top grade, held by only 14 countries worldwide, among them the UK. Sharp downgrades to Cyprus and Portugal left them with \"junk\" ratings on their debt \u2013 ranking them as very risky investments.</p> <p>A handful of countries escaped Friday the 13th unscathed, notably Germany, which S&amp;P said had a track record of \"prudent fiscal policies and expenditure discipline\".</p> <h2><strong>What is S&amp;P worried about?</strong><br></h2> <p>Essentially, it thinks eurozone policymakers have not done enough to resolve the region's \"broadening and deepening financial crisis\". It criticised the latest talks as failing to come up with \"a breakthrough of sufficient size and scope to fully address the eurozone's financial problems\".</p> <p>Importantly, S&amp;P stresses that governments have been wrong to focus on austerity measures alone because these can become \"self-defeating\". It warns the ensuing worries about jobs and household incomes would damage domestic demand and consequently national tax revenues.</p> <h2><strong>How vulnerable is the UK to a downgrade?</strong></h2> <p>For now, Britain retains its AAA rating, but policymakers in France and Germany are already pointing the finger at the UK, saying its relatively high debt and flagging growth make it equally, if not more, deserving of a downgrade.</p> <p>But economic indicators and debt levels are not the only factors ratings agencies take into account. In making the call on how likely a country is to be able to repay its debts, whether a country is in the euro or not plays a big role. Unlike eurozone members, Britain should not be forced to bail out struggling European nations, and, more importantly, it still has monetary autonomy \u2013 the Bank of England can (and has) start printing money to shore up the economy. Finally, ratings agencies look at how soon, and at what rate, countries must repay their debts. France has to come up with around \u00a3100bn this year, but the UK has to find only around half that.</p> <h2><strong>What difference do the downgrades make?</strong></h2> <p>For those downgraded, the cuts are likely to result in higher interest being demanded when countries want to borrow. Governments need to auction bonds to pay for state spending and to cover the cost of repaying older bonds that are maturing (known as \"rolling over\" debt). Auctions from crisis-stricken Spain and Italy last week enjoyed a significant fall in rates, but those are likely to go up again now. In Italy, the cost of borrowing keeps pushing through the 7% barrier, which is regarded as unsustainably high. When a country cannot afford even to service its debts, it becomes increasingly likely to require a bailout.</p> <h2><strong>Does this make bailouts harder to fund?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. The eurozone's rescue fund, the European financial stability facility (EFSF), uses guarantees from its member countries to raise funds in financial markets. If those backer countries are seen as less creditworthy, so is the fund \u2013 and it could well be downgraded too. That will make it more difficult and more expensive to raise money from financial markets and other countries outside the eurozone. The fund has already committed large sums to Greece, Ireland and Portugal and will need to raise more money should Italy and Spain need the same kind of help.</p> <h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2> <p>S&amp;P has given nearly all the countries it downgraded a \"negative outlook\", meaning there is a one in three chance of a further cut in 2012 or 2013.

There are worries, for example, that rising borrowing costs for Italy mean it will sooner or later need to apply for help from the EFSF. If it does \u2013 and drops out of the fund as a backer \u2013 there are serious implications for key guarantors Germany and France. Their obligations to the rescue fund would rise \u2013 and put fresh pressure on their credit ratings.</p> <p>\u2022 The following correction was published on 5 February 2012:<br>\"Downgrades, debt and junk: key questions about the eurozone crisis answered\" (Business), said: \"The [Eurozone financial stability facility] fund has already committed large sums to Greece, Ireland and Portugal and will need to raise more money should Italy and Spain need the same kind of help.\" However, the \u20ac110bn bailout to Greece of 2010 was not part of the EFSF guarantees and not managed by the EFSF.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Politicians are past masters at stealing other people's clothes. Having attacked the economic policies of the 1945-51 Attlee governments all the way to the finishing post, the Conservatives duly accepted most of the postwar settlement: the Economist coined the term \"Butskellism\" to describe the similarity between the policies of Attlee's chancellor Hugh Gaitskell in 1950-51 and the Conservative \"Rab\" Butler, chancellor 1951-55. Now, hey presto, the present Labour leader Ed Miliband finds that the prime minister, having ripped his party conference speech apart at the time, has suddenly decided that there is something to be said for those who have revived Ted Heath's jibe about \"the unacceptable face of capitalism\": indeed, David Cameron is bending over backwards to share Miliband's concerns about \"predatory capitalism\". What this adds up to in practice is quite another matter. How a prime minister and chancellor can have allowed a state-controlled bank, RBS, even to contemplate giving its chief executive, Stephen Hester, a bonus, let alone one of \u00a32m, is beyond me. This is at a time when a number of readers complain that the season of goodwill has to come to a swift end and their small businesses are being faced with requests to cut their overdrafts in half, or even eliminate them entirely \u2013 overdrafts which are the lifeblood of the small business sector so beloved of the Conservative party. Meanwhile, large businesses sit on their cash, and those that could borrow vast sums at negligible rates of interest are so put off by the atmosphere of austerity that they prefer to reserve their options. The unfortunate truth is that George Osborne made a huge strategic mistake when he opted for \"Plan A\". Plan A was a programme of planned penury first, to eliminate the so-called \"structural\" deficit (which nobody really knows how to calculate precisely), to be succeeded by a rip-roaring season of tax cuts leading to victory in 2015. Osborne was mesmerised by a rose-tinted view of the history of the first Thatcher government (1979-83), ignoring the fact that until the Falklands war Margaret Thatcher, or Meryl Streep as she is known to the younger generation, was the most unpopular prime minister since records began. The essence of the chancellor's error is that, at a time when there are enough economic problems both at home and abroad, he has further sapped the confidence of consumers, and this has inevitably worked through to the confidence of investors and producers. Now, I stress that I am referring to the big picture. There are of course many examples of firms doing well; but it is the totality that matters for the health of the economy in general and employment in particular. A specific example is the revival of the British motor industry. (Sorry, did I say \"British\"? It is almost entirely foreign-owned, as is much of the rest of industry and the City of London itself. It always amuses me when the Eurosceptics go on about \"Brussels\" and sovereignty, when a large part of our sovereignty is, well, not sovereign.) The motor industry has been assisted by a more competitive pound. A vast proportion of its production is for export, to \"emerging markets\", and especially to what is known in the trade as the luxury end of the market. Nothing wrong with that: the problem is that there is not enough demand at home. And the same applies to most of the eurozone. Indeed, it now looks as though Germany itself, for so long the main beneficiary of the structure of the eurozone, has been hoist by its own petard. That is to say, the austerity on which the Germans have been insisting as \"conditionality\" for propping up the usual suspects has had such a dramatic impact that in the fourth quarter of 2011, Germany itself was hit by the general slowdown which is partly a consequence of its policies. Now, my more optimistic Brussels contacts assure me that the message is getting through, and that there is a burgeoning emphasis on the need for a positive growth strategy for the eurozone. Unfortunately, so far such elements of a growth strategy as have emerged appear to be of the long-term \"structural\" variety \u2013 such as \"freeing up the labour market\", Thatcher-style. I am not sure, as I look around, that the social effects of the flexible labour market have been quite as beneficent as claimed. But the main point is that even the most welcome reforms do not address the present crisis, which is a shortage of aggregate demand, and one that is likely to get worse, whether or not the eurozone implodes. During the decades of fairly rapid postwar growth, when entrepreneurs and executives were confident of the commitment of governments to full employment, and the case for \"Keynesian\" intervention was widely accepted, in most years the UK budget was actually in surplus or balance. Austerity was necessary after the war because there was a severe shortage of resources. We have plenty of resources now, but they are not fully employed. We need a complete rethink of the approach to economic policy. My old friend Alex Salmond is much in the news over the future of Scotland. As the first minister observed in Wednesday's Financial Times, \"If there is one thing markets abhor more than too much debt, it is too little growth.\" It is a pity that Salmond cannot be in our coalition cabinet. He is a great Keynesian and has been operating \"Plan B\" in Scotland, but he is hampered by the absence of Plan B in his larger neighbour. Still, one cannot help wondering what the ultimate objective really is. The SNP must be the only independence movement in history to demand freedom \u2013 but not yet \u2026",

      "standfirst": "We only need to look back a few years to find a chain facing problems of the kind now confronting Philip Clarke at Tesco", 
      "body": "<p>Does this ring a bell? Retailer smashes UK profit records, boosted by expansion overseas and years of unbroken success. Its grammar-school-educated chief executive is hailed as the finest shopkeeper of his generation and awarded a knighthood. After more than a decade of leadership, our hero bows out in glory. One of his lieutenants is promoted amid rumblings of discontent among rivals.</p> <p>Within months, the company issues a profits warning, the first anybody can remember. The shares plunge and the new boss says mistakes were made in Christmas trading. The company is soon exposed as under-invested: its stores are seen as shabby, its products mediocre and its service indifferent.</p> <p>Yes: it's Marks &amp; Spencer, just before the turn of the century. M&amp;S profits peaked at \u00a31.2bn in 1998 and few anticipated the chaos that followed Sir Richard Greenbury's departure the next year. Is Tesco next? Will the later years of Sir Terry Leahy's long reign now be reassessed as the period in which Tesco lost its touch? Will the story of the M&amp;S decline \u2013 years of boardroom infighting and strategic stumbles \u2013 be echoed in Cheshunt?</p> <p>It's impossible to know, of course. Today it still seems absurd to think that Tesco could be knocked off its perch as comprehensively as M&amp;S was. But, remember, at the time, M&amp;S's difficulties were also presented as surmountable. In that famous profit warning in January 1999, Peter Salsbury, Greenbury's hapless successor, blamed over-ordering of stock before Christmas.

      "bodyText": "Does this ring a bell? Retailer smashes UK profit records, boosted by expansion overseas and years of unbroken success. Its grammar-school-educated chief executive is hailed as the finest shopkeeper of his generation and awarded a knighthood. After more than a decade of leadership, our hero bows out in glory. One of his lieutenants is promoted amid rumblings of discontent among rivals. Within months, the company issues a profits warning, the first anybody can remember. The shares plunge and the new boss says mistakes were made in Christmas trading. The company is soon exposed as under-invested: its stores are seen as shabby, its products mediocre and its service indifferent. Yes: it's Marks &amp; Spencer, just before the turn of the century. M&amp;S profits peaked at \u00a31.2bn in 1998 and few anticipated the chaos that followed Sir Richard Greenbury's departure the next year. Is Tesco next? Will the later years of Sir Terry Leahy's long reign now be reassessed as the period in which Tesco lost its touch? Will the story of the M&amp;S decline \u2013 years of boardroom infighting and strategic stumbles \u2013 be echoed in Cheshunt? It's impossible to know, of course. Today it still seems absurd to think that Tesco could be knocked off its perch as comprehensively as M&amp;S was. But, remember, at the time, M&amp;S's difficulties were also presented as surmountable. In that famous profit warning in January 1999, Peter Salsbury, Greenbury's hapless successor, blamed over-ordering of stock before Christmas. Philip Clarke, Leahy's successor at Tesco, also pointed out a tactical mistake last week \u2013 a failure to react to rivals' discount coupons. There is, however, one big difference between Salsbury and Clarke: the Tesco man is being explicit about its \"longstanding business issues\", as he described them. Quality, range and service needed to be improved, he said. On the principle that recognition of a problem is the first step towards a cure, Clarke is ahead of the plot.
