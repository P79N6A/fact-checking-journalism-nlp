Booker, which supplies thousands of convenience stores including the Londis, Budgens and Premier chains, as well as restaurant chains including Wagamama and Carluccio\u2019s, is limiting beer and soft drinks purchases to 10 cases per customer and cider to five cases. A spokesperson for the wholesaler, which was recently bought by Tesco, said: \u201cDue to the international shortage of CO2, we are experiencing some supply issues on soft drinks and beer. \u201cWe are currently working hard with our suppliers to minimise the impact for our customers and to optimise availability with the stock that is available. Therefore, we cannot comment further at this stage.\u201d The rationing is the latest sign of shortages caused by high summer demand for fizzy drinks and beer, coupled with maintenance shutdowns at ammonia and bioethanol plants across Europe, which are the key sources of CO2. Suppliers of chicken, pork and bagged salad have also been affected, while Ocado and Morrisons home deliveries of frozen food have been hit because of a shortage of dry ice, another form of CO2. Supplies of Heineken\u2019s John Smith\u2019s Extra Smooth and Amstel kegs have already been hit. The brewer said: \u201cLike many other businesses in the food and drinks industry, we are affected by this shortage. \u201cWe continue to work hard to resolve this issue as quickly as possible within our European supply base, and are working with customers to minimise disruption to their business.\u201d Coca-Cola has also said that it has \u201ctemporarily paused\u201d some production because of the shortage of gas. Retailers said they were also seeing some shortages of supplies of Pepsi and had expected difficulties with other beverages supplied by Britvic including 7Up, Tango and Mountain Dew by next week. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: \u201cThe shortfall in the availability of CO2 across Europe continues to impact beer producers in the UK, as well as the farming and food manufacturing sectors. \u201cWe have recommended our members to continue to liaise with their providers directly where they have concerns over supply, but are monitoring the situation carefully. \u201cWe continue to engage with the government on the issue and call for their assistance; such as increasing storage capacity for CO2 in the UK, to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d Poultry and pork producers, who use CO2 in the slaughtering process, have been among the worst affected. Production at Scotland\u2019s largest pig abattoir was expected to cease on Tuesday afternoon, according to trade journal the Grocer, and industry sources said at least two more UK pork processing plants were close to running out of CO2. Supplies of chicken are continuing but have slowed as producers, including the UK\u2019s biggest poultry supplier 2 Sisters, switch to using electrical water baths to stun birds ahead of slaughter. Richard Griffiths, head of the The British Poultry Council, said: \u201cWe are keeping going at the moment with a slightly different way of doing things.\u201d Retailers said supplies were being maintained but that a large amount of chicken available in shops now had only a two-day shelf life rather than the usual week, because the production process has been slowed down. \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 27 June 2018 because an earlier version misspelled Booker as Brooker.",

The contrast could not be greater between the document\u2019s happy picture of industry and government working in harmony and today\u2019s reality of falling investment and large employers pleading with ministers to take seriously their worries over the impact of Brexit on their supply chains. \u201cFor decades, the UK\u2019s automotive industry has powered our economy forward,\u201d the government\u2019s document declared cheerfully. \u201cToday, automotive firms from around the world choose to set up shop here, citing our history of excellence, skilled workforce and world-leading supply chains.\u201d As for the future of those world-leading supply chains, one aim of the industrial strategy was to boost the value of UK components in UK-produced cars from 44% to 50% by 2022. Fair enough, fine ambition. But the document was also clear that smooth access to suppliers in the EU would continue to be critical. It talked about \u201ca new relationship that is free from tariffs and without friction to trade \u2013 factors that are fundamental to the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector\u201d. In the circumstances, the idea that BMW and others should shut up and support the UK prime minister, as health secretary Jeremy Hunt seems to believe, is absurd. If the government itself says frictionless trade with the EU is vital, companies are entitled to ask how it\u2019s meant to happen outside the customs union. The industry\u2019s \u201cjust in time\u201d delivery networks are not some idle demonstration of logistical prowess; they are how large manufacturers operate across the world to reduce working capital and keep costs low. Yes, UK-based firms could adapt to slower custom checks at the channel tunnel by holding more stock, but the switch would plainly come at a cost. \u201cJust in case\u201d, as it were, is more expensive than \u201cjust in time\u201d. Those costs are hard to assess precisely and the UK might still score well on other factors, such as skills and science base. But ease of trade will always be near the top of the list for car producers when making investment decisions. It underpins other ways to be competitive. Thus Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, was merely stating hard economic reality on Tuesday when he pointed out the long-term risks to UK jobs and said \u201cthere is no credible \u2018plan B\u2019 for frictionless customs arrangements\u201d under the government\u2019s current plan to leave the customs union. The same factors won\u2019t apply to all parts of the economy, obviously, but Hawes\u2019 analysis that \u201cthere is no Brexit dividend for our industry\u201d should not be controversial. The penny finally seems to have dropped in government that these large manufacturing companies \u2013 others being Airbus and Siemens \u2013 may know what they\u2019re talking about when they warn of the risks and costs of distribution bottlenecks. Theresa May appeared to take a swipe at Hunt and foreign secretary Boris Johnson yesterday when she spoke about the need for an \u201cevidence first before ideology\u201d approach. One wonders, though, how much damage has been done. It is hard to award any credibility to the government\u2019s long-term industrial policy if leading ministers react like upset children when a few facts of industrial life are put to them. Crafty gin bucks the market Astonishing statistic of the day: of the \u00a3500m increase in spending in supermarkets in the last 12 weeks against a year ago, some \u00a338m-worth came from extra sales of gin, says retail research firm Kantar. The gin boom shouldn\u2019t still be happening, according to the big spirits producers, who take the long view that consumer tastes tend to move in cycles; by now, vodka or whisky should be back in fashion. Not that the big brands mind, of course. Local distilleries producing \u201ccraft\u201d gins take the credit for the change in the market, but the large firms are delighted that the artisan crew have endorsed the notion that a spirit previously regarded as cheap \u2019n\u2019 cheerful can be a \u201cpremium\u201d product, to be sold at premium prices. It makes their own marketing efforts much easier and the \u201ccraft\u201d volumes, in an overall context, are still tiny. Their one regret is not making a knock-out bid about four years ago for Fever-Tree, the tonic firm that is the biggest winner from the gin boom. After a share price rise from 170p at the end of 2014 to \u00a334 today, Fever-Tree is now worth a remarkable \u00a33.8bn.",

The fears about a trade war after Donald Trump raised the stakes in his attacks on China and elsewhere continued to dominate sentiment. A rise in the oil price gave a lift to the FTSE 100 but elsewhere markets slipped back by the close, in some cases into negative territory. An early rise on Wall Street did little to support shares elsewhere. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 28.08 points or 0.37% at 7537.92 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,234.34 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.05% at 5281.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.3% to 21,419.27 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 9637.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.34%. Here\u2019s our story on the latest on the spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson over trade tariffs: And here\u2019s the criticism of the Bank of England over its expenses: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A London magistrates court says Uber can continue operating in London, but for a trial period: A court decided the ride-hailing firm should be awarded a new, 15-month probationary licence, after being told of sweeping changes to its practices. The ride-hailing firm\u2019s future in one of its biggest global markets had been in jeopardy after Transport for London ruled last September that it was not \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a private hire vehicles operator\u2019s licence. At the start of a two-day hearing, Uber admitted that London\u2019s original decision not to renew its five-year licence had been correct. TfL cited concerns about public safety and security, including reporting of crimes, and background checks on drivers. But Uber\u2019s lawyers convinced Westminster magistrates court that it had since cleaned up its act, while continuing to operate in the capital pending its appeal. Chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, said that Uber should pay all costs of the appeal. TfL\u2019s lawyer said a figure of \u00a3425,000 had been agreed. Our full report is here: The nervous gain made by markets in the wake of Monday\u2019s falls is hardly a convincing recovery. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: There is little reason to believe that this respite from the recent selling in the larger markets is anything more than a breather before the pressure starts once more. No one is showing any signs of backing down in the escalating and dangerous trade war that was started by the US. Today, the focus of US President Donald Trump\u2019s ire is iconic motor cycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, which is threatening to get round the EU\u2019s retaliatory import tariffs by increasing production outside the US. Trump is warning the company of a big tax being levied should it move production to Thailand, and we are seeing an important proxy play out for future cases given the growing impact this trade war is having on US-based firms. US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month, with today\u2019s Conference Board survey highlighting a particularly noticeable decline in future expectations. While many believe that the US will emerge in an improved economic standing in the aftermath of this current trade war, the fact is that we have a huge degree of anxiety over how this will play out. With China eradicating tariffs on Soybeans (one of the biggest US exports to China) from five Asian countries, it is clear that China is positioning itself for a further breakdown in US-China trade relations. There may not be a full blown trade war but markets will continue to be hit by the continuing tensions, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Despite the small rebound in equity markets today, fears of a global trade war have increased further this week. This, together with a likely slowdown in the US economy next year, will probably continue to weigh on equities. The news over the weekend that the US is taking further steps towards implementing protectionist policies, and that it is broadening its approach, strengthen the perception that we are genuinely moving closer to a full-blown trade war. This, rather than the proposed measures themselves, explains yesterday\u2019s sell-off in equity markets. Information technology (IT) stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday, which is not surprising. Admittedly, the measures are meant to protect US technology. But they could hurt the sales of US IT firms in China, or limit their ability to operate there. However, some of the stocks that fell the most in the US were consumer discretionary stocks, with very limited exposure to China. And some of the IT firms with larger-than-average exposure to China fared better than those with less exposure. Indeed, the stocks of the so-called FAANGs, the group of large US consumer discretionary and IT firms, were among the hardest hit stocks in the US yesterday. (See Chart.) This follows surprisingly strong performance so far this year, and suggestions that the FAANGs are emerging as some form of safe haven amid rising global trade tensions. ....We disagree with this notion. While most of the FAANGs might not be very exposed to China, they are still highly cyclical. They are therefore particularly vulnerable, as a trade war would raise the risk of an economic slowdown. We still do not anticipate a full-blown trade war, and we do not expect the protectionist measures implemented or proposed thus far to kill the current economic expansion on their own....However, as equity markets usually lead the economy rather than the other way around, the current escalation of trade tensions is adding to the pressure on global equity markets. What\u2019s more, cyclical sectors remain particularly vulnerable in this environment, with or without exposure to China. Markets are managing to hold on to their - fairly limited - gains. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The morning\u2019s positivity managed to carry over into the US session, though the gains were nothing compared to Monday\u2019s losses. The Dow Jones managed to rise 0.3% after the bell, sending the beleaguered US index back above 24300. This despite another strong day for the dollar, with the greenback rising 0.4% against both the pound and the euro, sending the former below $1.323 and the latter towards $1.165, and jumping half a percent against the yen. The most recent Conference Board consumer confidence reading had little impact on either currency or index, the possible negative impact of the worse than expected month-on-month decline countered by the upwards revised figure from May. Commenting on the US data Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence declined in June after improving in May. Consumers\u2019 assessment of present-day conditions was relatively unchanged, suggesting that the level of economic growth remains strong. While expectations remain high by historical standards, the modest curtailment in optimism suggests that consumers do not foresee the economy gaining much momentum in the months ahead. It should hardly come as much of a surprise, given the amount of talk about the recent trade tensions, but US consumer confidence has slipped back in June, coming in below expectations. The Conference Board consumer confidence index fell from 128.8 in May (itself revised up from 128) to 126.4. Analyst had forecast a level of 128. Here\u2019s our latest report on the new spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson: President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened Harley-Davidson with a \u201cbig tax\u201d and said the motorbike company\u2019s decision to shift some motorcycle production overseas, \u201cwill be the beginning of the end\u201d. A day after the company announced it was moving some production overseas to mitigate the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on European steel and aluminium Trump used Twitter to say the company is using \u201cTariffs/Trade War as an excuse\u201d to hide previously announced plans to move jobs to Asia. The Milwaukee-based company said on Monday it came to its decision because of retaliatory tariffs it faces in an escalating trade dispute between the US and the European Union. Trump warned Harley-Davidson that any shift in production \u201cwill be the beginning of the end\u201d. \u201cThe Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!\u201d Trump said in one of several tweets on Tuesday. He was referring to tariffs Harley-Davidson would face on motorcycles produced overseas and shipped back to the US for sale. The president has held up the motorcycle maker as an example of a US business harmed by trade barriers in other countries, but Harley-Davidson had warned that new US tariffs could negatively affect its sales. Trump recently imposed steep tariffs on aluminium and steel imported from Canada, Mexico and Europe in his attempt to reduce trade deficits between the US and its trade partners. But those countries have treated Trump\u2019s action as an insult and have chosen to respond in kind. The US and China are also volleying back and forth over tariffs. The full story is here: After Monday\u2019s slump, US markets have indeed managed to open in positive territory, even if the gains are not particularly convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 47 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.19% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29%. Technology stocks, which on Monday were among the biggest fallers after Donald Trump latest trade threats hit the sector, are leading the recovery. Gold is typically seen as a haven for investors in times of market turmoil, but not at the moment. It has been heading lower for a while and is down another $8 an ounce to $1257 so far today. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Gold has been falling sharply of late, dropping by a good $50 in the space of nine trading days. At the time of writing, the yellow precious metal was trading around $1257, its lowest level since December 18. The perceived safe haven metal has been unable to find much demand from flows out of the equity markets which have been tumbling amid concerns over global trade disputes and the outlook for rising interest rates. Indeed, the trend of central banks turning hawkish has continued in recent weeks. The Fed has indicated that it will probably raise borrowing costs two more times this year, while the ECB\u2019s QE will end at the end of this year \u2013 albeit the first rate rise has been delayed \u2013 and there are now more hawks at the BOE (3) than expected (2). As central banks tighten monetary conditions, yields could rise further. This means the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing assets like gold will increase (on a relative basis) along with expectations for higher borrowing costs. Unfortunately for gold, which is priced in the dollar, interest rate expectations in the US have been rising faster than in other regions. This has helped to underpin the dollar and undermine foreign currencies, and pressurised buck-denominated gold further. Thus, for gold to make a meaningful comeback, the dollar will have to depreciate and depreciate sharply. This can only happen if incoming US macro data were to deteriorate sharply, or the global economy \u2013 in particular, the EU \u2013 starts to expand at a faster pace than the US economy. However, as things stand, this looks unlikely and we therefore may see further dollar strength in the coming days and weeks. So, the outlook for gold looks bleak. A few minutes until Wall Street opens and the futures market is predicting the US markets - like those in Europe - will stage a minor recovery. After Monday\u2019s 328 point decline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open up around 40 points. Getting back to the trade wars.... Donald Trump has savaged Harley-Davidson for deciding to move some production out of America to avoid EU tariffs on US goods. The president accused the motorbike manufacturer of misleading customers yesterday, by using tariffs as an \u2018excuse\u2019 to shift jobs. He says it will be the \u2018beginning of the end\u2019 for Harley, unless it scraps the plan. Overnight, the Financial Times spoke to Harley workers in Milwaukee. Most apparently still support Trump, and think he\u2019s using his business smarts. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do it unless it needed to be done, he\u2019s a very smart businessman,\u201d said one Harley employee whose name is embroidered on his work shirt \u2014 though he asks not to be quoted by name. \u201cI think he\u2019s playing poker: I\u2019ll hit you with this, you\u2019ll hit us with that, I think this will bring them to the table \u2014 unless he\u2019s completely crazy,\u201d chimed in another.... More here. Before being quizzed over those whopping travel expenses, Bradley Fried told the Treasury committee that the Bank of England was committed to improving diversity. Reuters has the details: The Bank of England\u2019s next governor must embody values of inclusion and accountability, as well strong economic skills, the new chair of the central bank\u2019s court of directors said on Tuesday. \u201cThose values include inclusion, they include accountability, they include collaboration, decisiveness and empowerment. We would want that in the new governor,\u201d Bradley Fried told lawmakers. Incumbent governor Mark Carney is due to step down on June 30, 2019, and finance minister Philip Hammond is expected to announce his successor before the end of this year. Fried also acknowledged the criticism for only having one woman (Silvana Tenreyro) on the Bank\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates. That image doesn\u2019t match the Bank\u2019s commitment to inclusivity and equality, Fried insisted. There\u2019s also only one woman (Elizabeth Stheeman) on the Financial Policy Committee alongside 12(!) men - including two facing tough questions about their trans-Atlantic flights.... Back in parliament, the new chair of the court of the Bank of England has faced some uncomfortable questions about expenses. Bradley Fried has been asked to justify how two members of the BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, Donald Kohn and Anil Kashyap, ran up \u00a3390,000 of travel expenses in the last two and a half years. This is \u201ca simply staggering sum\u201d, says Conservative MP Simon Clarke. Is it really a sensible use of the bank\u2019s resources? Fried argues that Kohn and Kashyap\u2019s expertise mean it was value for money, given the skills which they provide to the FPC. \u201cIn the context of the skills we needed on the committees at the time\u2026 Having seen these committees in action and the contributions they have made, as high as their expenses have been, so staggering, I think, has been their contribution\u201d. Anil Kashyap is a professor at the University of Chicago, while Donald Kohn is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Both men are travelling between London and America to attend FPC meetings - with the Bank picking up the tab. Clarke says his constituents would be \u201cgobsmacked\u201d to hear that one return flight from Chicago for Mr Kashyap to attend a meeting in February cost \u00a311,084.89. Clarke says: \u201cThese meetings must be scheduled months in advance. I cannot understand how that figure was arrived at. Are FPC members allowed to fly first class, he wonders. Our people fly business class, replies Fried, but he\u2019ll check this issue. Onto taxis! Donald Kohn, it transpires, took a flight from Washington to London costing \u00a38,000 and added an extra \u00a3469 in taxi fares. Clarke says this is \u201cjust unconscionable\u201d. He adds that there are \u201cdisturbing echoes\u201d of the culture that was exposed by the House of Commons expense scandal in 2009. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, Clarke reminds Fried that the Bank\u2019s 2016 summer party cost \u00a3100,000. That\u2019s \u201cone hell of a party\u201d. Is that public money? if it isn\u2019t, whose money is it? Fried says he will \u201creflect\u201d on this issue and \u201cfigure out with our financial manager what framework is appropriate.\u201d Clarke puts his finger on another dubious issue. The Bank of England\u2019s Sports Centre facility at Roehampton - where it costs \u00a31,464 per year to a humble member of the public, but Bank staff only pay \u00a350 a year. That, Clarke says, is \u201can extraordinary good deal, and suggests an extraordinary subsidy being offered here\u201d. How does that fit with the Bank\u2019s mandate of promoting monetary and financial stability? Fried admits that the issue will be examined: Roehampton is part of what we look at. We will be looking at Roehampton. Andy Bruce of Reuters has dug out an example of Donald Kohn\u2019s expenses - including more than \u00a356,000 in one three-month period last year. The Chinese stock market\u2019s slide into a bear market today has sent shivers through the financial world, particularly in Asia. With shares down 20% since January, and worries about trade rising, investors fear more losses ahead. Qian Qimin, strategiest at Shenwan Hongyuan Group in Shanghai, says the threat of trade protectionism could push shares lower. \u201cThe market may keep falling since it\u2019s still hard to gauge the impact of trade tensions. Investors will keep cutting risk.\u201d Analysts at Danske Bank have warned that some international companies could pull out of China, leading to an outflow of capital. \u201cWe envisage that US companies in China will increasingly repatriate profits as they risk being caught in the crossfire in the trade war. The prospect that America blocks some technology exports to China (and maybe other countries too?) is also alarming traders. Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, explains why such a move would be significant: \u201cUnlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington\u2019s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections.\u201d Jonathan Haskel seems to be talking sterling down, even before he gets his knees under the table at the Bank of England. Sterling has dropped by half a cent today, to $1.322, as Haskel tells MPs that there may be more slack in the UK economy than we think. If he\u2019s right, that could mean interest rates rise more slowly. Haskel is generally coming over as a more dovish policymaker, which is significant as he\u2019s replacing the hawkish Ian McCafferty... The man who will be replaced by Jonathan Haskel is also speaking this morning, explaining why he voted (in vain) to raise UK interest rates last week. Ian McCafferty, who leaves the Bank of England monetary policy committee this summer, is arguing the economy is much stronger than official figures suggest. In his final major speech, McCafferty declares: \u201cWe should not dally in making the next move. In his view, low unemployment is starting to drive wages higher and energy prices are rising - both of which could keep inflation above the Bank\u2019s 2% target. \u201cContinuing with the slow reduction in monetary stimulus without undue delay could well prevent the need for a more aggressive tightening later on. Over in parliament, economics professor Jonathan Haskel is being quizzed by MPs about his appointment to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. Haskel has warned that rising protectionism could threaten the UK economy by driving up costs and hurting economic demand. Haskel told the Treasury committee: If protectionism were to break out into a widespread trade war I would of course be very concerned, for in such a situation economies would have higher inflation (due to higher import costs), lower demand (due to confidence etc.) and likely lower supply (to the extent that supply chains were interrupted that couldn\u2019t otherwise be established). Haskel also warns that Brexit\u2019s effect on the UK economy is still very uncertain. On productivity (his specialist area), Haskel says he\u2019s less pessimistic than some other experts. He believes that some firms are making significant investment in artificial intelligence which aren\u2019t yet bearing fruit. Haskel is due to join the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee in September, and he\u2019s now being grilled about gender balance, following the row over his appointment (over four female candidates). He says that Imperial College, where he works, are making efforts to improve the pipeline of female candidates into economics. This includes outreach programmes and efforts to engage with schools (Imperial experts who will turn up and perform a \u201cwhole load of explosions\u201d). Wes Streeting MP jokes that the Treasury Committee might enjoy a demonstration; Haskel gently points out that the House of Commons has already had one near-miss with explosions.... Newsflash: Britain\u2019s finance minister has warned that a trade war would be disastrous, not least for the United States. Speaking during a visit to India, chancellor Philip Hammond has told CNBC that we are living in \u201cuncertain times\u201d right now, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s approach to trade and tariffs. He told CNBC India: The old certainty for many decades has been that the United States was completely wedded to open markets and free trade. And now the United States is questioning the value, the fairness, of some of our arrangements. Hammond warns that a full-blown trade was could be devastating. \u201cI very much hope that we can avoid a full scale trade war (because) that would be a disaster for everyone, not least for the United States. Hammond also pledge that the UK would remain \u201can outspoken proponent of open markets and free trade, low tariffs barriers and low non-tariff barriers\u201d. The chancellor is one of the key voices pushing for a relatively \u2018soft Brexit\u2019, under which Britain\u2019s existing trade links with Europe are largely maintained. This chart shows how China\u2019s Shanghai composite index has fallen pretty steadily since its recent peak at the end of January. The slump in Chinese shares this year will worry policymakers in Beijing. Many small investors will have suffered hefty losses as the Chinese market has slid 20% from January\u2019s high. Financial speculation could destabilise the economy, at a time when officials are trying to tackle financial risks and shadow banking problems without hurting growth. Peter Garnry of Saxo Bank says China is under pressure to settle the trade dispute with America: After yesterday\u2019s tumbles, European traders will have approached their desks nervously today. But so far, the City looks relatively calm. The FTSE 100 has rise by 23 points in early trading, having plunged by 173 points yesterday. The news that China has fallen into a bear market hasn\u2019t caused a wider panic. The French and German markets have also risen by around 0.3%, as investors try to digest some mixed messages from the White House overnight. Wall Street was spooked last night by treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin\u2019s claim that America could restrict investment from \u201call countries that are trying to steal our technology.\u201d That message was then undermined by trade advisor Peter Navarro, who went on TV to declare: \u201cThere\u2019s no plans to impose investment restrictions on any countries that are interfering in any way with our country. This is not the plan.\u201d So we\u2019ll have to wait and see what Donald Trump signs off later this week. In the meantime, these escalating tensions are making investors increasingly nervous, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. If the US stops Chinese investment in certain US sectors, it will have a strong counteraction. Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin has said that more details on this would follow by the end of this week and this is going to keep investors even more nervous. On top of this, Trump administration is further adding to this uncertainty by keep sending conflicting statements; one person would say it is fake news and another would say more details on the topic would emerge sooner than later. Dickie Wong, head of research at Hong Kong-based broker Kingston Securities, says the gloom is deepening in China, as America threatens to escalate the trade dispute. Wong says (via CNN): It\u2019s a combo effect of concerns about the trade war and China\u2019s GDP growth. Last week Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, on top of the $50bn already being targeted. Newsflash: China\u2019s stock market has fallen into bear market territory, as fears of a trade war with America hits confidence. The Shanghai Composite index has dropped 0.5% today, which means it has fallen more than 20% from its recent peak in January. Energy stocks and banks led the selloff today, as traders worried that escalating trade tensions would hit Chinese economic growth and financial stability. Reports that the US will soon block Chinese firms from investing in America, and restrict the export of cutting-edge technology to China, has sent a shiver through the trading floors. Airline stocks also had a bad day, amid worries that the weakening yuan would drive up the cost of servicing debts issued in US dollars. Bloomberg reports that anxiety in China is growing: \u201cPessimism will keep growing as many companies are on the edge of margin calls and bond defaults,\u201d said Sun Jianbo, China Vision Capital president in Beijing. \u201cThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index will fall at least 10 percent from the current level.\u201d Trade war fears are hitting currencies across the developing world today. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy at FXTM, explains: Concerns over the possibility of an upcoming trade war are expected to remain front and centre of investor focus once again today. The Chinese Yuan, Malaysian Ringgit, Thai Baht, Indian Rupee and Indonesian Rupiah are once again trading lower against the Dollar, while the Japanese Yen is still outperforming as a result of investor reluctance to take on risk during an atmosphere of market uncertainty. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The markets are edgy today after growing worries of a trade war sent shares sliding on both side of the Atlantic yesterday. Yesterday\u2019s selloff wiped 328 points, or 1.3%, off America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average while the Nasdaq shed 2%. China\u2019s yuan has slumped to a near six-month low, as the threat of a deepening dispute with America hit confidence. Analysts believe Washington will press the button in tough restrictions on Chinese investment in the coming days, which would further escalate tensions with Beijing. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin denied last night that America was targeting China, saying that \u201call countries\u201d which pilfer US technology could face restrictions. Mnuchin may have been trying to help, but he\u2019s actually raised fears of a broader crackdown by the US. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets puts it: This trade spat story looks to have good legs on it everyone. Buckle up. In weak trading, the yuan has fallen to 6.5573 against the US dollar today, the lowest since last December. The news that US motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson would move some production out of America, thanks to EU tariffs, also hit sentiment yesterday. Analysts warned that it shows the perils of tit-for-tat trade barriers: Having triggered the current flurry of tariffs, Donald Trump has tweeted that manufacturers should be patient: But other US companies may follow Harley\u2019s lead, to avoid Europe\u2019s new 25% tariffs on some US goods. Also coming up today MPs will be kicking the tires of Britain\u2019s newest central bank policy maker, Jonathan Haskel, who joins the Bank of England in September. Haskel is a productivity expert, but the City don\u2019t know much about his views on monetary policy. The hearing may provide some hints on whether he\u2019s a hawk or a dove, and thus likely to vote for interest rate hikes. Haskel\u2019s appointment caused a stir last month; he was the only man on a five-person shortlist, so the Treasury missed the opportunity to tackle the Bank\u2019s gender problems. On the data side, the CBI is publishing its estimate of UK retail sales this month. We\u2019ve already had one piece of bad retail news - struggling Carpetright has just posted a whopping loss of \u00a370.5m for the last year, as it presses on with its store closure plan. Carpetright also warned that some suppliers are tightening credit terms, following \u2018adverse publicity surrounding the Group\u2019s restructuring\u2019. Plus, the latest survey of US consumer confidence is released later today. It hit a three-month high - will trade tensions have weakened it? The agenda: 10am BST: Professor Jonathan Haskel\u2019s appointment hearing for the Monetary Policy Committee at parliament 11am BST: CBI survey of UK retail sales in June 3pm BST: US consumer confidence for June",

Today, the focus of US President Donald Trump\u2019s ire is iconic motor cycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, which is threatening to get round the EU\u2019s retaliatory import tariffs by increasing production outside the US. Trump is warning the company of a big tax being levied should it move production to Thailand, and we are seeing an important proxy play out for future cases given the growing impact this trade war is having on US-based firms.</p> <p>US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month, with today\u2019s Conference Board survey highlighting a particularly noticeable decline in future expectations. While many believe that the US will emerge in an improved economic standing in the aftermath of this current trade war, the fact is that we have a huge degree of anxiety over how this will play out. With China eradicating tariffs on Soybeans (one of the biggest US exports to China) from five Asian countries, it is clear that China is positioning itself for a further breakdown in US-China trade relations.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b32596ae4b0bef28bb9a648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T15:21:43.383Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There may not be a full blown trade war but markets will continue to be hit by the continuing tensions, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the small rebound in equity markets today, fears of a global trade war have increased further this week. This, together with a likely slowdown in the US economy next year, will probably continue to weigh on equities.</p> <p>The news over the weekend that the US is taking further steps towards implementing protectionist policies, and that it is broadening its approach, strengthen the perception that we are genuinely moving closer to a full-blown trade war. This, rather than the proposed measures themselves, explains yesterday\u2019s sell-off in equity markets.</p> <p>Information technology (IT) stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday, which is not surprising. Admittedly, the measures are meant to protect US technology. But they could hurt the sales of US IT firms in China, or limit their ability to operate there.</p> <p>However, some of the stocks that fell the most in the US were consumer discretionary stocks, with very limited exposure to China. And some of the IT firms with larger-than-average exposure to China fared better than those with less exposure.</p> <p>Indeed, the stocks of the so-called FAANGs, the group of large US consumer discretionary and IT firms, were among the hardest hit stocks in the US yesterday. (See Chart.) This follows surprisingly strong performance so far this year, and suggestions that the FAANGs are emerging as some form of safe haven amid rising global trade tensions.</p> <p>....We disagree with this notion. While most of the FAANGs might not be very exposed to China, they are still highly cyclical. They are therefore particularly vulnerable, as a trade war would raise the risk of an economic slowdown.</p> <p>We still do not anticipate a full-blown trade war, and we do not expect the protectionist measures implemented or proposed thus far to kill the current economic expansion on their own....However, as equity markets usually lead the economy rather than the other way around, the current escalation of trade tensions is adding to the pressure on global equity markets. What\u2019s more, cyclical sectors remain particularly vulnerable in this environment, with or without exposure to China. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b324fd9e4b0bef28bb9a5a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T14:39:21.213Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are managing to hold on to their - fairly limited - gains.

It has been heading lower for a while and is down another $8 an ounce to $1257 so far today. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gold has been falling sharply of late, dropping by a good $50 in the space of nine trading days. At the time of writing, the yellow precious metal was trading around $1257, its lowest level since December 18. The perceived safe haven metal has been unable to find much demand from flows out of the equity markets which have been tumbling amid concerns over global trade disputes and the outlook for rising interest rates.</p> <p> Indeed, the trend of central banks turning hawkish has continued in recent weeks. The Fed has indicated that it will probably raise borrowing costs two more times this year, while the ECB\u2019s QE will end at the end of this year \u2013 albeit the first rate rise has been delayed \u2013 and there are now more hawks at the BOE (3) than expected (2). </p> <p> As central banks tighten monetary conditions, yields could rise further. This means the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing assets like gold will increase (on a relative basis) along with expectations for higher borrowing costs. Unfortunately for gold, which is priced in the dollar, interest rate expectations in the US have been rising faster than in other regions. This has helped to underpin the dollar and undermine foreign currencies, and pressurised buck-denominated gold further. </p> <p> Thus, for gold to make a meaningful comeback, the dollar will have to depreciate and depreciate sharply. This can only happen if incoming US macro data were to deteriorate sharply, or the global economy \u2013 in particular, the EU \u2013 starts to expand at a faster pace than the US economy. However, as things stand, this looks unlikely and we therefore may see further dollar strength in the coming days and weeks. So, the outlook for gold looks bleak. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fc3645165db580f3939650d1b298177a42b54f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc3645165db580f3939650d1b298177a42b54f3/0_125_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gold bars at YLG Bullion International Ltd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold bars at YLG Bullion International Ltd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b323c19e4b025d39df45154\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T13:15:50.246Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A few minutes until Wall Street opens and the futures market is predicting the US markets - like those in Europe - will stage a minor recovery.

    "webTitle": "Car industry leaders blame Brexit for UK collapse in investment | Phillip Inman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brexit is to blame for the collapse in car industry investment, which is down by half in the first six months of the year compared to the same period in 2017, industry leaders say. They believe the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations in Brussels, two years after the referendum vote, makes it almost impossible to invest in the UK. Without membership of a customs union and the promise of almost frictionless trade, car companies cannot know how well-connected their UK operations will be with car plants and suppliers on the continent. It might be clear to those close to the negotiations that a fudge, including access to the customs union, is the likely outcome of the talks. But that cannot be the working assumption of executives who spend billions of pounds financing new plants that will still be making cars in 2025 or beyond. Last year the industry\u2019s answer to this dilemma was delay. This year, firms are switching investment to countries they know are definitely inside the customs union. Brexit uncertainty has also made Micra man and Fiesta woman nervous about when to buy a new car, leaving sales in the UK flagging. There were 1.07m car registrations in the first five months to May compared to 1.15m in the same period last year \u2013 a fall of 6.8%. Other looming threats to the industryinclude Trump\u2019s eagerness to slap tariffs on car imports in the next stage in his trade war with Europe and the monumentally expensive switch from the internal combustion engine to electric and hybrid vehicles. So it is no wonder the industry\u2019s leaders want, as the very minimum requirement, to know how car parts will travel from the continent to the UK \u2013 and often back and forth several times for finishing \u2013 without sitting in a lorry park for hours or needing an extra piece of paperwork to clear border controls. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the car industry lobby group, the SMMT, said there is \u201cgrowing frustration in global boardrooms\u201d at the slow pace of negotiations. As for a Brexit dividend, he said that the \u201cincreasingly hostile and protectionist global trading environment\u201d where leaving the EU is yet another problem, means there isn\u2019t one. Remainers will argue that arch eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg needs to listen to the arguments as much as Theresa May and business secretary Greg Clarke. This is not to bow and curtsey before big business, but a recognition of the importance of the car industry and the government support that is needed in a period of huge transition. The car industry is one of the UK\u2019s main employers. There may be only 186,000 on production lines, but there are 856,000 jobs linked to the UK motor industry. It has enjoyed a stellar run since 2012. Until last year registrations were growing at more than 10% a year and production reached 1.67m vehicles, the second-highest figure since the turn of the century. It is not impossible the industry could suffer the same fate as its Italian counterpart, with large swathes of UK motor heritage shut down and moved to Turkey and the Czech Republic. The last UK factory to make Ford vans moved from Southampton to Turkey in 2012. Jaguar Land Rover, currently Britain\u2019s largest car maker, has chosen is to transfer all production of its Land Rover Discovery model from the West Midlands to a plant in Slovakia, potentially putting hundreds of jobs at risk. It already makes its first electric vehicle \u2013 the i-Pace \u2013 in Austria. It is comforting for those who voted leave to dismiss the industry\u2019s demands as sabre-rattling. After the emissions scandal, it would be understandable if car industry leaders were treated with disdain and told to get their own house in order before lecturing governments. But it is clear decisions are being made at the moment to the UK\u2019s detriment and it will take a change of negotiating tactics to keep what is an almost entirely foreign-owned industry on side.",

But that cannot be the working assumption of executives who spend billions of pounds financing new plants that will still be making cars in 2025 or beyond.</p> \n<p>Last year the industry\u2019s answer to this dilemma was delay. This year, firms are switching investment to countries they know are definitely inside the customs union.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6232afbc-00f6-45c2-a6fd-5d5ff9d12459\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>What is just in time production?</b><br>Rather than stockpiling components and raw materials, companies started in the late 1970s to buy the parts they required as close to the time of use as possible. The result was a drastic reduction in the cost of stocks and warehousing.</p>\n    <p>The name refers to the idea that parts arrive from suppliers at the factory gate with as little time to spare as possible.</p>\n    <p>Honda told the Financial Times on Tuesday it&nbsp;\u200bstill \u200b&nbsp;stores only enough parts to maintain production of the Honda Civic at its Swindon factory for 36 hours.</p>\n    <p><b>What is its history?</b><br>The process was developed by Toyota in Japan and became big in Britain during the 1980s.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.toyota-global.com/company/vision_philosophy/toyota_production_system/just-in-time.html\"></a>The technique was pioneered by a Toyota production engineer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/2009/07/03/taiichi-ohno\">Taiichi Ohno</a>, from the end of the second world war. Japan lacked cash to produce goods in large quantities, and space for stockpiling goods was at a premium.</p>\n    <p>The system helped Japanese car manufacturers compete with US producers, and provided a competitive edge which helped Japan overtake Europe to become the third largest car producer in the world (behind the US and China). The production process is known by some academics as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System\">Toyota Production System</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>What are the potential negatives?</b><br>Companies can lose the economies of scale. They also need detailed plans of their operations to juggle their needs in real time, which can be difficult when a single car consists of about 30,000 components often arriving on the production line a few hours before they are needed.</p>\n    <p>However, the biggest emerging risk comes from political instability. Having benefited from comparatively steady political conditions since the collapse of communism, decades of globalisation have led to the growth of supply chains sprawling across the planet. Political upheaval in one country often now means production problems in another.</p>\n    <p><b>What are the consequences of Brexit?</b><br>British firms have often chosen the safest, closest and cheapest locations to source their supplies, which has helped eastern European countries as a result of their low production costs and the political protection of the EU. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>&nbsp;threatens to throw sand into the wheels of just in time production.</p>\n    <p>If the UK crashes out of the EU without a customs deal evidence suggests increased border checks could add \u00a31.5bn a year to the costs for the aerospace industry alone \u2013 which relies on just in time supply chains.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Brexit uncertainty has also made Micra man and Fiesta woman nervous about when to buy a new car, leaving sales in the UK flagging.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.smmt.co.uk/reports/smmt-motor-industry-facts-2018/\">There were 1.07m car registrations</a> in the first five months to May compared to 1.15m in the same period last year \u2013 a fall of 6.8%.</p> \n<p>Other looming threats to the industryinclude Trump\u2019s eagerness to slap tariffs on car imports in the next stage in his trade war with Europe and the monumentally expensive switch from the internal combustion engine to electric and hybrid vehicles.</p> \n<p>So it is no wonder the industry\u2019s leaders want, as the very minimum requirement, to know how car parts will travel from the continent to the UK \u2013 and often back and forth several times for finishing \u2013 without sitting in a lorry park for hours or needing an extra piece of paperwork to clear border controls.</p> \n<p>Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the car industry lobby group, the SMMT, said there is \u201cgrowing frustration in global boardrooms\u201d at the slow pace of negotiations.</p> \n<p>As for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-cash-plan-the-brexit-dividend-claim-is-a-lie\">Brexit dividend</a>, he said that the \u201cincreasingly hostile and protectionist global trading environment\u201d where leaving the EU is yet another problem, means there isn\u2019t one.</p> \n<p>Remainers will argue that arch eurosceptic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> needs to listen to the arguments as much as Theresa May and business secretary Greg Clarke. This is not to bow and curtsey before big business, but a recognition of the importance of the car industry and the government support that is needed in a period of huge transition.<br></p> \n<p>The car industry is one of the UK\u2019s main employers. There may be only 186,000 on production lines, but there are 856,000 jobs linked to the UK motor industry. It has enjoyed a stellar run since 2012. Until last year registrations were growing at more than 10% a year and production reached 1.67m vehicles, the second-highest figure since the turn of the century.</p> \n<p>It is not impossible the industry could suffer the same fate as its Italian counterpart, with large swathes of UK motor heritage shut down and moved to Turkey and the Czech Republic. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The last UK factory to make Ford vans moved from Southampton to Turkey in 2012.

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, US, and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from June 2006 to May 2009 The fallout from the disastrous Brexit vote and the even more calamitous negotiations are scaring businesses to death, and continuing apace. House of Fraser has announced it will be closing down 31 out of 59 stores. Airbus and BMW both warned of the severe consequences of a disorderly Brexit. Airbus closing plants in the UK would have an especially bad impact on jobs in Wales, where Airbus has a major plant, that inexplicably voted for Brexit given it has the most to lose of almost anywhere from leaving the EU. A Baker McKenzie survey of 800 business leaders in France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden and Ireland found that nearly half of respondents say their company has reduced investment in the UK since the Brexit vote. No wonder many thousands demonstrated against the Brexit madness last weekend. It appears that the Brexit vote has already cost the UK between \u00a320bn and \u00a340bn. The ONS reported that in April manufacturing output dropped 0.5%, which is the largest fall since May 2017. GDP growth was 0.1% in the first quarter and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has forecast it will be only 0.2% in the second quarter. As a consequence the pound continues to slide on the obvious economic weakness. The pound is worth more than 10% less now than on the eve of the Brexit vote. The bad news continued with the trade deficit rising to the second highest on record. Three members of the MPC this month \u2013 Haldane, McCafferty and Saunders \u2013 inexplicably voted for a rate rise, based on wishful guessing and entirely ignoring the data from the real world. They know not what they do. They said they just knew that the data declines were temporary that wages were set to explode. Members of the MPC have cried wolf so many times over wages rising it is no longer funny. Pay growth excluding bonuses, which is the MPC\u2019s preferred wage measure, fell from 3% in March to 2.5% in April. Oops. They have not understood that so many people are underemployed, wanting more hours than they can find, and that is what is keeping wage pressure down. Underemployment remains well above its pre-recession levels, and let\u2019s not forget real wages are 6% below what they were in 2008. The UK economy is slowing and the last thing it needs is a rate rise. This is getting embarrassing. They know not what they do. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 We have seen some quite positive data over the past month on employment, retail sales and public finances. Jobs growth in the past three months has been strong, while retail sales volumes bounced back in May. In the latest three months, retail volumes were 2% up on a year ago, the strongest annual growth rate recorded since June 2017. The government\u2019s deficit for 2017-18 has been revised downwards and in the first two months of this financial year borrowing is \u00a34bn below its level a year ago. This will be reassuring for the chancellor, who has been asked to find an extra \u00a320bn to fund the NHS. The growth of tax receipts in April and May is consistent with a bounceback in economic growth in the second quarter after a disappointing first quarter. Official figures for manufacturing output have been disappointing, but the CBI industrial trends survey \u2013 which is more up-to-date \u2013 is upbeat. With reasonably healthy growth continuing across the world economy, we should expect UK manufacturing to benefit in the short term. The bigger worries for the UK manufacturing sector relate to the longer-term outlook. Recent warnings from a range of manufacturing firms \u2013 including Airbus and BMW \u2013 indicate there could be significant job losses if the Brexit deal creates new trade barriers for manufactured goods between the UK and the rest of the EU. Meanwhile, the pound remains weak against both the dollar and the euro. The MPC voted 6-3 to keep interest rates on hold. This is the strongest vote to raise interest rates above 0.5% since May 2011, but financial markets remain cautious about the prospect of rate rises. The Bank has been indicating that interest rates should be on a gradually rising path since \u201cforward guidance\u201d was launched nearly five years ago. However, since then, the MPC has failed to take advantage of many good opportunities to start the process of normalising monetary policy. So until words are backed up by action, markets are right to be sceptical of the MPC\u2019s statements pointing to higher interest rates. While sterling remains weak, inflation is likely to be stuck above the target at around 2.5% \u2013 with energy prices adding further upward pressure. The price of Brent crude oil is hovering around $75 per barrel, up from about $45 a year ago. Indeed, we should not rule out a rise in inflation over the next few months, which could put a dampener on consumer spending and economic growth in the second half of this year.",

      "bodyText": "Pound stutters on weak economic data Weaker than expected readings on the economy sent sterling tumbling earlier in the month, before the Bank of England gave the pound a shot in the arm after indicating it could raise interest rates from as early as August. Having opted to leave the cost of borrowing unchanged this month, Threadneedle Street still suggests the economy is stronger than official data appear to suggest. The manufacturing sector provided the worst of the bad news for the economy over the past month, putting pressure on the pound, after figures showed the worst month for output in five years. Despite rising in recent days, the pound is still worth more than 10% less now than on the eve of the Brexit vote. FTSE 100 rocked by world trade fears The FTSE 100 tumbled over the course of last month amid mounting fears over a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs. The president refused to exempt the European Union (including the UK), Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminium tariffs on imports from outside the US, while threatening $200bn (\u00a3151m) of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The news rocked global stock markets as investors grow increasingly concerned over the actions, with the FTSE 100 losing more than 100 points in the past few weeks. Better than expected Inflation holds steady despite rising petrol prices Despite petrol prices rising to the highest level for almost four years, UK inflation unexpectedly remained at a one-year low last month, helped by the falling cost of computer games, sweets and chocolate. Confounding economists\u2019 forecasts for an increase, the consumer price index held steady at 2.4% in May for the second month running. The Office for National Statistics said the average price of petrol rose by 4.6p a litre between April and May to 125.3p last month \u2013 the highest level since October 2014 \u2013 while economists also said the rate of inflation could rise again in coming months. Worse than expected Trade deficit rises to second highest on record Falling exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft contributed to Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit unexpectedly ballooning by \u00a32bn to \u00a314bn in April from the month earlier. Economists had forecast the gap between what Britain imports from the rest of the world and sells overseas would shrink slightly. Taking into account trade in UK services, as well as goods, over the three months to April, the total trade deficit widened by \u00a31.9bn to \u00a39.7bn. Better than expected Service sector stages recovery, yet Brexit fears loom The UK\u2019s dominant services sector expanded more quickly than expected in May, according to the most recent data published over the course of the last month, in a sign that Britain could have come through the worst of this year\u2019s slowdown. The latest snapshot from the IHS Markit/Cips UK Services PMI showed activity in the sector, which includes banks, restaurants and hotels, recovering to a three-month high. The construction and manufacturing sectors also recorded stronger-than-expected growth. Worse than expected Fall in wage growth despite low unemployment Earnings growth unexpectedly dropped despite Britain continuing to record the lowest levels of unemployment since the 1970s, which economists reckon should usually help workers to demand higher pay. Pay growth including bonuses dipped by 0.1 points to 2.5%, while excluding bonuses, wage growth fell by a similar level to 2.8%. There was better news, however, from a rise in job numbers despite weak economic growth in recent months, with 146,000 more people in work between February and April than in the previous three months. Better than expected Royal wedding and sunshine spark spending spree The royal wedding and warmer weather in May tempted consumers back to the shops, according to the latest figures published over the course of the last month, providing much-needed respite for Britain\u2019s struggling retailers. After heavy snow and freezing weather earlier in the year, shoppers had stayed home but returned to the high street as the sun came out. The Office for National Statistics said sales rose by 1.3% in May from a month earlier, comfortably beating expectations for a rise of just 0.5%.

Better than expected Government borrowing falls more than expected Tax rises might be around the corner to fund Theresa May\u2019s pledge to increase NHS spending by \u00a320bn a year by 2024, yet the latest figures from the UK public finances show public sector borrowing falling further than expected.

The Rics house price index, measuring the balance of surveyors expecting price rises against those forecasting a fall, rose to -3 in May from -7 a month ago, beating economists\u2019 expectations. London continued to point to falling prices in the survey, while there were rising prices in the midlands and the north-west. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Fears of a global trade war intensify The prospect of a damaging global trade war appears to be edging ever closer, after Trump imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on the US\u2019s traditional allies and raised the stakes in the trade standoff with China. Although economists believe the current round of tariffs can be contained, there are fears of an escalation that would have grave consequences for growth. The World Bank warned in the last month that greater trade tensions could be as bad for world trade as the financial crisis a decade ago. Meanwhile, economists at Oxford Economics said the impact of Trump\u2019s latest threat \u2013 $200bn of additional tariffs on Chinese imports \u2013 could slow US and Chinese GDP growth by as much as 0.3% for both countries. The mounting tensions will worry Britain as ministers look to international markets to strike trade deals as the country leaves the EU.",

      "bodyText": "Warm weather tempting shoppers to spend and inflation holding steady are keeping the British economy on an even keel, despite mounting fears of job losses from a hard Brexit, a Guardian analysis of economic developments over the past month shows. Two years since voters narrowly opted to leave the EU, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news paints a mixed picture, with the biggest monthly fall in manufacturing output for five years eroding the benefits from a rebound in consumer spending. There have also been sharp warnings from major employers including Airbus and BMW over the risk to jobs and investment in Britain posed by a hard Brexit, while more than 100,000 people took to the streets of London last weekend to call for a second referendum. Theresa May will head to Brussels on Thursday for the latest round of talks with the EU amid widening splits in her own party over Brexit and with business leaders\u2019 warnings ringing in her ears. Having confounded the worst forecasts of doomsayers ahead of the vote two years ago, the British economy has since slowed to become one of the worst performing in the developed world and shows increasing signs of fragility. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said the fallout from the \u201cdisastrous\u201d Brexit vote and the government\u2019s \u201ccalamitous\u201d negotiating strategy are having a damaging effect on business investment in the UK. \u201c[Brexit is] scaring businesses to death \u2026 No wonder many thousands demonstrated against the Brexit madness last weekend,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of the referendum outcome on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in five cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows better news for the economy as retail sales jumped by 1.3% in May from a month earlier, comfortably beating expectations for a rise of just 0.5%. Inflation also held steady at 2.4% in May for the second month running, despite petrol prices rising to the highest levels for almost four years. There was more good news from surveys of business activity recorded by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, showing a strong rebound for the UK economy\u2019s dominant services industry, as well as recoveries in output for the manufacturing and construction industry from the slowdown triggered by heavy snowfall and freezing weather earlier in the year. However, the surveys jar with official figures from the Office for National Statistics released over the past month showing the weakest monthly performance for UK factories in April since October 2012. Factory output fell by 1.4% on the previous month, compared with economists\u2019 forecasts for growth of 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, another former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, said reasonably healthy growth for the world economy in the coming months should continue to benefit British manufacturing in the short term. However, writing in the Guardian, he said \u201cthe bigger worries for the UK manufacturing sector relate to the longer-term outlook\u201d. \u201cRecent warnings from a range of manufacturing firms \u2013 including Airbus and BMW \u2013 indicate there could be significant job losses if the Brexit deal creates new trade barriers for manufactured goods,\u201d he said. The concerns are likely to prove troubling at a time when Donald Trump is stepping closer to a full-blown trade war with the US\u2019s major trading partners, which could have a damaging impact for growth. Oxford Economics estimates the trade tariffs pledged by the White House so far could slow economic growth in the US and China by as much as 0.3%, while the World Bank warned of a slowdown for global trade akin to the one seen during the financial crisis. Harley-Davidson plans to shift the production of some of its bikes out of the US in response to retaliatory tariffs on motorcycle imports put forward by the EU, after Trump imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on his traditional allies. There were better signals for the labour market in recent weeks despite the clouds hanging over the economy, with about 146,000 more people able to find a new job between February and April. However the official figures also show a surprise drop in wage growth that could trouble the Bank of England, as it prepares to raise interest rates from as early as August. Threadneedle Street put consumers on notice at the latest meeting of its rate-setting panel for an increase in the cost of borrowing, with the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, arguing in favour of an immediate hike. However, there are warnings from business leaders and some economists against an increase just before Britain leaves the EU. Blanchflower said: \u201cThe UK economy is slowing and the last thing it needs is a rate rise. This is getting embarrassing.\u201d",

Oxford Economics estimates the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/24/tit-for-tat-tariff-battle-could-spark-downturn-in-global-economy-bis\">trade tariffs pledged by the White House so far could slow economic growth</a> in the US and China by as much as 0.3%, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/world-bank-warns-us-trade-war-could-cause-2008-level-crisis\">World Bank warned of a slowdown for global trade</a> akin to the one seen during the financial crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/25/trade-war-fears-hit-markets-trump-targets-china-investments-business-live\">Harley-Davidson plans to shift the production</a> of some of its bikes out of the US in response to retaliatory tariffs on motorcycle imports put forward by the EU, after Trump imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on his traditional allies. </p> <p>There were better signals for the labour market in recent weeks despite the clouds hanging over the economy, with about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/uk-wage-growth-interest-rate-rise-pay-unemployment\">146,000 more people able to find a new job between February and April</a>.

One in every \u00a313 of the extra spending on groceries was on gin, according to new data from research group Kantar, with sales up by \u00a338m, or 1.7m litres \u2013 a 40% rise \u2013 compared with the same 12 weeks a year ago. Helped by recent warm weather, soft drinks and hay fever remedies have also been selling well. The extra \u00a3500m of grocery spending means the UK grocery sector has now witnessed two full years of sustained growth, with sales as as whole rising by 2.1% over the three months. Morrisons, which has championed the sale of so called \u201cwonky\u201d veg \u2013 smaller or misshapen fruit and vegetables \u2013 said its popularity has helped make it the fastest-growing of the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets. The Bradford-based chain increased sales by 1.9% in the last three months and said sales of wonky greengrocery \u2013 which it sells at a lower price as a way to cut down waste \u2013 have more than tripled, according to Kantar. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said the wonky produce was now bought by 12% of shoppers at Morrisons, boosting its own-label sales by 18%. Morrisons also achieved double-digit growth in online sales. Morrisons\u2019 growth was ahead of Asda at 1.8% and Tesco at 1.4%. Sainsbury\u2019s was the only one of the big four chains where sales fell, dropping 0.2%. However, all the major chains continue to lose market share amid rapid growth by discounters including Lidl, Aldi and Iceland, as well as online grocer Ocado. McKevitt said: \u201cThe latest figures largely pre-date the soaring temperatures and newfound optimism for England\u2019s World Cup chances but with the nation spending \u00a3500m more in supermarkets this period compared with last year, it suggests that summer has already arrived for many.\u201d Lidl continues to be the UK\u2019s fastest-growing grocer overall with sales up 10% as it opens new stores around the country. Its fellow German chain Aldi increased sales by 8.2%, taking the two chains\u2019 share of the market to a combined new high of 12.8%.",

The troubled retailer said it had been \u201ca very difficult year\u201d for the firm as it reported a 3.6% fall in sales at its established UK stores in the year to 28 April. Carpetright said trading in the first eight weeks of the current financial year had been heavily disrupted by its restructuring programme, particularly because some suppliers had withdrawn products. The hot weather had also kept customers away, the firm said. The retailer announced its store closure plan in April, putting 300 jobs at risk. It has also asked landlords for rent reductions of up to 50% on 113 more stores under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a process designed to stave off administration as its struggles against a backdrop of weaker consumer spending and a slowdown in the housing market. Announcing the loss, which followed a \u00a3900,000 pretax profit a year earlier, the Carpetright chief executive, Wilf Walsh, said the company was focused on working through its recovery plan. \u201cAfter a difficult trading year impacted by reduced consumer spend, increased competition and the legacy of an unsustainable, over-rented store portfolio \u2013 the CVA and recapitalisation offers us the chance to rebuild Carpetright, which remains the clear market leader in floor coverings with outstanding consumer brand awareness,\u201d he said.
