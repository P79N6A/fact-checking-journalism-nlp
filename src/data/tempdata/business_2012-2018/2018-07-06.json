      "bodyText": "The US added 213,000 jobs in June as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4%, suggesting the start of an international trade war has so far done little to dent the robust jobs market. The US has now added jobs every month for 93 months in a row \u2013 the longest such stretch since records began. The unemployment rate most likely rose as more people who were not looking for work started job searches. There was more good news from previous months. Growth in employment for April was revised up from 159,000 to 175,000, and the change for May was revised up from 223,000 to 244,000. But wage growth, which has been modest for a decade, lagged behind jobs growth again, rising just 2.7% from a year earlier. The latest report from the commerce department comes as the US and China slapped levies of $34bn on each other\u2019s exports amid an escalating trade dispute that now involves all of the US\u2019s largest trading partners. On Thursday the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its latest meeting, noting that business contacts had \u201cexpressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity\u201d. But so far those concerns have not led to a fall in hiring. The report comes after ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said the private sector had added 177,000 jobs in June. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which helps compile the report, said the tight job market, not the trade dispute, was currently the biggest problem faced by US business. \u201cBusiness\u2019 number one problem is finding qualified workers. At the current pace of job growth, if sustained, this problem is set to get much worse. These labor shortages will only intensify across all industries and company sizes,\u201d said Zandi. Economists had been expecting the economy to add 195,000 new jobs over the month and for the unemployment rate to remain steady at 3.8%. The unemployment rate rose in June as 601,000 people entered the job market and the labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of the workforce in employment or looking for work, edged up to 62.9%.",

      "bodyText": "US satellite company EchoStar has walked away from attempts to acquire Inmarsat after a second takeover bid was rejected by its UK rival. EchoStar said it had no intention of making a formal takeover bid on Friday afternoon, after issuing a statement earlier in the day saying that its latest cash and shares offer had been rejected. Shares in Inmarsat closed down 8% at 484p. The second announcement came less than half an hour before a 5pm London deadline set by the UK Takeover Panel for EchoStar to either make a firm offer for Inmarsat or walk away. After EchoStar\u2019s withdrawal, Inmarsat\u2019s board said it remained \u201chighly confident\u201d in its strategy and prospects. EchoStar had been building a small stake in Inmarsat and had its first offer, which was tabled last month, dismissed out of hand. Inmarsat said it \u201csignificantly undervalued\u201d the company. EchoStar\u2019s latest offer values the company at 532p a share, well below the level analysts believe will need to be tabled to win over Inmarsat\u2019s board and get a deal recommended to shareholders. Inmarsat shares were trading at 470p on Friday after news of the rejection of the offer. Analysts at RBC Europe believe it will take a bid of \u201cat least\u201d 750p to gain board or shareholder approval. \u201cGiven the political backdrop (sensitive satellite infrastructure) we believe Echostar is likely to need a recommended offer as a hostile bid could allow the company to seek political protection,\u201d the RBC analyst Wilton Fry said in a note to investors. Inmarsat, which employs more than 1,500 people, has provided technology used by the British armed forces, although its largest single customer is the US military. The London-based company, which has 13 communications satellites in orbit, provided satellite services to the Ministry of Defence to improve ground communications for soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. Its \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d technology was used in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared in 2014 and is believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. The firm has repeatedly won praise from the government, thanks to its leadership position in the British space industry, excluding the Franco-German industrial group Airbus, which has sizeable operations in the UK but is French-owned. The former chancellor George Osborne praised Inmarsat in 2012 as he announced \u00a31.2bn of funding over five years to increase Britain\u2019s role in European space projects. The UK\u2019s place in the European Space Agency, which is working on the \u20ac10bn Galileo satellite navigation system, is uncertain amid the Brexit negotiations. Inmarsat is also a world leader in several cutting-edge technologies such as mobile satellite communications and maritime and aviation safety, while it is among the largest providers of inflight internet services for airlines. Its four Global Xpress satellites provide the world\u2019s only global high-speed broadband operation, with a fifth satellite due to launch next year to increase capacity. It is also working with Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom on the European Aviation Network, which will provide high-speed broadband to air passengers across the continent. EchoStar\u2019s interest is likely to be fuelled in part by Inmarsat\u2019s exposure to the US, given that the US military is the company\u2019s largest single customer.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our Q&amp;A on the new US-China tariffs, and what it might mean for the global economy. Here\u2019s our earlier summary of the trade dispute. Here\u2019s our report from China: And here\u2019s our write-up of the US jobs report. Our rolling coverage of today\u2019s drama starts here, after the US confirmed that it was imposing $34bn of tariffs on China, triggering criticism in Beijing and a rapid retaliation. That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW In other trade spat news, Russia has announced new tariffs on US imports - in retaliation to the US steel and aluminium levies which Donald Trump signed off early this year. This will push the cost of certain US imports up by between 25% and 40%. Economic development minister Maxim Oreshkin explained: In particular, some types of road construction equipment, oil and gas equipment, tools for metal processing and rock drilling, as well as fibre optics are covered.\u201d CNBC have created a very handy list of the Chinese imports subject to America\u2019s new 25% tariffs: Here\u2019s their article on the trade war. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, believes president Trump is trying to squeeze concessions out of China, rather than deliberately cause economic harm. With US elections this autumn, the White House doesn\u2019t want to upset voters, Hobbs argues: \u201cThe drumbeat of a full blown trade war is certainly getting louder, but we still maintain that this is more likely a negotiating strategy on the part of the US administration designed to prise open further a Chinese economy which remains amongst the most protectionist in the world. We are reliant on the presence of US midterm elections in November, as well as a degree of economic self-interest, to act as a restraining force on the US administration. The fact that most of the targeted goods in this latest batch of tariffs go into the supply chains of US multinational manufacturers and originates from companies that aren\u2019t in fact Chinese gives some sense of how complicated, and messy, it is to prosecute a trade war in the modern era of exploded corporate supply chains. On the US jobs report, Capital Economics says: The 213,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in June, which followed an even stronger 244,000 rise in May, provides further evidence that uncertainty over trade policy isn\u2019t yet having a major impact on the economy. It also leaves the Fed firmly on track to raise interest rates twice more by year-end. The Financial Times reports that Chinese social media was gripped by the process of Peak Pegasus, a ship full of American soyabeans, earlier today. Peak Pegasus was in a race against time to reach the port of Dalian before Chinese tariffs took effect. But its efforts were in vain....customs officials had received their orders to implement the new tariffs before it arrived. One of Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisors has predicted that Donald Trump will succeed in shaking up global trade. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told Bloomberg that the president will hammer out reciprocal trade deals in the coming months that will reduce trade barriers. Hassett declared: The president wrote The Art of the Deal... I think we\u2019re going to see those deals soon. So far, though, Trump\u2019s trade moves have pushed up trade barriers. Not only with China too; his 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium have provoked the EU into imposing new levies on US products like motorbikes and orange juice. Americans have been waking up to the news that they are officially in a trade war with China. Ovenight, Washington imposed 25% tariffs on $34bn of Chinese imports - enacting a plan laid out by president Trump earlier this year. The levies mainly affect Chinese technology such as aerospace, IT, and medical kit. The tariffs are part of America\u2019s push against what it sees as China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the move has been criticised in China - with the US labelled \u2018hoodlums\u2019 by local media. Chinese premier Li Keqiang warned it would hurt free trade and multilateral relations. The ministry of commerce warned that America was starting \u201cthe biggest trade war in economic history\u201d. Beijing has also delivered on its threat to make US imports pricier. It retaliated with tariffs on a range of products including soybeans, chemicals and some auto vehicles. Economists are concerned that the trade could intensify in the weeks ahead. Donald Trump has added to these concerns, by suggesting overnight that tariffs could eventually be imposed on $500bn of Chinese imports unless the country changed its ways. Mark Whitehead, manager of the Legg Mason Martin Currie Global Equity Income fund, says these moves could jolt the markets. Investors must therefore be prepared for volatility to intensify. This will particularly be the case if companies pass on any tariffs to consumers, which could stoke inflation. \u201cIf we get a prolonged trade war and the US Federal Reserve continues to raise rates and tighten policy, there is a danger that this combination of headwinds could cause the global economy to slide towards recession.\u201d Farmers in America have voiced their concerns that sales to China - a key market - will suffer. Here are the key charts from today\u2019s US jobs report: The US dollar has fallen against other major currencies, following today\u2019s jobs report - and the underwhelming wage growth. That\u2019s pushing shares up in New York in pre-market trading. Today\u2019s jobs report suggests America\u2019s economy is shrugging off the threat of a trade war. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe explains: The US added 213,000 jobs in June as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4%, suggesting the start of an international trade war has so far done little to dent the robust jobs market. The US has now added jobs every month for 93 months in a row \u2013 the longest such stretch since records began. The unemployment rate most likely rose as more people who were not looking for work started job searches. The tariffs imposed today by the US and China have been overshadowing the global economy for months. Of course, we\u2019ll only see their full impact in the months ahead.... Here\u2019s a snap summary of the US jobs report, from Bloomberg TV Despite the solid job creation in May and June, the US unemployment rate has risen to 4% from 3.8%. It\u2019s the first rise in a year, and might fuel concerns that the jobs market is levelling out. But... this is also because more people are looking for work. This pushed the labor force participation rate up to 62.9%, from 62.7% in May. Newsflash: America\u2019s labour market created more jobs than expected last month, but wage growth remains subdued. The June non-farm payroll, just released, rose by 213,000 - beating forecasts of a 195,000 increase. May\u2019s figure has also been revised higher, from 223,000 to 244,000 - underlining that America is still creating jobs at a decent rate. But disappointingly, average hourly earnings only rose by 0.2% during the month - missing hopes of a 0.3% rise. That kept the annual earnings growth at 2.7%, missing expectations of 2.8%. This suggests that there\u2019s not much wage inflation in America - bad news for workers, but it might take the pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. More to follow... Here\u2019s a video clip of Airbus CEO Tom Enders warning today that Brexit will be damaging for his industry and the UK, whether it\u2019s \u201csoft or hard, light or clean or whatever you call it\u201d. China\u2019s premier has warned that Beijing will respond to Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, even though a trade war isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interests. Li Keqiang told a summit meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, that: \u201cA trade war benefits no-one because it hurts free trade and the multilateral process. \u201cIf a country wants to raise tariffs, China will respond to defend itself.\u201d Li is attending the 7th summit of heads of government of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) and China, which has been slightly overshadowed by the start of the US-Chinese trade war this morning. Paul Donovan of UBS argues that the US and China aren\u2019t in a trade war yet....but they will be, if Trump actually slaps tariffs on $500bn of Chinese imports (as he seemed to threaten last night). Donovan also points out that US consumers will pay these tariffs: The US raised consumer taxes again overnight. $34bn of goods partially made in China now face a 25% tariff. The consumer tax was designed to minimize the impact on the US consumer, which makes it something of an economic practical joke. This is not a trade war - it may redistribute patterns of trade. US President Trump was sounding agitated, threatening to tax US consumers on up to $500bn of US sales (that would be a trade war). This creates uncertainty, which the Federal Reserve warns may damage investment in the US. Even if just \u201cart of the deal\u201d bluster, such talk has a cost that may not easily be reversed. Europe\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, has tweeted that these new tariffs will hurt the global economy: That\u2019s a non-too-subtle rebuttal of Trump\u2019s claim that trade wars are good and easy to win. US farmers are understandably concerned about the trade war, which could badly dent their exports. China is the biggest single market for US soybeans, buying more than half the country\u2019s production. They\u2019ve now less attractive due to the additional 25% tariff being levied by Chinese officials at the border, which might increase demand for Brazilian soy instead. Brent Bible, an Indiana farmer who grows corn and soy, says the trade war has already caused damage, driving down the price of soybeans in the wholesale market. This means farmers are reluctant to invest in new equipment and storage, Bible told the New York Times, adding: \u201cIf we\u2019re not spending money then other industries aren\u2019t making any money off of us, either.\u201d The financial markets continue to take the trade war in their stride. European equities are a little higher, after a positive day in Asia. Donald Trump\u2019s claim overnight that he could eventually impose tariffs on $500bn of Chinese imports - a truly colossal sum - hasn\u2019t caused any obvious panic. Arnaud Masset of Switzerland\u2019s online bank Swissquote, says investors don\u2019t really know where they stand: The dollar index was down 0.10% to 94.30, the single currency rose 0.20% to 1.1715, while the Swiss franc and Japanese yen were treading water. The Chinese yuan was down only 0.10%. Equities were blinking green across the screen, while bond yields were relatively stable on both side of the Atlantic. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that tariffs actually hurt the country imposing them, as well as their target. Newsflash: China has joined Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, by imposing retaliatory tariffs of 25% on $34bn of US goods. The Xinhua news agency is reporting that China\u2019s tariffs came into effect at 12.01pm Beijing time - shortly after America fired the opening salvo. The list of products affected includes US fruit and vegetables (from apricots to soy beans), cigars, chemicals, some vehicles, a wide array of chemicals (including crude Benzene and various adhesives), plastics and some medical equipment. The latest reading for the productivity of British workers is out, and they\u2019re unlikely to cheer the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has made boosting efficiency one of his top priorities. According to the Office for National Statistics, economic output per hour of work dropped by 0.4% in the first three months of 2018 from the final quarter of last year, amid a strong increase for employment across the UK. When more people contribute to the economy without generating increased levels of economic output, productivity falls. The reading is worrying because higher rates of productivity tend to lead to greater increase in pay - which has grown at a pitiful rate in the UK since the financial crisis. Comparing the first quarter to the same period a year ago, productivity growth increased by a healthier-sounding 0.9%. However, the ONS said this growth remains below the average pre-downturn of 2%, continuing the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d. Economists are perplexed as to why the UK has failed to return productivity growth towards the pre-crisis average, although many fear falling business investment as Britain leaves the EU could make the problem worse. That\u2019s because companies spending on machinery and better technology tends to boost the efficiency of workers. Newsflash: Airbus says is already taking steps to protect itself from Brexit damage: Airbus CEO Tom Enders insists he isn\u2019t trying to meddle in UK politics - despite launching such a stinging attack on the government. Airbus is \u2018going for broke\u2019 in its attempts to avoid a damaging hard Brexit, reckons Tom Macleod of Sky News. John Collingridge of the Sunday Times says the government really should listen to major businesses like Airbus (rather than just swearing about them, foreign secretary....) Back in Britain, the boss of Airbus has launched an absolutely blistering attack on the UK government\u2019s Brexit strategy. CEO Tom Enders has told reporters that Theresa May\u2019s administration has \u201cno clue\u201d about how to execute Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union without causing \u2018severe harm\u2019. My colleague Rob Davies is attending Airbus\u2019s annual media briefing, and reports. Last month, Airbus warned that it could be forced to stop making aircraft wings in Britain, if Brexit disrupts its access to the European customs union. This new intervention comes as Cabinet ministers head to Chequers for their own crunch talks on Brexit, where Theresa May faces a battle with ministers... Anticipation is building in the markets, as traders wonder when China will deliver on its promised retaliation. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Beijing is \u201cteasing the markets\u201d by delaying its response to America\u2019s move, making it clear that the US fired the first shots. Technically, I think the \u2018tat\u2019 comes first.... (as in the successful \u2018tit for two tats\u2019 game theory strategy). The American Chamber of Commerce in China has appealed to both sides to negotiate a settlement. Chairman William Zarit warned: \u201cThere are no winners in a trade war. We urge the two governments to come back to the negotiation table.\u201d \u201cBuy on the sound of cannons\u201d is an old City maxim. And today, traders are buying on the sound of tariffs. Asian stock markets have actually risen today, despite Donald Trump pulling the trigger on Chinese imports. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index has gained 1%, with Hong Kong close behind. Traders may be relieved that the waiting is over - these tariffs have been hanging over our heads for weeks! Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains: The first batch of US tariffs on China came into force \u2013 it is a milestone in the trade war but a very well-telegraphed one. China said it\u2019s forced to retaliate, but did not specify a time-frame, helping risk appetite. Trump repeated his claim that China is \u201ckilling us\u201d on trade at a rally in Montana last night \u2013 but his pattern so far has been to respond to the response \u2013 so China\u2019s delay in retaliation may slow down the war. China\u2019s newspapers are very critical of Donald Trump for launching the trade war, accusing the US president of leading a \u2018gang of hoodlums\u2019. Our Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, reports: \u201cIf what the US wants is to escalate a trade war with China, then so be it. A little fighting may be the only way the Trump administration clears its mind and allows everyone to sober up,\u201d the state-run Global Times said on Friday. \u201cThe Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China,\u201d said an English-language article in the China Daily. On Thursday, a spokesperson for China\u2019s ministry of commerce said the US will be \u201copening fire on the whole world and also opening fire on itself.\u201d We\u2019re now awaiting Beijing\u2019s formal retaliation. China has swiftly hit back, accusing the United States of starting \u201cthe biggest trade war in economic history\u201d The country\u2019s Commerce Ministry said imposing tariffs on $34bn of Chinese sales into America would hurt the global economy, damage large companies and consumers. A ministry spokesman added: \u201cChina is forced to strike back to safeguard core national interests and the interests of its people.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The trade war between America and China has begun, as Donald Trump delivers on his threat to hit $34bn of Chinese imports with new 25% tariffs. Washington imposed the new tariffs at midnight East Coast time, as Donald Trump had outlined in June. The move means US customs officials must now collecting 25% tariffs on more than 800 Chinese products, including aerospace, IT, robotics and industrial machinery. Tariffs on another $16bn of Chinese goods are expected in a couple of weeks. China has already vowed to hit back, of course, and has lined up tariffs on $34bn of US goods \u2014 such as soya beans, electric vehicles, seafood and pork. That could hurt America\u2019s agricultural base. Last night, Trump told reporters that the US could impose more tariffs if China retaliates, with officials working on a second wave of $200bn of imports. Speaking on Air Force One, he floated the idea of tariffs on an extra $300bn of Chinese goods, on top of what has been lined up . The president explained: \u201c34 [billion dollars], and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then as you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.\u201d Such an escalation would seriously roil the financial markets, and risk chilling global growth. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned yesterday, a full-blown trade war risks damaging the world economy, including America. Also coming up today The pound could be volatile as the British cabinet meets to debate Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan. Brexiteers are already criticising the PM\u2019s latest attempt to limit the economic damage of leaving the EU, claiming it would prevent a decent trade deal with the US. It could be a long and testing day at Chequers. We also discover how many jobs were created in America last month. June\u2019s non-farm payroll is expected to rise by 195,000, compared with the 223,000 new jobs in May. Economists hope that wage growth picked up, to 2.8% per year from 2.7%.

      "bodyText": "A number of supermarket chains have been forced to recall thousands of bags of own-brand frozen vegetables because of fears that they could contain a deadly bacteria. The Food Standards Agency said 43 frozen products, including sweetcorn and mixed vegetables \u2013 sold by retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl \u2013 had been recalled by Greenyard, one of the largest suppliers of fruit and vegetables. It is feared the frozen vegetables could contain listeria monocytogenes, which can cause listeriosis, a rare illness responsible for the death of two people in the UK last year. Since 2015, there have been 47 reported cases, nine of which were fatal. Outbreaks have also affected Austria, Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Last week the Hungarian food safety authorities banned the sale of frozen vegetables produced by a Greenyard plant in Hungary over the past two years. It also ordered retailers to withdraw the products from their shelves and alert customers in an effort to contain the outbreak. All freezing activity at the plant has been stopped. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said it had detected strains of listeria in products manufactured at the processing plant as far back as 2015. This suggests strains of the bug have persisted in the factory despite cleaning and disinfection procedures being carried out. Initially the source of the bacteria was thought to be sweetcorn, but EFSA said it was possible that other vegetables were also contaminated. Greenyard said: \u201cWe take this very seriously. We stopped our production in Hungary for an in-depth review and will not restart before the root cause is found and eliminated.\u201d",

The report urges planning in town centres to include alternatives to retail, including housing and entertainment. Grimsey urges the creation of community hubs to replace empty shops, which would appear to be a positive step forward. Indeed, planners and entrepreneurs could be missing a trick here \u2013 empty shops mean new opportunities for business, but why limit our horizons to merely replacing retail jobs with entertainment? Most towns are saturated with cinemas and restaurants, although young people would benefit from more sports facilities, eg skate parks. Surely we need an alternative vision for community regeneration, one that gives opportunities to social enterprises such as day centres for elderly people. The large empty retail premises could be easily converted into spacious centres perhaps based on the Japanese model of centres for wellbeing and purposeful activity. The retail assistants mourning their former jobs could embrace a different type of employment. However, as a society we need to seismically shift our perspectives and attitudes towards social care from regarding it as a distress purchase to a holistic component of everyday life. Mary Gameson Norwich \u2022 The urban calamity wrought from favouring out-of-town retail malls was brought home in this heatwave trying in vain to buy a simple tub of soft scoop in Paisley\u2019s town centre. If I wanted tattoos, sunbed hire, e-cigarettes, discarded entertainments in retro formats from the perma-jumble sale charity shops, or a PO box for dubious internet shopping, I would be in seventh heaven \u2013 so long as I was happy to survive on takeaways. Soon expensive M&amp;S will have a retail food monopoly in Paisley town centre. Fourteen miles away, the little village of Lochwinnoch has two central mini-marts \u2013 two more than Paisley with 29 times its population. Mark Boyle Johnstone, Renfrewshire \u2022 One area is booming \u2013 the coffee sector, which is set to grow by almost 50% by 2022. Evidence suggests that coffee shops are also supporting their neighbours on the high street with research showing that 75% of people spend money in local shops when drinking coffee on-the-go. However, this cash injection is under threat from a proposed \u201clatte levy\u201d or \u201ctea tax\u201d, with 33% saying that a tax on recyclable paper cups would reduce the times they visited the high street. Those calling for a levy need to ask whether this added damage is proportionate given that paper cups are fully recyclable and make up just 0.7% of packaging waste.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Airbus has accused the government of having \u201cno clue\u201d on how to leave the EU without harming the economy, as the prime minister hosted a summit at Chequers aimed at uniting the cabinet behind a Brexit plan. The criticism from the aerospace firm, which employs 14,000 people in the UK, is the strongest intervention yet from the business community on the risk of a hard Brexit and came in the same week that Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s largest carmaker, warned its UK operations with 40,000 staff were under threat. Speaking at a briefing in London before the Farnborough air show later this month, the Airbus chief executive, Tom Enders, said: \u201cThe sun is shining brightly on the UK, the English team is progressing towards the [World Cup] final, the RAF is preparing to celebrate its centenary and Her Majesty\u2019s government still has no clue, no consensus on how to execute Brexit without severe harm.\u201d Enders said Airbus, a Franco-German group that supports a further 100,000 UK jobs in its supply chain, was wary of all types of Brexit, including a worst-case no-deal scenario. \u201cRest assured that we are taking first preparations as we speak in order to mitigate consequences from whatever Brexit scenario may follow,\u201d he said. \u201cBrexit in whatever form, soft or hard, light or clean, whatever you call it, will be damaging for industry, for our industry and damaging for the UK, whatever the outcome will be.\u201d The company has previously said that a hard Brexit could force it to leave the UK, where it builds wings for its aircraft at facilities such as Broughton, in north Wales. Enders said uncertainty over the nature of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU was \u201cvery discomforting\u201d and it was the company\u2019s duty to speak up about the issue. \u201cOur interference is not to play politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe it to our stakeholders to be truthful about the consequences and those would be severe in the event of an unorderly [sic] or hard Brexit. Let\u2019s see what comes out of Chequers: white smoke, black smoke or no smoke.\u201d He warned of the danger that the UK could leave the European Aviation Safety Agency, which he said would see the process by which parts are certified for use in aircraft fall apart. \u201cThat could be a very troubling situation that could eventually lead to a standstill of production,\u201d Enders said. \u201cAfter all the time that has been spent and lost on this process \u2013 and the situation being as it is \u2013 that\u2019s not a scenario we can exclude.\u201d Guillaume Faury, the president of the commercial aircraft division of Airbus, said the company was already asking parts suppliers to ramp up production in case its supply chain was disrupted by Brexit, but warned many would struggle to do so. The request is intended to ensure Airbus has enough parts in reserve to last for three months if a no-deal Brexit slows down the movement of components across borders. \u201cLet\u2019s assume we want a three-month buffer for UK suppliers of parts to aeroplanes in France and Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to start producing 35% more parts during the next nine months to prepare just a three-month buffer, to give time to adapt. Most suppliers are at max production already today.\u201d After Enders refused to comment any further on Brexit, it was left to Faury to say that Airbus was not bluffing about the possibility of winding down investment in the UK. \u201cYou bluff when there is a benefit for bluffing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went public because we see the risks growing and we need decisions. We need clarity to prepare ourselves.\u201d Airbus was joined this week by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in voicing concern about the dangers of a hard Brexit. JLR said a bad Brexit deal would force it to reconsider \u00a380bn of investment planned for the UK, putting 40,000 jobs at risk. Carmakers including Nissan, BMW and the Vauxhall owners, PSA \u2013 as well as the industry trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders \u2013 have also voiced concern about the lack of clarity on the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Rolls-Royce said on Thursday it had drawn up contingency plans to move design approval out of the UK to Germany because of uncertainty about the shape of Brexit. While Airbus reserved most of its criticism for the British government, Enders said the company was also lobbying the European Union to ensure continued cooperation on defence and security, including multinational projects such as the Galileo GPS navigation system. \u201cIf there\u2019s one company in Europe that makes its voice heard, not just in London but Paris in Brussels and Berlin, it\u2019s Airbus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would not understand if the UK falls out of the Galileo project. \u201cBeyond all the bickering and tactics and negotiation, both sides have a strong interest for further close cooperation with the UK on security and defence matters. There are only two serious military forces in the EU today and one is the UK. Guess who is the other; it\u2019s not Germany.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What is a tariff? Tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports. Importers pay the applicable charges at the point of entry to the customs agency of the country or economic bloc imposing them. Rather than being used to raise revenue, they are imposed to increase the price of foreign goods in order to make domestic produce comparatively cheaper, with the aim of encouraging domestic production by protecting local firms from global competition. According to tariff supporters, this can help to save jobs that might otherwise go overseas. Why is Trump targeting China with tariffs? Donald Trump believes Beijing is using unfair trade practices to gain an advantage on the US, which he says includes the \u201ctheft and abuse\u201d of intellectual property rights of US firms, such as Hollywood films or IT systems. He has also accused China of subsidising steel exports in a practice amounting to dumping \u2013 selling a product at an artificially low price \u2013 on the rest of the world, which he argues has hurt jobs in the US. He also takes issue with the size of the US trade deficit, or the imbalance between exports and imports, with China. How big is US trade with China? According to official figures, the US racked up a trade in goods deficit of $375.6bn (\u00a3283.1bn) with China last year, meaning America bought far more from the world\u2019s second largest economy than it has managed to sell to it. US exports of goods totalled $129.9bn last year, while imports from China were $505.5bn. Exports to China support about 1m American jobs, according to the US-China Business Council, while aircraft and soybeans are the most valuable items sold to China. Mobile phones, computers, toys and games are the biggest imports to the US from China. What goods are affected? The White House is imposing tariffs on Chinese goods including boats, aircraft engines, nuclear reactors and other industrial and agricultural machinery, as part of a wide-ranging list of 818 types of product. The US has imposed tariffs worth $34bn on China so far, although it will introduce a second round covering 284 more products at a later date, taking the total to $50bn. Beijing is targeting the same value of goods, although has taken a different approach to slap tariffs on fewer American goods across broader categories. Its list includes soybeans, which will hit agricultural communities usually loyal to the president, as well as other goods such as cotton, corn, tobacco and cars. How will it affect other economies? Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned this week that further escalation of Trump\u2019s trade disputes would hurt the American economy most, with potential to lower US economic growth by around 5%. Publishing forecasts by the UK\u2019s central bank, Carney warned that the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest grocery retailer is targeting the growing number of Britons who live or eat alone by significantly expanding its range of single-portion foods. Tesco is selling solitary beef burgers and steak fillets, hand-sized packets of new potatoes and broccoli \u2013 and even shrunk-down bottles of sauvignon blanc \u2013 as it targets an increasingly important demographic. The retailer has increased the size of its single-serve range by nearly 40% this year to 430 products. The growing number of single-person households has been one of the biggest societal trends since the second world war. Official figures released last year counted 7.7m such households compared with 6.6m in 1996. The shift is particularly marked among baby boomers, with a 53% increase in the number of 45 to 64-year-olds living alone because of declining marriage rates and divorce. \u201cIt\u2019s about offering choice,\u201d Kate Ewart, Tesco\u2019s head of product development, said. \u201cTime-pressed customers want to find healthy, quick and convenient meals in the size that matches the occasion.\u201d The meals-for-one market is worth more than \u00a320bn, with analysis of purchasing habits showing choices heavily skewed towards buying ready meals, salads and quick meals like beans on toast. This has led big food manufacturers such as Premier Foods, which own brands including Batchelors and Lloyd Grossman, to launch convenience foods such as single-serve pasta pots and sauce pouches. For decades supermarkets have focused on feeding families with buy-one-get-one-free promotions and supersized grocery packs that only make sense if the buyer has lots of mouths to feed. However, ever-shifting meal times in busy households mean that four in 10 meals or snacks are consumed alone, according to the grocery industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel. It calculates that Britons are eating an extra 186m meals on their own annually compared with only three years ago. \u201cSmall households have a lot of buying power and shop very differently to family shoppers,\u201d said Joanna Parman, an analyst at the data firm Nielsen. Its recent shopper poll found 18% shoppers wanted to buy smaller pack sizes. \u201cHouseholds with one or two people are more likely to shop little and often rather than doing a large weekly shop,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s the older, small households that have the most dispensable income and are spending the most on food and drink.\u201d Tesco\u2019s decision to offer more single meal options is not just about appealing to this group. Its research has found that increasingly families do not eat together and if they do gather around the kitchen table, they might eat different dishes as dietary regimes such as veganism surge in popularity. New lines in the Tesco single-serve range include upmarket wood-fired pizza slices and pitta breads sold in packets of two rather than six. The retailer believes smaller packs, which can still cost more than larger packs per gram, will help households chip away at the UK\u2019s food waste mountain. Around \u00a313bn of food is thrown away by households each year, according to the government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap. It calculates that the average Briton wastes \u00a3200 of food a year while it rises to \u00a3700 for those with children. \u201cThe way supermarkets are set up makes it almost impossible to shop for one,\u201d Phillip Adcock, the managing director at the shopper research agency SBXL, said. \u201cWe have been educated to buy more for less.\u201d \u201cBut supermarkets are doing everything they can to be more convenient,\u201d said Adcock, who warned their motives for backing the trend are unlikely to be entirely altruistic. \u201cPlug your brains in customers because they are going to charge more for it.\u201d The big supermarkets are being forced to adapt to changing shopper behaviour as Britons shun the big weekly shop in favour of more frequent small shops at convenience stores on their way home from work or use takeaway delivery services such as Deliveroo. Multibuy deals such as bogofs (buy one get one free), which were once a potent supermarket sales tactic, are disappearing from the aisles as big chains like Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s focus on straightforward price cuts as they battle the fast-growing German discount chains Aldi and Lidl.",

The shift is particularly marked among baby boomers, with a 53% increase in the number of 45 to 64-year-olds living alone because of declining marriage rates and divorce.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about offering choice,\u201d Kate Ewart, Tesco\u2019s head of product development, said. \u201cTime-pressed customers want to find healthy, quick and convenient meals in the size that matches the occasion.\u201d</p> <p>The meals-for-one market is worth more than \u00a320bn, with analysis of purchasing habits showing choices heavily skewed towards buying ready meals, salads and quick meals like beans on toast. This has led big food manufacturers such as Premier Foods, which own brands including Batchelors and Lloyd Grossman, to launch convenience foods such as single-serve pasta pots and sauce pouches.</p> <p></p> <p>For decades supermarkets have focused on feeding families with buy-one-get-one-free promotions and supersized grocery packs that only make sense if the buyer has lots of mouths to feed. However, ever-shifting meal times in busy households mean that four in 10 meals or snacks are consumed alone, according to the grocery industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel. It calculates that Britons are eating an extra 186m meals on their own annually compared with only three years ago.</p> <p>\u201cSmall households have a lot of buying power and shop very differently to family shoppers,\u201d said Joanna Parman, an analyst at the data firm Nielsen. Its recent shopper poll found 18% shoppers wanted to buy smaller pack sizes.</p> <p>\u201cHouseholds with one or two people are more likely to shop little and often rather than doing a large weekly shop,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s the older, small households that have the most dispensable income and are spending the most on food and drink.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco\u2019s decision to offer more single meal options is not just about appealing to this group. Its research has found that increasingly families do not eat together and if they do gather around the kitchen table, they might eat different dishes as dietary regimes <a href=\"tel:www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/vegans-are-coming-millennials-health-climate-change-animal-welfare\">such as veganism</a> surge in popularity.</p> <p>New lines in the Tesco single-serve range include upmarket wood-fired pizza slices and pitta breads sold in packets of two rather than six. The retailer believes smaller packs, which can still cost more than larger packs per gram, will help households chip away at the UK\u2019s food waste mountain.<br></p> <p>Around \u00a313bn of food is thrown away by households each year, according to the government\u2019s waste advisory body, <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/work-underway-retailers-farmers-and-growers-tackle-food-waste-farm\">Wrap</a>. It calculates that the average Briton wastes \u00a3200 of food a year while it rises to \u00a3700 for those with children.</p> <p>\u201cThe way supermarkets are set up makes it almost impossible to shop for one,\u201d Phillip Adcock, the managing director at the shopper research agency SBXL, said. \u201cWe have been educated to buy more for less.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut supermarkets are doing everything they can to be more convenient,\u201d said Adcock, who warned their motives for backing the trend are unlikely to be entirely altruistic. \u201cPlug your brains in customers because they are going to charge more for it.\u201d</p> <p>The big supermarkets are being forced to adapt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/04/convenience-stores-tesco-booker-deal\">changing shopper behaviour as Britons shun the big weekly shop in favour of more frequent small shops</a> at convenience stores on their way home from work or use takeaway delivery services such as Deliveroo. </p> <p>Multibuy deals such as bogofs (buy one get one free), which were once a potent supermarket sales tactic, are disappearing from the aisles as big chains like Tesco and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/sainsburys-suffers-sales-decline-after-end-of-multibuy-discounts\">Sainsbury\u2019s focus on straightforward price cuts</a> as they battle the fast-growing German discount chains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi\">Aldi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl\">Lidl</a>.</p>",

The mortgage lender said June\u2019s 0.3% increase was not enough to stop the annual rate of house price growth falling for the third month in a row. It stands at 1.8%, which compares with about 4% last autumn. The new figures follow a period of seemingly volatile and conflicting house price data, although on this occasion the Halifax\u2019s data is broadly in line with that of its main rival. Nationwide building society said prices rose by 0.5% in June, and that annual price growth was running at 2% \u2013 the lowest figure for five years. Russell Galley, the Halifax\u2019s managing director, said property values remained broadly flat, amid relatively low levels of market activity. However, he added: \u201cWe continue to see very positive factors of continuing low mortgage rates, great affordability levels and a robust labour market. The continuing shortage of properties for sale should also continue to support price growth.\u201d The Halifax is sticking with its forecast that prices will rise by up to 3% this year. It puts the current average price at \u00a3225,654, which is \u00a32,400 down on March. The earlier months of this year were marked by volatility. According to the lender, UK prices leapt 1.6% in March, dropped by 3.1% in April, the steepest monthly fall since 2010, and then rose by 1.7% in May. Commenting on the figures, Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and the former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: \u201cOnce again, we are seeing a market in subdued mode, supported broadly for some time by low interest rates and unemployment, as well as more specifically by low stock.\u201d He added that on the ground \u201cwe have reached the limit of what many buyers can afford, so this is not a correction, more a realignment of prices to reflect changes in circumstances\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s dismal track record on improving worker productivity since the financial crisis continued in the first three months of the year, amid mounting concern Brexit will further damage the efficiency growth required for boosting wages. Economic output per hour of work dropped in the UK by 0.4% in the first quarter after a rise of 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017, according to the latest snapshot from the Office for National Statistics. The rate of growth for labour productivity in the first quarter was up 0.9% compared with the same period a year ago, about half the average rate notched up across Britain in the years before the 2008 financial crisis. Prior to the downturn the average rate of growth stood at 2%. The figures will disappoint the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, who consider a boost to productivity as one of their top targets in government. Economists believe increasing worker efficiency could help to lift pay growth out of the doldrums as companies would be able to generate greater profits with the same resources \u2013 enabling them to pay higher wages. The ONS said the latest fall in productivity came after strong employment growth in the UK earlier this year. When more people contribute to the economy without generating greater levels of economic output, productivity falls. Economists argue Britain has created hundreds of thousands of low-paid jobs since the crisis began a decade ago, rather than opting to invest in technology and skills to boost the number of higher-paid jobs. Tej Parikh, a senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cWe\u2019re hiring more people than ever, yet each worker is unable to produce much more. This means businesses cannot offer inflation-beating wages and that our long-term economic growth potential remains constrained.\u201d There are fears Brexit could make matters worse, as companies put their investment decisions on hold amid the political uncertainty \u2013 with recent warnings coming from firms such as BMW and Airbus. Higher levels of business investment tend to lift the rate of productivity growth, because spending on machinery and technology can boost the efficiency of workers. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said it was highly possible several companies would take on staff rather than commit to investment, given the highly uncertain economic and political outlook. \u201cThere is a risk that extended uncertainty and concerns over the UK\u2019s economic outlook could end up weighing down on business investment and damaging productivity. Prolonged difficult Brexit negotiations could increase this risk.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High street sales fell for the fifth month in a row in June, according to a survey that suggested bricks and mortar retailers have endured the worst first half year of trading in more than a decade. UK high street sales fell 1.7% year-on-year in June, the fifth consecutive month of falling sales, according to data released by advisory firm BDO, which bases its finding on a survey of mostly medium-sized retail businesses. It is the first time in at least 12 years that in-store growth had not topped 1% in a single month for the first half of a calendar year. Sophie Michael, the head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said: \u201cThe bleak and crippling start to the year shows no sign of abating, with deep discounting set to eat into [profit] margins that are already being stretched paper-thin by poor sales and rising costs, including the much discussed issue of unfair business rates on high street retailers.\u201d MPs and retail bosses have called on the government to rethink business rates as rising costs, a shift to online shopping and low consumer confidence have already led to a series of high street failures with well established chains including House of Fraser, New Look, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright all closing dozens of shops. Business leaders say rates, the tax levied on the value of a commercial property, unfairly discriminate in favour of online specialists such as Amazon, Asos and Ocado. But the chancellor warned in a letter published on Friday there would be no quick relief on business rates. In response to a letter from Nicky Morgan, who chairs parliament\u2019s Treasury committee, Philip Hammond said there was no consensus on an alternative to rates and many of the ideas proffered \u201cwere not without their own issues\u201d. Hammond said the government had undertaken a fundamental review of business rates in 2016 after which it decided to keep business rates as a property tax. \u201cRespondents to the review agreed that property based taxes were easy to collect, difficult to avoid, relatively stable compared to other taxes and had a clear link to local authority spending.\u201d Referring to competition from the likes of Amazon, which is being addressed by a government consultation on taxation of digital firms, Hammond said: \u201cI have been clear that we need to find a better way of taxing the digital economy and we are making progress on this issue.\u201d But he said further consideration of a new digital tax was needed before considering any changes to business rates. Morgan said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that many bricks and mortar stores are struggling to remain competitive against online retailers, with the chancellor admitting that business rates can represent a high fixed cost for some businesses.\u201d",
