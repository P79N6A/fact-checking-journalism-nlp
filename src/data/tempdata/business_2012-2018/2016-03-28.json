      "bodyText": "Fears over the UK\u2019s faltering economic outlook have been underlined by a survey showing a sharp drop in confidence among financial services firms, against the backdrop of the Chinese slowdown and the EU referendum. Optimism among companies in the UK\u2019s financial sector has fallen at the fastest rate since 2011, reflecting a backdrop of tumultuous markets and worries about a global economic slowdown. The downbeat outlook from one of the UK\u2019s key sectors - which accounts for around 10% of GDP - will add to fears that the economy will slow this year amid global pressures and domestic challenges. The survey also indicated that banks in the UK are preparing to cut more jobs. The CBI/PwC financial services survey showed banking and investment management were the gloomiest sub-sectors, while confidence was holding up better among building societies and insurance companies. \u201cConcerns over China and a volatile start to the year for markets, alongside uncertainty about a possible Brexit, have created a perfect storm to dampen optimism in financial services,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, the director for economics at business lobby group the CBI. George Osborne was forced to concede in this month\u2019s budget that UK growth would be much slower than previously expected this year and next. The chancellor has blamed a weaker global economy but the government\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has flagged problems closer to home, most notably a weaker productivity outlook for the UK. The CBI poll of 104 companies highlighted financial market instability, competition from within the sector and macroeconomic uncertainty as the top three challenges facing financial services over the coming year. The quarterly survey showed that the volume of business at financial services firms was continuing to expand \u201cat a solid pace\u201d, while profitability improved, albeit at the slowest pace for almost two years. However, Newton-Smith added that the EU referendum on 23 June could have hit sector confidence. \u201cAs we know from talking to CBI members, now that the referendum date has been set some investment decisions have been put on hold by some firms, though this is not widespread.\u201d Some business surveys have identified an impact on consumer and corporate confidence in the runup to the EU referendum. The Bank of England has linked a sharp fall in the value of the pound to uncertainty around the vote outcome. The CBI has been vocal in its support for Britain staying in the EU. It says 80% of its membership wants to remain and that only 5% would support Brexit. The lobby group recently published an analysis claiming Brexit would cause a serious shock to the UK economy, which could lead to 950,000 job losses and leave the average household \u00a33,700 worse off by 2020. Campaigners for the UK to leave the EU have questioned the findings. They counter that by leaving the EU, the UK can gain more control over trade and employment rules and they argue that staying in the bloc harms the UK\u2019s economic prospects. The CBI\u2019s survey showed that compared with three months earlier, 14% of financial services firms were more optimistic and 35% were less optimistic, giving a balance of -21%. For banking alone the picture was more downbeat, with a balance of -48% indicating the sharpest drop in confidence since the depths of the global downturn in 2008-09. Overall, more financial services firms reported that profits had increased rather than fallen. But with a net balance of just +13% reporting an increase, profit growth appeared to have slowed from the previous quarter, when the balance was +42%. Employment in financial services increased in the last quarter. It is expected to remain flat in the next three months, however, with increases in the insurance and building society sectors offset by another sharp fall in headcount in banking, the report said. Last month, Lloyds Banking Group revealed it was cutting 1,755 jobs and closing 29 branches, while earlier this month Royal Bank of Scotland said it was cutting more than 400 investment banking jobs in the UK and laying off 550 investment advisers. Financial firms have been under pressure to cut costs as their productivity has fallen in recent years. Falling staff costs at banks had helped bring down total costs for the financial sector for the first time in more than a year, the CBI survey suggested. London listings on hold The London share listings market has had a slow start to 2016 with companies putting IPOs on hold until after the EU referendum, says consultancy EY. In the first quarter of this year there were 15 initial public offerings (IPOs) \u2013 nine on the main market and six on the junior AIM market, raising \u00a31.65bn. That compares with 13 listings over the previous quarter that raised a much-higher \u00a34bn between them, according to EY\u2019s IPO Eye report. But Scott McCubbin, an IPO expert at the consultancy, said London remains the leading market in Europe for public listings and that the pipeline for future listings was strong with companies looking at dates towards the final quarter of this year and into 2017. \u201cThe UK has experienced a slow start to 2016, brought about largely by market volatility, concerns regarding slowing economic growth and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum,\u201d said McCubbin.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are struggling to recruit skilled workers and keep pace with global technology, according to an industry report that criticises the government for lack of support. Three-quarters of companies say they have faced difficulties finding the right workers in the last three years, according to business group EEF. It warns a skills shortage is putting productivity growth at risk and adding to pressure on manufacturers as they battle a host of pressures in domestic and overseas markets. The report comes just weeks after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cut its forecast for potential productivity, or what workers in the UK can produce an hour, triggering warnings of damage to living standards, wages and government tax receipts. Quality and quantity of candidates lacking The latest evidence of skills shortages adds to gloomy news from the manufacturing sector, which has slumped into recession in the face of tough export markets, steel plant closures and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. The EEF says the struggle to find the right people with the right skills is compounding those problems. It predicts demand for skills will rocket and urges the government to launch grants for apprenticeships and reform the education system to ensure leavers\u2019 skills match needs of businesses. Technology is manufacturing globally, with increasing automation of production in sectors such as car-making. In turn, that has increased demand for new skills such as programmers for robots. In the wider economy there have been warnings of large-scale job losses from the so-called fourth industrial revolution. The World Economic Forum has predicted more than 7m jobs are at risk in the world\u2019s largest economies over the next five years as technological advances in fields such as robotics and 3D printing transform the world of work. The EEF claims that ministers are not matching industry\u2019s efforts to tackle a skills crunch, such as in-house training programmes and competitive pay packages. \u201cWe still struggle to find a sufficient number of candidates to satisfy the demands of our sector, and too many candidates lack the skills that manufacturers need,\u201d said EEF\u2019s chief executive, Terry Scuoler. \u201cHad manufacturers not already been taking action, we would arguably now be over the cliff-edge, not just approaching it.\u201d Two-thirds of manufacturers cited a lack of technical skills among applicants and almost as many, 64%, said there was an insufficient number of candidates, according to the EEF\u2019s survey of 239 companies. Hard-to-fill posts The group also highlights government figures showing that the proportion of hard-to-fill vacancies in manufacturing remained at 35% in 2015 \u2013 unchanged from 2013 and worse than in 2011 when it was at 30%. Those figures from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills put hard-to-fill vacancies for all sectors in the UK together at 33%. The EEF predicts recruitment difficulties will intensify given manufacturers expect their demand for skilled workers to rise over the next three years. Almost six in 10 (59%) expect to need more production-related technical skills and almost half expect to need more staff with IT skills, according to the skills report. Overall, 72% of companies said they were worried about acquiring the skills their business will need in the next three years. Companies in the survey said they were offering training and flexible working to help, with eight in 10 planning to recruit manufacturing and engineering apprentices in the next 12 months. The EEF used its report to renew its complaints over the cost to employers from a new national living wage coming in this week and an anticipated apprenticeship levy due to start next year. It also demanded more help on skills from the government, which has pledged a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d and less reliance on consumer spending to fuel economic growth. Responding to the report, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) said the government was working closely with manufacturers to raise productivity and had already cut red tape and invested \u00a36.9bn in the UK\u2019s research infrastructure. A BIS spokeswoman added: \u201cWe are supporting employers up and down the country to address skills challenges by pressing ahead with our reforms to education, skills training and higher education, making sure every young person has the skills employers need now and for the jobs of the future. That includes with the new apprenticeship levy putting employers back in the driving seat.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Netflix's breaking good: from DVD mail-order firm to UK's top streaming service", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, when Netflix was just a DVD mail-order business based in California, co-founder Reed Hastings vowed to built the \u201cleading company\u201d in the then-emerging online consumer entertainment business. Last week figures from the TV ratings body Barb showed Hastings\u2019 vision had become reality in the UK. Barb estimated that more than 5m British homes subscribed to Netflix in 2015, compared with 1.6m for rivals Amazon Prime Instant Video and fewer than 1m for Sky\u2019s internet service Now TV. That means Netflix is now in nearly a quarter of UK households, with 1.4m joining the streaming service in 2015 alone to watch hit series such as the political thriller House of Cards. Business research company IHS forecasts Netflix will have about 7.5m subscribers in the UK by 2019. With a market cap of about $42bn (\u00a329bn) and 75 million subscribers, Netflix has a presence in about 200 countries. Arguably it is the first global broadcaster, despite being an internet streaming service. Netflix\u2019s programming budget matches its global ambition and reach. In 2016, it plans to spend about $5bn on content, up from $3bn last year. Investment bank UBS estimates Netflix\u2019s UK content spend at about \u20ac360m (\u00a3283m) for this year, rising to \u20ac409m annually over the next four years. Richard Eary, the UBS head of European media equity research, says: \u201cBased on our forecasts we expect Netflix will spend more on content globally than the top seven commercial broadcasters in Europe by 2018-19.\u201d Jonathan Broughton, a IHS senior analyst for TV, television media, agrees Netflix is \u201coutspending everyone else currently on content and, if you take a global total, excluding sport, that includes Sky\u201d. Most of the content budget for on demand services such as Netflix and Amazon is spent on rights to libraries of other people\u2019s programmes, which means they have to bid for the rights in each individual market. However, the ability to aggregate the costs across many countries means it makes business sense \u2013 owing to economies of scale \u2013 to invest in scripted drama, despite its high cost. Although it began as a library of other people\u2019s shows and benefited, in particular, by marketing itself as the online home of the critically lauded US drama Breaking Bad, Netflix\u2019s decision to invest in its own original programmes took it to another level. The success of the 2013 remake of Andrew Davies\u2019 BBC adaptation of Michael Dobbs\u2019 novel House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey, became its calling card. Netflix became synonymous with the concept of binge-viewing after settling on a strategy of releasing all the episodes of its new shows at once, globally, taking the moreish habits already established with DVD box sets online. The company has \u201csurfed the zeitgeist\u201d of immersive viewing, according to Radio Times editor Ben Preston. \u201cWe\u2019re watching television in a way now that we read books \u2013 you immerse yourself in a world 20 hours at a time and the Scandinavians kick-started all that with The Killing telling the story of a murder over 20 hours with subtitles. \u201cNetflix absolutely caught on to that with House of Cards, Orange is the New Black ... They turned immersive cinema into something you could do in your own living room.\u201d The company has allied its investment in original programming with tentpole marketing, using the popularity of series such as House of Cards to promote its wider content offering. \u201cNothing is as powerful as a big hit,\u201d says Preston, \u201cand they\u2019ve had a string of shows which got people talking\u201d, the latest of which is Making a Murderer. Original programming output will rise from 450 hours last year to 600 in 2016. Netflix is reportedly splashing out about \u00a3100m on The Crown, its first UK original drama, an epic royal biopic based on Peter Morgan\u2019s play The Audience and starring Wolf Hall\u2019s Claire Foy and former Doctor Who Matt Smith. Other big names making shows for the international streaming service include Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Ricky Gervais and Charlie Brooker, whose dystopian drama Black Mirror is transferring from Channel 4. Behind the showbiz hoopla is also a sophisticated technology, commercial and marketing strategy that has helped drive the popularity of the service in the UK. Broughton says one of the reasons for Netflix\u2019s success in the UK is that culturally viewers are used to \u201cpaying quite a lot for television\u201d via providers such as Sky or Virgin, so \u201ca low price point of \u00a35.99 is extremely encouraging for them to take up an additional pay TV on the back of what they have\u201d. He adds that the BBC helped as the iPlayer \u201ctrained people\u201d in how to consume TV shows online. Good broadband penetration in the UK has also helped, plus the fact that we share the same language as the US-based Netflix. Watching Netflix also does not require a monthly contract, arguably disrupted the market \u2013 and future generations of viewers\u2019 expectations of long-term contracts \u2013 especially for Sky, which launched its own more expensive no-contract internet service Now TV in 2012. They are not completely directly comparable as Now TV offers a full TV service whereas \u201cNetflix is a VOD library\u201d, Broughton says, adding that marketing has come into play as Sky went with a fresh brand, thus \u201cprotecting their pay TV business\u201d but costing more to market from a standing start.",

Business research company IHS forecasts Netflix will have about 7.5m subscribers in the UK by 2019. </p> <p>With a market cap of about $42bn (\u00a329bn) and 75 million subscribers, Netflix has a presence in about 200 countries. Arguably it is the first global broadcaster, despite being an internet streaming service.</p> <p>Netflix\u2019s programming budget matches its global ambition and reach. In 2016, it plans to spend about $5bn on content, up from $3bn last year.

The success of the 2013 remake of Andrew Davies\u2019 BBC adaptation of Michael Dobbs\u2019 novel House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey, became its calling card.</p> <p>Netflix became synonymous with the concept of binge-viewing after settling on a strategy of releasing all the episodes of its new shows at once, globally, taking the moreish habits already established with DVD box sets online.</p> <p>The company has \u201csurfed the zeitgeist\u201d of immersive viewing, according to Radio Times editor Ben Preston. \u201cWe\u2019re watching television in a way now that we read books \u2013 you immerse yourself in a world 20 hours at a time and the Scandinavians kick-started all that with The Killing telling the story of a murder over 20 hours with subtitles.<br></p> <p>\u201cNetflix absolutely caught on to that with House of Cards, Orange is the New Black ... They turned immersive cinema into something you could do in your own living room.\u201d</p> <p>The company has allied its investment in original programming with tentpole marketing, using the popularity of series such as House of Cards to promote its wider content offering. \u201cNothing is as powerful as a big hit,\u201d says Preston, \u201cand they\u2019ve had a string of shows which got people talking\u201d, the latest of which is Making a Murderer.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8b58c44c661f0285bbbeb3c3ec2b16f04089680\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8b58c44c661f0285bbbeb3c3ec2b16f04089680/0_139_2605_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Avery, left, appears during his sentencing.

Good broadband penetration in the UK has also helped, plus the fact that we share the same language as the US-based Netflix.</p> <p>Watching Netflix also does not require a monthly contract, arguably disrupted the market \u2013 and future generations of viewers\u2019 expectations of long-term contracts \u2013 especially for Sky, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/16/sky-netflix-now-tv\">launched its own more expensive no-contract internet service Now TV in 2012</a>. </p> <p>They are not completely directly comparable as Now TV offers a full TV service whereas \u201cNetflix is a VOD library\u201d, Broughton says, adding that marketing has come into play as Sky went with a fresh brand, thus \u201cprotecting their pay TV business\u201d but costing more to market from a standing start. </p> <p> </p> <p><br></p>",
