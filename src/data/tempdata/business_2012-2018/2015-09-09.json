      "bodyText": "Morrisons was late to the convenience store game, then paid too much for shops in poor locations after Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s had spent a decade grabbing the prime pitches. That, roughly speaking, is how Morrisons\u2019 140 local M stores recorded an operating loss of \u00a336m last year. In the circumstances, you can understand why the new-broom chief executive, David Potts, has ordered an exit. Even so, the price looks poor \u2013 just \u00a325m. Morrisons hasn\u2019t even been able to wave a clean goodbye to the leases, which will revert should the business fail under its new owners. One wishes the buyers \u2013 Greybull Capital, backing the \u201cretail entrepreneur\u201d Mike Greene \u2013 success, naturally. But they would do everybody a favour if they explained why they think they can prosper without Morrisons\u2019 buying clout. It would also be polite to explain how the deal is funded. Is Greybull putting up capital that is at risk? Or is this another example from retail-land of rescuers making themselves secured creditors of the business they are buying? It\u2019s an important question after Comet\u2019s rapid passage from buyout to administration a couple of years ago. Greybull, incidentally, was a junior backer of that Comet deal, which was led by private investment firm OpCapita. Morrisons, as a grown-up FTSE 100 company, should have ensured the financing question was answered plainly at the outset. It\u2019s one thing for Potts to thank staff for their \u201chard work and dedication to M local\u201d. But he could have expressed his gratitude by insisting that those staff who choose to transfer were told how their new employer is funding the deal. Bank code cracking Is that a rift between Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and Anthony Habgood, the chairman of the Bank\u2019s court of directors? It rather looks like it, after Habgood told the Treasury select committee yesterday that the Bank\u2019s governing body would review the codes of conduct for policy makers in light of the controversy around Gertjan Vlieghe, an incoming member of the monetary policy committee. Carney, by contrast, told the committee this month that the codes are right in their present form. Vlieghe, arriving from Brevan Howard, had intended to keep his financial interest in the hedge fund, prompting questions about conflicts of interest. In the event, Brevan Howard quickly defused the row by buying out Vlieghe\u2019s rights \u2013 a sensible response. But the process looked clumsy and unscripted, which is not how appointments to the Bank should work. Carney has worries about the Bank\u2019s ability to recruit talent, but Habgood is right to order a review. Perceptions matter, and the Bank was caught on the hop by the Vlieghe episode. Anglo sale credit Anglo American\u2019s share price has plunged in the past year and half the City expects the dividend to be cut, but the chief executive, Mark Cutifani, deserves credit for agreeing a deal that many thought would prove beyond him \u2013 a sale of the loss-making platinum mines in Rustenburg in South Africa. This disposal is tiny in the context of Anglo American\u2019s $12bn (\u00a38bn) of debt. The group will receive just 1.5bn rand (\u00a372m) up front by selling to local oufit Sibanye Gold, with at least R3bn to follow over several years, all being well. But the small pricetag doesn\u2019t reflect the effort to get the mines to a position where a credible buyer might appear. About a third of the workforce has been shed since 2012, no easy task in the politically heated and strike-prone South African mining industry. Nor could Anglo simply have avoided a restructuring, and dodged platinum\u2019s current horrible economics, by giving the mines away: the company still has too many assets in South Africa, including in platinum, to play fast and loose. Several political hurdles have to be cleared but Sibanye, spun out of Gold Fields in 2013 and listed in Johannesburg, clearly qualifies as a respectable purchaser. Anglo\u2019s shares, despite rising 5% yesterday, are still close to their lowest levels for 13 years, but management credibility gets a boost from this deal. Sports Direct hold-outs A near-30% rebellion by independent shareholders against the reappointment of Keith Hellawell as chairman of Sports Direct counts as chunky but it\u2019s a safe bet that nothing will come of it. A majority is a majority, Hellawell and Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority-owner, can fairly reflect. But who are these two out of three independent shareholders who think the standard of boardroom governance at Sports Direct is just fine? For all the reasons described here yesterday (the company\u2019s punt on Tesco shares; the 18 months without a finance director; the change in bonus targets, etc), the company\u2019s lineup of non-executives is surely crying out for an overhaul. Legal &amp; General announced that it had joined Royal London in voting against Hellawell. Well done. Now would those mainstream pension fund managers in the other camp \u2013 but presumably signed up to the same codes promoting good stewardship \u2013 please explain their thinking?",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct denies 'Dickensian practices' in face of investor revolt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has insisted it is \u201cnot operating Dickensian practices\u201d, in the face of growing shareholder unrest at Mike Ashley\u2019s sportswear retailer. The company, which has gained notoriety for keeping 20,000 staff on zero-hours contracts and making Ashley a billionaire, robustly defended its treatment of workers at its annual shareholder meeting after strong criticism from activist investor groups. A representative from the pressure group ShareAction claimed that workers are \u201cjeopardising their health\u201d for fear of being dismissed while another shareholder said the company\u2019s reputation as an employer was \u201catrocious\u201d and asked its chairman, Keith Hellawell, why he had not resigned. Unite union members protested outside Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Derbyshire, where the meeting took place, by dressing up as Dickensian workers and holding a banner reading: \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018workhouse\u2019 not a workplace.\u201d Investors also gave the company robust criticism over pay and the future of Hellawell. More than half of the company\u2019s independent shareholders who voted were against its pay policy, while almost a third refused to back the re-election of Hellawell as chairman. In response to the criticism, Hellawell said he was \u201cproud of the way this organisation operates\u201d. Claire Jenkins, a non-executive director, said comments about working conditions were misguided, adding: \u201cWe are not operating Dickensian practices.\u201d Leading up to the meeting, Sports Direct had faced heavy criticism from the City and trade unions over corporate governance failings and the treatment of its workers. City institutions including Royal London Asset Management are unhappy about the company lowering the performance targets in its bonus scheme, failing to hire a new finance director for 18 months and buying stakes in rival retailers such as Tesco and Debenhams. The Investment Association issued a red-top alert, its most severe warning, ahead of the meeting. Trade unions have accused Sports Direct of exploiting workers by using zero-hours contracts for the majority of its staff. Colin Hampton, a representative from ShareAction, claimed at the meeting that up to 4,000 casual staff employed at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse faced a \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re sacked\u201d policy. This includes strikes for sickness, excessive talking and toilet breaks, he alleged, while also claiming staff have to wait between 25 and 45 minutes unpaid to be searched at their end of their shifts. However, Jenkins denied the claims and said there was \u201cno evidence of bullying\u201d. She said: \u201cThe six strikes policy is actually not dreadful at all, in fact compared to an awful lot of employers, six strikes is actually deemed to be quite generous. \u201cCasual workers provide flexibility for us, but agencies give them guaranteed hours of work. We are satisfied we are providing good conditions and casual workers are getting what they know they are entitled to from their workers\u2019 pack. \u201cWe address issues by telling the truth and the facts. But if you choose not to listen to facts, I am not sure what we can do.\u201d When asked by John Dunn, a shareholder, whether he would resign as chairman, Hellawell said: \u201cIf a majority of shareholders feel I am not doing a good job, I will not stay. I am proud of this organisation and I am proud of the way this organisation operates. \u201cI am not satisfied with statements made by people with their own agenda. What you are not accepting is that we are telling the truth.\u201d Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct and the owner of Newcastle United, remained silent during the meeting, even when a shareholder asked whether the tycoon was concerned that the company might not be meeting health and safety regulations because of the treatment of its workers. \u201cThis is not Mr Ashley\u2019s company,\u201d Hellawell replied. \u201cHe is a major shareholder, but it has a life of its own. I can assure you that we on the board, unless Mike wants to disagree with me, are satisfied.\u201d However, Ashley approached the three shareholders who represented trade unions and ShareAction at the end of the meeting and pledged to look into the allegations about staff being forced to wait 45 minutes at the end of shifts. Excluding Ashley, 50.3% of shareholders voted against Sports Direct\u2019s remuneration policy for directors, while 28.6% refused to back Hellawell as chairman. Legal &amp; General, which owns 3% of Sports Direct and is a top-10 shareholder, voted against Hellawell. However, the support of Ashley, who owns 55% of Sports Direct, meant both resolutions were passed at the meeting. There were also significant rebellions against the re-election of Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors and the remuneration of Grant Thornton as auditors. A total of 88.3% of shareholders backed the re-election of Ashley as executive deputy chairman, while the lowering of the profit target for the staff bonus scheme was also approved. Jenkins, who is also the chairman of Amicus, the legal charity, said the board had looked into Sports Direct\u2019s treatment of workers when allegations first emerged about its employment practices two years ago. She said the criticism of Sports Direct had been allowed to \u201csnowball\u201d because legal issues had hampered what the company could say. Jenkins told shareholders: \u201cWe are not batting away your concerns, we are trying to make it incredibly clear that your concerns are unfounded.\u201d However, she said the company would not agree to a meeting with trade unions. \u201cThe managers sit down and talk to workers. A third party in between is not necessarily helpful,\u201d Jenkins said.",

      "body": "<p>Sports Direct has insisted it is \u201cnot operating Dickensian practices\u201d, in the face of growing shareholder unrest at Mike Ashley\u2019s sportswear retailer.</p> <p>The company, which has gained notoriety for keeping 20,000 staff on zero-hours contracts and making Ashley a billionaire, robustly defended its treatment of workers at its annual shareholder meeting after strong criticism from activist investor groups.</p> <p>A representative from the pressure group ShareAction claimed  that workers are \u201cjeopardising their health\u201d for fear of being dismissed while another shareholder said the company\u2019s reputation as an employer was \u201catrocious\u201d and asked its chairman, Keith Hellawell, why he had not resigned. </p> <p>Unite union members protested outside Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Derbyshire, where the meeting took place, by dressing up as Dickensian workers and holding a banner reading: \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018workhouse\u2019 not a workplace.\u201d</p> <p>Investors also gave the company robust criticism over pay and the future of Hellawell. More than half of the company\u2019s independent shareholders who voted were against its pay policy, while almost a third refused to back the re-election of Hellawell as chairman.</p> <p>In response to the criticism, Hellawell said he was \u201cproud of the way this organisation operates\u201d. Claire Jenkins, a non-executive director, said comments about working conditions were misguided, adding: \u201cWe are not operating Dickensian practices.\u201d</p> <p>Leading up to the meeting, Sports Direct had faced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-sports-direct-big-british-capitalism-at-its-grubbiest\">heavy criticism from the City and trade unions</a> over corporate governance failings and the treatment of its workers.</p> <p>City institutions including Royal London Asset Management are unhappy about the company lowering the performance targets in its bonus scheme, failing to hire a new finance director for 18 months and buying stakes in rival retailers such as Tesco and Debenhams. The Investment Association issued a red-top alert, its most severe warning, ahead of the meeting.</p> <p>Trade unions have accused Sports Direct of exploiting workers by using zero-hours contracts for the majority of its staff.</p> <p>Colin Hampton, a representative from ShareAction, claimed at the meeting that up to 4,000 casual staff employed at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse faced a \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re sacked\u201d policy. This includes strikes for sickness, excessive talking and toilet breaks, he alleged, while also claiming staff have to wait between 25 and 45 minutes unpaid to be searched at their end of their shifts.</p> <p>However, Jenkins denied the claims and said there was \u201cno evidence of bullying\u201d. She said: \u201cThe six strikes policy is actually not dreadful at all, in fact compared to an awful lot of employers, six strikes is actually deemed to be quite generous.</p> <p>\u201cCasual workers provide flexibility for us, but agencies give them guaranteed hours of work. We are satisfied we are providing good conditions and casual workers are getting what they know they are entitled to from their workers\u2019 pack.</p> <p>\u201cWe address issues by telling the truth and the facts. But if you choose not to listen to facts, I am not sure what we can do.\u201d</p> <p>When asked by John Dunn, a shareholder, whether he would resign as chairman, Hellawell said: \u201cIf a majority of shareholders feel I am not doing a good job, I will not stay. I am proud of this organisation and I am proud of the way this organisation operates.</p> <p>\u201cI am not satisfied with statements made by people with their own agenda. What you are not accepting is that we are telling the truth.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/mike-ashley\">Ashley</a>, the founder of Sports Direct and the owner of Newcastle United, remained silent during the meeting, even when a shareholder asked whether the tycoon was concerned that the company might not be meeting health and safety regulations because of the treatment of its workers.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not Mr Ashley\u2019s company,\u201d Hellawell replied. \u201cHe is a major shareholder, but it has a life of its own. I can assure you that we on the board, unless Mike wants to disagree with me, are satisfied.\u201d</p> <p>However, Ashley approached the three shareholders who represented trade unions and ShareAction at the end of the meeting and pledged to look into the allegations about staff being forced to wait 45 minutes at the end of shifts. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-sports-direct-big-british-capitalism-at-its-grubbiest\">The Guardian view on Sports Direct: big British capitalism at its grubbiest | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Excluding Ashley, 50.3% of shareholders voted against Sports Direct\u2019s remuneration policy for directors, while 28.6% refused to back Hellawell as chairman.

      "bodyText": "A former bankrupt who later built a consultancy business and went on to appear on Channel 4\u2019s The Secret Millionaire is to acquire Morrisons\u2019 struggling portfolio of convenience stores, backed by a controversial buyout firm. Mike Greene, who has spent 20 years on the board of the Association of Convenience Stores and founded the Association of Retail Newsagents, is leading the \u00a325m takeover of 140 M Local branches. He is being backed by Greybull Capital, a private investment group best-known for its investment in the now defunct Comet chain. The consortium said the deal would safeguard the futures of 2,300 existing store staff \u2013 with up to 200 new jobs being created when 10 stores closed by Morrisons reopen. The new owners plan to rebrand the shops as My Local and implement a new supply chain. Greene said: \u201cSupermarket distribution depots are not usually experienced or expert in small-drop frequent deliveries ... so there\u2019s a cost challenge there. \u201cWe will work with one of the UK\u2019s leading wholesalers that on a daily basis deliver to thousands of small stores and have been doing so for decades, efficiently and profitably in very small drops.\u201d He added that criticisms of the quality of the sites chosen by Morrisons for its convenience stores were overly harsh. \u201cThey have the good, the bad and the ugly but no worse or better than Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and the like.\u201d Greene is not widely known in the City, although he is not without a public profile. His \u201cself-help\u201d book, Failure Breeds Success, reveals how he went bankrupt at the age of 27, before moving on to work in the retail sector and then creating a retail consultancy called him! He sold the firm for an undisclosed sum in 2011 to the business information group William Reed. Despite appearing on The Secret Millionaire, Greene declined to answer questions about the size of the fortune he has built, insisting that he is \u201cquite a private person\u201d. The consortium would only say that management will have a \u201csignificant holding alongside majority shareholder Greybull Capital LLP\u201d. Greybull was one of the co-investors, alongside OpCapita, in the electrical retailer Comet, which collapsed in 2012. The deal was controversial as the backers protected their investments partly by structuring their purchase using secured loans, rather than injecting the cash as equity, prompting the then coalition government to order an investigation into the chain\u2019s demise. The report has yet to be published. A Greybull partner, Nathaniel Meyohas, refused to reveal if his firm\u2019s latest investment took the form of a loan. He said: \u201cWe are structuring the deal in the standard format that you would expect us to having taken proper advice from tax advisers and lawyers.\u201d New documents filed at Companies House show that the company acquiring the M Local stores is owned by another UK firm, which is in turn owned by an offshore company based in Jersey. Morrisons said it expects lose about \u00a330m on the deal. In addition, it will provide a guarantee to landlords who leased the supermarket chain the convenience stores, which could cost Morrisons up to \u00a320m \u201cif [My Local] does not succeed\u201d. The leases on the stores are thought to have an average of about five years to run. Morrisons\u2019 chief executive, David Potts, said: \u201cConvenience is a large and growing channel in UK food retailing. Morrisons learned much from its entry into the market, but M local was unable to scale. However, we remain open to other opportunities in convenience in the future.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook is on stage now, promising \u201cmonster announcements\u201d across several product lines. So, bang on cue, here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Apple liveblog: I don\u2019t think I have any \u2018monster\u2019 news to offer, so am going to clear off now. Will be back if there are any major developments.... There\u2019s robust trading in Apple shares today, as Wall Street prepares to see the company\u2019s latest wares unveiled. 28 million Apple shares have changed hands already, twice as many as the second most active company on the Dow, Intel. This has pushed Apple\u2019s share price up by 0.6%, as investors anticipate CEO Tim Cook\u2019s appearance on stage shortly: My colleague Alex Hern explains what\u2019s expected: Over in New York, hopes of Asian stimulus measures have crunched into fears of a US interest rate hike. After that solid start, the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 just dipped into negative territory. And that\u2019s because the number of job openings available across America has hit a record high of 5.8m in July, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey. Upbeat employment data could prompt the Federal Reserve into the much (too much?!)-discussed rate hike this month. Tony Cross of TrustNet reckons this could undermine market confidence, in the run up to the Fed\u2019s meeting next week. Wall Street is however proving to be something of a drag on sentiment \u2013 the latest employment numbers have shown a record number of job openings state-side and this is once again throwing open the possibility of the Fed gambling on a rate hike next week. If conviction builds further here then even talk of renewed stimulus measures from Beijing will do little to placate a market that\u2019s worried about the wider global consequences of higher borrowing costs in the US, but for now it\u2019s the base metals miners that are pulling through much of the upside. The other main European markets ended the day higher too, although Germany\u2019s rally rather fizzled out. Another day, another chunky move in the stock market. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 just closed for the day, up 82 points or 1.35% at 6229. That\u2019s the highest closing level since the end of August: Hargreaves Lansdown, which sells financial products, was the biggest gainer. It closed 6.9% higher after reporting record new business. It was followed by three mining stocks -- Anglo American (+5.5%), Glencore (+4.7%) and BHP Billiton (+3.6%). That reflects hopes that China\u2019s economy could enjoy a softer landing, now the government is a) sounding more positive, and b) promising to do more. Hmmm, the rally is fading somewhat: The NIESR think tank has warned that growth in the UK economy slowed over the summer. It predicts that Britain\u2019s GDP rose by 0.5% in the June-August quarter, down from 0.6% in the three months to July. That would also be weaker than the 0.7% growth officially recorded in the second quarter of 2015. NIESR adds: Despite the slight softening, growth remains close to the estimated long run potential of the economy, but below the average rate of growth (0.7 per cent per quarter) observed since the start of 2013. Wall Street has joined the rally. The Dow jumped 150 points, or nearly 1%, at the start of trading. A quick recap: World stock markets have continued their recent wild swings, by posting solid gains led by a big rally in Asia. The cause? Hopes of fresh stimulus measures to pep up the global economy. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was the stand-out performer, surging 7.7% today. That appears to be sparked by prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s pledge to keep cutting corporate taxes. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite rallied for the second day, up 2.4%. Optimism was rife after the Ministry of Finance vowed to strengthen fiscal policy, boost infrastructure spending and speed up reform of its tax system. Premier Li X then tried to reinforce confidence, telling policymakers that the economy was moving in the right direction. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: It appears that the noticeable decline in both imports and exports from the recent China economic data has been shrugged away, with this perhaps linked to expectations that the People\u2019s Bank of China will ease monetary policy further. European stock markets have followed Asia\u2019s lead, with the main indices gaining as much as 2.6% Investors are scrambling to get back into the market after August\u2019s selloff. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the City is calculating that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates this month (especially after the World Bank urged them to sit tight). It\u2019s still fear rather than fundamentals driving markets. On the way down its fear of losses but on the way up its fear of missing out. World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu\u2019s view that a Federal Reserve rate hike would trigger \u201cpanic and turmoil\u201d echoes that of IMF head Christine Lagarde. Top officials publically coming out against a rate hike will make it harder for Janet Yellen to move in September. In addition, the latest economic news from the UK is worrying: Britain\u2019s trade gap has widened, and manufacturing output has fallen, as UK firms suffer a drop in exports. The TUC has warned that the recovery could be at risk, while analysts predict that UK growth is slowing in the face of international upheaval. The decline in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector in July shows that the government\u2019s pledge to rebalance the economy is floundering. So argues Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor: \u201cThe increase in the trade deficit and fall in manufacturing output are both signs of George Osborne\u2019s neglect of the need for a balanced recovery. \u201cThe trade in goods has sunk to a five year low and exports have not kept pace with the Chancellor\u2019s \u2018march of the makers\u2019 promise. \u201cBritain needs a serious strategy to help exporters \u2013 this means redoubling efforts to boost productivity, tackling infrastructure obstacles, addressing the skills deficit and ensuring innovators can access the capital they need.\u201d Here\u2019s Heather Stewart\u2019s full take on the data: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is concerned by that Britain\u2019s manufacturers suffered the biggest drop in output since May 2014. She says: \u201cThe sharp falls in manufacturing and exports suggest that the economy is entering tougher times. And with the failure to fix long-term problems, like Britain\u2019s low rates of investment and innovation, the government\u2019s severe spending cuts will put the recovery at even greater risk. \u201cThese are worrying times for working people and their families, who remain hard-pressed after the longest fall in living standards on record. We need a better economic plan for a stronger and fairer economy that works for the many, not just the few.\u201d These charts help to show why today\u2019s UK trade data (details here) is worrying: Wall Street is expected to rally by around 1% when trading begins, in 90 minute time. Conner Campbell of SpreadEX says: The US open looks set to continue the buoyant market atmosphere this afternoon, with the Dow futures suggesting a 150 point jump when the Wall Street bell rings. Associated Press now has full details of premier Li\u2019s upbeat comments at \u201cSummer Davos\u201d today: China\u2019s No. 2 leader tried Wednesday to mollify foreign concerns about its economic slowdown, saying growth is in the \u201cproper range\u201d and Beijing has no plans to allow its currency to decline further. Speaking at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in the eastern city of Dalian, Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing will stick to plans for market-opening reforms despite recent \u201cfluctuations\u201d in economic performance. Communist leaders are in the midst of an unusually high-level effort to calm global financial markets after a collapse in Chinese stock prices and abrupt downturns in manufacturing and exports. The central bank governor, finance minister and securities regulatory agency issued similar statements last weekend that stock market turmoil was ending and the economy was stable. \u201cThe underlying trend of the economy is still moving in a positive direction,\u201d said Li, the country\u2019s No. 2 leader and its top economic official. Pointing to data showing more than 7 million urban jobs were created in the first half of the year, he said, \u201call this shows the Chinese economy has been running within the proper range.\u201d Li announced no new initiatives but touched on a wide range of issues that are sensitive for foreign investors in a clear attempt to assure them business conditions would remain stable. Despite today\u2019s gains, many stock markets are still lower than at the start of this year. America\u2019s S&amp;P 500, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite have all now fallen into the red. But Japan\u2019s Nikkei and Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 are slightly higher than on January 1st. There were happy faces on China\u2019s trading floors today, as hopes of fresh stimulus measures sent the Shanghai index up over 2%: This fruit vendor kept an eye on stocks, while selling his wares at a market in Hangzhou, in eastern China\u2019s Zhejiang province. And over in Tokyo, there was excitement as the Nikkei posted its biggest one-day leap since October 2008: Back in China, premier Li Keqiang has declared that the country has succeeded in fighting off \u2018potential systemic financial risks\u2019. Li told a panel discussion at the \u201cSummer Davos\u201d, in the port city of Dalian, that recent measures taken to calm market instability had worked. China must keep implementing reforms, Li continued: \u201c(We) will persist with a market-oriented, law-based system to establish an open and transparent capital market.\u201d The drop in Britain\u2019s manufacturing output in July suggests growth is weakening this quarter, as the slowdown in China and beyond hits demand. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says growth could drop to 0.5%, from 0.7% three months ago, or even lower. Muted manufacturing activity and weakened exports is worrying for hopes that UK growth can become more balanced and less dependent on the services sector and consumer spending. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, says British factories are finding it tough to get export orders in the current climate. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s gloomy industrial data: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a particularly good summer for manufacturing production and growth is hard-earned. Although macroeconomic conditions remain broadly supportive, it\u2019s surprising that lower oil prices haven\u2019t yet had more of a positive effect on the sector. With demand in the Eurozone still sluggish and an uncertain international picture, manufacturing output appears to be is stuck in neutral.\u201d The disappointing drop in UK manufacturing output send the pound down almost half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.536 The stock market remains upbeat, though -- probably because weak economic data means more chance of fresh stimulus measures from central bankers. Two disappointing pieces of economic data from the UK just hit the wires, showing that Britain\u2019s manufacturing base is struggling. UK industrial output shrank by 0.4% month-on-month in July, dashing hopes of a small rise. It was just 0.8% higher than a year ago. And the picture at manufacturing firms is particularly worrying. Production fell by 0.8% month-on-month, the biggest decline since May 2014, and is 0.5% lower than in July 2014. The Office for National Statistics says that output fell sharply at transport equipment makers, and manufacturer of basic metals &amp; metal products. It may partly be because UK car factories shut down for the summer earlier this year. But that\u2019s not the only bad news. Britain\u2019s trade gap has widened sharply in July. The deficit in goods widened to \u00a311bn, the biggest since July 2014, as exports tumbled by almost 10%. The ONS says: Exports of goods decreased by \u00a32.3 billion to \u00a322.8 billion in July 2015, the lowest export figure since September 2010. This is attributed to decreases in semi-manufactures (specifically chemicals) of \u00a31.0 billion and finished manufactures of \u00a30.8 billion. Imports of goods increased by \u00a30.3 billion to \u00a333.9 billion over the same period. Even when Britain\u2019s surplus in Services is included, the overall trade gap was \u00a33.37bn, compared to just \u00a3800m in June. The prospect of more stimulus in Japan was a key factor behind today\u2019s strong rally, which dragged the Nikkei back from a seven-month low. Associated Press explains: The Nikkei, which had earlier hit its lowest level since February, bounced after comments by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised expectations of more measures to shore up economic growth under his \u201cAbenomics\u201d stimulus program. In remarks from Abe read to a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch conference in Tokyo, he pledged to cut corporate tax rates by at least 3.3% next year. Passage of legislation making it easier to hire temporary workers and reports that Abe plans to keep his current economic team in a cabinet reshuffle next month also appeared to whet investor appetite. Japan\u2019s economy does still look weak - it shrank by 0.3% in the last quarter, despite Abe\u2019s existing stimulus measures. The promise of fresh stimulus from Beijing had a predictable effect on shares in China. The Shanghai stock market joined the Asian rally with gusto, and closed 2.3% higher. That\u2019s a full 10% higher than its recent low, in late August, suggesting the selloff may have bottomed out. Even so, it still leaves the Chinese market down a third since June as the equity bubble deflates. Reuters has a good take on China\u2019s new pledge to boost spending, a day after trade data showed a worrying tumble in imports. China will strengthen fiscal policy, boost infrastructure spending and speed up reform of its tax system to support the economy, the Ministry of Finance said, joining other steps by authorities to re-energize sputtering growth. The ministry will accelerate major construction projects, bring in private financing through increased use of the public private partnership (PPP) model, standardize the management of local government debt and reform taxes, it said in a statement late on Tuesday. Chinese policymakers have stepped up efforts to revive an economy growing at its slowest pace in decades, with a 40 percent plunge in mainland stock markets since mid-June roiling global financial markets. On Tuesday, data showed China\u2019s imports tumbled in August, raising concerns about the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy and its contribution to global growth. \u201cWe will accelerate the implementation and improvement of proactive fiscal policy and related measures, do timely fine tuning, and speed up reform measures to support stable growth and promote continued healthy economic development,\u201d the finance ministry statement said. Full story: China finance minister targets fiscal policy, infrastructure to support economy Japan\u2019s stock market has been one of the worst performers since China devalued the yuan last month. The Nikkei\u2019s remarkable 7.7% leap today suggests that investors are now shaking off their worries. Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management, said (via Bloomberg): \u201cThe selloff in Japanese equities has been excessive amid concerns over China\u2019s economic slowdown. Today\u2019s rally can be sustained once the market\u2019s perception of the Chinese economy improves.\u201d Budget airline Ryanair can also take some credit for today\u2019s upbeat mood. Ryanair hiked its profit forecast by 25% this morning after stronger-than-expected passenger growth over the summer. Its shares have surged 9% in Dublin this morning to a new record high. The main European markets are rallying too; with the German DAX up 2.1% and France\u2019s CAC up 2.3%. Shares in carmakers such as Renault, Daimler and BMW are all up around 5%, after China reported a rise in car sales last month. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has jumped by 100 points at the start of trading, a gain of 1.7%, to 6246 points. Mining shares are leading the way, with commodity trader Glencore up 5.8% and Anglo American up 4%. Both companies would benefit if China does boost spending to avoid a \u201chard landing\u201d, as it appeared to pledge overnight. European stock markets are open, sending traders racing to buy shares..... Today\u2019s market rally is also being driven by hopes that the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates next week. The World Bank\u2019s chief economist, Kaushik Basu, told the Financial Times that the Fed risks triggering \u201cpanic and turmoil\u201d in emerging markets if it hikes at its September meeting. Policymakers hold fire until the global economy is on a surer footing, Basu argued. More here: World Bank chief economist warns Fed to delay rate rise Good morning. A new sense of optimism is racing through the financial world this morning, driving shares up sharply across Asia - with Europe due to follow. Japan\u2019s stock market has just posted its biggest one-day jump in seven years, as confidence returned to Tokyo\u2019s trading floors. The Nikkei surged by 7.71%, a gain of 1,343 points. to close at 18,770. Every share gained ground, with many jumping over 10%. We\u2019ve not seen this sort of move since the wild days of the financial crisis in 2008. The surge was triggered by two factors. 1) Prime minister Shinzo Abe pledged to implement a planned corporation tax cut, and to go further if possible. 2) New optimism over China. Last night, China\u2019s Ministry of Finance issued a statement focused on \u201cfiscal measures to support growth\u201d - seen as a sign that Beijing will spend more to support the economy. Angus Nicholson of IG Index explains: Global markets have been buoyed by China\u2019s new market intervention and the announcement from the China\u2019s Ministry of Finance (MoF) that they will speed up fiscal spending. Japanese markets have been the standout performer in Asia today, seeing a record daily rise off the back of plans to cut corporate tax rates.... Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced plans for dramatic cuts to corporate tax rates. He stated that he planned to initially cut the current corporate tax rate of 35% by 3.3%, and push it down into the twenties over several years until it reaches as level that compares favourably in the international context. The market was no doubt buoyed by this news alongside renewed Chinese stock market support and fiscal spending, as well as further weakness in the yen. However, the Nikkei 225 was also partly just very oversold and primed for a rally on short covering alone. The percentage of stocks trading below their 200-day moving average had reached 20.4%, its lowest level since mid-2012. Good news for those who suffered losses after the Great Fall of China, three weeks ago. We\u2019ll be tracking all the latest developments across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business through the day.",

Japanese markets have been the standout performer in Asia today, seeing a record daily rise off the back of plans to cut corporate tax rates....</p> <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced plans for dramatic cuts to corporate tax rates. He stated that he planned to initially cut the current corporate tax rate of 35% by 3.3%, and push it down into the twenties over several years until it reaches as level that compares favourably in the international context.</p> <p>The market was no doubt buoyed by this news alongside renewed Chinese stock market support and fiscal spending, as well as further weakness in the yen. However, the Nikkei 225 was also partly just very oversold and primed for a rally on short covering alone. The percentage of stocks trading below their 200-day moving average had reached 20.4%, its lowest level since mid-2012.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Good news for those who suffered losses after the Great Fall of China, three weeks ago.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/statuses/641497372510584832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A stormer of a session for the Nikkei sees it finish +1,343 points or 7.71% higher.

      "bodyText": "The escape from a dramatic blaze on a British Airways plane on take-off from Las Vegas underlines advances in aviation safety, according to experts, who note parallels to past incidents that caused widespread fatalities. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will lead an investigation into exactly how the Boeing 777-200 suffered a catastrophic failure to its left engine while accelerating down the runway, but the pilot\u2019s response and the plane\u2019s containment systems meant the fire was swiftly extinguished without serious harm to passengers \u2013 terrifying though it may have been for those on board. One of the worst disasters on a British plane occurred just over 30 years ago in similar circumstances, when an engine caught fire on a British Airtours flight taking off from Manchester in August 1985. As in the Vegas flight, the pilot braked hard before take-off. But on that occasion, the flames engulfed the aircraft, and 55 people died. That disaster led to a range of recommendations from the safety authorities, using more fire retardant materials and allowing more space for evacuation routes. The UK\u2019s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) also recommended parking and evacuating the plane immediately on the runway, keeping the blaze downwind of the fuselage where possible and distributing the most experienced crew members throughout the plane to aid evacuation. Tony Cable, a former senior engineer at the AAIB, said the 777 was designed to cope with engine failures and fires. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a fire handle in the cockpit \u2013 if the pilot gets a warning that an engine is on fire, he double checks which engine with other crew, then pulls the handle. That shuts off a valve in the fuel tank as well as the electrics and hydraulics, and removes ignition sources and fuel. You can\u2019t control the oil but the quantity of that is limited. And there should be titanium and steel walls that would contain a fire in the engine.\u201d He said the designs now limit the effects of an engine fire andplanes can fly \u2013 and even take-off if already past a certain velocity \u2013 on one engine. However, incidents have occurred of \u201cnon-contained\u201d fires that can prove more serious. Cable said: \u201cYou could get a very nasty situation if debris comes out and damages the wing or the fuel line. These are very rare \u2013 most airline pilots will go an entire career without an engine failure. And aircraft are designed to deal with failures and to make them survivable. Aviation now remains fantastically safe.\u201d Experts also praised what they called a textbook evacuation. Jim McAuslan, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association, said: \u201cPilots are trained to prepare for things not going to plan throughout every single flight so they are able to make split-second decisions and keep passengers safe. A pilot could go through their whole career without dealing with an incident like this, but if it happens, all the training and time in the simulator pays off. \u201cWhile we await a meticulous investigation to help us understand this fire and prevent it happening again, all pilots will want to recognise the professional way the pilots and crew dealt with this emergency situation.\u201d The BA cabin crew from the Gatwick-bound flight 2276, at least one of whom apparently sustained injuries while evacuating the 157 passengers, are currently involved in a dispute with the airline over reduced terms and conditions for the most experienced employees. The 777\u2019s engine was manufactured by the US firm General Electric. It has had occasional issues with the engines it manufactured for Boeing. In 2013, GE issued a warning when new faulty gearboxes caused engines to shut down on two separate flights (although this BA plane predated those engines). Incidents and investigations have thrown light on unknown technical and engineering issues, and sometimes human error. One recent investigation into another engine fire on a BA flight from Heathrow to Oslo found that tired maintenance staff who had worked a string of long overnight shifts had attended to the wrong plane and left the covers unlatched. The Boeing 777-200 was the model flown by Malaysia Airlines on its doomed MH370 and MH17 flights, and has been involved in other incidents. The aviation lawyer James Healy-Pratt represented plaintiffs aboard the British Airways 777-200 plane, flight BA38, that crash-landed before the runway at Heathrow in 2008, when a problem with the fuel pipes led the engines to fail. He said passengers could seek recompense in the US courts if any systemic safety issues were uncovered.",

      "bodyText": "Fears are growing about the strength of Britain\u2019s economic recovery, after sharp falls in exports and manufacturing output offered the first evidence the global slowdown may be taking its toll. Britain\u2019s overall trade deficit in goods and services widened to \u00a33.4bn in July, from \u00a32.6bn in June, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The deterioration was driven by a drop in goods exports, which decreased by \u00a32.3bn to \u00a322.8bn in July 2015 \u2013 the lowest level since September 2010. Measured over a three-month period, the overall trade deficit narrowed, but analysts said the deterioration in the latest month was concerning. At the same time, the manufacturing sector \u2013 which the chancellor, George Osborne, has said he would like to spearhead a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d \u2013 reported a 0.8% decline in output in July, taking production to 0.5% below the level of a year ago. Joe Grice, the chief economist at the ONS, said: \u201cThe biggest single factor in the fall in manufacturing output was motor vehicle production, with the summer shutdowns appearing to start earlier than usual, along with anecdotal evidence showing a slowdown in exports. There has also been a fallback in the manufacture of weapons, following a big rise in June.\u201d Overall, industrial production \u2013 which includes mining and energy, as well as manufacturing \u2013 fell by 0.4% in July. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the data suggested the economic recovery would be vulnerable to the fresh round of spending cuts planned by the chancellor. \u201cThe sharp falls in manufacturing and exports suggest that the economy is entering tougher times. And with the failure to fix long-term problems, like Britain\u2019s low rate of investment and innovation, the government\u2019s severe spending cuts will put the recovery at even greater risk.\u201d The chancellor has confirmed that he will deliver his autumn statement, including new forecasts for the economy, on 25 November \u2013 alongside the Treasury\u2019s spending review, which will detail which departments will bear the brunt of the latest round of austerity. \u201cJuly\u2019s industrial production and trade figures highlight that the strength of the pound and weakness in demand in key export markets held back the recovery in the manufacturing sector at the beginning of the third quarter,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The strength of sterling \u2013 which makes the UK\u2019s exports less competitive in global markets \u2013 has been one reason the Bank of England has so far delayed lifting interest rates from their record low of 0.5%. The Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee will announce its latest decision on Thursday but is widely expected to leave rates on hold. City analysts said the two weak readings \u2013 the first official indications of how the economy performed in July \u2013 suggested GDP growth could be set to slow in the third quarter of the year, from the healthy 0.7% pace recorded from April to June. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the decline in industrial output suggested the economy had expanded by 0.5% in the three months to August. Howard Archer, of the consultancy IHS Global Insight, described the data as \u201ca double whammy of bad news for the UK economy that does not bode at all well for GDP growth in the third quarter\u201d. He added: \u201cWe had expected GDP growth to moderate from 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter to 0.6% in the third quarter, but there is now a serious risk that growth could dip to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter or even lower.\u201d The UK\u2019s trade deficit with both EU and non-EU countries widened in July, according to the ONS, suggesting that demand may have slowed both in the eurozone and in major emerging markets such as China. Britain\u2019s exports to the EU fell by 5.2% in July, to \u00a311bn, and exports to non-EU countries by 12.6%, to \u00a311.7bn. Chris Leslie, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cBritain needs a serious strategy to help exporters \u2013 this means redoubling efforts to boost productivity, tackling infrastructure obstacles, addressing the skills deficit and ensuring innovators can access the capital they need.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s oil and gas industry expects to continue shedding jobs and heavily cutting its costs despite reducing its workforce by more than 65,000 in the last 20 months. The annual economic report for Oil &amp; Gas UK disclosed on Wednesday that the total number of people employed in the sector had fallen from 440,000 to 375,000 since the beginning of 2014, largely due to the crash in world oil prices. Deirdrie Michie, the industry body\u2019s chief executive, said more jobs would go and cuts in the sector\u2019s cost base would continue before the industry was lean enough to weather the crisis, despite a recent rise in production of 3%. Oil &amp; Gas UK repeated its demands for further tax cuts and increased Treasury incentives to help boost investment, increase margins and cut decommissioning costs, arguing that the latest tax cuts were insufficient. With Brent crude prices as low as $43 late last month, nearly half its average price a year ago, the industry has already cut costs by \u00a3800m on existing assets this year and is planning a further \u00a31.3bn cut next year \u2013 excluding spending on new fields. With total output expected to rise this year for the first time since 2000, the industry wants to reduce the average operation cost per barrel of oil from about \u00a317.80 in 2015 to roughly \u00a315 by the end of 2016. The economic report forecast Brent crude prices remaining in the current range of $45-$65 a barrel \u201cwell beyond the end of 2015\u201d. Even with new fields such as Golden Eagle pushing up production, overall capital investment could drop by as much as \u00a312bn over the next three years, falling from \u00a314.8bn last year by between \u00a32bn-\u00a34bn a year to 2018. \u201cThis great industry of ours is facing very challenging times. Last year, more was spent than was earned from production, a situation which has been exacerbated by the continued fall in commodity prices,\u201d Michie said. \u201cThis is not sustainable and investors are hard pressed to commit investment here because of cash constraints. Exploration for new resources has fallen to its lowest level since the 1970s and with so few new projects gaining approval, capital investment is expected to drop from \u00a314.8bn (2014) by \u00a32-4bn in each of the next three years. \u201cDifficult decisions have had to be made across the industry. We estimate that employment supported by the sector has contracted by 15% since the start of 2014 to 375,000 jobs. It is likely that capacity may have to be reduced still further in order for the business to weather the downturn.\u201d Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s economic director, Mike Tholen, said \u201cWe are now seeing companies\u2019 commitment to improving cost and efficiency reflected in industry performance. We anticipate that by the end of 2016, companies will have reduced the cost of operating their existing assets by 22% (over \u00a32bn). \u201cWhilst the improvement will be offset to some extent by \u00a31.1bn of operating expenditure relating to new fields brought on-stream in the intervening period, these new developments are vital for the future of our industry, in terms of both oil and gas production as well as the commercial opportunities they bring for the supply chain.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s largest homebuilder, Barratt Developments, has reported a 45% surge in profits, as a result of the acute mismatch between housing demand and supply, as well as the government\u2019s help to buy scheme. Barratt said it had been \u201canother year of excellent progress for the group\u201d with pre-tax profits having risen to \u00a3566m, compared to \u00a3391m the previous year. Revenues were up by 19% to \u00a33.8bn, in a year when Barratt completed the largest number of homes since 2008. The company, which is the UK\u2019s largest housebuilder by volume, said its average selling price had risen 8.7% to \u00a3262,500, largely driven by house-price inflation. In a statement to investors, Barratt said the market for new homes remained strong, with demand continuing to exceed supply. The homebuilder has also been boosted by the greater availability of mortgage finance, as well as government support. The government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme, which was unveiled in the 2013 budget, allows homebuyers with just 5% of a property\u2019s price to buy a newbuild home with the help of an interest-free loan or an existing home with a government-guaranteed mortgage. The scheme has been extended to 2020. Very few first-time buyers have benefitted, partly because the scheme has helped to drive up prices. But the scheme has been a boon for housing companies, which have seen an upswing in profits against a backdrop of intense demand for housing and record-low interest rates. The previous chief executive of Barratt Developments, Mark Clare, cashed in \u00a311.8m worth of shares when he stepped down in July, after nine years at the top. He received \u00a36.03m in pay and bonuses last year, thanks to a \u00a34.1m payment from a long-term incentive scheme. Shares in Barratt have risen by 80% over the last year and on Wednesday morning were changing hands at 646p, a rise of 1.4% on the day. Shareholders will get dividend of 10.3p per share, compared to 7.1p in 2014. Richard Hunter, of Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: \u201cHousebuilders find themselves in an extremely sweet spot at present and Barratt is no exception. A combination of low interest rates, a general lack of new housing supply, rising house prices and increased mortgage availability all play into its hands. Barratt reported that market fundamentals remained \u201cvery positive\u201d and said it had seen a strong start to its latest financial year, with reservations up 15% on last year. Barratt\u2019s chairman, John Allan, said the company had completed its highest number of homes in seven years, \u201covercoming a number of well-publicised housing market challenges, particularly labour shortages\u201d. Completions rose 11% to 16,447 last year, although the company warned that a shortage of \u201chigh-quality skilled labour\u201d was likely to continue to test the construction industry and limit its output.",

      "bodyText": "Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, has reopened the war on \u201crip-off\u201d energy prices by calling on the government to introduce a protected energy tariff for vulnerable customers and end \u00a31bn of overcharging. The tariff would be set by the regulator and target those least likely to switch tariff. Flint pointed out that the independent Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had said that households were being overcharged by \u00a31bn a year, but the only action the government had taken was to write a letter the big six energy companies. Parts of that letter sent by the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, in June were briefed to the media, but a freedom of information request to get the whole letter released, as well as the responses from the energy firms, has so far failed amid claims from the department that the letter may have policy implications. Much of the focus over energy prices has dissipated with the fall in oil prices. Flint, who was widely praised for taking the attack to the energy firms in the last parliament, clearly feels the drop in oil prices is not being passed on. The Labour deputy leadership contender said: \u201cThe CMA are looking at a transitional \u2018regulated safeguard tariff\u2019. I am calling on the government to back this approach and signal an end to rip-off prices.\u201d She added the CMA said that the big six had been making more than \u00a31bn a year by overcharging 70% of customers who are on the standard variable tariff. The CMA suggested in July that a transitional regulated safeguard tariff is one option to protect consumers while the energy market is fixed. This would protect so-called \u201csticky\u201d customers who do not switch and are getting a bad deal from their energy company. The CMA made its recommendation after its year-long investigation concluded millions of households were paying too much for their gas and electricity due to a lack of competition. The groups least likely to switch are the most vulnerable, those who are on low incomes, have low qualifications, are living in rented accommodation, who are above 65 and those less likely to be engaged in the domestic retail energy markets against a variety of indicators. The CMA research showed 35% of those whose household incomes were above \u00a336,000 had switched supplier in the last three years, compared with 20% of those whose household incomes were below \u00a318,000. Flint pointed out a large number of other energy markets, especially in the United States, offer a \u201cdefault tariff\u201d. This can take a number of forms, from a reference price to a regulated tariff. Under the regulated (or \u201cprotected\u201d) tariff model, each supplier must offer one tariff where the price is set by the regulator and any prices changes must be approved by them. This becomes the default tariff for vulnerable consumers, or consumers who do not switch. Suppliers are, however, free to offer other tariffs at a price of their determining. Flint said the introduction of a protected price does not equate to a return to a full price cap model for all tariffs, as it existed in Britain from privatisation until 2001. This was a form of price-cap regulation, where price rises for all suppliers and all tariffs were capped at inflation minus any expected efficiency savings. The default tariff, by contrast, acts as a price to beat for competitors, delivering choice for those that want it while ensuring fair prices for those who do not engage. It is a hybrid model where both regulated and competitive tariffs exist, and in effecta fair price guarantee.",

The airline had expected to make profits of \u20ac940m - \u20ac970m, but said it had been surprised by a spike in passenger traffic and increase in takings.

But O\u2019Leary said not all the improvement in Ryanair\u2019s latest figures were due to its model or their management.</p> <p>He cautioned shareholders and analysts \u201cto avoid irrational exuberance\u201d and reiterated that passengers could see lower prices this winter, as airlines embark on \u201cvery attritional and sustained fare-wars across Europe this winter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have clearly benefited from favourable industry trends this summer including bad weather in northern Europe, stronger sterling encouraging more UK families to holiday in the Med, reasonably flat capacity across the EU industry and lower prices for our unhedged oil.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBeing the airline industry we do not expect these favourable conditions will persist, and we would urge shareholders and analysts to avoid irrational exuberance.\u201d<br></p>",
