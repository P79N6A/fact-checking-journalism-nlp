Each week another tidbit of information says Apple has been negotiating with this or that American TV content provider - now ESPN, then HOB, then Viacom - to offer exclusive programmes for its always-expected-yet-never-shown TV set. One analyst, Gene Munster, has been forecasting since February 2009 that Apple is about to offer a TV. Apple does offer something called Apple TV: it's a set-top box the size and colour of an ice hockey puck. Steve Jobs referred to it as a \"hobby\", and Tim Cook hasn't changed that approach. Even so, more than 13m have sold since the launch, half of those in the past year. Why is the Apple TV box a \"hobby\"? Because Apple hasn't figured out how to push the US's entrenched TV operators and cable networks aside. It sells films and TV shows via its Apple Store on the box, but not much else. In the UK, it's only really useful for watching Netflix or YouTube; there isn't an iPlayer app, let alone Channel 4's 4OD or ITV Player. Leaked talks about content are most likely for this product. Americans yearn for Apple to disrupt TV, because they hate their cable and TV companies. It won't. After all, why would Apple try to crack the TV market? The replacement rate is about 10% annually at best; there is fierce price competition; it's a mature market with little room for growth. Apple likes new markets with huge room for growth, high replacement rates, and low price sensitivity. Hence digital music players in 2001 - where the iPod boomed for eight years. To smartphones in 2007 it brought the iPhone - which people replace every two years (ie 50% annually) in a still-growing market. For tablets in 2010, the iPad blazed a trail and created a new market which is growing at 50% annually. Set against that, selling big panes of glass looks pointless. Apple will keep doing phones, and tablets, and perhaps soon something wearable. Why? Nike just announced there are 18 million users of its Fuelband fitness gadgets worldwide.

    "webTitle": "Eurogroup chief becomes latest to admit Greece on course for third bailout", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, is the latest senior politician to concede that Greece may yet need a third bailout, casting a shadow over news that eurozone companies are reporting their strongest growth for more than two years. Dijsselbloem, who heads the eurogroup of finance ministers, told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad: \"The problems in Greece won't be solved in 2014, so something more will have to happen.\" He said the form and scale of another rescue would depend on Greece's progress with economic reforms. His admission echoed that of the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who told an election campaign event earlier this week that the bailed-out country still needed more aid. The International Monetary Fund has suggested that there is an \u20ac11bn (\u00a39.4bn) shortfall in the current rescue package for Greece. The spectre of destabilising negotiations over a new bailout, though they are unlikely to get under way until after German elections next month, were a reminder that the eurozone is still not out of the woods, despite an upbeat survey suggesting economic recovery in the 17-member zone is gathering steam. The monthly purchasing managers' indices, which test the confidence of firms across the 17 member-states, showed both manufacturing and services expanding at their fastest pace since summer 2011. Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit, which compiles the indices, said: \"The euro area's economic recovery gained momentum in August.\" Apolline Menut, of Barclays, said: \"The readings confirm that recovery is on track and that GDP should continue to grow in the third quarter.\" However, while Germany scored a PMI reading of 53.4 \u2013 well above the 50 level which marks expansion, suggesting recovery in the eurozone's largest economy is gathering speed \u2013 output in France declined, and at a faster pace than during July, according to the survey, with both manufacturing and services output falling. Williamson said: \"A big question mark still hangs over France's ability to return to sustained growth.\" Across the eurozone as a whole, export sales rose for the second month in a row, Markit said, and new orders for manufactured goods jumped at their fastest pace since May 2011. However, some analysts remain more sceptical about whether the nascent upturn \u2013 after an 18 month recession \u2013 is set to last, particularly if the US Federal Reserve's plan to \"taper\", or start reducing, its $85bn a month quantitative easing programme continues to push up government bond yields on this side of the Atlantic, raising the cost of borrowing. A research note from City consultancy Fathom said: \"The fundamental structural problems facing the euro area have not gone away. In addition, the potential spillovers from Fed tapering pose a threat to debt sustainability in the periphery \u2026 we are a long way from calling an end to the euro area crisis.\" Investors were cheered by a similar survey of China's manufacturing survey, published by HSBC, which suggested output may be stabilising, after growth deteriorated sharply at the start of the year. The reading on the purchasing managers' index rose to a stronger-than-expected 50.1 for August, from 47.7 in July \u2013 the largest monthly jump in three years. Analysts said there were hopeful signs that China is succeeding in shifting its growth model away from exports, towards consumer spending. \"Domestic demand is strong enough to support 7.5% [growth] in 2013,\" said Ken Peng, senior economist at BNP Paribas in Beijing. \"Almost all of China's economic data since July has shown improvements and suggests a rebound is under way.\" Fears about a so-called hard landing in China have exacerbated recent jitters in financial markets over the fate of emerging economies when the Fed withdraws from QE. Yields on US government bonds hit a fresh two-year high, as minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, released on Wednesday night, confirmed that QE could start to be phased out as soon as next month. However, the dollar's relentless rise was briefly checked after a worse-than-expected labour market survey, which suggested new claims for unemployment benefits had risen by 13,000, to 336,000, in the past week. \"The Fed tapering theme continues. The minutes reinforced expectations that the Fed will taper its quantitative easing programme in September and Thursday's jobless claims didn't really change that,\" said Greg Moore, currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.",

      "body": "<p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, is the latest senior politician to concede that Greece may yet need a third bailout, casting a shadow over news that eurozone companies are reporting their strongest growth for more than two years.</p> <p>Dijsselbloem, who heads the eurogroup of finance ministers, told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad: \"The problems in Greece won't be solved in 2014, so something more will have to happen.\" He said the form and scale of another rescue would depend on Greece's progress with economic reforms.</p> <p>His admission echoed that of the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who told an election campaign event earlier this week that the bailed-out country still needed more aid. The International Monetary Fund has suggested that there is an \u20ac11bn (\u00a39.4bn) shortfall in the current rescue package for Greece.</p> <p>The spectre of destabilising negotiations over a new bailout, though they are unlikely to get under way until after German elections next month, were a reminder that the eurozone is still not out of the woods, despite an upbeat survey suggesting economic recovery in the 17-member zone is gathering steam.</p> <p>The monthly purchasing managers' indices, which test the confidence of firms across the 17 member-states, showed both manufacturing and services expanding at their fastest pace since summer 2011.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit, which compiles the indices, said: \"The euro area's economic recovery gained momentum in August.\"</p> <p>Apolline Menut, of Barclays, said: \"The readings confirm that recovery is on track and that GDP should continue to grow in the third quarter.\"</p> <p>However, while Germany scored a PMI reading of 53.4 \u2013 well above the 50 level which marks expansion, suggesting recovery in the eurozone's largest economy is gathering speed \u2013 output in France declined, and at a faster pace than during July, according to the survey, with both manufacturing and services output falling. Williamson said: \"A big question mark still hangs over France's ability to return to sustained growth.\"</p> <p>Across the eurozone as a whole, export sales rose for the second month in a row, Markit said, and new orders for manufactured goods jumped at their fastest pace since May 2011.</p> <p>However, some analysts remain more sceptical about whether the nascent upturn \u2013 after an 18 month recession \u2013 is set to last, particularly if the US Federal Reserve's plan to \"taper\", or start reducing, its $85bn a month quantitative easing programme continues to push up government bond yields on this side of the Atlantic, raising the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>A research note from City consultancy Fathom said: \"The fundamental structural problems facing the euro area have not gone away. In addition, the potential spillovers from Fed tapering pose a threat to debt sustainability in the periphery \u2026 we are a long way from calling an end to the euro area crisis.\"</p> <p>Investors were cheered by a similar survey of China's manufacturing survey, published by HSBC, which suggested output may be stabilising, after growth deteriorated sharply at the start of the year. The reading on the purchasing managers' index rose to a stronger-than-expected 50.1 for August, from 47.7 in July \u2013 the largest monthly jump in three years.</p> <p>Analysts said there were hopeful signs that China is succeeding in shifting its growth model away from exports, towards consumer spending.</p> <p>\"Domestic demand is strong enough to support 7.5% [growth] in 2013,\" said Ken Peng, senior economist at BNP Paribas in Beijing. \"Almost all of China's economic data since July has shown improvements and suggests a rebound is under way.\"</p> <p>Fears about a so-called hard landing in China have exacerbated recent jitters in financial markets over the fate of emerging economies when the Fed withdraws from QE.</p> <p>Yields on US government bonds hit a fresh two-year high, as minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, released on Wednesday night, confirmed that QE could start to be phased out as soon as next month.</p> <p>However, the dollar's relentless rise was briefly checked after a worse-than-expected labour market survey, which suggested new claims for unemployment benefits had risen by 13,000, to 336,000, in the past week.</p> <p>\"The Fed tapering theme continues. The minutes reinforced expectations that the Fed will taper its quantitative easing programme in September and Thursday's jobless claims didn't really change that,\" said Greg Moore, currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Another day, another mis-selling scandal courtesy of the banks \u2013 this time it's CPP's card protection policies. And, not for the first time, we must ask the questions: what on earth was the Financial Services Authority doing? How could a regulator, with a mandate to look out for consumers' interests, have been quite so asleep on the job? The PPI scandal, which will end up costing the banks about \u00a318bn in compensation and administration costs, was bad enough \u2013 the policies were variously overpriced, oversold and misleading. But PPI policies, at least at the outset, did carry a figleaf of respectability in the fact that some borrowers might benefit from insurance against the risk of illness or unemployment. In the case of CPP's card protection policies there was no excuse. The law is clear: liability for card fraud lies with the issuer of the card in most cases. Or as the Financial Services Authority said when it finally woke up last December and fined CPP: \"Customers generally do not need insurance for fraudulent transactions on lost or stolen credit and debit cards because they are not liable for unauthorised card payments\u2013 apart from in exceptional circumstances.\" The card protection policies, then, were largely useless, even at \u00a335 a year \u2013 and the identity protection policies, at \u00a385, were not much better since the risks were greatly exaggerated. So how on earth were 23m policies sold to 7 million people? Shameless greed is the superficial answer. The banks and credit companies, by pushing customers towards CPP, were getting a kickback of up to 80% (as detailed in CPP's flotation prospectus). It was money for old rope. Bank executives may have eased their consciences by reflecting that a third party, CPP, was ultimately selling the policies. But that's no mitigation. It is right that the FSA's successor, the Financial Conduct Authority, has dragooned 13 banks and credit card issuers into agreeing a \u00a31.3bn compensation scheme. But another explanation is the feebleness of the FSA. This scandal could have been killed at birth. All it required was the regulator to notice that punters were being sold insurance they already had. Hindsight is wonderful, it might be objected. But come on: an on-the-ball FSA would have been all over these policies in 2005, not 2011. The FCA has drawn up a scheme for redress that looks reasonably robust and, once approval is secured, speedy. The individual sums at stake may also be small enough to keep the ambulance-chasing claims management companies off the scene. That's all to be welcomed. But the moral of the tale is never to be surprised by banks' brazen behaviour or to underestimate the scale of the FSA's blindness in the go-go years. The banks are now full of declarations of good intentions towards customers and the FSA has been abolished. Things can only get better. We hope.",

      "bodyText": "Staff at John Lewis and Waitrose will be celebrating their second bonus of the year this weekend after the company realised it had been miscalculating pay for seven years and owed employees an extra \u00a340m. Around 69,000 of the John Lewis Partnership's 85,500 employees, who are mostly shop-floor workers, are to receive an average \u00a3350 in additional holiday pay after the company realised it had miscalculated the rate for a number of years. Some staff will pocket several thousand pounds in back pay, but more than half will get less than \u00a3120 after a pay review and a question from a staff member brought the error to light. The company admitted it had incorrectly applied the EU Working Time Directive relating to holiday pay for staff who were paid a premium for working on Sundays or bank holidays. Individual payments will vary according to shift patterns and pay rates. Those who have left through redundancy, illness or retirement will also be contacted by the group. But workers who voluntarily left the company may feel aggrieved after the company decided it would not compensate them even if they had been employed by John Lewis Partnership until recently. The company said the \u00a340m hit to profits would be recognised in its half-year results in September and increase future pensions liabilities by about \u00a37m. Meanwhile, updating pay systems to ensure all future holiday payments are correct would add around 0.5% to annual pay costs. However, it said the \u00a340m hit would not be deducted from the annual staff bonus paid in 2014. All staff, who are known as partners, receive an annual bonus which is calculated as a proportion of profits. In April all 84,700 staff then within the partnership shared \u00a3211m after a strong year of trading. Tracey Killen, director of personnel, said: \"As soon as we established that we were not implementing the working time regulations correctly, we worked quickly to make the repayments to our partners in a way that is both fair and responsible.\" The regulations go back to 1998, but John Lewis decided to cut off the start of the compensation period at April 2006, when its accurate digital records began. Sources at the group believe its effort to address the discrepancy \"goes beyond what other companies would do\". The John Lewis Partnership operates 39 John Lewis stores and 295 Waitrose shops in the UK and has annual gross sales of more than \u00a39.5bn.",

Those economies with current account deficits which are reliant on capital inflows have been particularly hard hit.</p> <p>Blooms warns that a recent underperformance of the dollar against G10 currencies will not last:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We anticipate a fresh bout of USD upside against the EUR, GBP and JPY. Neither the ECB nor the BoE will want to live with rising market interest rates and a stronger currency. Policies will likely respond, through words and actions, taking their currencies lower against the USD.</p> <p>In fact, history shows that over the tightening cycle, the USD has tended to perform consistently across G10. It would be wrong to read too much into its recent weakness against the EUR, GBP and JPY.

A big question mark still hangs over France\u201fs ability to return to sustained growth. Although the French PMI is well above the lows seen earlier in the year, August saw a slight steepening in the rate of contraction, notably in services \u2013 which points to lacklustre domestic demand.</p> <p>The dataflow continued to improve outside of France and Germany, suggesting that a long-awaited recovery seems to be taking shape in the periphery.

      "bodyText": "That is all from us today. Thank you for joining us, and for all your comments. Please do join us again tomorrow for the latest developments, including revised estimates of second-quarter growth in the UK and Germany, and eurozone consumer confidence. US house prices climbed 0.7% in June according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, slightly more than the 0.6% rise predicted by economists. It pushed up the annual rate of growth to 7.7%. Dow Jones: +0.2% at 14,930 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 1,647 European indices have built on earlier gains: FTSE 100: +1% at 6,453 CAC 40: +1% at 4,059 DAX 30: +1.2% at 8,388 IBEX: +2.2% at 8,652 FTSE MIB: +2.6% at 17,309 Following equivalent data from China and the eurozone earlier, Markit's US manufacturing PMI showed modest improvment in August, with the headline index rising to a five-month high of 53.9 from 53.7 in July. Markit's Chris Williamson had this to say: The U.S. manufacturing sector saw only modest growth of production in August, suggesting that the economy is continuing to recover in the third quarter but that the pace of expansion remains disappointingly sluggish. Hopefully the faster growth of new orders seen during August will translate into increasingly strong production gains in coming months, and also boost hiring. Policymakers will be encouraged by the sustained recovery and signs of strengthening demand, which add further weight to the possibility of the Fed starting to taper its asset purchases as soon as September. However, the Fed will also be wary of how fragile growth both at home and abroad is looking, and will therefore be keen to ensure policy is not tightened too much too fast.\u201d In the US new jobless claims rose by 336,000 last week, which was more than the 330,000 expected, and more than the 323,000 claims in the previous week. The data indicated a healthier underlying picture though, with the rolling four-week average falling to its lowest level since November 2007. If fell to 330,500 from the previous week's revised average of 332,750 according to the US Labor Department data. Weekly jobless claims at 1.30pm Manufacturing PMI at 2pm Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index at 2pm Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers which begins at 3pm The main events today so far have been the flurry of PMI releases. First we had the HSBC China manufacturing PMI which showed improvement in the sector and fuelled hopes that the world's second largest economy is stabilising. That was followed by surprisingly weak PMI figures from France, which showed both the services and manufacturing sectors shrank in August. There was far better news from Germany, which boasted better than expected PMIs and the strongest manufacturing activity in more than two years. The upbeat data drove European markets higher. The news got better when Markit's PMI index was published for the eurozone as a whole, showing the region's private sector is the healthiest in more than two years. Britain's car industry continued on a winning streak with a 7% rise in the number of vehicles built in the UK in July according to the SMMT. Yields on 10-year German bonds hit the highest level since March 2012 as investors turned away from safe haven assets after the flurry of upbeat data. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, leader of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, admitted Greece will need another bailout next year. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutchman who leads the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, has conceded Greece will need another dose of financial aid next year. According to reports, he told the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad \"the problems in Greece won't be solved in 2014, so something more will have to happen.\" He said the form and scale of another rescue would depend on Greece's progress with economic reforms. It followed similar comments from Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's finance minister, earlier in the week. The answer is yes, according to HSBC currency strategist David Bloom. He argues in a note entitled USD smashes EM, G10 you\u2019re next that the recent trauma imposed on emerging market currencies by the dollar is likely to spread. Since the start of May, the Brazilian real and Indian rupee have fallen 16% against the dollar, while the Indonesian rupiah and South African rand have fallen 11%, hit by speculation that the Fed is on the verge of scaling down its bond-buying programme. Those economies with current account deficits which are reliant on capital inflows have been particularly hard hit. Blooms warns that a recent underperformance of the dollar against G10 currencies will not last: We anticipate a fresh bout of USD upside against the EUR, GBP and JPY. Neither the ECB nor the BoE will want to live with rising market interest rates and a stronger currency. Policies will likely respond, through words and actions, taking their currencies lower against the USD. In fact, history shows that over the tightening cycle, the USD has tended to perform consistently across G10. It would be wrong to read too much into its recent weakness against the EUR, GBP and JPY. The USD has smacked EM, and it is coming for G10. The Guardian's Heather Stewart takes a look at the faltering fortunes of some of the key emerging market economies here. Meanwhile India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, is the biggest loser of the rupee's sharp depreciation according to Bloomberg, with 24% wiped off his fortune. The chairman of Reliance Industries, operator of the world\u2019s biggest oil refinery complex, has lost $5.6bn (\u00a33.6bn) of his wealth since May 1. The 56-year-old is left with a net worth of $17.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics: August\u2019s flash euro-zone PMIs provided further evidence that the currency union\u2019s economy continued to expand in the third quarter, albeit at a pretty modest pace. Overall, the survey provides hope that the second quarter\u2019s rise in eurozone GDP was not a one-off \u2013 we now expect the economy to contract by just 0.5% or so in 2013 as a whole. But for now at least, growth remains a long way short of the rates required to start to address the region\u2019s debt crisis. Martin van Vliet, economist at ING: Today\u2019s PMI figures add to evidence that the Eurozone economy as a whole has left recession behind and, as such, further reduce the odds that the ECB will follow up its forward guidance rhetoric with action. Moreover, they also suggest that the return to growth is becoming more broadly-based, even though some countries, including France, continue to struggle. Looking ahead, we expect the Eurozone economy to continue its recovery in the remainder of this year. But it will likely be a slow and uneven process. James Ashley, senior economist at RBC Europe: We view this morning\u2019s PMIs as indicating that although the pace of recovery in the euro area remains uneven, most economies are now seeing a general improvement in the growth outlook. German bond yields have risen after strong PMI data from the country and the eurozone as a whole dampened investor appetite for save-haven assets. The yield on 10-year benchmark Bunds rose as high as 1.937%, the highest since March 2012. A total of 128,873 vehicles were built at UK car plants in July, a 7% increase compared with a year earlier. It meant that in 2013 so far the number of cars built in Britain was up 1.9% at 893,263 vehicles according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Mike Baunton, SMMT interim chief executive, said: Car manufacturing is continuing to follow the wider UK trend for more positive economic growth. We are starting to see slight signs of recovery from Europe which will support stronger production levels this year. John Leech, UK head of automotive at KPMG, was similarly upbeat: Yet even better news is expected in the second half of 2013, as the decline in European car sales looks finally to have bottomed-out, with registrations of new cars in Europe rising 4.8% in July compared to the same month a year ago. Even austerity hit Spain, Portugal and Greece, where sales are roughly half pre-recession levels, showed double-digit gains. With the eurozone back out of recession, consumer confidence is starting to improve, giving UK car manufacturers confidence that the second half of 2013 will see greater production volumes than the first. With strong UK car demand from private buyers continuing to drive UK car production, I expect UK car production will grow by 5% in 2013. This will make it the UK\u2019s fourth consecutive year of growth, contrasting sharply with the rest of Europe, which is likely to endure its sixth straight year of production decline. Recovery in the eurozone appears to have gained momentum in the second quarter if Markit's August PMIs from the region are anything to go by. The services sector returned to growth, with the PMI rising to a two-year high of 51 from 49.8 in July. Anything above 50 signals expansion. Growth in the manufacturing sector accelerated with the PMI increasing to 51.3 from 50.3, a 26-month high. It pushed the combined, eurozone PMI composite index up to a 26-month high of 51.7 from 50.5 in July. The troubled region finally came out of recession in the second quarter with 0.3% growth, and markets have reacted positively this morning to signs from the PMIs that the momentum has continued into the third quarter. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the third quarter is shaping up to be the best the eurozone has seen since the spring of 2011: The euro area's economic recovery gained momentum in August, with manufacturing and service sector companies reporting the strongest pace of expansion for just over two years. The economic picture from the surveys is therefore coming into line with policymakers' expectations of a modest yet still fragile return to growth. The upturn is being led by Germany, where growth accelerated again in August, driven in turn by rising domestic and export demand. A big question mark still hangs over France\u201fs ability to return to sustained growth. Although the French PMI is well above the lows seen earlier in the year, August saw a slight steepening in the rate of contraction, notably in services \u2013 which points to lacklustre domestic demand. The dataflow continued to improve outside of France and Germany, suggesting that a long-awaited recovery seems to be taking shape in the periphery. Output and orders rose at the strongest rates since early-2011, with a broad-based improvement in domestic and export sales suggesting that the recovery is also looking more sustainable. Europe's key markets are all up this morning, shrugging off concerns about the easing of Fed stimulus and encouraged by the signs from the PMIs that Germany's economy got off to a strong start in the third quarter. FTSE 100: +0.7% at 6,439 CAC 40: +0.9% at 4,052 DAX 30: +1% at 8,370 IBEX: 1.5% at 8,581 FTSE MIB: +1.3% at 17,093 Once again Germany has saved the day, countering the disappointing French PMI with a stronger than expected perfomance from the manufacturing and services sectors in Europe's largest economy. Germany's manufacuturing PMI hit the highest level in more than two years, rising to 52 in August from 50.7 in July. The services PMI meanwhile rose to a six-month high of 52.4 from 51.3, pushing the composite index combining the two to 53.4 from 52.1 - a seven-month high. It means that Germany's private sector has expected for a fourth straight month, and followed better-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the wider economy in the second quarter. Tim Moore of Markit had this to say: The survey provides confirmation that Germany\u2019s economy is back on a solid footing and likely to remain in expansion through the third quarter of 2013. Manufacturing was an especially bright spot in August, with the latest figures suggesting that a rebound in export orders helped output growth accelerate to its strongest for over two years. Service providers also benefitted from improving business conditions at home and across the euro area, with total activity levels rising for a third month running. Moreover, jobs growth was maintained in the service economy during August, pointing to sustained confidence in the near-term business outlook. The Markit flash PMIs for France are out and show both the services and manufacturing sectors shrank in August. The services index fell to 47.7 from 48.6 in July, a two month low, while the manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 49.7. Combining the two meant that the composite index fell to a two-month low of 47.9 in August, from 49.1 in July. Economists had been expecting the PMI to reinforce a picture of recovery in the French economy, after better than expected GDP numbers showed France emerged from recession in the second quarter with 0.5% growth. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit and author of the French PMI report, said: Although output fell at a sharper pace in August, the rate of decline remained much slower than seen earlier in the year. Weakness in activity and employment was broad-based across the services and manufacturing sectors, with moderate falls signalled in each case. However, there were encouraging signs from some of the more forward- looking indicators, such as a slight rise in manufacturing new orders for the first time in over two years and service providers\u2019 confidence holding steady on July\u2019s 11-month high. Asian markets are all down following the Federal Reserve's latest set of minutes were published on Wednesday. Analysts said the minutes did little to dispel the idea that the US central bank will start to ease its vast bond-buying programme by the end of the year, and most likely in September. The timing will largely depend on the strength of economic data out between now and then. This from CMC Market's Michael Hewson: Last night\u2019s FOMC minutes didn\u2019t really shed any fresh light on whether the Fed would be more or less inclined to start a tapering program at next months Fed meeting, but they did show that \u201calmost all\u201d policymakers were broadly comfortable with the time line laid out by Fed Chairman Bernanke of an end to the program by the middle of next year, and that \u201calmost all\u201d were comfortable with the idea that it should start later this year. Good morning. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. China's HSBC manufacturing PMI published overnight showed improvement in the sector, supporting hopes that the world's second-largest economy is stabilising. The index hit a four-month high in August, rising to 50.1 from 47.7 in July, where anything above 50 indicates expansion. It was better than expected, with economists forecasting a rise to 48.3. New orders rose to 50.5 in August from 46.6, while the PMI's employment index also improved but remained below the 50 mark. Hongbin Qu, chief China economist at HSBC, said: This is mainly driven by the initial filtering-through of recent fine-tuning measures and companies' restocking activities, despite the continuous external weakness,\" \"We expect further filtering-through, which is likely to deliver some upside surprises to China's growth in the coming months. China's annual growth rate slowed to 7.5% in the second quarter from 7.7% in the previous three months, marking the ninth quarter of slowdown in the past 10 quarters. Economists are forecasting a modest fall to 7.4% for the third quarter according to a Reuters poll.",

The deal, a joint venture with local business Demsa, will see SuperGroup continue its global growth following plans for introducing a website launch in China. A five-year exclusive deal has been signed, that will see at least eight stores open across the country, including two in Istanbul and a single store in Ankara. The first Turkish store will open in October. SuperGroup said last month it plans \u00a330m of capital expenditure, including 50 new franchised stores, with sites in France, Spain, Germany, Denmark, India and Lebanon. The chief executive, Julian Dunkerton, said at the time: \"We are ready for the future and believe we are in expansion mode where the whole world is on our radar.\" On Thursday he said: \"Turkey is a territory that has held our interest for some time and our partnership with Demsa Group offers the perfect opportunity to enter this diverse and growing market.\" SuperGroup said last month it had banished the memory of a difficult 2011 and 2012, when it issued a stream of profit warnings, as it reported a 22% increase in pre-tax profits and a 15% rise in sales to \u00a3360m in the year to 28 April.",
