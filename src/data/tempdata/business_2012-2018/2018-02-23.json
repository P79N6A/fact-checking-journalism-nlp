      "bodyText": "Having just managed to rid itself of one Joyce, the government has been keen to embrace another member of the clan. At Sydney airport on Friday, Mathias Cormann, the acting prime minister, and treasurer Scott Morrison enlisted Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce to promote their plan to cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 25%. What better embodiment of Australian corporate success than the airline\u2019s boss? After plumbing the depths four years ago with losses of $2.8bn, the national carrier is now soaring into the wide blue yonder of profitability this week with half-yearly earnings of $976m. But it\u2019s a bold move by the ministers to align themselves so closely with the big end of town. One reason is that the justification for tax cuts \u2013 the trickle-down theory that they are good for everyone because more profitable companies invest more and create more jobs \u2013 is heavily contested and might not give the economy the boost the Coalition is hoping for. Many economists think Australia\u2019s faltering housing market and a possible drop in Chinese demand for raw materials will have a bigger part to play in the next couple of years. And while Qantas can be seen now as a corporate champion, its (perfectly legal) ability to avoid paying corporate tax in recent years on its huge profits may yet make it a pariah. It\u2019s hard to explain why a business that is throwing off cash like Qantas hasn\u2019t made much a contribution to the nation\u2019s coffers. Analysts can explain all about how the company has been allowed to use the losses as credits against tax, but that cold accounting might wear thin with the public when one of the biggest issues at the next federal election will be why it is that the corporate share of Australia\u2019s economic cake is growing at the expense of the workforce. Forty years ago the percentage of gross domestic product that went on workers\u2019 pay was 54%, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, compared with 15% on what the bureau classes as the gross operating surplus of corporations. Fast forward 40 years and it\u2019s a different story. The most recent quarterly figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in September 2017, workers\u2019 share was 47.35% while the slice taken by companies was 24.4%. That\u2019s a stark change and tells the story of globalisation. High tariffs and strong unions kept wages high back in the 70s before the trade agreements and the rise of Asian economies able to take advantage of a more level playing field changed the game. The result has been bad for pay but good for the profits of companies that survived the opening up of the world economy. Joyce and his ministerial supporters like to cite global competition as the reason why Australia must lower its headline company tax rate. The Qantas boss told reporters on Thursday that he was \u201cworried that there will be an investment drain out of Australia and this will lead to further investment in the US\u201d if the government doesn\u2019t match Donald Trump\u2019s plans to slash the tax burden for USA Inc. Cormann also talked up the threat. \u201cIf we force businesses like Qantas ... which are involved in global competition to be less competitive because taxes in Australia are higher than in other parts of the world, then that puts pressure on our whole economy,\u201d he said on Friday. It\u2019s not just Qantas that is enjoying bumper returns, meaning that the Coalition\u2019s economic policy begins to feel like a race to the bottom for wages and a race to the top for profitability. The current reporting season on the Australian stock market has seen a 14% rise in profitability. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty strong,\u201d says Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. \u201cApart from the bounce after the GFC that\u2019s one of the better numbers.\u201d The good news, as McCarthy points out, is that these healthy balance sheets will mean more of them pay more tax. But if those taxes are reduced and the benefits flow to overseas investors in the shape of higher dividends rather than pay rises for the workers, the Coalition ministers might find themselves with another Joyce that they\u2019d rather not have around.",

Nor did he waver in the media storm that followed. He\u2019d make a donation to charity, he eventually conceded, but never got round to defining what he meant by a \u201cvery meaningful\u201d sum. Now a faint tinkle of common sense has penetrated Fairburn\u2019s tin ear. The chief executive will take a cut in his share-based incentive windfall \u2013 to \u00a375m, based on the current share price. That is still a ridiculous reward for running a housebuilder in a market pumped up with \u201chelp-to-buy\u201d steroids. The best that can said is that he has conceded, in effect, that there are times when it is wrong to insist on receiving every last penny of a contractual entitlement. Even that interpretation, though, is generous. Fairburn \u2013 and finance director Mike Killoran and managing director Dave Jenkinson \u2013 probably aren\u2019t acting out of a sense of doing the right thing. Rather, they will have read the newspapers and realised some of their shareholders are hopping mad. It is hard to believe investors would have found the backbone to vote a director or two off the board at April\u2019s annual meeting, but some of the language was robust. Fairburn\u2019s bonus was \u201cpreposterous,\u201d said Euan Stirling of Aberdeen Standard Investments, and his \u201cinsistence in extracting such a high proportion of the value that has been created is damaging, both financially and reputationally, to the company\u201d. A large majority of shareholders voted in favour of the incentive scheme back in 2012, as Persimmon has consistently pointed out. And the other parties to blame are the former chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, and the pay chief, Jonathan Davie, who failed to impose a cap on the maximum rewards. Housebuilding is notoriously cyclical and, after George Osborne launched help-to-buy in 2013, it became a doddle for the executives to meet their \u201cstretching\u201d performance targets. Wrigley and Davie at least had the grace to resign out of embarrassment. Fairburn, Killoran and Jenkinson, however, have let this saga run and run. They have could have made Friday\u2019s modest gesture in 2016 since the size of the bonuses was visible for at least 18 months before December\u2019s first vesting. Giving up a few quid now makes it look as if the sums have been be wrestled from their clammy hands.

The move will put 3,200 jobs at risk and follows the recent decision by its bankrupt American parent to try to sell the loss-making UK business as well its other European stores. Members of the Toys R Us management team met with officials from the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) on Friday to notify them of the development. The troubled retailer had been trying to drum up a buyer before the end of the month when several payments, including a \u00a315m VAT bill, fall due.

Moorfields has been put on standby to handle the process, according to Sky News which first reported the development. In September Toys R Us\u2019s American parent filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts and struggling to compete online. It is trying to restructure its finances and is closing hundreds of US stores. The UK chain has been struggling for the same reasons as its parent, with shoppers shunning the large out-of-town sheds synonymous with the Toys R Us brand in favour of buying online or from supermarkets. The retailer\u2019s most recent accounts showed an operating loss of \u00a3500,000 on sales of \u00a3418m. In December the UK chain won a stay of execution after landlords took back the keys to 26 of its 104 shops and accepted less rent for those that stayed open. But the turnaround plan was torn up after poor trading continued into the new year. Administration would be bad news for the 600 members of the retailer\u2019s pension scheme. The fund has a deficit of about \u00a330m based on an assessment by the PPF, the state-backed pensions lifeboat, but as much as \u00a393m on the basis of a buyout by an insurer. If the retailer goes bust the pension fund would be an unsecured creditor alongside its landlords and HMRC and therefore at the end of the queue to collect money owed.",

The fund has a deficit of about \u00a330m based on an assessment by the PPF, the state-backed pensions lifeboat, but as much as \u00a393m on the basis of a buyout by an insurer. If the retailer goes bust the pension fund would be an unsecured creditor alongside its landlords and HMRC and therefore at the end of the queue to collect money owed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, has been ordered to pay a \u00a350,000 fine and \u00a337,000 court costs for failing to disclose vital details to the pensions watchdog as part of its investigation into the collapse of the high street chain. The fine \u2013 which Chappell said he could not pay because he had \u201cno funds\u201d \u2013 comes on top of a demand from the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for \u00a310m to help plug the hole in BHS\u2019s pension fund. Thrice-bankrupt Chappell, 51, bought the high street chain from the billionaire Sir Philip Green for just \u00a31 in March 2015. The company crashed just 13 months later with the loss of about 11,000 jobs and 164 stores. TPR, which has a responsibility to safeguard pensions, moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members. Just days after the company collapsed, Chappell was ordered to hand over hundreds of documents in relation to the \u00a3571m pension blackhole at BHS. When he failed to comply, TPR charged Chappell with neglecting or refusing to respond to three section 72 notices to provide information and documents in April and May 2016 and in February 2017. In the first prosecution of its kind, Chappell of Blandford Forum, Dorset, was hauled before a court last month. He was found guilty of all three charges and faced a maximum sentence of an unlimited fine for failing to comply with the notices. Chappell appeared at Barkingside magistrates court where he was fined \u00a315,000 each for the first two charges (\u00a330,000) and \u00a320,000 for the last charge, with \u00a337,430.84 court costs. He had earlier told the court: \u201cI have no funds as it stands.\u201d He said there was a perception he had \u201cmade millions out of BHS\u201d but he had actually been left almost penniless by the collapse. Alex Stein, prosecuting, said Chappell claimed he had no assets whatsoever other than a share in a property. Chappell was asked to give evidence in the witness box under oath over his wealth and assets. He told the court he had a monthly income of about \u00a32,700-\u00a33,000 acting as a consultant to a small cosmetics company. But he claimed he had extensive outgoings, of almost \u00a39,000. This was made up of: \u00a33,800 a month rent on his Dorset home; \u00a32,666 a month leasing a 2017-plate Range Rover; and \u00a32,500 a month school fees for his two children, aged eight and 12, on which he was in arrears. He told the court: \u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur. It\u2019s the nature of the business. There are boom times and slack times. This is a slack period where I have huge amounts of cash flooding out of the door in relation to legal fees. \u201cI have no way of paying a large fine at the moment but I could speak to people to borrow a loan.\u201d He said he had endeavoured to fully comply with the TPR requests for information and documents and had spent about \u00a3250,000 in legal fees in the wake of the BHS collapse. The fine comes just weeks after Chappell, a former racing driver, was handed a formal demand for \u00a310m from TPR as it attempted to plug the failed retailer\u2019s pension fund. The TPR has already agreed a deal with Sir Philip Green that he should pay \u00a3363m towards the pension deficit. District judge Gary Lucie said: \u201cHe is not being sentenced in any way for the collapse of BHS or the pension funds, just the failure of him to comply with demands over the pension funds.\u201d He said the court must send a message \u201cto those in positions of power\u201d that a failure to comply with TPR demands would lead to a substantial penalty. He said: \u201cThere was a complete lack of remorse on Mr Chappell\u2019s part. The fine should therefore reflect that. In my view there has not been full and frank disclosure of his means. I\u2019m not impressed by the lack of detail.\u201d The judge proposed he pay \u00a32,500 per calendar month. If Chappell does not have the means to pay the fine, it could lead to him being declared bankrupt for the fourth time. Nicola Parish, of the TPR, said: \u201cWe prosecuted Dominic Chappell because, despite numerous requests, he failed to provide us with information we required in connection with our investigation into the sale and ultimate collapse of BHS. \u201cChoosing not to comply with our section 72 notices has now left him with a criminal record and a bill of \u00a350,000, both of which he could have avoided if he had simply done what was required of him.\u201d After the case, Chappell\u2019s lawyer, Michael Levy, said the businessman was appealing against his conviction on three charges of failing to provide documents to the TPR.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The turnover of shops on Britain\u2019s high streets charts the rise and fall of retail empires as once popular brands and their owners fall out of fashion. The 2016 collapse of BHS shocked the foundations of Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire and the mooted sale of his Topshop to Burton group Arcadia would bring the final curtain down on a near 20-year reign as king of the high street. But as one billionaire Philip fades into the background, another is hoving into view. Retail entrepreneur Philip Day is yet to become a household name but the owner of more than a dozen retail brands, including Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Peacocks, is quietly buying up swathes of the high street, with troubled electronics retailer Maplin the latest chain on his shopping list. The scale of Day\u2019s growing empire is set out in the most recent accounts for the group\u2019s parent company Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group. The sprawling group now has 1,113 stores and concessions and employs more than 24,000 people. Its sales topped \u00a3592m and generated profits of nearly \u00a384m in the year to February 2017. Day got his big break in 2001, when he was part of the \u00a349m private equity backed takeover of staid middle-aged knitwear emporium the Edinburgh Woollen Mill. The following year he bought out co-investors Rutland in a \u00a369m deal backed by HBOS giving him his first retail Monopoly piece. One corporate financier who has been involved in selling Day several companies said he had still not actually met the businessman. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get involved with deals; you do the negotiating with people from his office. He\u2019s not like Mike Ashley, who turns up to all the meetings.\u201d In the early years Day made a series of small acquisitions including the homewares chain Ponden Mill and the golf clothing brand ProQuip, best known for dressing Ryder Cup players. The 52-year-old\u2019s first big move came in 2012 when he acquired budget fashion chain Peacocks. \u201cEdinburgh Woollen Mill has never been a growth story, it has always been steady, steady, steady, delivering good profits and producing cash,\u201d says another corporate financier who has encountered Day. Although Peacocks was the biggest brand in sales terms, Edinburgh Woollen Mill\u2019s stores were more profitable per square foot. The group uses company money to finance its acquisitions rather than big borrowings. Since repaying HBOS in 2005 it has been debt free. Day prefers to buy rather than rent the properties he occupies. The painful high street restructuring triggered by changing shopping habits is serving up a stream of potential deals for turnaround investors, as older brands, with large store estates, buckle in tough trading conditions. Day bought Austin Reed in 2016 and Jaeger in 2017. Earlier this month he rescued bust suitmaker Berwin &amp; Berwin, which included the Paul Costelloe and Lambretta brands, saving 800 jobs. Whereas Green is often snapped with celebrity friends such as Kate Moss or on the deck of his superyacht, Lionheart, Day\u2019s private life has remained private. Married to wife Debra for more than 20 years, the Day family still own plenty of baubles including Edmond Castle, a Tudor-style country house near Brampton in Cumbria, and a vineyard in Valencia. Day, who grew up on a Stockport council estate, has amassed an estimated \u00a31.1bn fortune. His eclectic portfolio includes the Scottish Deer Centre in Fife, where the attractions include 14 species of deer and a branch of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and an anaerobic digestion plant in Penrith, Cumbria. The group is keen to be viewed as a job creator, a patriarchal approach shaped by Day\u2019s youth when his parents and their friends struggled to find jobs. He left school at 16 and skipped university to pursue a business career. His conservative stewardship extends to the company\u2019s pension scheme where there is a policy to ensure any deficit is never more than 5% of profits. \u201cWe tend to avoid comparisons with other people and companies because we like to think of ourselves as trying to do something new and different,\u201d said a group spokesman. \u201cWe recognise the high street is going through a difficult period and we\u2019re trying to create a genuinely new company that gives customers choice on the high street.\u201d In 2014 Day swapped the Cumbrian rain for Dubai sunshine. The company says the relocation is not for tax purposes but to personally manage an increasingly complex global sourcing operation. Day\u2019s background is in manufacturing, having started his career with stints at clothing suppliers Coats Viyella and Wensum. In the UK Day\u2019s key lieutenants are Stephen Simpson, the group operations director, and John Herring, a former Dresdner Kleinwort Benson banker, who is the non-executive chairman. With an eye on the long term, the handover to the next generation has already begun with two of Day\u2019s three children now working for the family firm. Last year, in the manner of Harry Selfridge, Day gave his name to a new department store venture. The first branch of Days, housed in a former BHS outlet in Carmarthen, Wales, brought clothing brands such as Peacocks, Austin Reed, Country Casuals and Jaeger under one roof for the first time. At 25,000 sq ft \u2013 the size of a high street supermarket \u2013 the outlets are aimed at shoppers who don\u2019t want to schlep around vast department stores. Two more Days are planned in Bedford and Crawley but the openings are running behind schedule. \u201cAs we\u2019re a private family business, we\u2019d rather take the time to get things right, than get them done quickly,\u201d the spokesman says. \u201cWe have the flexibility to take our time \u2013 and we do not chase short-term results or profits. We\u2019re not in a rush because we\u2019re trying to build something that will last generations into the future.\u201d",

The following year he bought out co-investors Rutland in a \u00a369m deal backed by HBOS giving him his first retail Monopoly piece. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfcb4c816278a8e216879418961fec33048513a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfcb4c816278a8e216879418961fec33048513a8/0_371_5130_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh Woollen Mill shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Day bought the Edinburgh Woollen Mill in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bagnall/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One corporate financier who has been involved in selling Day several companies said he had still not actually met the businessman. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get involved with deals; you do the negotiating with people from his office. He\u2019s not like Mike Ashley, who turns up to all the meetings.\u201d</p> <p>In the early years Day made a series of small acquisitions including the homewares chain Ponden Mill and the golf clothing brand ProQuip, best known for dressing Ryder Cup players. The 52-year-old\u2019s first big move came in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/24/knight-comfy-cardy-rescue-peacocks\">2012 when he acquired budget fashion chain Peacocks</a>. </p> <p>\u201cEdinburgh Woollen Mill has never been a growth story, it has always been steady, steady, steady, delivering good profits and producing cash,\u201d says another corporate financier who has encountered Day. Although Peacocks was the biggest brand in sales terms, Edinburgh Woollen Mill\u2019s stores were more profitable per square foot.</p> <p>The group uses company money to finance its acquisitions rather than big borrowings. Since repaying HBOS in 2005 it has been debt free. Day prefers to buy rather than rent the properties he occupies. </p> <p>The painful high street restructuring triggered by changing shopping habits is serving up a stream of potential deals for turnaround investors, as older brands, with large store estates, buckle in tough trading conditions. Day bought Austin Reed in 2016 and Jaeger in 2017. Earlier this month he rescued bust suitmaker Berwin &amp; Berwin, which included the Paul Costelloe and Lambretta brands, saving 800 jobs.</p> <p>Whereas Green is often snapped with celebrity friends such as Kate Moss or on the deck of his superyacht, Lionheart, Day\u2019s private life has remained private. Married to wife Debra for more than 20 years, the Day family still own plenty of baubles including Edmond Castle, a Tudor-style country house near Brampton in Cumbria, and a vineyard in Valencia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a616b9912ddc31b77ea57ff982c5a0ce076c8f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a616b9912ddc31b77ea57ff982c5a0ce076c8f8/0_153_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"last shopping day for BHS, Bromley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BHS, defunct since 2016, joins other big-name high street retailers broken by online shopping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Day, who grew up on a Stockport council estate, has amassed an estimated \u00a31.1bn fortune. His eclectic portfolio includes the Scottish Deer Centre in Fife, where the attractions include 14 species of deer and a branch of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and an anaerobic digestion plant in Penrith, Cumbria.</p> <p>The group is keen to be viewed as a job creator, a patriarchal approach shaped by Day\u2019s youth when his parents and their friends struggled to find jobs. He left school at 16 and skipped university to pursue a business career. His conservative stewardship extends to the company\u2019s pension scheme where there is a policy to ensure any deficit is never more than 5% of profits. </p> <p>\u201cWe tend to avoid comparisons with other people and companies because we like to think of ourselves as trying to do something new and different,\u201d said a group spokesman. \u201cWe recognise the high street is going through a difficult period and we\u2019re trying to create a genuinely new company that gives customers choice on the high street.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014 Day swapped the Cumbrian rain for Dubai sunshine. The company says the relocation is not for tax purposes but to personally manage an increasingly complex global sourcing operation. Day\u2019s background is in manufacturing, having started his career with stints at clothing suppliers Coats Viyella and Wensum. </p> <p>In the UK Day\u2019s key lieutenants are Stephen Simpson, the group operations director, and John Herring, a former Dresdner Kleinwort Benson banker, who is the non-executive chairman. With an eye on the long term, the handover to the next generation has already begun with two of Day\u2019s three children now working for the family firm.</p> <p>Last year, in the manner of Harry Selfridge, Day gave his name to a new department store venture. The first branch of Days, housed in a former BHS outlet in Carmarthen, Wales, brought clothing brands such as Peacocks, Austin Reed, Country Casuals and Jaeger under one roof for the first time. At 25,000 sq ft \u2013 the size of a high street supermarket \u2013 the outlets are aimed at shoppers who don\u2019t want to schlep around vast department stores. Two more Days are planned in Bedford and Crawley but the openings are running behind schedule.</p> <p>\u201cAs we\u2019re a private family business, we\u2019d rather take the time to get things right, than get them done quickly,\u201d the spokesman says. <strong>\u201c</strong>We have the flexibility to take our time \u2013 and we do not chase short-term results or profits. We\u2019re not in a rush because we\u2019re trying to build something that will last generations into the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s big six energy companies have been accused of dirty tricks after analysis for the Guardian revealed that they are routinely charging customers almost exactly the same amount after switching them off controversial default tariffs. In the face of Theresa May\u2019s plans to impose a price cap on standard variable tariffs (SVTs), which more than half of energy customers are on despite their steep prices, companies such as British Gas, E.ON and SSE have pledged to phase out such tariffs and shift billpayers onto better value fixed deals. The chief of energy regulator Ofgem has welcomed such moves as a sign of progress in the energy market. But data compiled for the Guardian shows that in the case of market leader British Gas, the most expensive fixed deal \u2013 that many customers are being moved on to \u2013 is identical to its SVT, at \u00a31,099.84. It is understood that when customers contact their supplier to change their tariff, most are moved to the most expensive fix that the company offers. Each company\u2019s cheapest fixed deals are often only available through comparison sites. E.ON charged \u00a31093.35 for both its SVT and most costly fix, while the gap for ScottishPower was just \u00a38.49 and npower\u2019s was \u00a337, the figures obtained by challenger supplier Octopus show. SSE was slightly better, with a \u00a354.73 gap, and EDF\u2019s gap was \u00a382.83. The data suggests the companies are engaged in what is largely a rebadging process rather than a genuine effort to cut customers\u2019 bills by switching them to more competitive products. John Penrose, the Tory MP who pressured Theresa May to confirm a cap last October, said: \u201cThe big six need to do more than just a cosmetic exercise. No one should be fooled if they\u2019re just moving customers from one rip-off tariff to another, with a different label on the tin. \u201cThe only way we\u2019ll put a stop to these dirty tricks is with an energy price cap, so I\u2019m delighted the government is about to bring one in.\u201d British Gas on Thursday cited the price cap as one reason it is shedding 4,000 jobs, although its consumer energy arm\u2019s profits only dropped 1% despite losing 750,000 customers to more competitively priced rivals. More than half of British Gas customers are on SVTs, with similar shares for E.ON, EDF and npower. SSE has the highest proportion, and Scottish Power the lowest. The data compiled by Octopus on big six pricing tactics is a snapshot taken of tariffs offered on 18 February in the London region. It excludes fixed tariffs with extras, such as boiler cover. While the gap is small or non-existent in most cases between the SVT and the most expensive fixed tariff, the big six do offer cheaper fixes to lure in new customers. For example, British Gas\u2019s cheapest fix is \u00a3200 below its SVT. Although the figures are taken on a single day, an examination of the companies\u2019 tariffs over a 90-day period ending on 18 February showed the pricing behaviour is not an anomaly. Greg Jackson, the founder and chief executive of Octopus, calling the pricing cynical and said: \u201cTime and time again we see the big six ducking and diving to find new ways of covertly ripping off their loyal customers. This latest is a cynical move as now even the experts \u2013 press, regulators and politicians \u2013 won\u2019t be able to hold them to account, and it shows why the energy price cap is so vital.\u201d British Gas declined to comment but SSE said: \u201cWe work hard to keep prices down and our fixed deals give customers the security of knowing their prices are locked in for a set period of time.\u201d E.ON said it was still working out the detail of ending SVTs but: \u201cOur new model of offering customers a one-year tariff as the default option \u2026 [will] be cheaper than their current standard variable product.\u201d Npower said its tariff was cheaper and \u201calso protects customers from any price increase for the next three years\u201d. It added: \u201cIt is also worth noting that our cheapest generally available tariff is now \u00a392 less than our SVT product.\u201d EDF said: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree that moving customers on to a deal which is almost identical to their existing standard tariff is in their best interests and we don\u2019t do it.\u201d Asked what percentage of customers were moved off an SVT on to the company\u2019s most expensive fix, none of the big six responded.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of \u00a3752m in 2017, following a \u00a37bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. \u201cRBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of \u00a32.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,\u201d McEwan told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe\u2019ve been restructuring the bank, but it\u2019s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn\u2019t want to be in.\u201d McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. \u201cWe have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,\u201d McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors\u2019 minds. The bank\u2019s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was \u201cnot the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.\u201d He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank\u2019s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a \u201cnormally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It\u2019s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn\u2019t want to be the long-term shareholder.\u201d He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS\u2019s return to profit in 2017 amounted to \u201ca stay of execution rather than a pardon\u201d because of the looming US fine. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank\u2019s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.\u201d RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. \u201cThe gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,\u201d McEwan said. \u201cWhat it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.\u201d RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank\u2019s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. \u201cOur progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,\u201d McEwan said. \u201cAnd with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail \u201ca symbolic moment\u201d. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the \u00a3110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany\u2019s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England\u2019s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday\u2019s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England\u2019s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth \u2013 both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships \u2013 is likely to continue for some time. Here\u2019s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain\u2019s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November\u2019s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank\u2019s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s the MPC\u2019s view that the economy\u2019s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,\u201d the former finance ministry official said. \u201cThat means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,\u201d he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity \u2013 how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked \u2013 is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC\u2019s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it\u2019s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It\u2019s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank\u2019s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost \u00a360bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank\u2019s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it\u2019s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find \u00a33.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS\u2019s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are \u201ccloser\u201d have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018\u2014dividends can\u2019t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday\u2019s share price reaction doesn\u2019t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS\u2019s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn\u2019t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank\u2019s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation \u2013 down to 1.3% in January from December\u2019s 1.4% \u2013 the region\u2019s indices couldn\u2019t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday\u2019s hawkish meeting minutes. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe\u2019s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe\u2019s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday\u2019s data showed. \u201cThe German economy continues to be in good shape,\u201d said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. \u201cSince 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.\u201d He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB\u2019s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission\u2019s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here\u2019s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (\u00a3). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning\u2019s inflation reading highlighted there\u2019s still work to be done to reach the ECB\u2019s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB\u2019s target within the first quarter, he\u2019ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It\u2019s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month\u2019s reading doesn\u2019t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday\u2019s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank\u2019s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it\u2019s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank\u2019s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank\u2019s share price, so until it\u2019s materially completed, the market isn\u2019t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government\u2019s breakeven point, the taxpayer\u2019s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto \u201cdeferred\u201d until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +\u00a3752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of \u00a3512m was a \u00a3195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around \u00a31bn to \u00a32.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a \u00a3110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around \u00a350m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France\u2019s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain\u2019s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of \u20ac3.015bn, below forecasts of \u20ac3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row \u2013 after nine years and \u00a350bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black \u2013 for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it\u2019s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of \u00a3752 million versus a \u00a37bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked \u00a33.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that \u2018substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters\u2019. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here\u2019s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA\u2019s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of \u00a32.2bn and an attributable profit of \u00a375m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week\u2019s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven\u2019t seen any sort of follow through from last week\u2019s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard\u2019s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can\u2019t. Yesterday\u2019s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January\u2019s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England\u2019s Sir David Ramsden.

The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS\u2019s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case.

And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. </p> <p>As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation \u2013 down to 1.3% in January from December\u2019s 1.4% \u2013 the region\u2019s indices couldn\u2019t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. </p> <p>There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday\u2019s hawkish meeting minutes.

Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly.</p> <p>Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission\u2019s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a8ff1d4e4b0398dfa928707\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-23T10:54:07.064Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank.

This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. </p> <p>The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank\u2019s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities...</p> <p>All in all, it\u2019s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. </p> <p>Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank\u2019s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. </p> <p>That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank\u2019s share price, so until it\u2019s materially completed, the market isn\u2019t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government\u2019s breakeven point, the taxpayer\u2019s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto \u201cdeferred\u201d until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +\u00a3752m).

RBS says it has earmarked \u00a33.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that \u2018substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters\u2019. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. </p> <p>How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years.

Based on Thursday\u2019s closing share price, Mike Killoran, the finance director, will receive \u00a324m less than the \u00a378m originally slated, while the bonus for Dave Jenkinson, the managing director, will be cut by \u00a32m to \u00a338m. All three will have future payouts under the scheme capped at \u00a329 a share, compared with a current share price of around \u00a325. Persimmon said the incentive plan had been a significant driver of the company\u2019s \u201coutstanding performance\u201d, but acknowledged the lack of a cap in the original terms of the scheme was a mistake. \u201cIt is clear that the absence of a cap \u2026 has given rise to the potential for payouts which, when triggered in full, will be significantly larger and paid earlier than might reasonably have been expected at the time the scheme was originally put to shareholders,\u201d it said in a statement. Persimmon has come under intense pressure both publicly and privately from politicians and shareholders for planning record-breaking bonus payouts to bosses after the company benefitted from the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme. The change of heart came after shareholders started to voice complaints and indicated they were considering voting against the re-election of some directors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on 25 April. This week the company\u2019s sixth-largest shareholder, Aberdeen Standard Investments, described Fairburn\u2019s bonus as \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d, and said it remained a huge concern despite his recent pledge to donate some of it to charity. Responding to Persimmon\u2019s move, Royal London Asset Management said on Friday that while the board had finally listened to shareholders, the sums being paid to the executives were still generous. The investment management firm has a 0.5% stake in Persimmon, worth about \u00a335m. \u201cThis incident has been a classic corporate governance failure and highlights the need for remuneration committees to step up and make decisions if circumstances beyond a company\u2019s control change,\u201d said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the head of responsible investment at Royal London. \u201cHowever, even after this reduction, in our view the scale of the remuneration on offer under this plan is still extremely generous given the government\u2019s support for the sector through the help-to-buy scheme. Despite this, we hope the company and shareholders can now draw a line under this issue, allowing management to devote their focus solely to the running of the company.\u201d Announcing the bonus reduction, Persimmon said its remuneration committee was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the decision. Nicholas Wrigley resigned as company chairman in December over his role in orchestrating the pay scheme. The company will be hoping it takes some of the pressure off its senior management as it prepares to publish its 2017 results next week. Earlier this month, Fairburn said he decided some time ago to give some of his bonus away but that he had wanted to take an \u201cold-fashioned approach\u201d and keep the decision private. Last year the Guardian revealed that his pay deal could be used to provide a council house for every homeless family in Yorkshire, where Persimmon is based. Even reduced by a quarter, Fairburn\u2019s bonus could be used to build more than 1,000 council houses. A donation of \u00a34.6m could provide a home for all of the 58 registered homeless families in York. It would cost \u00a360.8m to build a home for all 760 homeless families in the Yorkshire and Humber region.",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from October 2006 to May 2011 The UK economy is currently feeling the pull of two opposing forces. The strength of the global economy and healthy growth in other European economies is boosting growth in export-oriented sectors. This is confirmed by robust manufacturing growth recorded in both official data and the CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey. Meanwhile, consumers continue to be squeezed by high inflation while Brexit uncertainty is holding back business investment. Consumer indicators, including the latest retail sales data, point to very sluggish growth in household spending. Over the crucial Christmas and New Year period from November to January, retail sales volumes increased by just 0.1% on the previous three months, adjusted for seasonal factors. Car sales in January were 6.3% down on a year ago, with private sales nearly 10% below a year ago. The services sector, which is more reliant on domestic spending, is therefore acting as a drag on UK economic growth. This is being reflected in slower employment growth over the second half of last year and a slight rise in the unemployment rate from 4.3%to 4.4%. High inflation \u2013 driven by the post-Brexit fall in the pound, and rising food and energy prices \u2013 is the main factor squeezing consumer spending. CPI inflation is still running at 3% while RPI inflation is stuck at 4%. There have been some signs of relief, with the pound rising against the dollar to around $1.40, up from $1.20-1.25 about a year ago. But sterling remains weak against the euro \u2013 the most important currency for UK imports and exports. At around \u20ac1.13, the pound is still nearly 20% below its average value in 2015 against the euro. The oil price has recently fallen back from $70 a barrel to about $65 a barrel, but remains 20-30% above its level last spring. And it would not be surprising if continued strong global growth exerts further upward pressure on food and energy prices in the year ahead. As a result of these global price pressures and the weakness of the pound against the euro, inflation is likely to be slow to subside. The squeeze on consumer spending, and its dampening effect on the UK economy, is therefore likely to continue into the second half of this year. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, US, and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from June 2006 to May 2009 The big news on the month is that the number of unemployed rose by 31,000 between the rolling quarters of September to November and October to December \u2013 which provides a monthly look at how the labour market is doing rather than the Office for National Statistics\u2019 favoured three month averages. Young female unemployment numbers took a notably big jump. As a result, the unemployment rate rose unexpectedly from 4.3% to 4.4%. There were big increases in the unemployment rates of young people also. Looking on the monthly basis, employment fell by 60,000 with two-thirds of the fall accounted for by full-timers \u2013 despite what the ONS might say about employment rising by 88,000 over the three-month average. The UK labour market is hard to read when the ONS is the only statistical agency in the world to produce three-month averages \u2013 every other country produces estimates by single month. That is a disgrace. When you look at the monthly movements, there is early evidence that the labour market is turning down. In contrast the eurozone is booming and unemployment rates there are falling. In the latest data unemployment rates fell in Belgium; France; Germany; Ireland; Spain; Italy, and the Netherlands. The UK is a less attractive place to work for eastern Europeans who are seeing falling not rising unemployment rates at home and who are now increasingly staying home. These English speaking, skilled and mobile workers grease the wheels of the labour market. When they leave that lowers UK output and raises prices. The evident weakening of the labour market will come as a surprise to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, whose unduly bullish inflation report last week signalled that rate rises were coming as they concluded the labour market was not weakening. Oops! You don\u2019t raise rates, which causes unemployment to go up, when unemployment is already rising. A week is a long time in economics. The labour market is not separate from the rest of the economy. Weekly wage growth remained unchanged on the month at 2.5% but real wages fell for the ninth month in a row. As real wages slow, consumers inevitably have to reduce spending; they have reduced saving for some months but that can\u2019t go on for ever. January was a particularly tough month on the high street, showing the extent of the squeeze on consumers as sales barely bounced back from a terrible Christmas. There was also signs of slowing elsewhere. The housing market is far from in rude health, as the number of sales and new buyers falls. There is also evidence among companies that economic growth more broadly is set to slow. The Markit/CIPS UK PMIs, for services, manufacturing and construction all dropped in January. Not good.",

      "bodyText": "The Centrica chief executive, Iain Conn, avoided the indignity of cutting the dividend for a second time in three years and has probably saved his job as a result, at least for now. It will be 4,000 colleagues who lose theirs as the company embarks on another round of cost-cutting in search of stability. Conn found himself issuing regrets on many fronts \u2013 to the affected workers and to investors for \u201ca very poor shareholder experience\u201d. You bet: he inherited a share price of 279p at the start of 2015 and it\u2019s now just 142p, even with Thursday\u2019s 7% relief bounce. The dividend calculations look mighty tight since 12p a share is being distributed from earnings of 12.6p, even when those earnings are totted up on Centrica\u2019s \u201cadjusted\u201d basis. Next year the City expects earnings of 14p, which is hardly a great leap forward. Yet Conn was prepared to stick out his neck and say Centrica \u201cexpects\u201d to keep the dividend intact until 2020. The weak promise comes with two caveats \u2013 annual cash flow must be \u00a32.1bn to \u00a32.3bn and debt must not explode. Neither assumption is heroic, but the point about Centrica is that nobody really knows what will happen to profits and cashflow at British Gas when the government\u2019s price cap on standard variable tariffs (SVT) arrives. In anticipation, Centrica can shed staff and push more of its SVT customers on to fixed-price tariffs, with boiler-maintenance deals and smart thermostats as part of the package. But what\u2019s the likely long-term profit margin for British Gas? It\u2019s surely lower than the 5.5% reported last year \u2013 and maybe much lower. The same, one assumes, will apply to Conn\u2019s bonus for 2017. After last year\u2019s bonus debacle \u2013 he received a \u00a34m pay package including a \u00a3759,000 bonus \u2013 zero would be another way for him to express regret, or be told to. Pensions Regulator in the dark By the end of her bruising session with MPs one almost felt sorry for Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator. After all, she became boss only in 2015, meaning others were responsible for most of the regulator\u2019s ineffectual dance around Carillion\u2019s pension deficit. Yet the MPs\u2019 outrage was legitimate for two reasons. First, two big pension blow-ups \u2013 the other being BHS \u2013 seem to have failed to inspire a sense of urgency at the regulator. Titcomb was asked a seemingly simple question about how many pension schemes have had very lengthy recovery periods similar to Carillion\u2019s 16 years and couldn\u2019t offer even a rough estimate. Isn\u2019t that the sort of thing she should know, especially as MPs have made the sharpest pointed comments on the subject? Frank Field, co-chair of the inquiry, thought so. \u201cIf Rachel [Reeves, the other co-chair] and I bumped into you at a bus stop we would expect you to be better informed than you are now,\u201d he said. Harsh but fair. The second reason is Titcomb\u2019s apparent reluctance to concede that the regulator should have exercised its powers of intervention at Carillion and insisted on bigger and quicker contributions to the pension scheme in 2013, when the company was spraying dividends at shareholders and bonuses at directors. Instead it merely threatened to intervene, without actually doing so, before settling for a limp compromise. Maybe Titcomb was being loyal to colleagues but pleas about how \u201cvery difficult judgments were made at the time\u201d inspire little confidence that the same mistakes won\u2019t be repeated elsewhere. Pursuing Carillion\u2019s former directors, as the regulator is now doing, is sensible but any recovered sums will be tiny in the context of the deficit. The time to get heavy is when a company says it\u2019s flush with cash. Why is that so hard for Titcomb to say? Barclays needs to mind the gap \u201cToday it is difficult to imagine the world of banking as a solely male environment,\u201d runs a self-congratulatory piece on Barclays website. But, actually, it\u2019s not terribly hard because Barclays\u2019 own gender pay statistics suggest things haven\u2019t changed that much over the years. The numbers are extraordinary: women in the international division, which houses the investment bank, were paid half as much as the men last year. We\u2019ll wait to see what other banks report, but the gap feels far wider than average. Note that Barclays\u2019 nine-strong executive committee was exclusively male for a while until Laura Padovani became \u201cinterim\u201d chief compliance officer last October. The bank talks about its \u201clong-standing commitment to improving gender diversity\u201d. It\u2019s right in the sense that the same website piece reveals that an \u201cequality and diversity charter\u201d was launched as long ago as 2001. Real commitment, however, is measured in action, not in nice charters.",
