      "bodyText": "The energy watchdog's call for a full investigation into the industry is a victory for consumer power over the big six suppliers, Ofgem itself and, to a lesser extent, politicians. It will cause some uncertainty for investors looking at much-needed new power plants over the next two years but it is ultimately better for them than the current situation, which is inherently unstable and unsustainable. Ofgem is under new leadership and can discard the baggage of the past 10 years, when it was captured by the big six and failed to act robustly despite a bundle of evidence that the market was working for companies rather than consumers. Successive governments have allowed this situation to continue while failing to come up with a workable framework for modernising the creaking energy infrastructure and introducing lower-carbon power without placing an impossible burden on the consumer. Ofgem has acted after some of the companies themselves \u2013 such as E.ON \u2013 called for a deeper inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Surely now the corporate game is up for increasing profits while doing little to improve internal efficiency or provide appropriate levels of customer service. Consumer and campaign groups such as Which?, Age UK and Fuel Poverty Action will take credit for repeatedly drawing attention to the plight of those trying to pay the bills, who have lost all trust in power providers. Their campaigning has pushed politicians to press the regulator into action. But to describe the problems in the power sector as a \"political and media\" confection, as some industry executives like to do, is self-defeating. The loss of faith among consumers has been enhanced by the big six warning that the lights would go out whenever proposals emerged that would disturb the status quo. In the meantime the companies have seen their own market share remain at over 95% year after year. But then Ed Miliband broke the political consensus with his promise at last September's Labour party conference to freeze prices, break up the big six and scrap Ofgem. Ministers in the coalition government have been running to keep up, first branding the proposal Marxist, then pitching in themselves as some of the companies froze prices. Most of the big six welcomed the Ofgem call for an inquiry on the grounds it would \"clear the air\" and \"take the politics and media out of the situation\", as though the storm was not of their making. Centrica \u2013 the owner of British Gas \u2013 was the one leading the charge to suggest that a two-year inquiry would make it more likely the lights went out and would in effect freeze investment. The only substantial power project Centrica has been looking at in recent times, apart from wind farms, has been a gas-fired station at Kings Lynn in Norfolk. Indeed, that project may be delayed but most financial analysts believe the real problem with the Kings Lynn investment is the expansion of wind-generated energy, making gas-generated energy less profitable, plus low wholesale power prices because of an influx of cheap coal from America. It is a similar story across Europe. Centrica and other power companies have been mothballing gas-fired power plants in Britain. However, hard-headed independent investors, such as Macquairie, Australia's largest investment bank, and oil trader Vitol have been buying gas plants in anticipation of better trading ahead. Under the recently-introduced Energy Act and Electrical Market Review companies will be able to secure subsidies for power plants that need to be on standby when renewable energy sources cannot meet demand. Those taxpayer payments will be the main driver in deciding whether the big six invest in new capacity, not the outcome of the CMA inquiry. And whatever the CMA comes up with in the way of findings or even action, no amount of market restructuring, supplier switching and trust rebuilding will fix everything. The government must accept that energy is a national security issue that is too important to domestic consumers, business users and the general economic health of the country to be left entirely to the free market. A proper nationally funded project way beyond the half-baked Green Deal insulation programme is needed to underline that energy demand reduction must be a key part of any solution. Britain invests around \u00a335bn on defence every year but new figures out last night from the National Energy Action fuel poverty charity showed public spending on energy efficiency measures in England through the Green Deal Community Fund was \u00a380m. That latter figure equates to \u00a33.50 per electricity user.",

A member of staff has since been arrested. That arrest followed another incident in which Morrisons' group treasurer and head of tax, Paul Coyle, was arrested in December after an insider trading investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority. But Philips' decision to waive his bonus follows a trend among listed-companies' chiefs whose pay packets are increasingly under scrutiny by shareholders. Last month Barclays chief executive, Antony Jenkins, said he would waive his bonus after a \"difficult\" year for the banks, while RBS's former boss, Stephen Hester, waived his bonus for 2011 and 2012. In November the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, Sam Laidlaw, turned down his bonus worth up to \u00a33.5m as he admitted that the energy industry needed to rebuild public confidence. In January, Sainsbury's boss, Justin King, said he would convert a \u00a31.7m cash bonus due to him into shares in a bid to show confidence in the future of the company. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Next, Lord Wolfson, handed last year's \u00a32.4m bonus out to staff after he said the company's soaring share price meant the award had \"become more valuable than I could possibly have expected\".",

    "webTitle": "Big six energy suppliers could be broken up after Ofgem triggers full investigation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain has been warned that it faces an energy investment freeze and a heightened risk of blackouts after the industry watchdog called for the deepest ever investigation into the big six power suppliers. Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of British Gas parent group Centrica, said the building of new power plants would be set back by the climate of uncertainty, increasing the threat of power shortages. Centrica was backed by investors as one City firm argued that the UK now \"tops the political risk table\". A second City firm, Liberum Capital, argued: \"It is likely in our view that the hiatus in power generation investment we have seen in recent years will continue and probably deepen.\" But the warnings were dismissed by energy regulator Ofgem which said it wanted to \"clear the air\" after confirming evidence of soaring corporate profits and plunging consumer confidence. The inquiry to be undertaken by the newly created Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) could lead to the break-up of the big six power companies such as British Gas and RWE npower by separating their supply arms, which sell power to households, and the generation units that own power stations. The review could take up to two years to complete but Ofgem warned of much higher fines amounting to \"tens of millions of pounds\" against power companies if they break rules in the meantime. The inquiry follows a mounting outcry from consumers groups and politicians about rising bills and soaring fuel poverty which now afflicts 4.5 million Britons. Ofgem said dual fuel prices, where a customer takes gas and electricity from the same supplier, had risen by 24% between 2009 and 2013. Nolan said an initial look at the market over recent months by Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading and the CMA had not been driven by political pressure but by increasing evidence of market dysfunction. Dermot Nolan, the newly installed chief executive of Ofgem, insisted the probe would \"enhance confidence in the investment climate\". He added: \"Ofgem believes a referral offers the opportunity to once and for all clear the air and decide if there are any further barriers which are preventing competition from bearing down as hard as possible on prices,\" he said. \"I want to make sure that consumers are put at the heart of this market, so we will continue to take action to help consumers. This includes from today putting the industry on notice that any new serious breach of the rules which comes to light will be likely to attract a higher penalty from Ofgem.\" Ofgem said it found that 43% of customers did not trust energy companies to be clear and honest about prices, and that suppliers' retail profits - from selling energy to households and businesses - had risen to \u00a31.1bn in 2012 from \u00a3233m in 2009. Suppliers consistently set higher prices for existing consumers compared with those who have switched. The suppliers \u2013 Centrica, SSE, RWE npower, E.ON, Scottish Power and EDF Energy \u2013 control 95% of the market for retail supply. The regulator said its own review had found that consumer trust had fallen and there was no clear evidence that companies had tried to cut their costs while retail bills had more than quadrupled in three years. Some suppliers such as E.ON and Scottish Power welcomed the probe but Centrica's Laidlaw said a long inquiry could damage investment when Britain's energy security was in question because of a lack of new power stations being built. When questioned on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme about whether it would mean power outages, he said: \"There is an increasing risk. A lot can be done in terms of demand management, but actually building a new gas power station does take four years. So that's the kind of time pressure we are up against, by adding another two years that makes it six years.\" The Labour Party dismissed this argument as \"special pleading\" by British Gas while Davey said: \"He [Laidlaw] is absolutely, totally wrong and I can prove it. We have 14 contracts for power generation [in the pipeline] over the next 15 years ... What we are seeing in Britain is a big investment in energy. It is true that companies like Centrica are not investing as much as we might like them to but we are seeing independent energy generation firms like Siemens coming in in their place.\" But a research note released by Liberum Capital said the CMA probe would freeze additional expenditure by the large power companies and \"dampen investment from those corporates not directly involved in the inquiry.\" And fellow City firm Exane Paribas said last week that Britain had moved over the last year from having one of the lowest political risks to the highest \"and now ranks above Spain for the first time.\" British Gas and other members of the big six have repeatedly warned that the lights could go out \u2013 most vociferously when Ed Miliband told the party annual conference last autumn that an incoming Labour government would force companies to freeze prices, break up the big six and dismantle the regulator. This stance was undermined on Wednesday when SSE, Britain's second-biggest provider, said it would not increase prices for its five million customers until 2016 and has already split off its wholesale arm, which includes energy production and storage, from the retail business, which sells to homes and businesses. Ofgem said there were \"continuing uncertainties\" about whether having retail and wholesale businesses under one roof was in customers' best interests. Richard Lloyd, executive director of the consumer group Which?, which had led the way in pushing for a full inquiry, said: \"This investigation must work quickly to expose what is really happening in the energy market and confirm where competition is lacking. It is make-or-break time for the energy suppliers, who should not wait to be forced into action but instead start now to put customers first, keep costs as low as possible and trade transparently.\" Ofgem's request to the CMA is subject to a two-month consultation period to let the industry and interested groups have their say. The City had long-anticipated an inquiry and shares in Centrica rose marginally yesterday, although SSE saw its shares decline 2%. Centrica also released its annual report yesterday, revealing that Laidlaw had handed the \u00a3851,000 bonus in his \u00a32.2m pay packet to charity.",

It's there, though, that Inmarsat finds itself at the centre of another global story. It is the previously low-profile UK company that helped to establish that Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 almost certainly crashed in the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite data collected in this control room \u2013 when sliced, analysed and modelled \u2013 provided the key clues in narrowing the search.</p> <p>The Malaysian government has acknowledged the importance of the analysis by Inmarsat and the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch. However, Pearce, 50, and chief executive since 2012, is oddly reluctant to claim Inmarsat's contribution was critical. \"I don't know whether you can say that honestly,\" he says, pointing out that he can't know what other sources of information were used by official investigators.</p> <p>\"Our job was to get our heads down, look at our data, to try to turn that into meaningful intelligence that could support the investigation.

This conclusion was based on analysis of the \"pings\" from an Inmarsat satellite above the Indian Ocean to the aircraft's antenna. Inmarsat's communication technology is installed on most of the world's intercontinental aircraft and the system works like a mobile phone network, constantly checking for connectivity via a so-called \"handshake.\"</p> <p>\"Dozens\" of Inmarsat engineers \u2013 mostly at the HQ on Old Street's Silicon Roundabout \u2013 arrowed down the likely flight path, basing their calculations on the shift in frequencies created by a moving object (the plane) connecting with a fixed object (the satellite).</p> <p>That, at least, is the shorthand version. Pearce won't be drawn on the finer details of an exercise that has impressed aviation experts: \"You dig down a fraction beneath the apparently facile surface and it's incredibly complex and skilful engineering and extremely complex to understand requiring a lot of thought and discussion,\" he says. \"It isn't straightforward. We haven't done anything like this before.\"</p> <p>The reluctance to discuss details, he says, is to minimise misleading noise: \"The blogosphere is full of rumours, innuendo, supposition that will take the slightest bit of information and turn it into conjecture.

Now it is famous. There is no commercial benefit for Inmarsat in assisting the MH370 investigation, Pearce stresses. Nevertheless, in normal clinical style, the City's attention has turned to Inmarsat as an investment. The share price has risen 9% in the past fortnight.</p> <p>The company was born in 1979 as the International Maritime Satellite Organisation, a not-for-profit venture created by the International Maritime Organisation to enable ships to stay in contact with shore and call for help; emergency distress calls are still routed as priority for free.</p> <p>It was privatised in 1999, bought by private equity houses Apax and Permira in 2003, then floated in London two years later, trebling in value in the next half-decade. It was briefly a member of the FTSE 100 index before a fall in the share price in 2010 and 2011. Revenues from the core maritime business (about 60% of last year's group total of $1.25bn) stalled in the global downturn. Then came the collapse into bankruptcy protection of LightSquared, a US telecoms firm planning to build a wireless broadband network in the US using spectrum leased from Inmarsat's satellites. The US military's withdrawal from Afghanistan has been another headwind.</p> <p>Now the share price has almost regained its old levels as attention has turned to the potential of Inmarsat's latest generation of satellites, called Global Xpress. The first, built by Boeing, was launched last December from Kazakhstan and two more will go up later this year. A fourth is on order as a reserve in case of a blow-up on the launchpad, not unknown in this industry, although Inmarsat has never lost a satellite. Pearce calls 2014 \"a year of transition leading to transformational growth\".</p> <p>The kit is substantial. Each Global Xpress satellite costs about $400m and is the size of a London bus. The new generation can run 100 times faster than the old technology and the potential size of new markets is said to be worth $3bn a year across maritime, aviation, energy, government and commercial fields.</p> <p>In aviation, where Inmarsat's broadband service is already on 5,000 planes, it could mean high-quality 3D pictures being received by passengers on planes. Business people flying across China could be able to join video conferences hosted in the US. \"That's the era that's coming,\" says Pearce.</p> <p>The new technology will also be capable of streaming critical positioning and cockpit data from aircraft in real time, reducing the urgency of finding the black box in cases like MH370.

Markit\u2019s PMI surveys showed that the weather disrupted business across the economy in the first two months of the year, but that a rebound was evident in March. The all-sector PMI recovered from 53.3 in February to 55.5. Even with this rebound, the surveys are signalling annualised GDP growth of a mere 2.5% in the first quarter, but policymakers have already braced themselves for some disappointing numbers for early 2014 and remain committed to tapering the Fed\u2019s stimulus such that it will most likely stop buying assets by the fall. </p> <p>Given the willingness of the Fed to \u2018look through\u2019 recent weather affected data, Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers should have little impact on policymakers\u2019 views, except of course if the numbers come in super-strong or disastrously weak. Our PMI survey employment index points to private sector payroll growth of approximately 130,000 in March, which is a figure that will worry neither the hawks nor the doves, given the weather disruptions. </p> <p>More importantly for the course of policymaking, and how long the Fed will decide is appropriate to keep interest rates at their record low, will be how much momentum the economy has retained after the weather impact falls out of the numbers, and that of course includes the need to discount strong rebound numbers as the weaker improves. <br></p> <p>The last Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers slightly more hawkish than many had expected. The Open Market Committee upgraded their outlook for the labour market and, while noting that interest rates were not expected to rise until next year, the forecasts indicated that they expected their target rate of be 1.00% by the end of 2015 and 2.25% by the end of 2016 on average, up from 0.75% and 1.75% respectively at the December meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53341fdde4b053cc1d015cf5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-27T12:56:53.486Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jobless claims drop to four-month low</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was more good economic news in the US.

Indeed, even if sales volumes merely held steady in March, they would still be 1% higher than they were in the fourth quarter. Retail spending, which accounts for about 20% of GDP, would therefore add 0.2 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth in Q1, double the amount they did in Q4. </p> <p>Granted, today\u2019s figures may fuel concerns that the economic recovery is too dependent on an unsustainable consumer spending binge. (Note that recent figures on trade and industrial production in Q1 so far have been fairly weak.) And it is true that much of the recovery in spending to date has reflected consumers saving less. But with real pay set to pick up imminently and employment intentions strengthening, the foundations for the recovery in consumer spending should be more solid soon. As a result, the recovery in retail sales that is now underway looks set to be more than just a flash in the pan. Indeed, we continue to expect retail sales volumes to rise by 2.5% or so this year, the most since 2007.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53340438e4b053cc1d015cc6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-27T11:03:49.700Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England gets ready to rein in risky mortgage lending</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In an attempt to tackle risky mortgage lending, the Bank of England has urged banks to consider the risk of future spikes in interest rates when approving mortgages.

This was eased with news of a 12% increase in sales for March and a continuation of market share gains. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-27T11:15:56.401Z\">at 11.15am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5334010de4b07edc52cb97ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-27T10:48:46.123Z\">10.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's not just Greece that's on strike. <b>Germany's main airports have been hit by a strike</b> as public sector workers upped the ante in their pay dispute with the government.

From next week, energy bills must display tariff information in a clear and consistent manner, which will help consumers make quick comparisons. Switching must be a part of the solution to the current high energy prices \u2013 it is a healthy part of a functioning competitive marketplace and the process should be made as easy as possible for consumers. The market is clearly not working entirely in the consumer's favour, which is why 43% of consumers do not trust the transparency of energy suppliers. </p> <p>Putting energy companies under the spotlight over what could be a two year review period will likely encourage them to get ahead of the game. Expect to see an increasing number of companies announce price freezes \u2013 following in the footsteps of SSE - in order to retain customers and win consumer and regulatory trust. The energy price hikes of some companies in an uncompetitive market are clearly evidenced by the money people can save by switching providers \u2013 in many cases comfortably around \u00a3350 a year.

Scotland's banks and finance industry would face a long and costly period of disruption and uncertainty if there was a yes vote for independence, a major industry organisation has warned. Severin Carrell writes: Scottish Financial Enterprise, the trade body for 110 banks, insurers, finance firms and pension companies, said there were too many unknowns over which currency and central bank Scotland would use, the impact of its EU membership talksand the effects of two diverging markets replacing the UK's current single market. It said the scale and complexity of the task facing Scotland after a yes vote cast real doubts on whether the Scottish government's target of declaring independence in March 2016 was achievable. \"Having consulted widely and in particular with those not advancing a case on either side of the independence debate, it looks likely that negotiations will take several years and certainly a lot longer than the 18 months suggested by the Scottish government,\" it stated.

JK More on GSK's recall of its Alli weight loss pill from the US and Puerto Rico. Alli can be bought over the counter. The UK and other countries are not affected by this recall. A GSK spokeswoman told me that there have been no reports of serious illness. So far there is evidence that 20 bottles have been tampered with, with GSK receiving inquiries from 12 or 13 consumers in seven US states. GSK issued this statement: \"Safety is our first priority and we are asking retailers and pharmacies to remove all alli from their shelves immediately,\u201d said Colin Mackenzie, President Consumer Healthcare North America. \u201cWe have posted a Consumer Alert on our website, www.myalli.com, and issued a News Release with information and photographs to help consumers determine if their alli is authentic.\u201d alli\u00ae is a turquoise blue capsule with a dark blue band imprinted with the text \u201c60 Orlistat\u201d. It is packaged in a labeled bottle that has an inner foil seal imprinted with the words: \u201cSealed for Your Protection.\u201d Consumers should confirm any alli\u00ae in their possession matches this description. Pictures of the product are available on our website: www.myalli.com. Consumers who have product they are unsure or concerned about should not use it. Instead, they should call GSK promptly at 800-671-2554, and a representative will provide further instructions. If they have consumed questionable product, they should also contact their healthcare providers. Back in the US, the number of contracts to buy previously-owned homes fell to its lowest level in more than two years in February. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 0.8% to 93.9 last month, the lowest level since October 2011. GlaxoSmithKline is (voluntarily) recalling all its Alli weight loss products from the US and Puerto Rico, after receiving complaints from customers in seven states about bottles of Alli that contained other tablets and capsules. The British pharmaceutical giant believes that some bottles have been tampered with and may not contain authentic Alli \u2013 a non-prescription drug \u2013 and is working with the US Food and Drug Administration on the recall from shops and pharmacies. The UK government has announced its pension charge cap. Workplace pension schemes that automatically enroll their members will be subject to a 0.75% annual charge cap from April 2015, the pensions minister told the House of Commons. The government went for the toughest of the three options it had been considering. Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic data firm Markit, sent his instant reaction to the US data. The data suggest that the economy had slightly more momentum than previously thought before it was hit by extreme weather at the start of 2014. Markit\u2019s PMI surveys showed that the weather disrupted business across the economy in the first two months of the year, but that a rebound was evident in March. The all-sector PMI recovered from 53.3 in February to 55.5. Even with this rebound, the surveys are signalling annualised GDP growth of a mere 2.5% in the first quarter, but policymakers have already braced themselves for some disappointing numbers for early 2014 and remain committed to tapering the Fed\u2019s stimulus such that it will most likely stop buying assets by the fall. Given the willingness of the Fed to \u2018look through\u2019 recent weather affected data, Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers should have little impact on policymakers\u2019 views, except of course if the numbers come in super-strong or disastrously weak. Our PMI survey employment index points to private sector payroll growth of approximately 130,000 in March, which is a figure that will worry neither the hawks nor the doves, given the weather disruptions. More importantly for the course of policymaking, and how long the Fed will decide is appropriate to keep interest rates at their record low, will be how much momentum the economy has retained after the weather impact falls out of the numbers, and that of course includes the need to discount strong rebound numbers as the weaker improves. The last Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers slightly more hawkish than many had expected. The Open Market Committee upgraded their outlook for the labour market and, while noting that interest rates were not expected to rise until next year, the forecasts indicated that they expected their target rate of be 1.00% by the end of 2015 and 2.25% by the end of 2016 on average, up from 0.75% and 1.75% respectively at the December meeting. There was more good economic news in the US. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week and touched its lowest level in nearly four months. Jobless claims fell by 10,000 to 311,000, the lowest since November, the Labor Department said. The US fourth-quarter GDP figures are out \u2013 the economy grew a bit faster than previously thought. The annual rate has been revised higher to 2.6% from 2.4%, a toucher lower than the 2.7% estimated by Wall Street economists. It still marks a slowdown from the 4.1% growth seen in the previous quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of the economy, was much stronger than originally estimated. It grew by 3.3% , revised from 2.6%, the fastest pace in three years. In the first quarter, growth is expected to have slowed to 2%. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, has asked George Osborne for his version of how much political pressure was brought to bear to support the Co-op Bank's failed bid for more than 600 Lloyds branches (codenamed Project Verde). Tryie wrote to Osborne yesterday asking: Did Treasury ministers or any Treasury officials at any time bring undue pressure to bear on the Co-operative Bank or group, or Lloyds Banking Group, in respect of the sale of the Verde branches? Tyrie said in a statement: I have written to the Chancellor to clarify the extent and nature of exchanges between the Treasury - both Ministers and officials - and those involved in the bidding process. The Chancellor may be asked about this when he appears before the Committee next Thursday. The committee has heard various versions of events. Lord Levene, who headed a rival bid, and former Bank of England governor Lord King have disagreed over whether King told Levene the Co-op was favoured because of political interference. Then Paul Flowers, the disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman, said on Tuesday that there was pressure from Osborne for the deal to go through. The deal collapsed last year shortly before a \u00a31.5bn hole in the Co-op Bank's finances was revealed. More from Centrica's annual report: the keenly watched pay information. The bare numbers show that chief executive Sam Laidlaw's pay more than halved last year to \u00a32.3m from \u00a35.7m. The report also reveals that Laidlaw has donated last year's bonus of \u00a3851,000 to charity. Centrica published the report on the day that Ofgem called for a review of the energy market by the competition regulator. Here's what remuneration committee chairwoman Lesley Knox said: The Committee noted Sam Laidlaw\u2019s personal desire to donate any annual incentive award for the year to charity and took the necessary steps to facilitate that. As a result, Sam will not be required to defer the usually mandatory portion (40%) of his Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) award and will instead donate the entire award received in cash. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has published its annual report for 2013, in which it sets out the main risks to its business. The company is obviously feeling the heat. Under \"political and regulatory intervention\" it says: The energy industry and markets expect to be subject to increased political scrutiny in the lead-up to the 2015 UK general election. This could result in manifesto pledges that do not translate well into considered policy which in turn could result in sharp fluctuations in investor confidence, an increase in the cost of capital and a reduction in the credit worthiness of energy buyers due to the uncertainty this creates. In the event that Scotland was to become independent following the referendum, some of our upstream assets could be subject to a new fiscal regime. Our downstream businesses could also be subject to policy and regulatory decisions of an independent Scotland. While the outcome and impact of this referendum remains uncertain, this could have impacts on our operational and financial results. And this comes under the heading of \"trust and perception\": The energy sector in the UK is currently the subject of unprecedented public and political debate and scrutiny against a backdrop of declining disposable income for many customers. This is not only raising concern for our customers but also damaging investor confidence, increasing the prospect of potential further government or regulatory intervention in our operating markets at a time when substantial investment is required to secure supplies of energy for the UK in the long term. The positions taken by political parties and the media in the run-up to the 2015 UK general election could also lead to further uncertainty, as the consensus that existed between them over key questions of energy policy has broken down... The increased use of social media allows customers and consumer groups to engage in direct action and other campaigns more readily than before. Any failure to restore trust in the energy industry and markets could lead to campaigns for corporate change through specific resolutions to direct the Company in a particular manner. Capital Economics' Samuel Tombs thinks today's strong retail sales figures are a sign of things to come and that worries about unsustainable consumer spending are overdone: It is clear from looking at the level of retail sales that they are now on a strong upward trend. Indeed, even if sales volumes merely held steady in March, they would still be 1% higher than they were in the fourth quarter. Retail spending, which accounts for about 20% of GDP, would therefore add 0.2 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth in Q1, double the amount they did in Q4. Granted, today\u2019s figures may fuel concerns that the economic recovery is too dependent on an unsustainable consumer spending binge. (Note that recent figures on trade and industrial production in Q1 so far have been fairly weak.) And it is true that much of the recovery in spending to date has reflected consumers saving less. But with real pay set to pick up imminently and employment intentions strengthening, the foundations for the recovery in consumer spending should be more solid soon. As a result, the recovery in retail sales that is now underway looks set to be more than just a flash in the pan. Indeed, we continue to expect retail sales volumes to rise by 2.5% or so this year, the most since 2007. In an attempt to tackle risky mortgage lending, the Bank of England has urged banks to consider the risk of future spikes in interest rates when approving mortgages. The central bank is readying tools to rein in overly risky lending. House prices have climbed around 10% across Britain over the past year, and the Bank said mortgages were higher as a share of income than at any point since 2005, in a statement published this morning following last week's meeting of its financial policy committee. It said: In a continuation of a longer-term trend, mortgages at loan-to-income ratios above four times accounted for a higher share of new mortgages in the third quarter of 2013 than at any time since the data series began in 2005. New mortgage lending at high loan-to-value ratios remained low by historical standards, though the number of mortgage products offering higher loan-to-value ratios had doubled over the previous six months. Given the increasing momentum, the FPC will remain vigilant to emerging vulnerabilities, will continue to monitor conditions closely and will take further proportionate and graduated action if warranted. Read the full story from our economics editor Larry Elliott here. If in doubt turn to Russia for a market catalyst, says Nick Dale-Lace, senior sales trader at CMC Markets. Forceful rhetoric from Obama overnight regarding Putin and Russia has taken the wind out of European equity markets sails as the two day rally comes to an abrupt end. In a market clearly lacking in conviction for where to go next we again turn to the situation in Russia to provide a catalyst for market direction as we seem to have done repeatedly over the past few weeks. Retail sales figures this morning failed to move the market and we now hope that this afternoons GDP numbers from the US will provide some concrete economic data on which to base genuine market valuations and hence give traders something on which to hang their bullish or bearish coats. After a stellar 2013 Hennes &amp; Mauritz, the second biggest fashion retailer in the world is 4% lower this morning on news of weaker than expected first quarter profits. This was blamed on both the general retail environment they find themselves in which is proving to be particularly challenging with the worlds current economic situation as well as a recent increase in business investment with online service development being a major area of spend. This was eased with news of a 12% increase in sales for March and a continuation of market share gains. It's not just Greece that's on strike. Germany's main airports have been hit by a strike as public sector workers upped the ante in their pay dispute with the government. Frankfurt and Munich are among those affected. Lufthansa cancelled a third of flights scheduled for today, including almost all domestic and European short-haul flights during the strike period until 1300 GMT. The walkout is part of wider action that also includes local transport staff and child carers. Trade unions are demanding pay rises of 3.5% plus an extra \u20ac100 per month for 2.1 million federal and municipal public sector workers, which would take the total increase to 6.7%. Alan Clarke at Scotiabank says \"UK retail sales are \"flying\". The breakdown is volatile from one month to the next. But one thing that comes across loud and clear is that components related to the housing market are doing very well indeed. For example, department store sales are up almost 6% y/y. The rather obscure 'other non-food' component is up 10% y/y. Internet sales are back up to 20% y/y. Notwithstanding that the consumer is enjoying some favourable tail winds, it is hard to see how this pace of growth can be maintained for much longer. After all, real income growth has only just turned positive. Nonetheless, for now, the consumer should be very supportive for Q1 GDP, which is just as well because the early data suggest that net exports are going to be weak. So much for rebalancing. Over on our Realitycheck pages, my colleague Juliette Jowit has looked at whether the investigation into the Big Six energy suppliers could cause blackouts. An official investigation into over-charging customers for gas and electricity raised an \"increasing risk\" of blackouts, claims Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of the UK's biggest gas supplier, Centrica . Really? More here. Here's more on the IMF bailout for Ukraine, courtesy of Reuters. The $14-18bn loan agreement is intended to help Ukraine meet debt payments looming this year after months of anti-government protests which resulted in the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych and a standoff with Moscow in which Russia annexed the Crimea region. The mission has reached a staff-level agreement with the authorities of Ukraine on an economic reform programme that can be supported by a two-year stand-by arrangement with the IMF,\" the IMF said in a statement. The financial support from the broader international community that the programme will unlock amounts to $27bn over the next two years. Of this, assistance from the IMF will range between $14-18bn, with the precise amount to be determined once all bilateral and multilateral support is accounted for. Read the full story here. Returning to the strong UK retail sales numbers which took analysts by surprise, Keith Richardson, managing director of the retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: These figures are welcome news for retailers, particularly when viewed against the backdrop of the extreme weather conditions that affected large parts of the country during February. They suggest that consumer confidence is heading in the right direction and the sector is benefiting from an improved outlook. Looking further ahead, price cuts particularly in the grocery sector, will benefit consumers in future months, although this will impact upon margins for both retailers and their suppliers. Retailers will look to the arrival of spring as a further opportunity to maintain positive momentum. More Ofgem reaction. How many more winters before bills come down? asks Henry de Zoete, former government adviser and co-founder of ThisIsTheBigDeal.com. All this decision does is push the issue further down the road. It will take years to report, and even longer to implement. Meanwhile, the energy companies will be delighted to continue business as usual. But when energy bills have doubled people need help now. How many more winters before bills come down? The only way for people to challenge the Big Six and get cheaper energy bills now is to group together. There\u2019s power in numbers. Just out: UK retail sales jumped 1.7% last month, following January's 2% drop \u2013 over three times as much as expected. Sales volumes were up 1.6% in the three months to February, the highest since August. Supermarkets and other food stores contributed more than half of the growth in February. James Padmore, head of energy at comparethemarket.com, said: When it comes to energy bills, clarity is king. Although Ofgem highlights the lack of switching, its reforms being introduced next week will actually help people to change energy suppliers more easily. From next week, energy bills must display tariff information in a clear and consistent manner, which will help consumers make quick comparisons. Switching must be a part of the solution to the current high energy prices \u2013 it is a healthy part of a functioning competitive marketplace and the process should be made as easy as possible for consumers. The market is clearly not working entirely in the consumer's favour, which is why 43% of consumers do not trust the transparency of energy suppliers. Putting energy companies under the spotlight over what could be a two year review period will likely encourage them to get ahead of the game. Expect to see an increasing number of companies announce price freezes \u2013 following in the footsteps of SSE - in order to retain customers and win consumer and regulatory trust. The energy price hikes of some companies in an uncompetitive market are clearly evidenced by the money people can save by switching providers \u2013 in many cases comfortably around \u00a3350 a year. For a family of four this could pay for roughly a year and a half\u2019s broadband. More reaction to the energy competition investigation. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, welcomed it but said that it would take at least 18 months before any proposals come out of the probe. It is clear from the evidence we have seen that competition is not working well enough and it is absolutely essential that, in order for consumers to benefit from competition, we obtain a greater level of engagement. Competition is working well in the supermarket sector \u2013 why can\u2019t it work as well for energy? We also look forward to the launch of Ofgem\u2019s consumer engagement campaign. Many of us lack both the information and the confidence to participate in this market. We need a simple, straight talking education programme that enables consumers to make the market work for them. What is clear is that there is no cavalry coming to the rescue anytime soon. In the meantime, consumers will have to take their own steps to make their bills more affordable. There are two ways to do this - the first is to pay as little as possible for the energy we use; the second is to use less of it, by making homes as energy efficient as possible. The London Stock Exchange said this morning that money raised on its markets surged 91% in the 11 months to the end of February and there was more in the pipeline. Equity capital raised jumped to \u00a328.3bn from \u00a314.8bn, with 162 stock market flotations against 107 a year earlier. The European recovery rally has come to a halt following Wall Street's weak finish last night. Main stock markets are down between 0.4% and 0.5%. Swedish clothing chain Hennes &amp; Mauritz \u2013 the world's second-biggest fashion retailer after Spain's Inditex \u2013 disappointed with results that fell well short of analysts' forecasts, triggering a 3.8% drop in the share price. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has agreed a $14-18bn stand-by agreement with Ukraine, a deal that will unlock further loans to reach a total of $27bn over the next two years. In a sign that the Ukraine crisis is affecting some businesses, Eurasia Drilling \u2013 Russia's biggest oilfield services company \u2013 said it expects a fall in 2014 revenues due to the weaker rouble (as well as Rosneft's decision to develop its own servicing business). In London, shares in SSE and British Gas owner Centrica fell after Ofgem, the energy regulator, asked the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the Big Six energy suppliers. SSE lost 1% while Centrica slipped 0.6%. The watchdog wants to settle 'once and for all' whether the companies' profit rises are due to barriers preventing competition More on the story here. The CBI business lobby group was quick to respond. Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, said: We must have an energy market in this country that can attract the \u00a3110bn of investment needed over the coming years to secure and transform our power supply, while ensuring bills are manageable for both households and businesses. An inquiry provides an opportunity to resolve the current debate and win back some much-needed confidence in the market. To achieve this, it is vital that the CMA is able to get on with its job swiftly, free from political interference. The FTSE 100 index in London has tumbled some 30 points, or 0.4%, to 6574, while Germany's Dax, France's CAC, Italy's FTSE MIB and Spain's Ibex all slipped 0.2% in early trading. The main focus this morning is UK retail sales for February, which are likely to have bounced back after January's 1.5% slump. City economists have pencilled in a 0.5% rise \u2013 there was lots of heavy discounting that month which should have boosted sales volumes \u2013 but the bad weather makes it a tad hard to forecast. This morning also brings the statement from the Bank of England\u2019s March Financial Policy Committee meeting. Later today, we will get US fourth-quarter GDP revisions, weekly jobless claims and pending home sales for February. Wall Street analysts are expecting an upward revision to GDP growth to an annualised rate of 2.7% from 2.4%, driven by personal consumption. Equity market calls from Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: FTSE100 is expected to open 30 points lower at 6,575 DAX is expected to open 36 points lower at 9,413 CAC40 is expected to open 22 points lower at 4,363 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It looks like the rally enjoyed by European shares in recent days is over, with markets expected to track Wall Street's dip last night, where tech stocks such as Facebook and King Digital Entertainment plummeted. Facebook shares lost nearly 7% after it unveiled the purchase of the virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for $2bn (\u00a31.2bn). King Digital, the company behind Candy Crush, had a torrid stock market debut in New York, with shares crashing 16%. US president Obama's comments last night \u2013 he declared there were no easy answers nor military solutions to the Crimea crisis \u2013 and yesterday's disappointing underlying durable goods figures dragged down sentiment. Banks are going to be in focus today after ratings agency Fitch lowered the outlook on 18 European banks last night, including Deutsche Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Italy's Unicredit. On the other side of the Atlantic, the Federal Reserve rejected the capital plans of five large banks including Citigroup as well as the US divisions of HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, under new stress test scenarios. The banks must come up with new plans ASP.",

It plans to expand in the Norwegian and Australian offshore oil and gas markets. It will pay for the deal with a 5 for 13 rights issued at 790p a share to raise \u00a31.1bn before expenses. Mining shares were weaker after Glencore Xstrata decided to suspend production at an Australian mine following a plunge in coal prices. The company said it was no longer financially viable to operate the Ravensworth underground mine - which produced 2.1m tonnes of coal last year - due to lower prices, higher costs, a strong Australian dollar and geological constraints. Glencore was down 4p at 307.1p while Anglo American dipped 2p to \u00a314.87, and Rio Tinto dropped 29p to \u00a332.75. Among the other fallers, Tullow Oil lost 18p to 759p after a downbeat drilling report from Kenya, showing poorly developed oil bearing reservoir sands at a site four kilometres away from an earlier discovery. The competition investigation into the energy market, with the threat of a break up of the big six, prompted a mixed response from investors, with British Gas owner Centrica shrugging off early losses to end 2.1p better at 325.2p but SSE slipping 31p to \u00a314.87. Better than expected UK retail sales were outweighed by disappointing figures from Sweden's H&amp;M, so Next lost 200p to \u00a367.45 while Marks &amp; Spencer fell 4.1p to 455.1p. Finally Fox Marble, which owns quarries in Kosovo and south east Europe, lost 4% to 18p despite in-line results showing a net loss of \u20ac2.57m, down from \u20ac7.44m. The company has moved into production and won its first sales, and is currently building a processing plant in Kosovo. Its range of marble blocks and slabs sell for around \u20ac200 a tonne for the lower grade to \u20ac1,300 for premium Sivec marble. Chief executive Christopher Gilbert said its existing quarries had enough marble to last for 3,000 years, and now production had started it would concentrate on growing sales and boosting its distribution. It plans to brand its products as Etruscan marble, and is gaining customers in the UK, US and China in the high-end construction market. With extraction costs fairly low, the company reckons its gross margin is between 60% and 75%. Broker Fox-Davies - no connection - believes earnings could reach \u20ac3.4m next year.",

Among the other fallers so far, Tullow Oil has lost 28p to 749p after a downbeat drilling report from Kenya, showing poorly developed oil bearing reservoir sands at a site four kilometres away from an earlier discovery. Investec said: This is a string of pearls well so the market will already have assumed a hit. This could create an adverse reaction this morning. This well is just next door to Ngamia-1. The reservoirs encountered at Emong were poorly developed but oil bearing. Looks prospect rather than play specific but this result will test simplistic assumptions in the market about the drillout of the remaining string of pearls prospectivity. The competition investigation into the energy market, with the threat of a break up of the big six, has prompted a mixed response from investors, with British Gas owner Centrica shrugging off early losses to add 3p to 326.1p but SSE slipping 17p to \u00a315.01.",
