    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's business leaders have warned that the country risks an economic \"car crash\" as a respected international thinktank issued a stark warning that millions of English adults cannot read, write or add up better than primary school children. An investigation by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that a quarter of adults in England have maths skills no better than a 10-year-old, a conclusion that also prompted a political row in which the Conservatives attacked Labour's record in government. That means an estimated 8.5 million adults are only able to manage one-step tasks in arithmetic, sorting numbers or reading graphs. The same body also concluded that one in six adults could only just decipher sentences and read a paragraph of text \u2013 the literacy level of a child in their final year of primary education. Young people in England, those aged between 16 and 24, also scored 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 of the world's developed countries behind Estonia, Australia, Poland and Slovakia. The OECD survey did not include people from Scotland or Wales, which declined to take part on cost grounds. \"It's a car crash in slow motion for the economy,\" said John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. \"You have about 30% of every year of 16-year-olds who have been failed by the education system. Not by teachers. After 11 years in full time education, when they enter the labour force without adequate GCSE English or maths everyone loses out.\" Overall, English adults of all ages 16-65 rank 11th for literacy and 17th for numeracy. The consistently top performers were adults in Finland, Japan, Korea and the Netherlands. The OECD warned that the \"talent pool of highly skilled adults in England and Northern Ireland is likely to shrink relative to that of other countries\". It means that England is the only country in the developed world where the generation approaching retirement is more literate and numerate than the youngest adults. In a stark assessment of the success and failure of the 720 million-strong adult workforce across the wealthier economies, the economic thinktank warns that, in England, adults aged 55 to 65 perform better than 16- to 24-year-olds at foundation levels of literacy and numeracy. When the results within age groups are compared across participating countries, older adults in England score higher in literacy and numeracy than the average among their peers, while younger adults show some of the lowest scores for their age group. \"The implication for England and Northern Ireland is that the stock of skills available to them is bound to decline over the next decades unless significant action is taken to improve skills proficiency among young people,\" the OECD said. Matthew Hancock, the minister for skills and enterprise, said young people covered by the survey \"were educated almost entirely\" under the last government, noting that \"someone aged 18 when they took the OECD tests would have started school aged five in 1998 and finished compulsory education aged 16 in 2009\". He added that: \"This shocking report shows England has some of the least literate and numerate young adults in the developed world. These are Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations.\" However, David Blunkett, Tony Blair's first education secretary, who introduced both the literacy hour and numeracy hour into schools, questioned the methodology of the OECD, saying it \"leaves a number of questions unanswered\". \"Some have even blamed massive youth unemployment on the lack of literacy and numeracy skills of the under-25s. This is a staggering reversal of responsibility at a time when instead of investing heavily in preparation for employment, youngsters are being offered piecemeal, short term bites of experience which do not equip them for the world of tomorrow.\" The OECD research, the first of its kind, surveyed 166,000 people in 22 OECD member countries, as well as Russia and Cyprus, who sat through two hours of intense questioning about their skills and background. One of the questions raised is how so many adults have been left behind when GCSE results were improving. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's deputy director for education and skills, said that he could not prove there had been \"grade inflation. But intuitively in the UK there appears some truth in this idea\". Arguments over educational standards, look set to feature in the run up to the next general election. Last week the prime minister called for young people under the age of 25 to be stripped of benefits so that they could \"earn or learn\" their way through life. Labour argues that while in government it \"drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010\". The OECD report also revealed that there appears to be a distinct hollowing out of the workforce across the rich world, with jobs requiring highly educated workers rising by around 20% and those needing a medium or low skills base dropping by about 10% each.",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail shares demand outstrips supply", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dozens of banks, hedge funds and other institutional investors will be prevented from buying any Royal Mail shares as demand for stakes in the privatisation hugely outstrips supply. Institutional investors are thought to have ordered more than 10 times the number of shares available, meaning only those that offered to pay the maximum \u00a33.30-a-share will be able to buy any stock \u2013 and even then they will not collect anywhere near the amount they requested. A \u00a33.30 share price values Royal Mail at \u00a33.3bn and will see the government collect \u00a32bn from the 60% of the business being sold. A further 10% is being given to Royal Mail's 150,000 employees \u2013 each will collect shares worth about \u00a32,200. The original government price range for the shares \u2013 set on the advice of investment banks UBS and Goldman Sachs, which collected millions in advisory fees \u2013 had been between \u00a32.60-\u00a33.30. If the government had priced the shares at \u00a34 it would have collected an extra \u00a3400m for taxpayers. The amount of shares available to banks will be decreased to ensure the government meets the majority of orders from the public. The 10% of the shares reserved for employees are being distributed for free but it was revealed that 368 staff had refused to take up their allocation. Royal Mail would not identify those who had turned down the free shares or explain their reasons, but it is understood some staff rejected the shares as a protest against the privatisation while others declined due to their religious or ethical beliefs. All eight of Royal Mail's non-executive directors also turned down the shares. It is understood they had decided it would be inappropriate for them to benefit from a scheme designed to benefit hard-working frontline employees. However, Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive who was paid \u00a31.6m last year, will take up her free allocation. She is also understood to have placed a multimillion-pound order for more shares. Royal Mail declined to comment on the latter. Stockbrokers and the government's Royal Mail share sale website have been overwhelmed by demand from the public keen to buy shares in the biggest privatisation since John Major sold off the railways in the 1990s. Eager investors continued to place orders in a last minute dash on Tuesday before the 11.59pm deadline. City broker IG Index said it had not experienced such a high level of public excitement over a share sale since the flotation of Facebook in 2012 and the privatisations of BT, British Gas, British Airways and dozens of other state-owned companies under Margaret Thatcher's government. \"People have got memories about how well these government sell-offs did back in the 1980s and 90s,\" IG's chief market strategist David Jones said. \"With those, there were decent windfall profits on the first day.\" IG predicts the shares could rise to between \u00a33.85-\u00a34.05 on Royal Mail's first day as a public company on Friday. A rise to \u00a34 would mean investors would make an immediate 21% paper return. Michael Fallon, the business minister in charge of the sale, has said he will do all he can to ensure as many people as possible are able to share in the privatisation. \"I'm committed to making sure smaller investors get their fair share,\" he said. If public demand proves as strong as expected he will cut back on the amount of shares reserved for banks and other institutions, to make more available to the public. Previously, only 30% of the shares had been reserved for the public. It is understood that the government is doing all it can to ensure that it honours all the public orders for a minimum of \u00a3750 of shares. If the shares rise by 20% on Friday, \u00a3750 of shares will be worth \u00a3900 by the end of the afternoon. Orders from the public for more than \u00a3750 are likely to be scaled back, with larger orders cut back more severely. Ministers will meet advisers on Wednesday and Thursday to decide exactly how many shares applicants will collect. The final share price, which is almost certain to be \u00a33.30, will not be announced until Friday morning. Conditional share trading will start on Friday, but people who have ordered shares directly from the government website or the Post Office will have to wait until at least Tuesday before they can sell. Royal Mail staff, who are 96% opposed to the privatisation and are balloting for days of strikes, plan to protest outside parliament today. The Communication Workers Union is also planning a protest at the London Stock Exchange to coincide with the flotation at 8am Friday. Royal Mail is expected to join the FTSE100 list of Britain's biggest companies. Demand for the shares massively increased after City analyst Gert Zonneveld said he was convinced the government had undervalued the 500-year-old company \"by more than \u00a31bn\". Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, has attacked the government for failing to realise the true value of Royal Mail and selling off the national institution on the cheap. \"This is turning into a dream and a bonanza for City speculators and hedge funds, meanwhile the taxpayer \u2026 is getting massively shortchanged,\" he said Vince Cable, the business secretary, has fought back against Umunna, accusing him of irresponsibly and dangerous implying that the company is undervalued and telling voters there's an \"easy bargain to be made\". \"I think you should consider the risk that you may be influencing the decisions of retail investors,\" Cable wrote in a letter. \"Equity investment always involves risk, particularly when the company in question is new to the market. In the light of this it is dangerous to imply that there is an easy bargain to be made.",

      "body": "<p>Dozens of banks, hedge funds and other institutional investors will be prevented from buying any Royal Mail shares as demand for stakes in the privatisation hugely outstrips supply.</p> <p>Institutional investors are thought to have ordered more than 10 times the number of shares available, meaning only those that offered to pay the maximum \u00a33.30-a-share will be able to buy any stock \u2013 and even then they will not collect anywhere near the amount they requested.</p> <p>A \u00a33.30 share price values Royal Mail at \u00a33.3bn and will see the government collect \u00a32bn from the 60% of the business being sold. A further 10% is being given to Royal Mail's 150,000 employees \u2013 each will collect shares worth about \u00a32,200.</p> <p>The original government price range for the shares \u2013 set on the advice of investment banks UBS and Goldman Sachs, which collected millions in advisory fees \u2013 had been between \u00a32.60-\u00a33.30. If the government had priced the shares at \u00a34 it would have collected an extra \u00a3400m for taxpayers.</p> <p>The amount of shares available to banks will be decreased to ensure the government meets the majority of orders from the public. The 10% of the shares reserved for employees are being distributed for free but it was revealed that 368 staff had refused to take up their allocation.</p> <p>Royal Mail would not identify those who had turned down the free shares or explain their reasons, but it is understood some staff rejected the shares as a protest against the privatisation while others declined due to their religious or ethical beliefs.</p> <p>All eight of Royal Mail's non-executive directors also turned down the shares. It is understood they had decided it would be inappropriate for them to benefit from a scheme designed to benefit hard-working frontline employees. However, Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive who was paid \u00a31.6m last year, will take up her free allocation. She is also understood to have placed a multimillion-pound order for more shares. Royal Mail declined to comment on the latter.</p> <p>Stockbrokers and the government's Royal Mail share sale website have been overwhelmed by demand from the public keen to buy shares in the biggest privatisation since John Major sold off the railways in the 1990s. Eager investors continued to place orders in a last minute dash on Tuesday before the 11.59pm deadline.</p> <p>City broker IG Index said it had not experienced such a high level of public excitement over a share sale since the flotation of Facebook in 2012 and the privatisations of BT, British Gas, British Airways and dozens of other state-owned companies under Margaret Thatcher's government.</p> <p>\"People have got memories about how well these government sell-offs did back in the 1980s and 90s,\" IG's chief market strategist David Jones said. \"With those, there were decent windfall profits on the first day.\" IG predicts the shares could rise to between \u00a33.85-\u00a34.05 on Royal Mail's first day as a public company on Friday. A rise to \u00a34 would mean investors would make an immediate 21% paper return.</p> <p>Michael Fallon, the business minister in charge of the sale, has said he will do all he can to ensure as many people as possible are able to share in the privatisation. \"I'm committed to making sure smaller investors get their fair share,\" he said.</p> <p>If public demand proves as strong as expected he will cut back on the amount of shares reserved for banks and other institutions, to make more available to the public. Previously, only 30% of the shares had been reserved for the public.</p> <p>It is understood that the government is doing all it can to ensure that it honours all the public orders for a minimum of \u00a3750 of shares. If the shares rise by 20% on Friday, \u00a3750 of shares will be worth \u00a3900 by the end of the afternoon.</p> <p>Orders from the public for more than \u00a3750 are likely to be scaled back, with larger orders cut back more severely.</p> <p>Ministers will meet advisers on Wednesday and Thursday to decide exactly how many shares applicants will collect.</p> <p>The final share price, which is almost certain to be \u00a33.30, will not be announced until Friday morning. Conditional share trading will start on Friday, but people who have ordered shares directly from the government website or the Post Office will have to wait until at least Tuesday before they can sell.</p> <p>Royal Mail staff, who are 96% opposed to the privatisation and are balloting for days of strikes, plan to protest outside parliament today. The Communication Workers Union is also planning a protest at the London Stock Exchange to coincide with the flotation at 8am Friday.</p> <p>Royal Mail is expected to join the FTSE100 list of Britain's biggest companies.</p> <p>Demand for the shares massively increased after City analyst Gert Zonneveld said he was convinced the government had undervalued the 500-year-old company \"by more than \u00a31bn\".</p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, has attacked the government for failing to realise the true value of Royal Mail and selling off the national institution on the cheap.</p> <p>\"This is turning into a dream and a bonanza for City speculators and hedge funds, meanwhile the taxpayer \u2026 is getting massively shortchanged,\" he said</p> <p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, has fought back against Umunna, accusing him of irresponsibly and dangerous implying that the company is undervalued and telling voters there's an \"easy bargain to be made\".</p> <p>\"I think you should consider the risk that you may be influencing the decisions of retail investors,\" Cable wrote in a letter. \"Equity investment always involves risk, particularly when the company in question is new to the market. In the light of this it is dangerous to imply that there is an easy bargain to be made.</p>",

Revenues down, investments weak, expansion unattractive. You face many barriers, and can't reach the scale to compete globally, while ordinary users just see poor connectivity, a narrow range of choices, and continued reminders of national borders. \"The telecoms sector will ultimately benefit from this package. But that is not why I'm doing it. I'm doing it for European growth and European jobs \u2013 the 1% of GDP we could gain with a true telecoms single market.\"",

The fund's growth forecasts for the UK have been revised up by 0.5 percentage points this year and by 0.4 percentage points in 2014 \u2013 comfortably the biggest increases for any developed country. What's more, the IMF predictions still look a bit low given recent developments in the economy. Further upgrades from the 1.4% and 1.9% pencilled in for this year and 2014 still look likely, unless the global economy nosedives in the coming months.</p> <p>But Blanchard was quite right to say that the pick-up in activity in the UK during the summer does not settle the debate about how the economy might have fared under an alternative strategy. All recessions come to an end eventually, so the real question is whether the upturn in Britain was unecessarily delayed by VAT increases, cuts in capital spending and the chancellor's comparison of the UK with Greece. Academic research by the economist Alan Taylor suggests that UK GDP would be 3% higher today without austerity.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/08/george-osborne-imf-growth-figures\">Has George Osborne had the last laugh on growth and the IMF?

Tsochadzopoulos, who until his arrest was a prominent socialists in the Pasok party he also helped co-found in 1974, was found guilty on Monday of pocketing around \u20ac55m in bribes culled from kickbacks given in weapons purchases.</p> <p>In a trial that lasted more than five months, the court heard how the former socialist strongman oversaw an ornate offshore money-laundering network that enabled him to build an empire of illegal wealth. In a letter released to the public today, Tsochadzopoulos accused the court of \u201cderailing from the law and justice,\u201d saying he not only did not recognize it but would appeal the verdict immediately.</p> <p>How Greeks will react to the judgment remains to be seen: although years of impunity has meant that most are eager to see justice being meted out to corrupt politicians, the vast majority view Tsochadzopoulos as being just the tip of the ice-berg. It is questionable whether his imprisonment will sate their thirst for punishment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7b3e302b-241d-44e6-a765-74183b02853d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/8/1381230320445/242d1761-18f2-48ab-b6b5-0e5b66a83afd-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek former defence minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos leaves the Athens court on October 7, 2013, after being sentenced to 20 years in jail for being convicted of money laundering in a case that has become emblematic of political corruption in the debt-wracked country.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek former defence minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos leaving the Athens court last night after being sentenced to 20 years in jail.

At the May 2010 meeting, directors from Middle Eastern, Asian and Latin American countries repeatedly asked why they weren't being presented with the option.</p> <p>European directors were \"surprised\" when Switzerland \"forcefully\" weighed in on the dissenting side, the minutes show. \"Why has debt restructuring and the involvement of the private sector in the rescue package not been considered?\" the Swiss executive director, Rene Weber, asked at the time.</p> <p>The IMF says today that debt restructuring simply wasn't feasible in 2010, because the risk of Greece's financial turmoil spreading to other countries was so high.</p> <p>Much of the debt was held by already fragile French and German banks, so European nations wouldn't consider it. And the U.S. feared its own trillion-dollar exposure to European banks.</p> <p>Ms. Lagarde was French finance minister at the time and keen to avoid losses by her country's banks, which had lent heavily to Greece. Mr. Strauss-Kahn\u2014widely known to be angling for the French presidency at the time\u2014backed off a tentative effort to press the issue after encountering European opposition before the IMF meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>Back in June the IMF admitted that mistakes were made in 2010, when it published its own review of the bailout.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up: \u2022 The International Monetary Fund has hiked its growth forecasts for Britain. It predicted that the UK economy will grow much faster in 2013 and 2014 than predicted in April -- when it claimed George Osborne was playing with fire. \u2022 The Treasury hailed the upgraded UK growth forecasts as a sign that the UK had turned the corner, but the opposition Labour party pointed out that living standards are still lagging. \u2022 But... the IMF also cut its growth forecasts for the world economy this year and in 2014. It warned that \"excessive fiscal consolidation\" in the US was hampering global growth, and cautioned that emerging markets also weakening faster than it expected six months ago. \u2022 The IMF also urged US political leaders to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling soon, before borrowing room runs out this month. The consequences of inaction could be terribly serious. \u2022 World stock markets fell once again, as the deadlock in Washington DC gnawed away at investor confidence. The IMF warning came on a day when Asia-Pacific leaders warned that growth was too weak, with global trade disappointing. This summary has full details of this morning's events -- including Slovenia's central banker talking about possibly seeking external aid. Back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight, GW The rumours were true. Ireland has persuaded its international lenders that next week's budget will be less austere than previous ones. As Henry McDonald flagged up this morning -- next week's fiscal package will include \u20ac2.5bn of spending cuts and tax rises, not the \u20ac3.1bn expected. Energy Minister Pat Rabbitte told state broadcaster RTE that the deal was reached over the weekend with the Troika. Rabbitte declared: The fact that the figure is fixed at 2.5 billion ... is a victory for the government. There will be 600 million euros less hardship visited on a public that are already suffering for too long. But as Henry also identified, that doesn't mean Irish austerity is over. There could still be \u20ac440m of cuts to welfare spending. Confused by the US debt ceiling debacle? Don't worry - our US business and finance editor, Heidi Moore, has written a punchy, witty explanation of the whole subject: My favourite bit: Q: So \u2026 what are we doing here? A: On 1 October, the healthcare exchanges from Obamacare went live at healthcare.gov. Republican opponents were hoping to stop that from happening. They say Obamacare is \u201cnot ready for primetime\u201d in the words of Eric Cantor, the House majority leader. So they forced a government shutdown until the president negotiates with them. The president has refused to negotiate about changing something that\u2019s already in the law. Q: Like a ransom? A: For criminals, it\u2019s called a \u201cransom\u201d. For congress, it\u2019s called \u201cleverage in a negotiation\u201d. And here's some analyst comment on today's action in the City, where America's debt ceiling/budget deadlock and the IMF's lower global growth forecasts pushed the FTSE 100 to a three month low. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG: US political bickering has hung over the markets like choking smog, limiting traders' ability to see blue sky, let alone silver linings. If progress is not made soon it's likely that markets will begin to act more directly to the lingering fears and some aggressive down days could be on the cards. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets So here we are, day eight of the US government shutdown and it really feels like we\u2019re in that Bill Murray movie, Groundhog Day, as we look across the Atlantic and see the same dysfunction continuing to play out. The only difference being that there is a growing acknowledgement now that US politicians seem determined to take this right to the wire. The lack of a larger stock market sell-off can best be explained by the belief that even if the US does miss a payment on its interest repayments as a result of this stand-off it won\u2019t be as a result of being unable to pay, but more a case of a temporary inability to pay, until the ceiling is subsequently raised. Even if this is how the crisis pans out on a worst case scenario both China and Japan have both voiced their concerns about how long it is taking to come to a resolution to this crisis, and it is to be hoped that they can knock some sense into the skulls of the politicians on Capitol Hill. Another day of losses in Europe's stock markets, as the US government shutdown causes growing angst in the City. The FTSE 100 has slipped to its lowest level since early July. Here's the damage: FTSE 100: down 71 points at 6365, -1.1% German DAX: down 35 points at 8555, -0.4% French CAC: down 32 points at 4133, - 0.77% Spanish IBEX: down 63 points at 9318, -0.67% Italian FTSE MIB: down 53 points at 18,372, - 0.3% My colleague Nick Fletcher rounds up the action here: With no significant progress in Washington yet today, the Dow Jones index is also down, shedding 88 points or 0.6% to 14847. A bigger fall might concentrate minds on Capitol Hill.... But while the Daily Telegraph calls for Olivier Blanchard to apologise for wronging our dear chancellor, economics editor Larry Elliott suggests George Osborne should avoid self-congratulation following today's upgraded growth forecasts. Instead, Osborne could ponder whether things could have been much better without the fiscal cutbacks implemented early in this parliament. Larry writes: In one important sense Osborne gets his pound of flesh from the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook. The fund's growth forecasts for the UK have been revised up by 0.5 percentage points this year and by 0.4 percentage points in 2014 \u2013 comfortably the biggest increases for any developed country. What's more, the IMF predictions still look a bit low given recent developments in the economy. Further upgrades from the 1.4% and 1.9% pencilled in for this year and 2014 still look likely, unless the global economy nosedives in the coming months. But Blanchard was quite right to say that the pick-up in activity in the UK during the summer does not settle the debate about how the economy might have fared under an alternative strategy. All recessions come to an end eventually, so the real question is whether the upturn in Britain was unecessarily delayed by VAT increases, cuts in capital spending and the chancellor's comparison of the UK with Greece. Academic research by the economist Alan Taylor suggests that UK GDP would be 3% higher today without austerity. Has George Osborne had the last laugh on growth and the IMF? Hardly That didn't take long... Another sign the UK is picking up, from the Institute of Directors. It reports that 75% of IoD members reckon the outlook is now brighter than at any stage since the financial crisis hit in 2008. The IoD added: Members are increasingly confident about the outlook for the economy, with nearly half (46%) displaying high confidence for the next 12 months, and only 12% saying they have low confidence. This is a marked improvement on the first quarter of 2013, when 15% had high confidence and 39% low confidence. Throughout the year, members have been more confident about their own business\u2019 outlook than they have about the wider economy, but this gap is beginning to narrow. 58% of directors answered that they had high confidence in the outlook for their business, compared to 8% who had low confidence. The fact that individual business confidence and whole economy confidence are coming together is a positive sign that the recovery is taking hold. Here's another chart from the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook, showing how the total debt of advanced economies is at its highest level, as a percentage of national output, since 1950. It is expected to drop, gradually, over the next five years as the world economy grows: Back over to Greece, where the second trial of Greek journalist Kostas Vaxevanis has been stopped, within hours of starting. Helena Smith was there, and reports that proceedings were paused when the court had only heard from their second witness, \"who spoke for a good three hours\". The judge hearing the case ruled that the three-member court should reconvene on October 21 to decide on a date for a trial. As explained earlier, this is Vaxevanis's second trial for publishing the Lagarde list of tax evaders. So far, no-one has actually been charged with tax evasion over the list. Duncan Weldon, TUC economist, urges caution over the IMF's new UK GDP forecasts. Today's upgraded prediction of a 1.4% increase in GDP this year simply matches what the Fund expected in July 2012. The IMF World Economic Outlook is online here. Here's the chart showing all its growth forecasts: And here's the chart showing how the IMF is less upbeat about growth prospects in advanced economies and emerging markets (the red line is today's forecasts, the blue=April's forecasts). Larry's story on the IMF being more pessimistic about the global economy is now online. It begins: Badly handled budget cuts in the United States and a slowdown in activity in big developing countries mean the global economy will expand more slowly than expected this year, the International Monetary Fund said. Revising down its forecasts for growth in both 2013 and 2014, the fund warned that the risks were that the performance could be even more lacklustre and said the Federal Reserve, the American central bank, needed to take special care as it contemplated reducing its colossal stimulus to the world's biggest economy. The IMF now expects the global economy to expand by 2.9% in 2013 and 3.6% in 2014 \u2013 down by 0.3 and 0.2 points respectively on its last set of predictions made in July- despite signs of recovery in the euro area. IMF cuts global economic growth forecasts for this year and next IMF deputy director of research, J\u00f6rg Decressin, said Europe looks stronger because there is less fiscal consolidation this year than in 2012; even peripheral countries should emerge from recession over the next year. Decressin added that a strong banking union is \"absolutely critical\" to tackle financial fragmentation. Olivier Blanchard also defended the IMF's warning six months ago that George Osborne was playing with fire with his austerity programme. Is the IMF admitting that Osborne was right? Blanchard replies that the IMF has been \"pleasantly surprised by the fact that growth was stronger\" than expected; but insists that it that \"doesn't settle the debate\" on fiscal policy, adding: It doesn't tell if the pace of fiscal consolidation was wrong... or whether growth could have come back earlier with a different fiscal framework. He added that the IMF's job is to warn about risks; that's what they did. I suspect this won't spare the IMF some robust criticism from Osborne's supporters: IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard has been enlarging on the Fund's view of the consequences of the looming US debt crisis, in the ongoing Q&amp;A (which is online here): If the debt ceiling is not lifted then there's a direct effect on government spending, which would have to be cut quite drastically... In addition, it would probably lead to a lot of financial turmoil: if there was a problem lifting the debt ceiling, it could well be that what is now a recovery could turn into a recession, or even worse. (via Observer economics editor Heather Stewart) Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls's responds to the news that Britain's growth forecasts have been upgraded by the IMF, and by more than any other major economy: After three wasted years of flatlining it\u2019s good that we finally have some growth. But this is the slowest recovery for 100 years and working people are worse off as prices continue rising faster than wages. Despite these welcome changes to its forecasts the IMF rightly warns that the UK economy will remain below potential for many years. That\u2019s why the IMF has repeated its view that the Government should bring forward infrastructure investment now, which could be used to build thousands of affordable homes. Instead of more complacency from George Osborne we need action to secure a strong and sustained recovery, catch up all the lost ground and tackle the cost of living crisis. Here's a table showing how the IMF expect major economies to perform this year and next year United States 1.6%, then 2.6% Euro Area \u20130.4%, then 1.0% Germany 0.5%, then 1.4% France 0.2%, then 1.0% Italy \u20131.8%, then 0.7% Spain \u20131.3%, then 0.2% Japan 2.0%, then 1.2% United Kingdom 1.4%, then 1.% Canada 1.6% ,then 2.2% Here's economics editor Larry Elliott's news story on the IMF predicting stronger growth in the UK this year and in 2014: IMF raises UK growth forecasts as economy 'turns corner' The IMF is also more upbeat about the conditions in the eurozone. It now predicts that the eurozone economy will shrink by 0.4%, not by 0.5% as in July. It still expects growth of 1% in 2014. The IMF is warning the US government to raise its debt ceiling soon, and end the federal government shutdown. A press conference is underway, and chief economist Olivier Blanchard is telling reporters that failure to raise the debt ceiling would be \"a major event\"; a prolonged failure would \"almost certainly derail the US recovery\". The IMF also warns America to slow the pace of its deficit reduction programme. The planned US fiscal consolidation is \"too large, and too arbitrary\", he added. The UK Treasury has cheered the news that the IMF has upgraded its growth forecasts for Britain. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: The IMF has confirmed that the UK economy is turning a corner, by revising up its forecast for growth over the next two years by more than for any other G7 economy. But risks to the global economy remain high, and the recovery cannot be taken for granted. That is why the government will not let up in implementing its economic plan, which has already cut the deficit by a third, kept interest rates near record lows and created over a million and a quarter jobs. Worth noting, though, that the IMF still wants the British government to take advantage of current low borrowing costs for long-term investment. It said: In an environment of still low interest rates and underutilisation of resources, public investment can also be brought forward to offset the drag from planned near-term fiscal tightening, while staying within the medium-term fiscal framework. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has raised its growth forecasts for the UK, in its new World Economic Outlook. The Fund now expects the UK economy will expand by 1.4% in 2013, an upgrade of 0.5 points. Next year, it sees growth accelerating to 1.9%, up by 0.4 points. Quite a boost for chancellor George Osborne. However, the IMF has has downgraded its forecasts for the global economy. It now expects growth of 2.9% this year, down from 3.1%. Next year it expects growth of 3.6%, down from 3.8%. More to follow A quick catchup of the main events, before the International Monetary Fund releases its latest World Economic Outlook in a few minutes (2pm BST). \u2022 Asia-Pacific leaders have warned that economic conditions are deteriorating. At a meeting in Bali, the APEC group said: Global growth is too weak, risks remain tilted to the downside, global trade is weakening and the economic outlook suggests growth is likely to be slower and less balanced than desired. \u2022 The latest economic data from Germany has rammed this point home -- imports were lower than expected in August, and the country's exporters fear lower sales growth this year. \u2022 Slovenia's central bank governor has suggested the country may need external help for its banking sector, unless its borrowing costs ease. \u2022 The Wall Street Journal has published details of documents which show how and why Greece's 2010 bailout was mishandled. Here's a photo of Greek journalist Costas Vaxevanis arriving at court in Athens for a new trial over the Lagarde list of alleged tax evaders, which he published. As explained at 12.16pm, the Greek authorities are appealing Vaxevanis's acquittal. Wall Street is expected to open flat in around 80 minutes time, as New York traders await developments in the US government shutdown/debt ceiling showdown. European shares have dropped through the morning - with the FTSE 100 is down 45 points. Marks &amp; Spencer is the biggest faller, down 3%, after analysts at Bernstein cut their rating today and warned clothes sales are still weak. The central bank governor of Slovenia has hinted that the country could be forced to seek international help to clean up its banking sector, Reuters reports. Bostjan Jazbec was asked about the possibility of asking for aid, during a press conference on the bank's new macroeconomic forecasts in Ljubljana today. He replied: That is possible if yields on Slovenian securities remain high. Jazbec added that the Slovenian government is trying to bring its borrowing costs down, but cautioned: If that is not successful then there is a possibility to ask for help within various programmes. Slovenia has been keeping a low profile for some months -- after Cyprus blew up, it was being talked about as the next candidate for a eurozone bailout. It's problem is that the country's banks, mainly state owned, are laden with around \u20ac7.5bn of bad loans -- over a fifth of itsGDP. Yesterday, interior minister Gregor Virant told reporters that Sovenia could use the European Stability Mechanism to overhaul its local banks. A decision isn't expected until bank stress test results arrive, in November. Slovenia's 10-year bonds, the benchmark for market access, are trading at yields of 6.6% to 6.8% today. Typically, the 7% level is seen as crucial. If yields don't drop, Jazbec and colleagues could soon be badgering Europe for help. Over in Greece there is much ado over two court trials this morning as the journalist who revealed the infamous Lagarde list of suspected tax evaders takes the stand again and Greeks digest the news of the imprisonment of the country\u2019s former top socialist politician Akis Tsochatzopoulos. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Hundreds of people piled into building number 9 to hear the retrial of Kostas Vaxevanis - the journalist who took the political establishment by storm last year publishing the names of more than 2000 suspected tax evaders included in the infamous Lagarde list. The trial, demanded by a public prosecutor after an earlier judgment acquitting Vaxevanis of breaching privacy was deemed to be flawed, comes at a pivotal time following the 20-year prison sentence handed down last night to the country\u2019s former defence minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos. The landmark verdict has sent tremors through the political scene with commentators describing the ruling as the most important of the last 20 years. Tsochadzopoulos, who until his arrest was a prominent socialists in the Pasok party he also helped co-found in 1974, was found guilty on Monday of pocketing around \u20ac55m in bribes culled from kickbacks given in weapons purchases. In a trial that lasted more than five months, the court heard how the former socialist strongman oversaw an ornate offshore money-laundering network that enabled him to build an empire of illegal wealth. In a letter released to the public today, Tsochadzopoulos accused the court of \u201cderailing from the law and justice,\u201d saying he not only did not recognize it but would appeal the verdict immediately. How Greeks will react to the judgment remains to be seen: although years of impunity has meant that most are eager to see justice being meted out to corrupt politicians, the vast majority view Tsochadzopoulos as being just the tip of the ice-berg. It is questionable whether his imprisonment will sate their thirst for punishment. And in a third Greek courtroom, the trial of Golden Dawn MP Costas Barbarousis, who was due to stand trial on Tuesday along with another 10 members of the ultranationalist party, has been postponed to November 10. The Kathimerini newspaper reports that the case was delayed as three of the defendants did not have legal representation in court. Another signal that global trade is faltering -- Germany's BGA trade association has slashed its forecast for export growth in 2013 to below 1%, from 3%. BGA president Anton B\u00f6rner told Reuters: We can't achieve 3 percent growth anymore. We now expect ... growth of less than one percent. There is a whole bunch of factors slowing us down. B\u00f6rner cited the turmoil in the Middle East, the US government shutdown, signs of financial strife in emerging markets and the eurozone's weaknesses, adding: If things go badly, we will see stagnation at best. If they are resolved, there could be decent growth. Germany has fanned fears over the strength of global trade by reporting a drop in industrial orders. The German finance ministry says industrial orders fell 0.3% in August, adding to the 1.9% slide seen in July. Economists had expected a bounce-back. Overseas orders slid by 2.1%, or 2.9% within the euro region, showing that Germany suffers from the weak demand in other nations. Orders for capital goods (such as large machinery) from other euro members tumbled by 9.2%. The German economic ministry tried to put a positive spin on the figures, pointing out that demand for capital goods within Germany jumped by 4.7%. That suggests domestic investment activity is picking up. And if you compare the July-August period to the previous two months, total industrial orders were actually up 0.2%. However, again, that was driven by domestic demand (+2.7%). Not a bad thing -- but foreign orders were still down by 1.7%. It rather reinforces this morning's warning from Asia-Pacific leaders that \"Global growth is too weak, risks remain tilted to the downside, global trade is weakening\" (see full statement in the opening post). Back to Bali, where America says it hasn't given up hopes of a new trade deal, called a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) , hours after world leaders warned that global trade is slowing. US trade representative Michael Froman told reporters that the TPP trade pact could be agreed by the end of the year. That optimism comes despite a range of hurdles including intellectual property to state-owned enterprises, labour and the environment. Froman told reporters: I think there is a consensus that there has been substantial progress on outstanding issues and there are still remaining issues that must be addressed. Analysts fear that President Obama's absence from the Asia-Pacific forum in Bali will weaken America's diplomatic punch at the summit. It has left secretary of state John Kerry to wave the flag for the US among other world leaders: Over in Ireland, finance minister Michael Noonan has dropped the heaviest of hints that next week's austerity budget will take up to a half a billion euros less out of the Republic's economy than previous ones during the financial crisis. Our correspondent in Dublin, Henry McDonald, has the story: Speaking on the way to a Cabinet meeting in Dublin this morning, Michael Noonan said that \u20ac2.5bn is to be taken out of the economy in the budget and not the projected \u20ac3.1bn. Noonan predicted that a resurgent Irish economy would make up for the remaining \u20ac600m, through extra tax revenues. Despite his announcement, Budget 2014 is likely to again contain unpopular measures as the Fine Gael-Labour coalition seeks to drive down Ireland's national debt and keep in line with the financial recovery programme imposed by the IMF and Europe since the Republic was bailed out from the brink of insolvency. Fellow Cabinet ministers still bracing themselves for more cuts to areas such as a social welfare where around \u20ac440m will probably be taken out of spending. The budget comes less than a fortnight after Enda Kenny's government sustained a massive electoral blow when the country's voters rejected the coalition's proposal to abolish the Republic's second parliamentary chamber, the Seanad. Portraying this budget as not as harsh as the previous ones in recent years is part of a government strategy to convince voters that the Coalition remains on course to steer the economy towards full recovery. As always it will be economic competence and the perception that things are getting better that provide the best hope for the coalition to survive into the next general election. The Wall Street Journal has today published new information which confirms what many observers and combatants in the eurozone crisis have long suspected \u2013 that the 2010 bailout of Greece badly botched, contributing to the country's subsequent woes. With a third aid package for Greece looming, the WSJ has got its hands on a cache of documents marked \"Secret\" or \"Strictly Confidential\" which show how the International Monetary Fund struggled to tackle the Greek problem three years ago. Crucially, the document shows that some IMF members were pushing for a debt write-offs in 2010 - something which finally happened in Greece's second bailout, after Eurozone banks had the chance to offload their Greek bonds. The 2010 documents show that several IMF directors were deeply skeptical of the staff's economic projections from the beginning, calling them \"rather optimistic,\" \"overly benign,\" even \"Panglossian.\", the WSJ reports. And while the IMF presented a united face in public, there was pitched argument and dispute behind the scenes about the wisdom of the 2010 bailout plan -- which forced tough austerity onto Greece in return for loans, but without tackling its overall debt pile. The full story is here: Past Rifts Over Greece Cloud Talks on Rescue Here's a flavour: The IMF documents show there were heated discussions about the need to write off part of Greece's debt from the start. At the May 2010 meeting, directors from Middle Eastern, Asian and Latin American countries repeatedly asked why they weren't being presented with the option. European directors were \"surprised\" when Switzerland \"forcefully\" weighed in on the dissenting side, the minutes show. \"Why has debt restructuring and the involvement of the private sector in the rescue package not been considered?\" the Swiss executive director, Rene Weber, asked at the time. The IMF says today that debt restructuring simply wasn't feasible in 2010, because the risk of Greece's financial turmoil spreading to other countries was so high. Much of the debt was held by already fragile French and German banks, so European nations wouldn't consider it. And the U.S. feared its own trillion-dollar exposure to European banks. Ms. Lagarde was French finance minister at the time and keen to avoid losses by her country's banks, which had lent heavily to Greece. Mr. Strauss-Kahn\u2014widely known to be angling for the French presidency at the time\u2014backed off a tentative effort to press the issue after encountering European opposition before the IMF meeting. Back in June the IMF admitted that mistakes were made in 2010, when it published its own review of the bailout. These documents confirm it. Italy's banks remained lumbered with bad debts in August, new data from the Bank of Italy shows. The number of non-performing loans across the sector was 22% higher than a year ago, matching July's rate. As this graph shows, the amount of toxic debts on the books of Italian banks rose steadily through its recession: Italian lenders continue to rein in credit too -- despite the ECB's efforts to encourage it. Lending to households is 1.2% lower than a year ago, while the cost of loans to companies rose. A loan of up to \u20ac1m cost 4.5% on average, up from 4.41% in July. The political row over the sale of Royal Mail is set to continue today, with news that the flotation of the historic organisation is proving a resounding hit with the public, and the City. There's such demand that Royal Mail shares are on track to be priced at the very top of the official range, 330p each. Good news if you get a slice of the action (the float closes at midnight, folks). And as we reported last night, the government is making more shares available to the public, rather than letting hedge funds and speculators devour the lot. More here: Royal Mail shares set to be priced at top of range on unprecedented demand But even at 330p each, there'll be a massive storm if \u2013 as appears likely \u2013 the share price spikes to 400p when trading begins. As my colleague Nils Pratley puts it, There is a real risk that the public purse could be royally short-changed in the Royal Mail privatisation. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says the City's patience is running thin with the lack of progress over the US government shutdown, adding: Risk aversion sees participants cashing out rather than placing more bets until a major move is made in Washington. Europe's stock markets are sagging again today, as the US shutdown enters its eight day. We're just nine days away from 17 October -- the date when America's national debt is expected to hit the $16.7trn limit agreed by Congress. China's warning yesterday that America needs to act swiftly to avoid a default captured plenty of attention yesterday, but didn't spark a breakthrough in Washington. So the main indices in Europe are in the red again, with the FTSE 100 down another 22 points at 6414. August wasn't a great month for Spain either -- industrial output across the country was 2% lower than in August 2012, marking two full years of contraction. This graph shows the steady decline (the red line is the seasonally adjusted data, while the orange line tracks the unadjusted figures): The latest economic data from Germany also suggests global trade isn't on fighting form, as APEC warned. Germany's adjusted trade surplus rose to \u20ac15.6bn in August, due to a small rise in imports - just 0.4% compared with July - while exports of goods rose by 1% month-on-month On a year-on-year basis, German imports were 2.2% lower than in August 2012 while exports of goods were 5.4% lower. The data, which is seasonally adjusted, doesn't suggest a surge in German consumption that would help weaker neighbours. It also means German exports are still 1.1% lower than over the first eight months of 2012. That underlines that the global economy remains sluggish, although Thomas Gitzel at VP Bank is optimistic for the future, saying: Global trade remains off-colour, which is putting the brakes on German exports. The outlook for the coming months is much more promising. Important freight indicators have risen considerably. The Asia-Pacific leaders' warning about the global economy has been echoed by Saxo Bank this morning. Saxo's chief economist, Steen Jakobsen, warns that the global economy is 'running on empty'. Next year, the world must face the consequences of the ultra-loose monetary policies that have helped keep developed markets afloat, he argues: 2014 will see a bigger discussion on what is the real exit strategy from the current \u2018extend and pretend\u2019. Right now the market only sees two paths: Inflating the economy to reduce the burden of debt, or writing off the debt between treasuries and central banks.But I believe there is a third way: A repeat of the 1940s - the last time Fed was this involved in so-called helping the market. Back then, the Fed got saved by disinflation and a recession brought on by the very same policy which today slows the path towards recovery too much easy money. History is about to repeat itself only because we fail to learn and to embrace the need for change. There were protests in Bali today against leaders attending the APEC summit, led by anti-globalisation campaigners from the Indonesian People\u2019s Alliance. The demonstrations, which appear to be peaceful, called for the Summit to be abandoned and claimed that trade liberalisation would actually bring little benefit to the region: Australia and China are still struggling to finalise a trade deal, even after 18 rounds of talks, with the new Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, saying he might have to accept a watered down deal. Reuters explains: Negotiations have been delayed by Beijing's concerns over opening markets to Australian food, while Australia wants China to do more to protect intellectual property. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. We start with news out of Bali, where leaders from across the Asia Pacific region have warned that economic conditions are weakening. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) issued a joint statement in which they pledged responsible macro-economic policies, but the key point is that they're bracing for tough conditions. World economic growth remains too subdued, they said, with a greater risk that conditions will deteriorate rather than improve. It's a timely warning from APEC -- the International Monetary Fund is due to release details of its latest World Economic Outlook later today (2pm BST). Here's the key line from APEC's statement: Global growth is too weak, risks remain tilted to the downside, global trade is weakening and the economic outlook suggests growth is likely to be slower and less balanced than desired. The group of 21 countries, which includes Japan, China, Russia, the United States and Australia, also pledge 'prudent and responsible' policies to help the region, saying: We will implement prudent and responsible macroeconomic policies to ensure mutually reinforcing effect of growth and to maintain economic and financial stability in the region, and prevent negative spillover effect. Barack Obama wasn't present to back the statement, though. The US president remains in Washington for Day Eight of the US government shutdown. With America's debt ceiling deadline looming, APEC leader may have wondered if the global economy is about to get a nasty shock. With no deal in Congress, European stock markets are expected to drop again this morning. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day...",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "EasyJet plane takes off leaving 29 passengers on the tarmac", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet is investigating how one of its planes took off for Britain from Spain while leaving 29 of its checked-in passengers stranded and baffled at the gate. The evening flight from Malaga to Bristol did manage to carry 110 passengers, as well as all their baggage. But as the remaining EasyJet customers queued to board flight EZY6056 at the Costa del Sol airport, they were forced to watch the aircraft set off down the runway. The astonished passengers, who were left in limbo between the departure gate and the plane, told how they had to bang on locked airport doors for minutes to alert staff to their plight. EasyJet said the problem occurred on the 9.15pm flight last Saturday due to \"an issue at the boarding gate\" and the airline was still trying to work out how airport and airline staff contrived to lose a quarter of the passengers without noticing. The passengers' luggage and boarding passes had all been scanned at the gate before the missing 29 proceeded down the walkway. According to one report, the group had reached a stairwell when a member of the ground crew drew a security ribbon across their path to the plane. Assuming it was a temporary wait while passengers who had already boarded were seated, the group queued patiently - until they looked outside and realised the plane had gone. One passenger, Iain Locke, 58, of Pensford in Somerset, said the group were waiting in the corridor for 20 minutes. He told the Bristol Evening Post: \"I turned round to the guy beside me and said 'I don't want to alarm you, but the plane has gone'. I just couldn't believe it. \"I've flown a lot and I know there are measures in place for the pilot and crew to check the correct number of passengers are on the aircraft. I find it unbelievable that a flight could take off with passengers missing.\" He added that being locked in the corridor was \"a bit freaky\" when their abandonment became clear. A spokeswoman for EasyJet said 19 customers took the next available flight to Gatwick at 10.30pm. The remaining 10 passengers spent the night in Malaga before flying to Bristol the next day. In a statement, the airline said: \"EasyJet has contacted and apologised to the passengers who did not board their flight from Malaga to Bristol on Saturday 5 October due to an issue at the boarding gate. \"We have launched an investigation to understand what happened and have offered flight vouchers and a refund of onward travel arrangements from Gatwick as a gesture of goodwill to the affected passengers. EasyJet arranged for 19 passengers to travel on the next available service to Gatwick and arranged accommodation for 10 passengers who travelled to Bristol the next day.\" The luggage was reunited with the passengers after their flights home, EasyJet said, adding that there was no requirement for cabin crew to do a headcount of passengers on the plane.",

But as the remaining EasyJet customers queued to board flight EZY6056 at the Costa del Sol airport, they were forced to watch the aircraft set off down the runway.</p> <p>The astonished passengers, who were left in limbo between the departure gate and the plane, told how they had to bang on locked airport doors for minutes to alert staff to their plight.</p> <p>EasyJet said the problem occurred on the 9.15pm flight last Saturday due to \"an issue at the boarding gate\" and the airline was still trying to work out how airport and airline staff contrived to lose a quarter of the passengers without noticing.</p> <p>The passengers' luggage and boarding passes had all been scanned at the gate before the missing 29 proceeded down the walkway. According to one report, the group had reached a stairwell when a member of the ground crew drew a security ribbon across their path to the plane. Assuming it was a temporary wait while passengers who had already boarded were seated, the group queued patiently - until they looked outside and realised the plane had gone.</p> <p>One passenger, Iain Locke, 58, of Pensford in Somerset, said the group were waiting in the corridor for 20 minutes.

      "body": "<p><strong>Q: I just want you to know that I would rather be doing anything, anything at all, rather than thinking about the debt ceiling again.</strong></p> <p>A: That makes two of us. Actually, it makes millions of us, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/02/politics/cnn-poll-debt-ceiling/index.html\">according to a CNN poll this week</a>. No one wants to be here. Let\u2019s just do this.</p> <p><strong>Q: OK, I just mean I feel like we just did this a few months ago.</strong></p> <p>A: Yes. We did.&#xa0;Earlier this year, the debt-ceiling crisis was wrapped up in the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d and you can revisit it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/fiscal-cliff-blog/2012/nov/27/fiscal-cliff-obama-live\">here</a>.&#xa0;We also did it in 2011. Yet, here we are. Again. For the third time.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Q: Sorry, I feel sheepish about this. I have to ask again: what\u2019s the debt ceiling?</strong></p> <p>A: Don't feel sheepish. In a just world, we shouldn't even be thinking about it this much.&#xa0;</p> <p>The debt ceiling is the borrowing limit that Congress sets for itself. Right now, it\u2019s at about $16.94tn. It\u2019s designed so that Congress doesn\u2019t recklessly spend more money than is responsible. Congress spends pretty speedily, so the debt limit usually comes up for a vote every year. Most years, it passes easily, but it hasn\u2019t been easy since 2011.</p> <p>Debt is really important to America's government. The government funds itself in two ways: one is through taxes from people and companies. The other is by borrowing money, which the government does by issuing Treasury bonds. <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/research/faqs/faqs_basics.htm\">When someone buys a Treasury bond</a>, they are lending the government money, and the government pays them interest every month. Those interest payments are huge; the next one is about $13bn, due 17 October. The November payment is about $25bn. You can see the size of them <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q: So, wait, $17tn is \u201cresponsible spending?\u201d</strong></p> <p>A: Just go with it.</p> <p><strong>Q: Right. So. If I understand this correctly, raising the debt ceiling means allowing Congress to borrow more money to pay our bills, right?</strong></p> <p>A: It means two things. One is yes, that Congress can borrow more money next year. The second thing is more important: raising the debt ceiling also means that the US Treasury, our national piggy bank, can pay the bills Congress has already run up this year. Congress has already authorized more spending than the debt ceiling allows.</p> <p><strong>Q: So the same Congress that spent money is now arguing about whether to pay its own bills.</strong></p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p><strong>Q: What kind of bills does Congress run up? Is it all fur coats and bad music?</strong></p> <p>A: No. There\u2019s everything in the budget, of course, like <a href=\"http://instagram.com/usinterior\">the national parks</a> and scientific research and food inspection and all those important things. Then there are things that affect everyday life, like Social Security and retirement benefits for government workers and pay for the military. The Treasury also has to pay interest on all those government bonds that people buy. <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44608\">Some big payments are coming up</a>, like Social Security payments of roughly $12bn on 9, 16 and 23 October. Overall, the Treasury needs to make <a href=\"http://bipartisanpolicy.org/news/articles/2013/09/debt-ceiling-cash-crunch-millions-wont-get-paid\">payments of about $108bn</a> between mid-October and mid-November.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office has a breakdown of the federal debt <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html\">here</a>. The Bipartisan Policy Center has <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/26/news/economy/debt-ceiling-cash-crunch/\">a handy infographic</a> about the people who won\u2019t get paid if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised.</p> <p><strong>Q: That sounds pretty bad. What happens if we don\u2019t pay our bills?</strong></p> <p>A: If we don\u2019t pay our bills, then the US defaults on its debt.</p> <p><strong>Q: What's a default?</strong></p> <p>A: A default, technically, is a failure to make a payment on your debt. It works roughly the same way that not paying your bills will lower your credit score and increase your interest payments on your credit card.&#xa0;</p> <p>If the US government doesn\u2019t pay its bills, it will have to pay higher interest when it borrows money \u2013 which is really bad because, as we just talked about, our government exists by borrowing trillions of dollars. The US has an almost perfect credit score right now, and very low borrowing costs. It would be really stupid to ruin that.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Q: Have we ever defaulted before?</strong></p> <p>A: Not in the modern era, at least not on purpose. But yes, there have been defaults before, <a href=\"http://qz.com/131489/the-most-often-repeated-fact-about-us-debt-is-wrong/\">as Quartz has pointed out</a>. They were never a good thing.</p> <p><strong>Q: How would a default hurt us?</strong></p> <p>A: It could hurt the economy, since companies and stock markets depend on the idea that the US is not reckless with its finances. The US dollar is the reserve, or reference, currency for the world.&#xa0;</p> <p>So far, however, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/03/obama-to-investors-please-panic-at-least-a-little-bit/\">the stock markets have been very calm</a>.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b4a70171-6447-476e-afd2-ecfa03fcf999\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/28/1340888229492/Supreme-Court-Decision-On-008.jpg\" alt=\"Supreme Court Decision On Affordable Care Act\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors gather outside the supreme court in June 2012, as justices prepare to rule on the Affordable Care Act.

    "webTitle": "Has George Osborne had the last laugh on growth and the IMF? Hardly | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Revenge, according to the old proverb, is a dish best served cold. Six months ago George Osborne was furious when the International Monetary Fund used its influential World Economic Outlook (WEO) to roast the government's austerity programme. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's chief economist, said the UK was playing with fire in its refusal to ease the pace of budget cuts. This was April, when the talk was of whether Britain would sink into an unprecedented triple-dip recession. Since then, fresh data has revised away the double-dip recession and economic growth has returned. The 0.7% expansion in the three months to June looks set to be at least equalled, if not bettered, in the third quarter. The debate in the City now is not about the long-forgotten triple dip but about whether Osborne is overcooking things with his Help to Buy scheme for the housing market. So game, set and match to the chancellor, then? Not quite. In one important sense Osborne gets his pound of flesh from the IMF's latest WEO. The fund's growth forecasts for the UK have been revised up by 0.5 percentage points this year and by 0.4 percentage points in 2014 \u2013 comfortably the biggest increases for any developed country. What's more, the IMF predictions still look a bit low given recent developments in the economy. Further upgrades from the 1.4% and 1.9% pencilled in for this year and 2014 still look likely, unless the global economy nosedives in the coming months. But Blanchard was quite right to say that the pick-up in activity in the UK during the summer does not settle the debate about how the economy might have fared under an alternative strategy. All recessions come to an end eventually, so the real question is whether the upturn in Britain was unecessarily delayed by VAT increases, cuts in capital spending and the chancellor's comparison of the UK with Greece. Academic research by the economist Alan Taylor suggests that UK GDP would be 3% higher today without austerity. What's more, the fund makes the point that it will take many years for the UK to make good the output losses from the deep slump and sluggish recovery of the past five years. With borrowing costs at a historic low, it is still calling for the government to consider an increase in borrowing to fund much-needed improvements in infrastructure. This would help the economy's future growth potential and make the recovery better balanced. There is a final reason Osborne may decide not to rub it in when he arrives in Washington for the IMF's annual meeting this weekend. The gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors takes place under the cloud of a possible US debt default and there are fears that this could provide the latest setback to a global economy that still bears the scars of the near financial meltdown of five years ago. The IMF has some harsh things to say about the way the US is conducting its financial affairs in its latest WEO, published in Washington on Tuesday. It says, correctly, that crude indiscriminate spending cuts under the sequester programme are a bad way to repair public finances battered by the deep recession of 2008-09. It notes, again correctly, that the game of chicken over the debt ceiling could lead to more uncertainty and hence lower growth. What concerns the fund is that American politics has the potential to destabilise the global economy at a particularly delicate moment. The big emerging market economies \u2013 China, India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa \u2013 are not growing as quickly as they were a couple of years back. The summer saw downward pressure on the currencies of developing countries as a result of anticipation that the US Federal Reserve would begin to taper away its $85bn-a-month stimulus programme from this autumn. Europe is only just emerging from a double-dip recession. These things also concern the chancellor. At the moment he has a nice little recovery going. But with an election little more than 18 months away, he cannot afford for it to falter.",

      "body": "<p>Revenge, according to the old proverb, is a dish best served cold. Six months ago George Osborne was furious when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/22/imf-uk-economy-verdict-eurozone-osborne\" title=\"\">the International Monetary Fund used its influential World Economic Outlook (WEO) to roast the government's austerity programme</a>. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's chief economist, said the UK was playing with fire in its refusal to ease the pace of budget cuts.</p> <p>This was April, when the talk was of whether Britain would sink into an unprecedented triple-dip recession. Since then, fresh data has revised away the double-dip recession and economic growth has returned. The 0.7% expansion in the three months to June looks set to be at least equalled, if not bettered, in the third quarter. The debate in the City now is not about the long-forgotten triple dip but about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/08/help-to-buy-house-prices-danny-alexander\" title=\"\">whether Osborne is overcooking things with his Help to Buy scheme for the housing market</a>.</p> <p>So game, set and match to the chancellor, then? Not quite. In one important sense Osborne gets his pound of flesh from the IMF's latest WEO. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/08/imf-raises-uk-growth-forecasts-economy\" title=\"\">The fund's growth forecasts for the UK have been revised up by 0.5 percentage points this year and by 0.4 percentage points in 2014</a> \u2013 comfortably the biggest increases for any developed country. What's more, the IMF predictions still look a bit low given recent developments in the economy. Further upgrades from the 1.4% and 1.9% pencilled in for this year and 2014 still look likely, unless the global economy nosedives in the coming months.</p> <p>But Blanchard was quite right to say that the pick-up in activity in the UK during the summer does not settle the debate about how the economy might have fared under an alternative strategy. All recessions come to an end eventually, so the real question is whether the upturn in Britain was unecessarily delayed by VAT increases, cuts in capital spending and the chancellor's comparison of the UK with Greece. Academic research by the economist Alan Taylor suggests that UK GDP would be 3% higher today without austerity.</p> <p>What's more, the fund makes the point that it will take many years for the UK to make good the output losses from the deep slump and sluggish recovery of the past five years. With borrowing costs at a historic low, it is still calling for the government to consider an increase in borrowing to fund much-needed improvements in infrastructure. This would help the economy's future growth potential and make the recovery better balanced.</p> <p>There is a final reason Osborne may decide not to rub it in when he arrives in Washington for the IMF's annual meeting this weekend. The gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors takes place under the cloud of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/government-shutdown-how-it-ends\" title=\"\">a possible US debt default</a> and there are fears that this could provide the latest setback to a global economy that still bears the scars of the near financial meltdown of five years ago.</p> <p>The IMF has some harsh things to say about the way the US is conducting its financial affairs in its latest WEO, published in Washington on Tuesday. It says, correctly, that crude indiscriminate spending cuts under the sequester programme are a bad way to repair public finances battered by the deep recession of 2008-09. It notes, again correctly, that the game of chicken over the debt ceiling could lead to more uncertainty and hence lower growth.</p> <p>What concerns the fund is that American politics has the potential to destabilise the global economy at a particularly delicate moment. The big emerging market economies \u2013 China, India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa \u2013 are not growing as quickly as they were a couple of years back. The summer saw downward pressure on the currencies of developing countries as a result of anticipation that the US Federal Reserve would begin to taper away its $85bn-a-month stimulus programme from this autumn. Europe is only just emerging from a double-dip recession. These things also concern the chancellor. At the moment he has a nice little recovery going. But with an election little more than 18 months away, he cannot afford for it to falter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kate Moss could lead Topshop into China after the fashion chain's billionaire owner Sir Philip Green said he was in \"advanced discussions\" to open its first outlets in the country. With the model set to put her name to a new collection for the retailer, due to launch in 40 countries next April, Green said: \"We could use that as an opportunity to open 20 to 30 pop-up stores within department stores in China.\" Moss's latest collaboration with Topshop will be the first since she walked away from a previous project three years ago. The model, who was paid a reported \u00a33m for her first collaboration, will work on the new collection with stylist Katy England and Topshop's creative director, Kate Phelan. At 39, she is old enough to be the mother of many Topshop customers, but Green insisted she still had fashion influence. \"Show me anybody with better fashion credibility. She's spent 20 years in the industry \u2013 who knows the business better?\" Using Moss's name in China would echo Topshop's move into the US four years ago, where the model's worldwide appeal helped secure sites in a number of Nordstrom stores as well as four standalone stores. Green, who opened a Topshop store in Hong Kong this summer, said he was in negotiations with a number of parties about different opportunities on the mainland, and Topshop's China launch might also begin with standalone stores alongside department store outlets. He could not say when these might open but said: \"We can open in any market pretty quickly. If we did the deal tomorrow we could open in six weeks.\" Green is also looking at pop-up shops for Topshop Unique, the catwalk range which showed during London fashion week. Meanwhile, Topshop is continuing its expansion trail in the US where it is just completing the opening of 20 new Nordstrom outlets. Green said more could follow next year if the current batch perform well, and there could be as many as 70 across the country in future as well as standalone stores. He is in negotiations to open four of five more high street outlets with plans for at least one more New York store. This year the Arcadia Group, which includes Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans as well as Topshop, has opened 154 new stores globally, taking its total to about 700. In the UK, Green is conducting a \"capital investment review\" amid increased competition from the internet and rival chains. Each of the Arcadia brands has been asked to make a pitch on how it could rejuvenate the look of its stores. Green would not put a figure on his investment plans but said trial revamps of Dorothy Perkins and Burton stores in Bluewater, Kent, and an Evans store on Oxford Street, London, had produced double-digit increases in sales. He said each chain could get a budget to try an updated look in 10 to 30 stores. Green has previously announced plans to pull out of 200 to 300 smaller stores when leases expire and he confirmed that process was continuing. \u2022 This article was changed on 11 October to correct the spelling of Nordstrom",

In its half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO), the Washington-based fund said national output in Britain would expand by 1.4% this year and by 1.9% in 2014. Upbeat data since the IMF's last set of forecasts in July led to estimates of growth being upgraded by 0.5 points in 2013 and by 0.4 points in 2014 \u2013 the highest for any developed economy. The fund embarrassed the chancellor in its last WEO, when it called on the UK to ease up on its austerity plans in order to boost the recovery prospects. It repeated the call for higher public spending in its latest assessment. \"In the UK, recent data have shown welcome signs of an improving economy, consistent with increasing consumer and business confidence, but output remains well below its pre-crisis-peak\", the fund said.

The fund said growth was expected to return to its long-term trend of 2-2.5% in the medium term but added that output levels would remain below potential for \"many years\". It added that further repair work was needed to the UK banking system in order to boost credit and demand, and urged the government to come up with a strategy for returning Royal Bank of Scotland to the private sector following its sale of part of its stake in Lloyds. Noting that the health of Lloyds and RBS was crucial for credit growth, the WEO said: \"A clear strategy is needed for the Royal Bank of Scotland with a view to returning both to private ownership.\" The fund gave its backing to the Bank of England's policy of forward guidance, under which Threadneedle Street has pledged to hold interest rates at 0.5% at least until unemployment comes down to 7%. \"Monetary policy should stay accommodative in the UK, and the Bank of England's recently adopted forward guidance framework is an important step toward greater transparency about the factors that will guide policy rates.\" But the fund encouraged Osborne to take advantage of cheap borrowing costs to improve the UK's infrastructure, something it said could be done without jeopardising the government's budget plans. \"In an environment of still low interest rates and underutilisation of resources, public investment can also be brought forward to offset the drag from planned near-term fiscal tightening, while staying within the medium-term fiscal framework.\"",

      "bodyText": "Facebook paid no corporation tax in Britain last year, according to its latest accounts, despite taking an estimated \u00a3223m share of the digital advertising market. The social network's tax bill fell from \u00a3238,000 in 2011 to zero, while its reported UK income rose by 70%. Together with Google, Facebook accounts for almost half of the \u00a36bn expected to be spent on digital advertising in the UK this year, according to forecaster eMarketer. Google will take the lion's share, with a 43% slice, but Facebook's influence is increasing. Its share is projected to grow to 5% of spend, or \u00a3303m, in 2013. In the last two years, its estimated British revenues have risen from \u00a3181m in 2011 to \u00a3223m in 2012, according to eMarketer. However, those numbers are not reflected in its accounts. In common with fellow American technology leaders Google and Apple, Facebook funnels the vast majority of its income from advertisers targeting its 33 million British users through Ireland. \"This is yet another example of what appears to be deliberate manipulation of accounts of economic activity to deprive the British taxpayer of a rightful tax contribution, according to the profits they make in the UK,\" said Commons public accounts committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge. \"I am getting fed up of this constant stream of stories and little sign of a challenge from HMRC and a strange silence from government.\" Accounts filed at Companies House show that in 2012 just \u00a335m of Facebook's UK income was booked in the market where it was generated. This was a 70% increase on 2011, when revenues were reported at \u00a320m. France is pushing for Europe to adopt a new corporation tax regime which would see multinationals such as Google and Facebook regulated and taxed in the countries where customers use their websites. Fleur Pellerin, the French digital economy minister, is expected to push for the reforms at a summit of European leaders scheduled for the end of October, which the EU digital commissioner, Neelie Kroes, is also expected to attend. Legislation would be changed to ensure companies are taxed according to where revenues are generated, rather than the geographic location of subsidiaries used to collect the revenues. \"What we have in mind is to find the criteria to define the taxable basis that we can attach to European territory,\" she told the Financial Times. \"When we talk to Google or Facebook or the others \u2026 of course they are not happy about paying more corporate tax. But they are happy to agree to play by the rules. The thing that bothers them is uncertainty.\" A Facebook spokesman said: \"Facebook pays all taxes required by UK law and we comply with tax laws in all countries where we operate and have employees and offices. We take our tax obligations seriously, and work closely with national tax authorities around the world to ensure compliance with local law.\"",

The joint venture also provides for fees payable to Ocado as it operates Morrisons' online business.

However, this does not account for the true benefits of the deal for Ocado. In addition to the cash flows, we believe that Ocado benefits from improved asset turnover in joint venture (leasehold) CFCs, the opportunity to grow at smaller incremental investments (around \u00a365m rather than the \u00a3215m that would be required for a CFC solely owned by Ocado on a freehold basis) and has recapitalised Ocado's balance sheet. <br> Assuming the successful launch of [Morrison's online business] M.com in January 2014, we would expect Morrisons to want to participate in the third CFC. With CFC2 capacity available to Ocado.com now effectively halved, if Ocado.com's sales accelerate as we expect them to (we forecast 22% average growth over 2013-15), then more capacity will be needed for Ocado.com in late 2016. </blockquote> <p>And sticking its neck, Goldman looks even further into the future:</p> <blockquote> By 2020, we assume eight operational CFCs (two wholly-owned by Ocado and six joint ventures with Morrisons, \u00a33.9bn of revenues from Ocado.com (2.6% share of the UK grocery market) and \u00a3272m in earnings for Ocado.

      "bodyText": "The sluggishness of the global economy has been highlighted, with German exports rising by less than expected and leaders from across the Asia Pacific region warning that trade is weakening. Exports from Europe's largest economy rose 1% in August but came in short of the expected 1.5% increase. Despite the rise, which followed an unexpected fall in July, the data from the federal statistics office showed German exports continue to be hit by weak demand from the eurozone. Imports rose by 0.4%, widening Germany's trade surplus to \u20ac15.6bn (\u00a313.2bn) from \u20ac15bn in July \u2013 higher than analysts had predicted but below a surplus of \u20ac18.1bn in the same month last year. On an annual basis, German imports were 2.2% lower than in August 2012 while exports of goods were 5.4% lower. Meanwhile, leaders at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting in Bali warned global growth was too weak and trade was slowing. \"Global growth is too weak, risks remain tilted to the downside, global trade is weakening, and the economic outlook suggests growth is likely to be slower and less balanced than desired,\" leaders said in a statement. \"We will implement prudent and responsible macroeconomic policies to ensure mutually reinforcing effect of growth and to maintain economic and financial stability in the region, and prevent negative spillover effect.\" The group of 21 countries includes Japan, China, Russia, Australia and the US, although the US government shutdown meant President Barack Obama was not present at the meeting to back the statement. Elsewhere, HSBC said British companies needed more help from the government to fulfil their export potential. Since the onset of the financial crisis, UK policymakers have repeatedly emphasised the need to rebalance the economy away from a reliance on spending and towards manufacturing and exports. The government has an ambition to double exports to \u00a31tr by 2020, an increase HSBC said would require \"considerable work\". Britain's largest bank said UK business confidence was rising, and predicted growth in hi-tech manufacturing, but it said companies needed more practical help. Publishing a manifesto for British exports, HSBC said businesses required assistance to make connections with other parts of the world, support with the initial costs and risks of exporting, and the confidence that came from clear information about international opportunities. Among its recommendations was an examination of the case for export tax credits for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), an improvement in SME access to export credit guarantees, and a simplification of the business visa process. \"Britain's businesses are among the most innovative and imaginative in the world. But in recent years, these talents have failed to deliver significant export growth,\" said Alan Keir, chief executive of HSBC Bank. \"Achieving the government's target of doubling exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 will take considerable work by all parties, yet we know from talking to our customers that many businesses with massive export potential are still holding back from looking overseas.\"",

      "bodyText": "A last-minute offer has been made to Gina Rinehart's children in relation to the billion-dollar trust their mother has ceded control over. The case was supposed to go before the NSW supreme court on Tuesday morning but it has been adjourned to the afternoon while Rinehart\u2019s son John Hancock and daughter Bianca Rinehart consider the offer of a new trustee. The trust, worth about $5bn, was supposed to be vested to Rinehart\u2019s four children in 2011 but she tried to defer it for another 50 years. Hancock and Bianca Rinehart accuse their mother of acting dishonestly in relation to the trust and last week, in an effort to stave off the court case, Gina Rinehart said she was relinquishing her role as trustee. The children have pressed ahead and on Monday night an offer was made to them for someone else to take over the role of trustee. It was not said in court who the person being considered is. Hancock has already nominated for the role and Rinehart's youngest daughter, Ginia, was considered to be her mother's choice, but she is yet to nominate. None of the family were in court on Tuesday morning.The hearing will resume at 2pm.",
