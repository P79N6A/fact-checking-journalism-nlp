      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's boss Justin King on Wednesday predicted hard-up Britons would \"splash out\" to enjoy Christmas with their families but would ditch branded goods in favour of cheaper own-label supermarket turkeys and trimmings. With last month's shock rise in inflation adding to the squeeze on Britons' spending power, King predicted shoppers would turn to its own brands, which include Taste the Difference and By Sainsbury's, which are typically 20% cheaper than their branded equivalents. \"People are spreading the cost because they want to have a special Christmas,\" he said, adding that parents started buying toys for their children's presents in October. \"They will splash out and Christmas will be about quality food and own-label will be a key trend.\" Sainsbury's flagged new products such as Taste the Difference Irish Cream Liqueur as an alternative to favourite Christmas tipple Baileys. His comments came as the retailer reported half-year profits up more than 5% at \u00a3373m on sales of \u00a313.4bn in the six months to 29 September. Like-for-like sales growth of 1.7% put it at the front of the supermarket pack with Sainsbury's now sitting on a market share of 16.7%, its highest for nearly a decade. Industry data has shown Sainsbury's stealing market share from rivals aided by its successful \"brand match\" pricing initiative which uses the same technology as the Nectar loyalty programme to give customers money-off vouchers if branded goods could have been bought more cheaply at a rival store. King, who is the longest-serving chief executive among the major supermarkets, also used the opportunity to deny reports he is considering stepping down: \"I do understand why, when someone's been in a job for eight years successfully, people think they'd have on their mind doing something else, but I'm very happy at Sainsbury's.\" The grocer had by far the best growth opportunities of the supermarkets ahead of it, he said, adding: \"I see myself playing my part in those.\" The supermarkets are battling tough trading conditions as higher fuel and food costs force Britons to cut back spending. The pressure on household budgets is changing how the nation shops, with the big \"weekly shop\" in decline as more Britons get their groceries delivered or shop locally to avoid wasting food. The trend is hurting market leader Tesco, which has more than 230 of the sprawling out-of-town Tesco Extra stores, and smaller rival Morrisons which does not sell groceries online yet and is only just branching out into convenience stores. With lingering concerns about the health of the economy, King urged the government to use next month's autumn statement to introduce \"anything to incentivise job creation or retention\". He floated the idea of a national insurance holiday for new employees, adding: \"Employment is by far the most powerful force for good in our economy.\" Sainsbury's shares have been buoyed by the return of speculation regarding a possible renewed bid attempt from its Qatari shareholder, which owns 26% of the business. But the shares closed down more than 2% at 338.8p as analysts feared a promotional bloodbath in the runup to Christmas as rival chains bombard shoppers with money-off coupons. Morrisons has upped the ante with the launch of a 10%-off discount card this week. King said it looked like there would be a \"kick on\" in the number of coupons circulating ahead of Christmas but, with 40% of goods on supermarket shelves already on promotion, he said the grocery market had been intensely promotional for some time. He argued its Nectar scheme was more potent as it targeted shoppers with money off products they actually wanted to buy: \"It gives you the edge if you are giving customers vouchers they want to use,\" he said. Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley said that given the tough market, Sainsbury's had reported a \"very solid\" set of results after a period of \"sustained out-performance\" relative to its peers. But he added that the supermarket had the most to lose from a resurgent Tesco, undergoing a \u00a31bn makeover under chief executive Philip Clarke. \"If market leader Tesco does begin to regain share from its investment programme, then Sainsbury remains the most vulnerable given the scale of trading overlap between the two groups.\"",

Michael Taylor, of Lombard Street Research, said: \"Over the entire forecast horizon the Bank expects growth to be below trend. The main downside risk to growth continues to be the global economy, in particular the euro-zone. We would tend to agree with this view. On policy the door is clearly left open to more quantitative easing.\" The exchequer secretary, David Gauke, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"Clearly, there are international pressures on our economy that mean that this is going to be a long and challenging recovery from a very substantial crisis. That is what we are going through at the moment. I think the British people understand that this is going to be a long process.\"",

      "standfirst": "People in Italy, Spain, Germany, France and Greece have joined strikes and demonstrations against austerity measures", 
      "body": "<h2>Italy</h2> <p>The Italian union CGIL led a four-hour general strike in Italy to protest against labour reforms instituted by Mario Monti's government easing hiring and firing rules, as well as rising unemployment and austerity-driven spending cuts and tax hikes which are hitting families hard, just as the recession sends thousands of businesses under. But students were also well represented on the streets, protesting against education cuts and what they see as a jobless future. One banner singled out the labour minister, Elsa Fornero, who recently warned graduates not to be \"choosy\" about jobs when they enter the job market. \"Stay Choosy? Choose to fight,\" read the banner.</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>Spanish unions have launched their second general strike this year to protest at budget cuts they say are strangling the economy, killing jobs and hurting all but the well-off. They accuse the conservative People's party government of breaking promises made in their election campaign a year ago and of using the crisis as a smokescreen for dismantling public services, creeping privatisation and undermining working rights. Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez Toxo, leader of the Comisiones Obreras union group, accused the government of implementing \"impositions from Brussels, or more exactly, the road map imposed by Berlin and Chancellor Merkel\". \"I'm striking today because this last labour reform is a fast track to unemployment,\" said Fatima Frutos, a local government equality officer in the northern town of Pamplona. \"Spain's welfare state is being sold off at bargain basement prices.\"</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>In Germany, people were not particularly complaining about their own problems but rather seeking greater social equality in the whole crisis. Germany's federation of trade unions (DGB) galvanised several thousand protesters across the country to demonstrate their solidarity towards strikers in southern Europe. Under the banner \"against the social division of Europe\", it said workers in Greece, Spain and Portugal in particular were paying for a crisis for which they were not responsible.

      "bodyText": "Italy The Italian union CGIL led a four-hour general strike in Italy to protest against labour reforms instituted by Mario Monti's government easing hiring and firing rules, as well as rising unemployment and austerity-driven spending cuts and tax hikes which are hitting families hard, just as the recession sends thousands of businesses under. But students were also well represented on the streets, protesting against education cuts and what they see as a jobless future. One banner singled out the labour minister, Elsa Fornero, who recently warned graduates not to be \"choosy\" about jobs when they enter the job market. \"Stay Choosy? Choose to fight,\" read the banner. Spain Spanish unions have launched their second general strike this year to protest at budget cuts they say are strangling the economy, killing jobs and hurting all but the well-off. They accuse the conservative People's party government of breaking promises made in their election campaign a year ago and of using the crisis as a smokescreen for dismantling public services, creeping privatisation and undermining working rights. Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez Toxo, leader of the Comisiones Obreras union group, accused the government of implementing \"impositions from Brussels, or more exactly, the road map imposed by Berlin and Chancellor Merkel\". \"I'm striking today because this last labour reform is a fast track to unemployment,\" said Fatima Frutos, a local government equality officer in the northern town of Pamplona. \"Spain's welfare state is being sold off at bargain basement prices.\" Germany In Germany, people were not particularly complaining about their own problems but rather seeking greater social equality in the whole crisis. Germany's federation of trade unions (DGB) galvanised several thousand protesters across the country to demonstrate their solidarity towards strikers in southern Europe. Under the banner \"against the social division of Europe\", it said workers in Greece, Spain and Portugal in particular were paying for a crisis for which they were not responsible. Doro Zinke, the boss of DGB Berlin who gathered protesters at the Brandenburg Gate, said that anger among German workers was growing over politicians' lack of joined-up thinking. \"The EU is concentrating solely on the economy but the EU also needs a social face and with that, job creation schemes for young people as well as an intensive effort across the continent to tackle wage dumping.\" France The five main French unions organised around 100 protests across the country on Wednesday to protest at the \"shock treatments\" being meted out to workers, especially those in Greece, Spain and Portugal.

      "bodyText": "Video showing Spanish riot police striking demonstrators in Tarragona today (see 6.55pm) With Madrid looking calmer again after the earlier clashes (see 9.26pm post) I'm going to suspend live-blogging operations for the evening. Thanks to all for reading, commenting, sharing photos and offering help and info over Twitter and by email. It's appreciated. Remember, El Pais is streaming the events in Madrid. Here's the scene a few minutes ago: I'll be back in the morning for another day's action - including all the fallout from today's pan-European protests. Until then, goodnight! Sara Firth of Russia Today has tweeted another photo from Madrid: This video on Bambuser shows the protests that took place in Barcelona this evening. At 11 minutes in, you can see riot police officers firing weapons at the crowd -- the rubber bullets that were pictured earlier this evening? (see 7.50pm) Madrid's riot police have also tangled with demonstrators tonight. Sara Firth of Russia Today is at the scene, and reports: This photo of Madrid's Columbus Square shows the full extent of the crowds who gathered for tonight's anti-austerity rally. The El Pais live feed from Madrid just showed a fire engine driving slowly through a crowd of demonstrators, many of whom applauded it. Heartening, after such a day Just to add to the sense of alarm tonight, the Dow Jones industrial average just slid 184 points to close at 12571, down nearly 1.5%. Today's Israeli air strike in Gaza, the protests in Europe, and the looming US fiscal cliff are all being blamed. Emergency vehicles in Madrid are now racing to deal with a fire: Meanwhile, speech are still taking place in the Spanish capital (you can hear occasional applause on the El Pais live feed, and then enthusiastic cheering) Looking around, I think the best way to track the events in Madrid this evening is thls live TV feed on the El Pais website Here's a screengrab: The photo above shows the anger in Madrid tonight. And the link in the tweet below shows the scale of the protests (sorry, you'll have to click on the link) Here's AP's take on today's events: Hundreds of thousands of Europe's beleaguered citizens went on strike or snarled the streets of several capitals Wednesday, at times clashing with riot police, as they demanded that governments stop cutting benefits and create more jobs. Workers with jobs and without spoke of a \"social emergency\" crippling the world's largest economic bloc, a union of 27 nations and half a billion people. The protests were met with tear gas in Italy and Spain, but were largely limited to the countries hardest hit by the austerity measures designed to bring government spending into line with revenues. Wealthier nations like Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark saw only small, sedate demonstrations. Another photo from Madrid shows how the centre of the Spanish capital is jam-packed with protesters tonight. Worth remembering that the protests in Spain actually began late last night. Freelance journalist Dan Hancox has written about how around 4,000 union activists hit the streets before midnight: Everyone piled up on flags, stickers, fire-crackers, horns, whistles and flyers, and at 11.45pm, set off to shut down the capital of Spain. Dan's blog also has a great selection of photos from the early hours of the Spanish protests, before dawn broke. Our correspondents across Europe report this evening: Hundreds of thousands of Europeans have mounted one of the biggest coordinated anti-austerity protests across the continent on Wednesday, marching against German-orchestrated cuts as the eurozone is poised to move back into recession. Millions took part in Europe-wide strikes, and in city after city along the continent's debt-encrusted Mediterranean rim, thousands marched and scores were arrested after clashes with police. There were banners declaring \"Austerity kills,\" Occupy masks, flares, improvised loudspeakers and cancelled flights. But there was also a violent, even desperate edge to the demonstrations, particularly in Madrid and several Italian cities. In the Spanish capital, police fired rubber bullets to subdue the crowd; in Pisa, protesters occupied the Leaning Tower, and in Sicily cars were burned. \"There is a social emergency in the south,\" said Bernadette S\u00e9gol, the secretary general of the European Trade Union Confederation. \"All recognise that the policies carried out now are unfair and not working.\" The full story is here. Photos have emerged tonight showing a rubber bullet (or bullets) that were fired in Barcelona today: That, along with the disturbing video footage of protesters being struck by riot police in Tarragona (see 6.55pm), is likely to further fuel anger in Spain against the methods that are being used against those who choose to demonstrate. Christopher Pissarides, professor at the London School of Economics, has argued this evening that Europe's governments blundered by imposing fiscal consolidation too quickly, and not holding back until they had addressed the flaws in the eurozone. Appearing on Sky News tonight, Pissarides also said Europe's banks were inflaming the situation by reining in their lending: Huge numbers of people are taking part in protests in Madrid this evening, packing the streets of the capital as European citizens continue to mark the November 14 protests. Photos from the city suggest that the number of demonstrators runs into the hundreds of thousands, with people carrying banners with slogans such as \"Justice\": Just found some TV footage of the moment riot police in Lisbon moved in to disperse protests in the city centre: Reuters is reporting that a small group of protesters threw rocks and stones at riot police protecting the parliament building in Lisbon tonight - which may explain why they began clearing people away (see 6.25pm). A video has emerged which shows three Spanish riot police lashing out at demonstrators in the city of Tarragona today: The brief clip does not show what led up to the incident, but it begins with one officer chasing a man down the street waving a baton, and striking another person* who falls to the floor clutching their head, and is then hit by a second officer (possibly twice) Another member of the public then remonstrates with the police, and is pushed back before then being struck three times by two officers. The nasty scene is played out to a background of police sirens. * - Update: the individual who is attacked while lying on the ground appears to actually be a boy. A photo of a child who was left bleeding following a police charge was circulating today: (Hat-tip to the Daily Telegraph for making the connection) In London tonight, a union-organised rally is taking place at the EC's offices in Westminster, to show support for those suffering from austerity in Europe. These tweets show more details (with thanks to @FBeyondBorders) Live TV footage from Lisbon in the last few minutes showed that the protests there have now turned violent \u2013 with riot police driving people along the streets. Here's a screengrab from Sky News: Our foreign correspondents from across Europe have written about the protests on their patch today, and the reasons why citizens have gone on strike or taken to the streets today: European strikes: who is protesting and why? Protests took place in 39 Portuguese cities today. And despite public anger over the country's austerity programme, they remained pretty peaceful. Union officials estimate that at least 50% of public sector workers took part in today's general strike. The most dramatic scenes were in Lisbon where people marched on the parliament building, where MPs were debating the 2013 budget. That legislation includes further austerity measure, including income tax hikes, and increases in sales tax. Here's a selection of photos from Portugal: There have been serious clashes between demonstrators and riot police in several Italian cities. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Italy today, frequently clashing with with police who have made multiple arrests, reports our man in Rome, Tom Kington. There appear to have been running battles at one stage between the two sides in Turin, Riot police also went toe-to-toe (or baton to head?) in Rome and Milan. Here are some pictures: Tom Kington has full details: Students were in the front line in noisy and often violent anti-austerity marches. In Naples and Brescia, protesters occupied rail tracks, in Genoa the entrance to the ferry port was blocked. In Turin a police officer was hit with a baseball bat. Trento, Trieste and Palermo also saw protests, as did Padua where two police men were injured in clashes, while 10,000 marched in Bologna. In Pisa, protesters hung banners from the top of the Leaning Tower. Clashes occured in Milan, while in Venice protesters draped banners in a bank reading \u201cYou are making money out of our debts\u201d. Banking in a nutshell?... Another sign of violence today: this photo from Valencia appears to show a police officer kicking a woman during today's protests. It's worth noting that the man who represented Greece's creditors in this year's bond restructuring (in which \u20ac107bn was wiped off its debt pile), has criticised Europe's austerity drive today Charles Dallara, head of the Institute of International Finance, delivered a scathing attack on the policies of austerity in Athens. Our own Helena Smith was there, and reports: \u201cEurope and Greece need to steer a new course to find a better balance between austerity and growth, between short-term fiscal discipline and long-term expansions of output and employment opportunities,\u201d Dallara said in a speech outlining the strategy that he argued was required for Greece and Europe to emerge from the crisis. \u201cA return to real, sustainable economic growth can be the only genuine solution to Europe\u2019s crisis,\u201d he told the Hellenic Bank Association. \u201cIt is time to recognize that austerity alone condemns not just Greece but the whole of Europe to the probability of a painful and protracted era of little or no economic growth. This would be a tragedy not just for Greece and for Europe, but for the world.\u201d In remarks after the speech, the American described as \u201cexcessive\u201d the pace of fiscal adjustment \u201cIt has been excessive and contribute to this dramatic contraction of the economy,\u201d he told me. We don\u2019t need to throw out the [IMF-EU fiscal consolidation] programme altogether and there are definitely good things in it but we need urgently to change course.\u201d So it's not just Europe's unions who are calling for a new approach... This two photos from Madrid show that some businesses preferred to carry on than take part in today's general strike \" People in Austria have also taken part in today's protests, even though the country has the lowest unemployment rate in the eurozone and has not (yet) felt the impact of austerity directly. Amela Muratovic reports that around 350 people were dancing sirtaki (a Greek jig) in the heart of Vienna beneath St Stephen's cathedral. Amela explains: It was a message of support and solidarity with the Greek people, but also with other people on Europe who are suffering from austerity measures. \"We are all Greek\" was the title of this activity. And here's a second picture: The Guardian Picture Desk have created a gallery of the best photos from today's protests, from press snappers across Europe: Anti-austerity strikes and protests across Europe As a reminder -- we're also collecting readers' photos here. This graph, via City firm M&amp;G, shows how unemployment in Spain and Greece have soared since the crisis began, helping to fuel the public anger that lead to today's strike. M&amp;G's Richard Woolnough points out that over the last 10 years the sick and healthy economies of Europe have alternated: the strong core and the weak periphery were the weak core and the booming periphery in the middle of the last decade. and says the speed of the switch is due to the inflexibility of the single currency. Woolnough also questions whether today should really be called a 'day of action': The day of action means in reality a day of inaction, as the active protesting on the streets is outweighed by the inactive sectors such as transportation hit by the strike. Not that there was much inactivity in Madrid or Milan today... C\u00e1ndido M\u00e9ndez, secretary-general of Spain\u2019s UGT union, has thanked those who took part in today's general strike, saying We are deeply grateful to the workers, who are in a very difficult situation with unemployment at almost six million That's via the FT, which also reports a \"sense of trepidation on the streets\" of Madrid ahead of demonstrations planned for this evening. Further proof that the eurozone crisis is causing serious damage to society - malaria is making a comeback in Greece. The Wall Street Journal has more. This video clip shows a group of people (mainly students, I think) occupying Naples central railway station today. That's via La Repubblica, which has other video clips on its site too. Opposition members of the Spanish parliament held up posters in support of the pan-European strike action today. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, leader of the opposition PSOE party, warned that many people will \"get left behind\" unless the Madrid government changes its economic policy. In Brussels, people gathered outside the offices of the European Commission this morning for a demonstration organised by the country's trade unions. People at the scene report that protesters chanted \"We want another Europe!\" for around an hour, taking the message from southern Europe to within earshot of European officials. Here are some photos from Brussels today: From Madrid, Jaime Gim\u00e9nez sends a photo showing riot police vans lined up in the Spanish capital and armed (he says) with dedicated riot guns for firing rubber ammunition. As mentioned at 1.57pm, Reuters has reported that rubber bullets were fired at protesters in Madrid earlier today (not clear if anyone was hit). In Athens, Helena Smith reports that demonstrators have spent the last hour amassed in front of the parliament in Syntagma square She says the turnout was small, due to Greeks being \"exhausted and disoriented\" by relentless waves of punitive measures. But what was striking was the talk of the country's imminent social implosion. Helena writes: Across the board I heard people say that they had been able to survive, so far, because of hand-outs from their parents or family support. \"But when that dries up, and it will with these latest measures, there will be no reason not to descend en masse onto the streets,\" said Kostas Kapetanakis, a young sociologist holding a banner demanding free education, health and welfare system. \"There will be a revolt because we will have absolutely nothing to lose.\" Nikos Bokaris, the mild-mannered president of the national foresters' association who was standing with other civil servants outside the parlaiment, feared Greece was being pushed towards a massive explosion. \"Civil servants feel they have been very unfairly singled out,\" he told me. \"I am very afraid that the country is heading for a massive social upheaval with huge consequences for public safety and order. All it will take is a spark.\" The number of people arrested in Spain during today's protests has now risen to 81. Reuters is reporting that riot police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Madrid, where some of the largest protests have taken place. In Rome, American journalist Barbie Latza Nadeau reports that the Italian capital is \"paralysed\" as several anti-austerity demonstrations merge into a single mass. The protests in Athens today (see 10.54am for details) appear to have passed off peacefully. Pictures from the scene show that marchers carried banners criticising European austerity (just days after the Greek parliament approved billions of euros of new cuts), while some people performed a puppet show in which Europe was assailed from all sides: Today's strike action has been criticised by a European employers organisation, which fears the walkout will damage Europe's already-weak economy and deter potential foreign investors. Philippe de Buck , the chief of Eurobusiness \u2013 the Brussels-based EU employers' federation \u2013 said: If you start striking at national level and in companies you only will harm the economy, and it is not the right thing to do today... It costs billions [of euros]. I can't find any authoritative estimates for the cost of today's action. But analysts have reckoned that major disruption to the UK economy (through bad weather or a bank holiday) costs upwards of \u00a31bn -- so it's clear that the general strikes in Spain and Portugal, plus walkouts in Italy and Greece, will have a significant cost. Manufacturers may be able to recover the lost hours, but service companies may not (commuters in Madrid won't buy twice as many coffees, newspapers or sandwiches tomorrow, for example). Many thanks to everyone who's shared photos from today's protests - our Readers' Gallery has a lot of fine pictures already: To share yours, just click here. More photos of the protests in Madrid have arrived, showing riot police apprehending some demonstrators: The number of arrests in Spain still stands at 62. Protesters in Madrid have also plastered shop windows with anti-government stickers, and Reuters reports that some cash machines have been jammed with glue (we flagged up at 10.11am that they had been vandalised) New economic data released this morning shows that austerity continues to have a dreadful impact on southern Europe. Portugal's economy shrank by 0.8% in the third quarter of the year, more than economists expected. This means the country's GDP is 3.4% lower than a year ago, when it was in the early stages of an 'adjustment programme' having accepted a \u20ac78bn bailout. Unemployment in Portugal has also hit a record high today of 15.8% for the last quarter. Separate data showed that Greece's economy is faring even worse - GDP has contracted by 7.2% over the last year. Some readers are asking what is the alternative to Europe's current economic path. So here's what the European Trades Union Convention (which called today's co-ordinated strike) has proposed instead of austerity-driven cuts and tax rises. \u2022 Economic governance at the service of sustainable growth and quality jobs, \u2022 Economic and social justice through redistribution policies, taxation and social protection, \u2022 Employment guarantees for young people, \u2022 An ambitious European industrial policy steered towards a green, low-carbon economy and forward-looking sectors with employment opportunities and growth, \u2022 A more intense fight against social and wage dumping, \u2022 Pooling of debt through Euro-bonds, \u2022 Effective implementation of a financial transaction tax to tackle speculation and enable investment policies, \u2022 Harmonisation of the tax base with a minimum rate for companies across Europe, \u2022 A determined effort to fight tax evasion and fraud, \u2022 Respect for collective bargaining and social dialogue, \u2022 Respect for fundamental social and trade union rights.

This video clip shows the early morning protest in Spain, where union leaders claimed that the European commission was imposing austerity on Spaniards \"on the orders of Berlin\". Here's a couple more photos from the marches in Italy this morning: This video clip appears to show a clash between demonstrators and riot police this morning in Milan. It begins with a large group of people carrying banners and placards, who march up to a line of riot police. What appear to be petrol bombs (or possibly flares) are thrown at the officers, at which point they charge the students (hitting several with their batons). The protesters then regroup and march towards the police again (using their placards as a shield wall, rather like a phalanx), and a second clash takes place. The video comes from Maurizio Sartori - you can see more of his clips here. Some of the most violent scenes so far this morning have taken place in Italy, where students have clashed with riot police. Italy\u2019s CGIL union has organised 100 protest events on Wednesday in Italy to mark a four-hour general strike, but it is students who are attracting attention in cities across Italy. From Rome, Tom Kington reports: The windows of a bank in Milan were reportedly smashed by protesting students, while far right students in Rome threw stones at police in a bid to break through a barricade to reach Palazzo Chigi, the residence of prime minister Mario Monti, which sits next door to the Italian parliament, where a budget law is being voted today. Police in Brescia charged against students congregating at the town\u2019s station. Susanna Camusso, the head of the CGIL is meanwhile heading a march which started from the gates of the troubled ThyssenKrupp steelworks in Terni in Umbria. In Turin, thousands of protesters marched behind a model dragon representing global finance, with a placard in its jaws on which the word \u201cWork\u201d was written. A raid on the city\u2019s tax office was met with tear gas fired by police. In Milan, transport workers, train conductors and hospital employees joined the students in the streets. The strike follows a tense day on Tuesday for Italian government ministers. In Sardinia, industry minister Corrado Passera and Fabrizio Barca, minister for territorial cohesion, needed to be evacuated by helicopter from a meeting on the local economy after protesters lined a road with burning cars. In Naples, a talk given by labour minister Elsa Fornero was interrupted by a man who threatened to slash his wrists to protest his daughter\u2019s inability to find work. Protesters clashed with police in the city on Monday. Here's a photo of the protests that are starting now in central Athens (see 10.54 for details) If you're taking part in a march today, or on strike, or simply feeling the impact of today's protests, we'd love to here from you. If you're on Twitter, please tweet your pics to @guardian with the hashtag #14N. Thanks! In Greece, the frontline of Europe's debt crisis, protesters are taking to the streets as public and private sector employees stage a three-hour work stoppage. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith writes: While the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is upbeat, with the conservative leader announcing that he expects a total of \u20ac44.6bn in loans to be handed over by creditors in the coming weeks, unions representing ordinary Greeks predict that the worst is only just beginning for a nation on course to endure it sixth straight year of recession amid every worsening poverty and unemployment. \"The price of this money is more misery for Greeks who are now undergoing their worst ever crisis in modern times.\" said Ilias Iliopoulos at the civil servants' union Adedy. \"There will be more cuts in salaries and pensions not to mention firings in the public sector,\" he lamented. Greek unionists in both the public and private sector have staged some 19 general strikes this years alone - but with little effect. The pan-European action follows months of efforts to coordinate anti-austerity protests across the continent with trade unionists frequently visiting Athens in recent months. \"We are a small country and so there is only so much that we can achieve,\" said Iliopoulos. \"Greece is no longer alone. Other countries in Europe are suffering from these terrible neo-liberal policies. This is the best way of getting our message heard.\" There are now reports that 62 people have been arrested so far today in Spain, with 34 people injured (including 18 policemen). Reuters reports that there have been clashes in Madrid this morning: Spanish anti-riot police and protesters clashed on Wednesday in central Madrid during a general strike. Two protesters were arrested and police hit others with night-sticks. As I blogged at 8.05am, today's protests in Spain began before dawn. Here's another good photo from the centre of Madrid this morning. Pockets of demonstrators led by trade unions gathered across Germany this morning as a sign of solidarity towards colleagues elsewhere in Europe, our Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly reports. But apart from several cancelled flights to and from destinations hit by strikes elsewhere, Germany remains largely untouched by the unrest. Michael Sommer, head of DGB, one of Germany's largest trade unions which has organised several solidarity demonstrations across the country, called on politicians to take more heed of social imbalances as they sought ways to battle the crisis. Sommer said: The austerity policies are not working...It not only make no sense to try to tackle the crisis with cuts, it is also dangerous. Instead he said the crisis should be tackled with a \"comprehensive growth and investment programme\". He added that the European strikes sent a \"strong signal: we cannot continue like this\". Kate also reports that that Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2013 towards whom much of the strikers' rage is directed \u2013 said she welcomed the protests, saying everyone had a right to demonstrate. \"I spent 34 years living in a country where you could not demonstrate,\" she said, referring to her East German origins. Just in: photos from the rail strike in Belgium today, which appears to have caused significant disruption (see 8.20am). Here, Belgian workers with flares demonstrate on rail tracks and block trains: Not everyone has had to wait in a chilly railway station, though: Trade unions are to hold 130 marches across France today in support of anti-austerity strikes in Europe. The unions, in a joint declaration, said they wanted to show \u201cfirm opposition to austerity measures which would plunge Europe into stagnation, if not recession\u201d creating deep \u201cinjustices\u201d. Our Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, reports: Francois Hollande, at his first official press conference last night, argued that the French demonstrations \u201cwere not questioning our politics, but rather supporting it.\u201d The Socialist president, who was elected for his opposition to one-size-fits-all austerity across Europe yesterday admitted France's high public spending needed to be trimmed in these times of economic crisis. But in French political semantics, the word \u201causterity\u201d remains taboo. And this morning, Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French prime minister denied any recourse to the dreaded a-word. He told French radio: A rigorous approach to get our public accounts under control, that's true. But austerity, you know what that means: cuts to salaries, pensions, family benefits, it means thousands of job cuts, that's not what we practise. Ayrault said the French state would make efforts to deal with its spending, and look closely at the social security system and local authorities, without detailing where these budget cuts would fall. Here's a view from Madrid via Andrew Moody, an Australian living in Spain. ATMs in Madrid vandalised, garbage uncollected, more traffic than normal, walked to work to avoid the metro The streets of Florence are now heaving with protesters (see also 9.24am) Britain's TUC will deliver a letter to the European Commission's London offices later today, urging European leaders to change their approach to the crisis. It warns that: The austerity measures that the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank are imposing on some countries and advocating for others are dragging the whole of Europe into economic stagnation.... These measures, far from re-establishing confidence in the financial markets, only serve to worsen imbalances and foster injustice. Workers and citizens are paying the price for a crisis they did not cause, in unemployment, falling wages and living standards and cuts in public services.' European unemployment levels have been hitting record highs month after month. The latest data showed that 25.751 million men and women are without jobs across the EU, where the unemployment rate is 10.6%. In the eurozone, the rate is 11.6%, or 23.3% for young people. Jude Kirton-Darling of the European Trade Union Confederation has told the BBC that today's general strike was called to highlight the fact that austerity is actually making the crisis in Europe worse. Kirton-Darling said: It's increasing inequalities, it's increasing the social instability in society and it's not resolving the economic crisis. Latest word from Spain is that 131 flights have been cancelled (including those BA flights from London). And the railway platforms in Madrid were deserted this morning: People travelling by air from the UK have been hit by today's strike action, with British Airways cancelling eight round-trip flights between London and Madrid and Barcelona, and two return services to Lisbon. EasyJet has also cancelled flights. ITV News has more details: Strikes cause flight misery for UK travellers Over in Italy, protesters have gathered in Florence for an anti-austerity strike. Here are some photos from the scene: The photo above shows a near-empty arrival hall at Madrid Atocha rail station in Spain this morning. And one resident in Madrid reports that the situation is calm: Today is billed as the \"1st Pan-European General Strike\", with around 40 unions taking part across 23 countries. Only Spain and Portugal are actually holding full-blown 'general strikes', but there is significant action across the region. Here's some details: Spain: General strike all day. Major protest in the centre of Madrid tonight. Around 600 flights have been cancelled (according to Sky). And just 20% of train services are expected to run. Portugal General strike all day. Protests in 40 Portuguese towns and cities. Around 160 flights cancelled. Lisbon Metro is closed. Just 10% of train services are expected to run. Greece A three-hour stoppage from noon (10am GMT). Rallies in Athens from noon, ending in Syntagma Square. EasyJet has rescheduled 10 flights (more details on disruption in Greece here) Italy Workers will hold a four-hour stoppage. France No official strike, but demonstrations are taking place across the country. Belgium Rail workers are on strike, disrupting services (see 8.20am) UK Anti-austerity rally in Westminster tonight. If you have more details - please let me know at graeme.wearden@guardian.co.uk or @graemewearden. The Spanish government says 32 people have been arrested at this morning's protests (see 8.05am for details and photos), with 15 injured. That's via Associated Press, which adds: The General Workers Union said the nationwide stoppage, the second this year, was being heeded by nearly 100 percent of workers Wednesday in the automobile, energy, shipbuilding and constructions industries. Spain is at the forefront of the eurozone crisis, with one in four people out of work. Its economy has been shrinking for the last year, and is expected to contract by another 1.5% in 2013. Today's strike action has disrupted rail travel in Belgium. Via Twitter, Fiona Wilson tells me that she's been unable to catch a train from Brussels to Switzerland - and it appears other services are also hit. Belgium's rail network warns that services could be disrupted through the day. Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal reports that Madrid Airport isn't running quite as well as he'd like... There have already been clashes between police and protesters in Madrid this morning, as Spain's general strike got underway. Demonstrators tried to stop buses leaving the main Madrid bus station, where mounted officers had been deployed. A picketer was also arrested by riot police officers, apparently after trying to close a pub with others picketers at the start of the general strike. And in Malaga, other picketers clashed with riot police officers as they tried to stop a truck leaving the city's main food warehouse \"MercaMalaga\". The European Trade Union Confederation released this video clip urging workers to take part in today's action, to put pressure on politicans to prioritise growth and employment: We cannot afford to wait any longer - the policies that have carried out until now have failed. We must take another course. If you're a Twitter user, you can follow the day's developments using the hashtags #14N and #14Nov2012. For example: The European Day of Action and Solidarity is organised by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), with the slogan: \"For Jobs and Solidarity in Europe. No to Austerity. ETUC has issued a declaration in which it warns that austerity is: ...dragging Europe into economic stagnation, indeed recession, as well as the continuing dismantling of the European social model. These measures, far from reestablishing confidence, only serve to worsen imbalances and foster injustice. ETUC's website also contains a Google map showing all the protests taking place across Europe today. European workers are holding their biggest ever co-ordinated strike action and protests today against the austerity programmes that are gripping the region. General strikes are already underway in Spain and Portugal, and workers in Greece and Italy are also expected to walk out. The European Day of Action and Solidarity is designed as a sign to leaders to abandon the programmes of tax rises and spending cuts that are being implemented since the financial crisis began. The disruption is expected to cripple transport links and government services, such as schools. Unions in other European countries may also join the action. We'll be tracking the protests across Europe throughout the day, as well as other key events in the financial crisis today as usual.",

If the competition isn't open, they are potentially losing out.</p> <p>\"It's very tough for employees and it's a big decision to make, but if the consumers are willing to shop, the stores are willing to do it,\" said Grandpre. If stores benefit again this year, he expects even earlier opening times next year.</p> <p>But Grandpre said that Dealnews's research showed 70% of the deals were available online, and that anyone expecting to avoid lines by arriving on Thanksgiving is likely to be disappointed. \"Realistically, if the shop opens at 8pm on Thanksgiving, you are going to have to be there several hours earlier to make sure of getting the best deals,\" he said. With so many deals available online, Grandpre says he finds it hard to see the point.</p> <p>Goebel, too, believes customers will eventually push back against Thanksgiving opening. \"I truly believe that people would rather be spending the day with their families than spending it in line,\" she said.</p>",

    "webTitle": "UK economy faces long and winding road to recovery, warns Mervyn King | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For once Sir Mervyn King struggled to find an appropriate sporting metaphor to sum up the current state of the economy when presenting the Bank of England's inflation report. Instead, he revealed a hitherto hidden knowledge of the Beatles to describe where the UK was heading. Sadly, the governor did not choose one of the Fab Four's cheerier numbers \u2013 Getting Better or Here Comes the Sun \u2013 but said there was a long and winding road to recovery. King was in gloomy mood. He doesn't expect the pickup in activity in the third quarter of 2012 to last and thinks there is a chance output will fall in the current quarter. Growth will remain below its historic trend for the next two years and the level of national output in late 2014 will still be below where it was before the recession started in early 2008. It was more Leonard Cohen than Paul McCartney. The outlook for the UK is for a mild dose of stagflation. Growth will be weaker than previously forecast while inflation will be higher, continuing to breach its 2% target for the next 12 months. As usual, King strongly insisted it would be a mistake for the Bank to tighten monetary policy to hit the inflation target \u2013 either by raising interest rates or by withdrawing some of the \u00a3375bn in quantitative easing \u2013 since to do so would lead to rising unemployment and slower growth. It was not the Bank's fault that inflation continued to misbehave. The cost of living was elevated because of factors beyond Threadneedle Street's control \u2013 such as dearer global food and energy prices and, more recently, the trebling of university tuition fees. Meanwhile, Britain's recovery hopes were being thwarted by an unfavourable global environment that made it tough going for exporters. Missing the inflation target has had consequences, however. The fact that wages have been growing less rapidly than prices \u2013 illustrated again by Wednesday's average earnings figures \u2013 means real incomes have been squeezed. At a time when pay settlements are low, and are likely to remain low, a rise in inflation slows growth by reducing consumer spending power and increasing business costs. This suggests the Bank might eventually need to consider fresh attempts to stimulate activity. King's comments that \"there are limits to the ability of domestic policy to stimulate private sector demand\" could be seen as an example that the monetary policy committee has been listening to the Beatles' Let it Be. That, though, was not what the governor meant. The MPC retains its faith in asset purchases (QE) and had not ruled out further moves. Hardly unexpectedly, King sought to downplay the significance of George Osborne grabbing the cash surplus sitting in the Asset Purchase Facility. This will mean the government has to borrow \u00a337bn less in the next financial year and the governor insisted this did not impair the Bank's independence. What it certainly does imply is a \u00a337bn loosening of monetary policy \u2013 QE by the back door \u2013 which the MPC seems happy enough to endorse. The other way to loosen monetary policy is through a lower exchange rate and King blatantly tried to talk down the value of sterling by making it clear that he is unhappy about the 8% appreciation in the pound over the past year. Given time, King thinks the economy can make a fully recovery. But not immediately and only after a Hard Day's Night.",

Sadly, the governor did not choose one of the Fab Four's cheerier numbers \u2013 Getting Better or Here Comes the Sun \u2013 but said there was a long and winding road to recovery.</p> <p>King was in gloomy mood. He doesn't expect the pickup in activity in the third quarter of 2012 to last and thinks there is a chance output will fall in the current quarter. Growth will remain below its historic trend for the next two years and the level of national output in late 2014 will still be below where it was before the recession started in early 2008. It was more Leonard Cohen than Paul McCartney.</p> <p>The outlook for the UK is for a mild dose of stagflation. Growth will be weaker than previously forecast while inflation will be higher, continuing to breach its 2% target for the next 12 months. As usual, King strongly insisted it would be a mistake for the Bank to tighten monetary policy to hit the inflation target \u2013 either by raising interest rates or by withdrawing some of the \u00a3375bn in quantitative easing \u2013 since to do so would lead to rising unemployment and slower growth.</p> <p>It was not the Bank's fault that inflation continued to misbehave. The cost of living was elevated because of factors beyond Threadneedle Street's control \u2013 such as dearer global food and energy prices and, more recently, the trebling of university tuition fees. Meanwhile, Britain's recovery hopes were being thwarted by an unfavourable global environment that made it tough going for exporters.</p> <p>Missing the inflation target has had consequences, however. The fact that wages have been growing less rapidly than prices \u2013 illustrated again by Wednesday's average earnings figures \u2013 means real incomes have been squeezed. At a time when pay settlements are low, and are likely to remain low, a rise in inflation slows growth by reducing consumer spending power and increasing business costs.</p> <p>This suggests the Bank might eventually need to consider fresh attempts to stimulate activity. King's comments that \"there are limits to the ability of domestic policy to stimulate private sector demand\" could be seen as an example that the monetary policy committee has been listening to the Beatles' Let it Be. That, though, was not what the governor meant. The MPC retains its faith in asset purchases (QE) and had not ruled out further moves.</p> <p>Hardly unexpectedly, King sought to downplay the significance of George Osborne grabbing the cash surplus sitting in the Asset Purchase Facility. This will mean the government has to borrow \u00a337bn less in the next financial year and the governor insisted this did not impair the Bank's independence. What it certainly does imply is a \u00a337bn loosening of monetary policy \u2013 QE by the back door \u2013 which the MPC seems happy enough to endorse.</p> <p>The other way to loosen monetary policy is through a lower exchange rate and King blatantly tried to talk down the value of sterling by making it clear that he is unhappy about the 8% appreciation in the pound over the past year.</p> <p>Given time, King thinks the economy can make a fully recovery. But not immediately and only after a Hard Day's Night.</p>",

But the unemployment rate, which tracks the number of people looking for work, dropped to 7.8% in the three months to September helped by a fall in youth unemployment. The most timely measure of employment \u2013 the claimant count, which tracks the number of people receiving jobseeker's allowance \u2013 rose by 10,100 last month, the largest increase since September 2011. Analysts were expecting the figures to be unchanged from the previous month. Looking back to the third quarter, the wider measure of people looking for work fell by 49,000, to 2.5 million. Youth unemployment, which the coalition government has sought to tackle through Nick Clegg's youth contract, eased 0.8% but remained high at almost 21% for the three months to September. The coalition government highlighted these bright spots in the Office for National Statistics' jobs report. The employment minister, Mark Hoban, said: \"It's good news to see yet another increase in the number of people in work and to see unemployment fall again. The fall in youth unemployment is particularly welcome, although we're not complacent about the scale of the challenge still facing us.\" But unions said the figures showed austerity was not working.

It is definitely hurting, but it's not working.\" Despite the mixed picture, economists said the data showed the job market was deteriorating.

The pace of expansion in employment is slowing. And the figures may still be benefiting from Olympics-related hiring in July and August. Indeed, the claimant count measure of unemployment rose in September, which suggests that the labour market may be beginning to weaken as the Olympics effect fades.\" Meanwhile, the squeeze on household budgets continues.

The merger of Britvic and its Scottish rival AG Barr to create the snappily named Barr Britvic Soft Drinks will bring Robinsons Barley Water, J2O and Fruit Shoot under the same roof as Irn-Bru, Tizer and Rubicon in a group with annual sales of more than \u00a31.5bn. However, Roger White, the current chief executive of AG Barr, who will lead the combined firm, warned that the merger will lead to 350-500 job cuts as the business strives to achieve annual savings of \u00a335m. He said it was too early to say exactly how many jobs would be lost and whether Britvic or AG Barr employees would be most heavily affected, but he added that the \"commercial logic\" of putting the two business together was \"enormous\". Gerald Corbett, chairman of Britvic, who will continue in the same role at the combined company, said the merger, which is subject to shareholder approval, would \"create a world-class soft drinks company \u2026 AG Barr and Britvic are a fantastic fit with complementary strengths and we will benefit from very significant synergies\". Britvic shareholders will own 63% of the new company, with AG Barr holding the rest. Paul Moody, Britvic's chief executive, who presided over the \u00a325m recall of Fruit Shoot drinks as a result of faulty bottle caps, will not have a role in the new company.

The Irn-Bru recipe is known by only three people in the world \u2013 former chairman Robin Barr, his daughter and company secretary, Julie Barr, and one other AG Barr board director whose identity remains confidential. The spelling Irn-Bru was introduced in 1947 following concern over proposed changes to food labelling regulations. AG Barr employs about 980 staff across 11 UK sites. As well as Irn-Bru, the company owns the Tizer, Barr's Originals, Orangina and Rubicon brands. Britvic The company traces its origins to a chemist in Chelmsford, Essex, in the mid-19th century.
