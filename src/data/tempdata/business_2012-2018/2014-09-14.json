      "body": "<p>At a red-brick warehouse that sits on a quiet, cobblestone street in this once industrial enclave of Brooklyn, Vince Oleson is trying his hand at perfecting \u201cthe science of separating the seemingly inseparable\u201d.</p> <p>If it sounds like it\u2019s more about philosophy than making a drinkable whiskey, that\u2019s not surprising. Good whiskey is no longer about pulling down the top-shelf stuff at a bar. As craft distillers proliferate, producing a good cask of whiskey is becoming an esoteric practice. <br></p> <p>Oleson, the tattooed 29-year-old head distiller at the Red Hook-based Widow Jane distillery, along with Widow Jane\u2019s founder and owner Daniel Preston, has the respect for terroir that is common across food and drink entrepreneurs across Brooklyn. Much of their time is spent as amateur geneticists, crossing unusual strains of locally grown, organic corn varietals. <br></p> <p>They blend them with a not-so-secret ingredient: water from the Widow Jane limestone mine from upstate New York. <br></p> <p>Kentucky distillers claim the right kind of water is essential for quality bourbon. Oleson thinks the \u201csweet and smooth\u201d water from the Widow Jane mine meets the bar.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt sounds like a gimmick, but it brings a lot of awesome characteristics out of the whiskey,\u201d says Oleson. \u201cIt enhances all our spirits but especially our bourbons.\u201d </p> <p>The corn has a pedigree too. Oleson, with Preston, has produced whiskey from a half-dozen corn varieties grown on Preston\u2019s three hundred-acre farm in upstate New York. <br></p> <p>Their non-genetically modified heirloom grains, Preston explains, are more difficult to distil and more costly to produce. They are high in proteins and low in starches, making it difficult and inefficient to extract the sugars required for the fermentation process.

      "bodyText": "At a red-brick warehouse that sits on a quiet, cobblestone street in this once industrial enclave of Brooklyn, Vince Oleson is trying his hand at perfecting \u201cthe science of separating the seemingly inseparable\u201d. If it sounds like it\u2019s more about philosophy than making a drinkable whiskey, that\u2019s not surprising. Good whiskey is no longer about pulling down the top-shelf stuff at a bar. As craft distillers proliferate, producing a good cask of whiskey is becoming an esoteric practice. Oleson, the tattooed 29-year-old head distiller at the Red Hook-based Widow Jane distillery, along with Widow Jane\u2019s founder and owner Daniel Preston, has the respect for terroir that is common across food and drink entrepreneurs across Brooklyn. Much of their time is spent as amateur geneticists, crossing unusual strains of locally grown, organic corn varietals. They blend them with a not-so-secret ingredient: water from the Widow Jane limestone mine from upstate New York. Kentucky distillers claim the right kind of water is essential for quality bourbon. Oleson thinks the \u201csweet and smooth\u201d water from the Widow Jane mine meets the bar. \u201cIt sounds like a gimmick, but it brings a lot of awesome characteristics out of the whiskey,\u201d says Oleson. \u201cIt enhances all our spirits but especially our bourbons.\u201d The corn has a pedigree too. Oleson, with Preston, has produced whiskey from a half-dozen corn varieties grown on Preston\u2019s three hundred-acre farm in upstate New York. Their non-genetically modified heirloom grains, Preston explains, are more difficult to distil and more costly to produce. They are high in proteins and low in starches, making it difficult and inefficient to extract the sugars required for the fermentation process. They also produce significantly lower yields \u2013 one-tenth to one-quarter as much as their factory farm-grown counterparts. Craft bourbon, as it turns out, is only just the latest concoction of Cacao Prieto, the company founded by Preston. The former aerospace engineer with a background of lucrative startups and inventions is also producing \u201csingle-source\u201d organic chocolate. After selling off a parachute technology company he founded, Preston went back to his roots: he invested in refurbishing his family\u2019s hundred-year-old defunct cacao farm in the Dominican Republic. Preston began experimenting with organic farming and chocolate-making techniques, and after having secured complete ownership of the entire supply process, Cacao Prieto was born. (He also founded Cacao Biotechnologies, which serves as the laboratory for his array of flavour experiments.) As a result, among the high-ryes and bourbons at Widow Jane, Oleson produces a variety of chocolate-infused rums and liqueurs that colourfully adorn the wall to the entrance of Cacao Prieto. The combination of distillery and chocolate factory seems an odd fit. But the foray into craft bourbon was a natural extension of Preston\u2019s belief in experimentation. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to change the way people think about what goes in their bourbon,\u201d says Oleson.

Or in S\u00e3o Paulo or Hong Kong?\u201d asks I\u00f1aki Berenguer. <br></p> <p>Berenguer, a Spanish-born tech entrepreneur who sold his last company for $26.5m (\u00a316.3m), is, as US immigration laws put it, a man of \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d. He has to be \u2013 it is the best way that he and other skilled foreigners can earn <a href=\"http://www.uscis.gov/eir/visa-guide/eb-1-extraordinary-ability/understanding-eb-1-requirements-extraordinary-ability\">a green card</a> to work in the US. </p> <p>One obstacle that dogs nearly all foreign-born entrepreneurs is obtaining and renewing work visas \u2013 never mind full green cards. The high bar, long wait times and confusing rules are discouraging to those who want to come to America to participate in the booming startup scene. </p> <p>Berenguer, now at work on his second startup, believes talented entrepreneurs will eventually move elsewhere if the current US visa system is not overhauled. Many others agree; the idea was the linchpin of entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa\u2019s book, The Immigrant Exodus.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf the US continues to do what it\u2019s doing, five, 10 years from now, it\u2019s not going to be the leader any more,\u201d says Seattle-based immigration lawyer Tahmina Watson, who has many foreign-born tech clients. <br></p> <p>\u201cIs that what the US wants?\u201d asks Watson. \u201cThe prosperity is not going to remain here, jobs are going to go somewhere else.\u201d Countries like Chile, Singapore and Canada are currently creating startup hubs to attract foreign entrepreneurs. </p> <p>As Berenguer points out, many foreign-born tech entrepreneurs still consider the US ideal for business. It offers capital, talent to hire, infrastructure that supports a growing business, and a huge consumer base. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf you want to make it big, you have to come to the US,\u201d asserts Berenguer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a3f1e5a4-45d5-4b1d-84fb-92cd85dd0bd3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/14/1410711432392/e7824d3d-aa05-406e-b9c3-fbf66e72486b-460x276.png\" alt=\"Inaki\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inaki Berenguer, who says \u201cto make it big, you have to come to the US\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Berenguer is a lean 38-year-old, typical of marathon runners, one of his only activities outside the world of technology. Affable yet intense, Berenguer sports a pair of perfectly fitting worn jeans and a blue Oxford shirt in his downtown New York office. The office is now home to the second company he co-founded and which recently launched the caller ID app Klink.</p> <p>By most measures, he would already be considered a success. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, with a stint at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship, Berenguer co-created the photo aggregations app Pixable, along with Andr\u00e9s Blank and Alberto Sheinfeld, both originally from Venezuela. In 2009 all three moved to New York City from Massachusetts, where Berenguer and Blank earned MBAs from MIT. Pixable uses a combination of meta-data, algorithms and editors to curate photos for its users. Within three years of its creation Pixable was bought by SingTel in 2012 for $26.5m; Berenguer remains the CEO. <br></p> <p>His current office, in downtown Manhattan\u2019s hip SoHo neighbourhood, is the picture of the typical US startup. Scribbled-on whiteboards decorate the walls, monitors and laptops sit atop all surfaces, and a couple of employees work at standing desks while the rest stare into their screens.

      "bodyText": "\u201cDo you want to have the next Google in the US? Or in S\u00e3o Paulo or Hong Kong?\u201d asks I\u00f1aki Berenguer. Berenguer, a Spanish-born tech entrepreneur who sold his last company for $26.5m (\u00a316.3m), is, as US immigration laws put it, a man of \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d. He has to be \u2013 it is the best way that he and other skilled foreigners can earn a green card to work in the US. One obstacle that dogs nearly all foreign-born entrepreneurs is obtaining and renewing work visas \u2013 never mind full green cards. The high bar, long wait times and confusing rules are discouraging to those who want to come to America to participate in the booming startup scene. Berenguer, now at work on his second startup, believes talented entrepreneurs will eventually move elsewhere if the current US visa system is not overhauled. Many others agree; the idea was the linchpin of entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa\u2019s book, The Immigrant Exodus. \u201cIf the US continues to do what it\u2019s doing, five, 10 years from now, it\u2019s not going to be the leader any more,\u201d says Seattle-based immigration lawyer Tahmina Watson, who has many foreign-born tech clients. \u201cIs that what the US wants?\u201d asks Watson. \u201cThe prosperity is not going to remain here, jobs are going to go somewhere else.\u201d Countries like Chile, Singapore and Canada are currently creating startup hubs to attract foreign entrepreneurs. As Berenguer points out, many foreign-born tech entrepreneurs still consider the US ideal for business. It offers capital, talent to hire, infrastructure that supports a growing business, and a huge consumer base. \u201cIf you want to make it big, you have to come to the US,\u201d asserts Berenguer. Berenguer is a lean 38-year-old, typical of marathon runners, one of his only activities outside the world of technology. Affable yet intense, Berenguer sports a pair of perfectly fitting worn jeans and a blue Oxford shirt in his downtown New York office. The office is now home to the second company he co-founded and which recently launched the caller ID app Klink. By most measures, he would already be considered a success. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, with a stint at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship, Berenguer co-created the photo aggregations app Pixable, along with Andr\u00e9s Blank and Alberto Sheinfeld, both originally from Venezuela. In 2009 all three moved to New York City from Massachusetts, where Berenguer and Blank earned MBAs from MIT. Pixable uses a combination of meta-data, algorithms and editors to curate photos for its users. Within three years of its creation Pixable was bought by SingTel in 2012 for $26.5m; Berenguer remains the CEO. His current office, in downtown Manhattan\u2019s hip SoHo neighbourhood, is the picture of the typical US startup. Scribbled-on whiteboards decorate the walls, monitors and laptops sit atop all surfaces, and a couple of employees work at standing desks while the rest stare into their screens. One of the \u201cteam values\u201d stated on a poster is \u201cdelight our customers\u201d. Berenguer has an informal job as something of a visa whisperer to his fellow foreign-born entrepreneurs. When immigrant entrepreneurs converge, professionally or socially, conversations quickly turn to visas. Late last year, he shared a stage with two co-founders of New York tech startups \u2013 Jos\u00e9 de Cabo and Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez \u2013 to a rapt audience in Lower Manhattan. Eager foreign-born entrepreneurs who packed the space wanted to know how they managed to start US-based businesses as foreigners. Berenguer and his fellow panellists rattled off their education, work histories, startup functions, and even amusing culture clash anecdotes like the time Fern\u00e1ndez was making a presentation to a room full of Americans and joked, \u201cI\u2019m from Spain, so I\u2019m not very ambitious,\u201d which, he reported with disappointment, did not elicit one laugh. But what this audience desperately wanted was guidance regarding the labyrinthine legal path a foreigner must follow to obtain the proper visa allowing them to start a business in the US. There were no magical solutions revealed other than \u201chire a good lawyer\u201d. \u201cGetting them is difficult,\u201d explains Berenguer of the work visas, \u201cand once you have them, they expire.\u201d Those with enviable visas are asked, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d and then tell a complicated tale that usually includes a patchwork of applications and forms \u2013 sometimes with creative wording, innovative lawyers, fees paid, numerous waiting periods, additional paperwork, and possibly trips home. \u201cBasically every case is kind of different,\u201d says Berenguer who had a tenuous visa situation until recently when a green card was granted because of that special qualification, his \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d.

He adds earnestly that he\u2019s living the American Dream. But enthusiasm wanes when Berenguer addresses the US\u2019s visa system for entrepreneurs. Like many in his position, he has found it murky, subjective and frustrating.

Part of the problem is that the framework for employment-based immigration stems from 1990, according to New York City immigration lawyer Chris Gafner. Populations, quotas, technology and global immigration options have changed drastically since then. An innovative solution introduced to help immigrant entrepreneurs is what\u2019s known as the startup visa, which is now languishing in Congress.

Jobs claimed that they had the opportunity to construct \"the best office building in the world\", the donut-like plan by Norman Foster hinged not just on aesthetics but also ensuring the possibility for collaboration between workers who would be able to walk around the new campus, a concept which is central to how architects now look at the modern office.

      "bodyText": "As we're talking over the phone, you're in Zermatt, where Virgin's month-long Strive Challenge culminated in the \"Strivers\" climbing the Matterhorn. But your son Sam suffered altitude sickness and had to be taken off the mountain by rescue helicopter on the way back down. It must have been very worrying? Fortunately, it actually wasn't alarming, because we didn't realise it was Sam that was in trouble, and then by the time we actually knew about it, he was safely at the bottom of the mountain. All was well. And you're feeling proud? The whole team are just magnificent. It's fantastic, what they've achieved over the last month. We had a big celebration with all the Strivers. Great kudos to them all. There's one lad who used to be a gang member \u2013 that's what the charity's all about. I'd almost be willing to bet that one day he'll be prime minister of England; he's just the most incredible lad. One day you must interview him. He's just an extraordinary man, a black kid in Brixton who's got out of being a gang leader to really wanting to make a difference in the world. You've said that the challenge reminded you of some of your more hair-raising adventures. Sam and Holly were brought up on their dad doing foolish things, and obviously there were a lot of boating trips and ballooning trips and other adventures. They were either going to take after my wife, who is the clear opposite of myself, or they were going to take after myself and be quite adventurous. And sadly, perhaps, they've taken after myself! So you wouldn't call your children risk-averse? No. We've done some wonderful things together. We've kited the Channel together, we've tried to break the transatlantic sailing record together, we've climbed Mont Blanc together. I think they will say that it's these sort of moments, like the last month, when we've strived, that most likely would be the moments they'd remember the most in their lives. And what connects your life in business with your life in a balloon, as it were? A lot of things about adventuring are not that dissimilar to being an entrepreneur. If you're an entrepreneur, you're trying to create things that have never been created before, you're trying to do it better than anybody else has done it, you're trying to make sure that you protect the downside, so that if it all goes wrong it's not going to bring everything else you've created crashing down. And if you're an adventurer, again you're trying to achieve things that haven't been achieved before, and again you're trying to protect the downside. And the downside can be your life. Speaking of business, you've written a book about it, The Virgin Way. What's the idea behind it? I've had almost 50 years being an entrepreneur and building companies. And so it's hopefully a helpful hand to young people who are setting up and trying to run businesses, or even working for businesses. Having said all that, I think the best way \u2013 and my publisher will kill me for this \u2013 of learning how to run a business is just to get on and do it and throw yourself into it, and learn through having to survive in the jungle. And presumably have something people want? If you can come up with an idea that makes people's lives better, you've just got to get on and create it. Virgin Airlines came about when I was trying to get from Puerto Rico to the Virgin Islands, and the airline decided to cancel the flight because they didn't have enough passengers. I was in my 20s, and I went to the back of the airport, hired a plane, borrowed a blackboard and jokingly wrote, \"Virgin Airlines, $39 to the BVI\" and I filled up my first plane. Out of personal frustration comes the best businesses. We're building a spaceship company because Nasa weren't interested in you or I going to space, they were interested in putting a few extraordinary astronauts into space. So I was frustrated waiting for the chance to go into space, and it wasn't going to happen unless we just went ahead and tried to do it ourselves. Aha, space! So when are you going to get there? I'm careful with my words! I'm a born optimist and have said on a couple of occasions that I thought that it would be on such and such a date and it's got delayed. And it is rocket science. I'm confident it won't be very long now. And that's not the only event on the horizon. Early next year you're going to become a grandfather when your daughter Holly has twins? [Sam's wife] Isabella's also pregnant, so we're actually going to have three grandchildren all within two weeks of each other. Exciting times\u2026 We've been prodding them a bit over the last 18 months, and we've got our wish. Holly and Isabella are best friends; they've got houses next to each other in Oxford and also in the Caribbean. The three kids will very much grow up together, so it's going to be great. When you did the ice-bucket challenge, you nominated all 60,000 of your employees. That's a lot of people. Does it still take you aback, when you think of how small you started? I appreciate my life enormously. I do definitely use the words fortunate and lucky a lot, because I have been extraordinarily fortunate and extraordinarily lucky, particularly with my adventuring. I've definitely gone through nine lives. Are there things in your business life that you wish you'd done? Most of my time's spent on the not-for-profits, and we run them just like businesses; some are doing really well, like businesses, and some could be doing better. We've got the Elders, who are trying to tackle conflict resolution issues; we've got the Carbon War Room, working hard on climate change issues; we've got the Oceanic Elders, who are trying to protect the species in the oceans; the B Team, which is business leaders trying to work on the environment; and the Global Commission on Drug Policy, which is trying to get governments to try to change their approach to the war on drugs, and treat it as a health problem not a criminal problem. That's what interests me the most. We've got a wonderful team of people who are pushing Virgin into new areas, like cruise ships and inner-city hotels and other things. I'm interested in that but it's not my reason for being any more. I just find Virgin Unite, our foundation, and that work, just that much more interesting. A lot of the book is quite old-fashioned: you champion listening, taking notes, forgiving people if they make mistakes \u2013 things that seem quite at odds with modern, cut-throat business. I was lucky in my upbringing. If I ever gossiped or said anything negative about anybody, my parents would send me to the mirror. It taught me that looking in the mirror for five minutes at yourself is not very pleasant, and it taught me to look for the best in people, and to praise people rather than criticise people. We all love praise; and particularly if you're a leader, if you say something negative about somebody, the weight of that statement is going to be magnified many times just because you are the leader. Therefore it can be very damaging. And people know when they've done wrong, they don't need to be told they've done wrong. But they do need to be told when they've done right. You're very frank about things that haven't gone right. You seem to regard them as a necessary part of the process? I actually think, particularly in Britain, that people don't mind people who have tried things and failed and then try again until they succeed. In fact, if you always succeed first time, people might think you're a bit smug. The first time I crossed the Atlantic in a boat, the boat sank 100 miles from Britain, and we picked ourselves up and succeeded the next year. If we'd succeeded the first time round, people might have said, so what? And in business? When we took on Coca-Cola, we had a year in which we were really giving Coke and Pepsi a run for their money and we were very much the underdogs taking on the biggest giant in the world, and when they sent in their big tanks and to an extent crushed us, the public didn't think any the poorer of the Virgin brand for it. In fact, I would say the Virgin brand was enhanced by the battle. So you don't regret it? The key thing is never to do anything which discredits the brand, like ripping off the public or doing something which you'd feel uncomfortable reading about. If you're going to go down, go down fighting. The Virgin Way: How to Listen, Learn, Lead and Laugh is published by Virgin Books, \u00a320. Click here to buy it for \u00a316 with free UK p&amp;p",

We've got a wonderful team of people who are pushing Virgin into new areas, like cruise ships and inner-city hotels and other things. I'm interested in that but it's not my reason for being any more. I just find Virgin Unite, our foundation, and that work, just that much more interesting.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the book is quite old-fashioned: you champion listening, taking notes, forgiving people if they make mistakes \u2013 things that seem quite at odds with modern, cut-throat business.</strong><br>I was lucky in my upbringing. If I ever gossiped or said anything negative about anybody, my parents would send me to the mirror. It taught me that looking in the mirror for five minutes at yourself is not very pleasant, and it taught me to look for the best in people, and to praise people rather than criticise people. We all love praise; and particularly if you're a leader, if you say something negative about somebody, the weight of that statement is going to be magnified many times just because you are the leader. Therefore it can be very damaging. And people know when they've done wrong, they don't need to be told they've done wrong. But they do need to be told when they've done right.</p> <p><strong>You're very frank about things that haven't gone right. You seem to regard them as a necessary part of the process?</strong><br>I actually think, particularly in Britain, that people don't mind people who have tried things and failed and then try again until they succeed. In fact, if you always succeed first time, people might think you're a bit smug. The first time I crossed the Atlantic in a boat, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/16/world/powerboat-sinks-just-hours-from-breaking-atlantic-speed-record.html\" title=\"\">the boat sank</a> 100 miles from Britain, and we picked ourselves up and succeeded the next year. If we'd succeeded the first time round, people might have said, so what?</p> <p><strong>And in business?</strong><br>When we took on Coca-Cola, we had a year in which we were really giving Coke and Pepsi a run for their money and we were very much the underdogs taking on the biggest giant in the world, and when they sent in their big tanks and to an extent crushed us, the public <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-fails-virgin-companies-that-went-bust-2012-4?op=1\" title=\"\">didn't think any the poorer of the Virgin brand for it</a>. In fact, I would say the Virgin brand was enhanced by the battle.</p> <p><strong>So you don't regret it?</strong><br>The key thing is never to do anything which discredits the brand, like ripping off the public or doing something which you'd feel uncomfortable reading about. If you're going to go down, go down fighting.</p> <p><em>The Virgin Way: How to Listen, Learn, Lead and Laugh is published by Virgin Books, \u00a320</em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781905264902\" title=\"\"><em>.
