      "bodyText": "Tesco Bank has revealed that the \u201cunprecedented\u201d attack on its online accounts at the weekend resulted in the loss of \u00a32.5m. The banking arm of the supermarket chain also revised down the number of accounts from which money was removed from 20,000 to 9,000 and announced that banking services had been restored for all its customers. Tesco bank issued its update hours after Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told MPs that the incident was unprecedented in the UK and regarded as serious. Bailey told the Treasury select committee that \u201cthere are elements of this that look unprecedented and it is serious, clearly\u201d. Benny Higgins, the chief executive of Tesco Bank, apologised to customers. \u201cOur first priority throughout this incident has been protecting and looking after our customers, and we\u2019d again like to apologise for the worry and inconvenience this issue has caused,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now refunded all customer accounts affected by fraud and lifted the suspension of online debit transactions so that customers can use their accounts as normal. We\u2019d also like to reassure our customers that none of their personal data has been compromised.\u201d Tesco Bank said it was continuing to work closely with the authorities and regulators in their criminal investigation. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is one of a number of organisations scrutinising what has taken place at the supermarket chain\u2019s banking arm, which has more than 7 million customers. The National Cyber Security Centre, the new division of the surveillance agency GCHQ created last month, confirmed it was working with the NCA, which has launched a criminal inquiry. The NCSC said it was \u201cproviding direct assistance to the company at their request, including on-site assistance\u201d. \u201cIn the case of cyber-related incidents, it can, on certain occasions, take a significant period of time to understand the incident given the technical complexities involved. So the story will emerge over time. During this period it is vital that nothing is said publicly that could interfere with the criminal investigation,\u201d the NCSC said. \u201cGiven the investigation thus far and the evidence at hand, the National Cyber Security Centre is unaware of any wider threat to the UK banking sector connected with this incident.\u201d Bailey told MPs that the FCA was in close contact with Tesco and the bank had reassured the regulator that the customers whose money had been stolen would be reimbursed by the end of Tuesday. He said it was too early to know the exact cause, but said it appeared to be related to debit cards and that computer hackers were looking for weaknesses and \u201cpoints of entry\u201d into banks. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s [in] online banking, clearly appears to be on debit card side of online banking as far as we can tell. But it requires further urgent analysis ,\u201d said Bailey. He said he was confident that Tesco knew which customers were affected by the incident which began to unfold on Saturday night when the bank began texting customers about unusual activity from their accounts. A number of theories have circulated about the cause of the problem, including that it was caused by an internal security breach. Conservative MP Chris Philp, a member of the Treasury select committee, has raised the idea that it could have been the work of a foreign power. \u201cI think we can\u2019t rule out the possibility, at all, that this is state-sponsored,\u201d he told the BBC earlier this week. As the crisis was unfolding, Higgins had said the decision to suspend some banking activities was an attempt to protect customers from \u201conline criminal activity\u201d. He described the raid as \u201ca systematic, sophisticated attack\u201d. The NCSC said its role was to provide support to the investigation, work with the company concerned to manage the incident, investigate the root causes, and use any lessons learned to provide future guidance and policy on cybersecurity. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is also scrutinising the situation. It fined telecom company TalkTalk a record \u00a3400,000 in October for failing to stop the personal data of 157,000 customers being hacked. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said after the hearing that \u201cthe attack on Tesco\u2019s retail accounts is deeply troubling. Banks have a long way to go to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems\u201d. Another member of the committee, Steve Baker, said: \u201cthe vulnerability of Tesco Bank highlights the crucial importance of technical security to the financial system.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Wall Street closes higher and Mexican peso hits two-month high ahead of election results \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The financial markets are now closed, with investors having pushed shares higher in Europe and the US today on predictions that Hillary Clinton is poised to become America\u2019s next president. If they\u2019re mistaken, and the polls are wrong, there\u2019s going to be an almighty panic when everyone returns to their desks. Oxford Economics say we can expect \u201cmoderate gains\u201d if Clinton wins, and a \u201csignificant selloff\u201d if she doesn\u2019t. In short, markets have already spoken. Equities will be the asset class that will gain the most in case of a Clinton win and equally lose the most if Donald Trump moves into the White House. Bond markets will likely rally a bit if Trump wins. Certain emerging market asset classes would also move sharply. The Mexican peso would depreciate by between 10 and 22% in case of a Trump win and its sovereign spreads rise by between 80 and 120bps. Asian traders will be in the firing line first - their markets will open as the early results come in. So we\u2019ll launch a new liveblog tracking the markets in a few hours. I\u2019m off to nervously watch the results have a nap, and will be back early tomorrow. In the meantime, stay tuned to our main US elections liveblog. Goodnight! GW DING DING! The closing bell of Wall Street has been rung, as traders pushed shares higher for the second day running. In a \u201crisk-on mood\u201d, the Dow Jones industrial average has ended the day 72 points higher at 18,331, up 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 shows similar gains, as traders continue to bet on a Clinton victory tonight. And the Mexican peso is still trading at a two-month high, in a clear sign that traders expect Donald Trump to fail in his bid to reach the Oval Office. With fifteen minutes until trading ends in New York, the Dow is holding onto its gains. It\u2019s currently up 104 points, or 0.5%, as investors continue to anticipate a Clinton victory. Could they be too complacent? This has not been the most dramatic day in the stock markets, in truth. But it\u2019s all going to change in a few hours, once the results come in. Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co, says traders should buckle up. He told Bloomberg that: \u201cPut your seat belts on because this is going to be a bumpy ride... As the polls close later today, investors will be moving in a chaotic fashion to get ahead of the information flow.\u201d Over in Asia and Australia, traders are heading to their desks to watch the US election results unfold. IG\u2019s Chris Weston says the market still feel that Hillary Clinton has the edge. But memories of the Brexit referendum this summer haven\u2019t faded. He reminds us how events unfolded in June: As soon as Newcastle and Sunderland broke and the markets thought \u2018this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen\u2019, then the sky darkened and the markets caved in. This election isn\u2019t perhaps as binary as the UK referendum, but the way financial markets react today could be fairly similar in the sense that if Trump starts picking up the 50/50 states like Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and potentially some of the more certain Democrat battlegrounds then the market could be wild. Of course, we mustn\u2019t forget that there is a real battle for the Senate too and its 50/50 that the Republicans can hold onto the Upper Chamber. The Mexican peso is continuing to rally, and just hit a new two-month high: Almost all of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average are up today, but the gains are fairly muted. Consumer good group Procter and Gamble, fast food chain McDonald\u2019s and drinks group Coca-Cola are among the top risers: Less than one hour to go until trading closes on Wall Street, folks! And the New York stock market is still on track to finish higher tonight, as investors continue to predict a victory for Hillary Clinton. The rally has weakened a little, though, as investors show some caution about the election: Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, told Reuters that: \u201cWe were dramatically oversold. People were nervous Trump would win. \u201cThere\u2019s likely to be additional volatility in both directions between now and the end of the day.\u201d There were lots of nervous faces on Wall Street today, as traders kept one eye on the markets and the other one on the unfolding election. Here are some new pictures from the NYSE trading floor: Jeremy Cook of World First is also concerned about the effect that the VoteCastr realtime polling is having on the markets.... MXN = the Mexican peso Here\u2019s a neat graph showing how the US stock markets pushed higher today after VoteCastr said Hillary Clinton was leading in key states like Florida (even though we don\u2019t know how accurate its system actually is) Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Standard Life Investments, has just published a note about the implications of a Trump or Clinton victory. If Hillary takes the White House the Lawson says the status quo will be maintained. There\u2019ll be gridlock in Washington but the economy will maintain its slow but steady recovery, and the Federal Reserve could hike borrowing costs next month. He writes: \u201c In this \u2018status quo\u2019 outcome the combination of a healthier economy and reduced policy uncertainty should allow the Fed to recommence normalising interest rates at its December meeting, though the pace of rate increases will remain gradual.\u201d But if Trump wins... \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s election would introduce more uncertainty to the outlook for government policy, economic activity and the Fed, though those risks are not all to the downside. Initially, considerable market volatility is possible but it is actual policy decisions that will dictate the trajectory for the economy.\u201d Lawson is betting Trump\u2019s tough trade talk is largely hot air and if he cuts regulation on the finance, energy, telecoms and healthcare sectors, that could boost earnings. \u201cIf, on the other hand, a President Trump turns out to be serious about pursuing a much more protectionist policy agenda, the negative consequences for economic activity and corporate margins could easily offset the benefits of fiscal easing, preventing the Fed from tightening policy for some time.\u201d The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that the live voting data produced by VoteCastr is affecting stock prices. The WSJ\u2019s Paul Vigna explains: Wall Street traders are moving markets Tuesday based on a small group of websites that purport to offer real-time estimates of the election results. It\u2019s a first for traders, and for the news media. It has been a longstanding policy for mainstream media to not report on exit-polling data while polls are still open on Election Day, so as to avoid discouraging voters in western states from voting. Today, though, websites Vice and Slate plan on providing what they are characterizing as \u201clive\u201d voting projections throughout the day. To be sure, this is an experiment, and a controversial one. Regardless, the numbers are being put out there, and the market is noticing. With the Slate data showing Hillary Clinton leading in several key swing states, stocks have shot higher and bonds have fallen. Right now, VoteCastr are giving Clinton a four point lead in the crucial state of Florida, with 48% of support vs Trump\u2019s 44%. If the Democrats do claim Florida, it\u2019s hard to see a Republican victory. BUT (and it\u2019s a big one), realtime polling forecasts are still somewhat experimental. If early voters aren\u2019t representative of the electorate, then their projections could be skewed, for example. The Mexican peso has hit a two-month high today, which also suggests investors are predicting defeat for Donald Trump. The peso has rallied to 18.4195 against the US dollar, from 18.58/$1 last night, a gain of 1% or so. The peso has been very sensitive to Trump\u2019s electoral prospects, given his attacks on Mexicans and opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Another handy map showing when the polls close across America (add five hours for UK timing): The VIX \u2018fear\u2019 index has fallen by 4.5% today, in another sign that US investors are looking forward to the end of the election (and who can blame them?) The US stock market is creeping higher and higher in mid-afternoon trading, as investors cautiously anticipate that Hillary Clinton will celebrate victory tonight/tomorrow. The Dow Jones industrial average is now up 124 points, or 0.67%, at 18,382. The S&amp;P 500, the broader measure of the US stock market, has gained 0.5%. According to CNBC, the Dow is on track for its best two-day rally since the Brexit vote (it jumped by 371 points yesterday). The news that Guam voters have (symbolically) backed Clinton is one factor. Another factor is that analytics company VoteCastr says Clinton has the edge in some key swing stages, including Florida. But they also caution that it\u2019s early days, with plenty of votes still to be cast. A reason for caution about trying to predict the outcome of all this. Dominic Rushe writes: If you want to know why investors are nervous, look at Ohio. President Barack Obama won the state in both 2008 and 2012 but the polls are giving Trump the edge this year. It\u2019s one of a number of formerly Democrat leaning states where many blue collar voters feel left behind by Democrats. I was in Youngstown, Ohio last week talking to business leaders and they are deeply unhappy with Obama\u2019s legacy and worried that Clinton will just be more of the same. They blame trade policies for the collapse of industry; this used to be steel country. And Obama\u2019s green fuel initiatives for the collapse of the coal industry. Unemployment in Youngstown is 6%, a full percentage point above the national average, and rising. \u201cI\u2019d vote for Donald Duck before I\u2019d vote for her,\u201d Bill Strimbu, president of local trucking firm Nick Strimbu, told me. There is nervousness among investors as the US votes for its next president - the spectre of the Brexit vote and the complete inaccuracy of the polls there is still fresh in the memory - but European markets have managed to end in positive territory. The news from Guam, a positive sign for Hillary Clinton, has given US markets a lift and helped push Europe higher too. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 36.23 points or 0.53% at 6843.13 Germany\u2019s Dax was up 0.24% at 10,482.32 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.35% at 4476.89 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.48% to 16,817.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 8937.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.28% to 582.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 118 points or 0.65%. Here\u2019s a traders guide from Goldman Sachs to what is likely to happen when as the election results come in, courtesy MarketWatch: An early positive sign for Hillary Clinton - she has been backed in the tiny US island of Guam: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after drifting lower in early trading, is now up 72 points or 0.4%. More on how markets would react to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump winning today\u2019s election. John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said: A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval. For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u201cmajors\u201d, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now. In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000. And there would probably a broad-based rout in emerging markets. We suspect that US Treasuries would rally if Trump won, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.5% from around 1.8%. Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens. Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index: Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago. This is a sign that markets are confident that Hillary Clinton will win the US Presidential election tonight. It also suggests that should she lose the election and Trump win, there could be a major readjustment in financial markets, with Fed rate hike expectations falling sharply, a dramatic fall in US bond yields, and a decline in the US dollar. ...While we think a Clinton win is more likely, we are still gearing up for major financial market volatility if this proves not to be the case. Our clients also appear fairly confident about a Clinton win, however, this is reflected more in their foreign exchange positions than in their stock market positioning. Our clients are long the US dollar in the lead up to the election result, and 75% of clients trading dollar/yen are long. The fact that our clients are willing to short the yen at this stage, suggests that they do not see a shock election result from the US. Although we expect stock markets to stage a relief rally if we see Clinton win the White House later today, we believe that any stock market rally is likely to be short-lived, as markets instead focus on the risk of rising bond yields and a Fed rate hike in a few weeks, which could be bad news for stocks into the end of the year. Away from the US election for a moment, and more signs of a slowing UK economy. The National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach has estimated that UK output grew by 0.4% in the three months to the end of October, compared to growth of 0.5% in the three months to September. The think tank\u2019s Oriol Carreras said \u201cOur estimates suggest the economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the three months to October. Robust consumer spending growth continues to support the economy. Looking ahead, this contribution from consumers is expected to wane over the course of next year due to a substantial rise in the rate of inflation.\u201d Its latest quarterly forecast published earlier this month predicted GDP growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. US markets have lost a bit of steam since yesterday\u2019s euphoric rise on the news that the FBI would not re-open its inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. The Dow Jones ended yesterday up 2%, the S&amp;P 2.22% and the Nasdaq 2.37% as Clinton inched further ahead of Trump in the polls. As the bell rung on election day all the stock market indices are down a fraction of a percent. It\u2019s going to be a long, nail-biting day on Wall Street. Separately...a former advisor to two former Republican president tweets: Ding ding! The Wall Street opening bell is ringing, to start the election day trading session. The main indices are dipping around 0.2%in early trading. More in a moment.... You can get ready for tonight\u2019s election drama with the Guardian\u2019s \u2018survival guide\u2019,. It lays out when the key action should happen (complete with food and drink recommendations) We\u2019ve also laid out five potential scenarios for the election, including how Donald Trump could be swept to the White House. And we\u2019ve also analysed the latest opinion polls, including for crunch states such as Florida: Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders are acting like \u2018zombies today\u2019. He flags up that the \u2018one week volatility\u2019 in the US dollar-euro exchange rate has fallen sharply, since the FBI absolved Hillary Clinton of misconduct over her email server on Sunday night. However.... this could change very much tomorrow if we do not get the expected outcome which is always a chief concern. Aslam also predicts that Wall Street would plunge sharply if Trump beats Clinton. If Trump wins the election, we are expecting the S&amp;P500 to drop nearly 6.16 percent% and the picture will be even more vile for the emerging markets. Traders have roused themselves from their US election torpor to drive shares in Marks &amp; Spencer down by 4.3%. M&amp;S are languishing at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, as the City shows little enthusiasm for its latest turnaround plan. Steve Rowe the firm\u2019s new CEO, has torn up M&amp;S\u2019s international ambitions, and will shut 53 overseas stores from China to Lithuania. Rowe is also canning the clothing departments at 60 stores, as part of a new focus on food. Given the lack of news, City traders could easily have taken today off. And looking at the stock market right now, maybe they already have! The blue-chip Footsie index is barely changed this morning, and sterling has dipped a little. FTSE 100: up 0.4 points or 0.01% at 6807 The pound: down 0.15% at $1.2381 It could be the calm before the hurricane, though. Trading floors will be pretty lively places tomorrow morning, especially if there\u2019s a shock result. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, explains: \u201cThe danger here of a Brexit-like shock is overblown; voter behaviour for one-off referendums is not comparable to that of routine elections. \u201cHowever, if Trump is named the 45th President of the United States, then there\u2019s certain to be traders running across the floor throwing papers in the air. An initial overreaction, comparable to the UK Brexit experience to-date, is likely before markets settle again.\u201d Betfair has seen a late flurry of wagers on Hillary Clinton who currently has a 78% chance of victory at its site. Barry Orr, Spokesperson for Betfair, says that 80% of presidential bets yesterday were on the Democratic candidate. There\u2019s been around \u00a37m traded in the last 24 hours and with so much money coming into the market the odds are likely to continue to fluctuate throughout the day and into the night. \u201cWith nearly \u00a3118m now traded it\u2019s hard to see how it won\u2019t surpass the \u00a3127m betting market record set by Brexit in June. It\u2019s unlikely the market will trade anywhere near as much as Brexit did once polls were closed, which occasionally hit \u00a310k per second, but if it does we would easily be looking at more than \u00a3150m total traded on the market. Many City traders are preparing for a sleepless night, to help deal with a rush of action once polling results come in. ETX Capital, for example, will be fully staffed overnight, and expects to face plenty of volatility. Analyst Neil Wilson explains: Market action could hinge on one or two moments - for example the Florida result, key for Trump\u2019s chances for the presidency, is vitally important. This will create some big opportunities in some of the most exposed markets, particularly around some of the key currency pairs, stocks and gold. But a word of warning - there could be some wild gyrations in prices, making this potentially the most turbulent trading sessions since Brexit. Looking to the results, if key states start to lean towards Trump, we may see sizeable risk-off selling as investors flee to havens like the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and gold. US government bond yields could sink and gold would soar. Turbulence could come quickly \u2013 polls in the vital swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina close between 7pm and 8pm (EST), which is midnight-1am GMT. You can expect markets to be highly sensitive to the results from these states. If they are called for either side early we will have a very clear idea about where the markets are headed. And if that\u2019s not enough action, there\u2019s also the England vs India test match! New York traders are heading to Wall Street for what is bound to be an edgy session. After yesterday\u2019s 2.2% surge, the Dow is expected to dip ever-so slightly at the open. The markers may remain dull until late tonight, when the first exit polls arrive. The first polls close at 6pm ET, or 11pm in the UK, followed by a flurry over the next couple of hours: Asian financial markets will be open, of course, and could see the brunt of the early buying/selling as the winner becomes clear. Despite yesterday\u2019s relief rally, there\u2019s still plenty of anxiety in the markets. Barclays says that: Similar to the pre-Brexit landscape, the risk premium on European equities is already near all-time highs, suggesting that investors are somewhat braced for an adverse economic outcome. The team at RBC have produced some predictions for how the markets will react to tomorrow\u2019s election result: Equities S&amp;P 500 should rally 3\u20134% upon a Clinton win and decline 10\u201312% on a Trump victory. VIX [the volatility index] should decline to 13\u201314 upon a Clinton victory and rise to 20\u201325 if Trump prevails. EM Equities such as Mexico, China, and others should rally under a Clinton presidency and sell off sharply under a Trump win. Currencies and Commodities Mexican Peso has become a proxy for Trump\u2019s chances of success (moves inversely); would rally under a Clinton win. Yen and other safe harbor currencies would sell off on a Clinton victory and rally if Trump prevails. Gold would slide upon a Clinton win and rise on a Trump victory. Global Rates Safe Havens (Switzerland, Japan)yields would rise modestly on a Clinton victory and fall on a Trump win. LatAm and Emerging Market yields would fall upon a Clinton win and move sharply higher on a Trump victory. They also suggest that companies who provide services through Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act should rally if Clinton wins, as should firms exposed to global trade. But if Tump wins, expect gold producers to rally - along with pharmaceuticals companies (as Clinton has promised to tackle high drugs prices). Trade has been a recurring theme of the US election campaign, with Donald Trump arguing that US jobs have been \u2018stolen\u2019 by China. That has sparked fears of a new wave of protectionism under a Trump White House. But as these graphs from Deutsche Bank show, world trade may already have hit a turning point. Paul Donovan, UBS\u2019s global chief economist, sounds thoroughly disenchanted with the whole US election. In his daily note to clients, Donovan explains how politicians have a duty to combat the rise in prejudice against other groups (rather than fuelling it, ala Trump), and to explain how technological changes are changing the labo(u)r market. Donovan says: The two most unpopular candidates in US presidential history face each other in the elections today. Perhaps Her Britannic Majesty could be persuaded to resume control of the colonies? There is nothing constructive to be said today on the political noise, so perhaps we should look to the challenges ahead. Prejudice is one of the biggest threats to economic and social stability. Prejudice is on the rise. Declaring a group in society to be \u201csecond class\u201d undermines their economic contribution \u2013 increasingly so in today\u2019s changing world. Politicians must tackle prejudice head-on; it is morally and economically the right thing to do. Global trade patterns are changing. Lengthening supply chains and outsourcing are outdated as localized production reintroduces the imperial trade model, and technology means that trade in services is increasingly important. Politicians need to stop living the trade of the past, and embrace the trade of the future. Jobs do not disappear; jobs become different. Politicians must tell people that if a robot takes their job, they must find something else to do (and help them with that). Technology does not cause deflation \u2013 technology changes relative prices, not inflation. Politicians challenging central bank independence at a time of quantitative policy is very dangerous The sovereign bond market has also entered a state of temporary hibernation this morning, with the prices of benchmark US, UK and German debt virtually unchanged. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, says few people wants to take a big risk ahead of tonight\u2019s election results. \u201cWhen the numbers are as close as this and when we are seeing an antiestablishment movement that perhaps behaves differently to traditional election voters, then the outcome is more uncertain, After three hours of trading, Europe\u2019s stock markets are still gripped by nervous tension. The FTSE 100 is currently up just 9 points, or 0.13%, as the City awaits results from America overnight. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The reality has hit home today, after yesterday\u2019s carefree exuberance almost made us believe the election was already over. Today sees all other concerns thrown out the window as we hunker down for a historic night that will likely dictate market sentiment for the remainder of this year. A handy map for those of you trying to plan your election coverage overnight (all timings for the UK) A Trump victory could send the gold price surging to $1,400 per ounce, up from around $1,280 today, according to Citi analysts. They also predict that the Mexican peso would slump by 10%, to 20 peso to the $1, on fears of trade disruption. Several City firms are warning their clients to expect a heavy selloff on Wednesday, if Donald Trump beats Hillary Clinton. Andreas Johnson, economist at Nordic bank SEB, warns that the race could be closer than people expect. A Trump victory would be a clear risk off event that would trigger significant reactions and equity markets would take a sharp hit, at least in the short term. Emerging market assets look particularly vulnerable as safe haven flows would put pressure on assets perceived to risky. A clear Clinton victory should trigger a short-lived rally. \u201cHowever, the tightening of the polls indicate that the risk of a very close result is substantial. In this scenario the election result could be up for challenge and equity markets could suffer from a prolonged period of uncertainty. The 2000 presidential election resulted in a month of uncertainty and such a scenario could weigh heavily on stock markets.\u201d Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam Private Wealth (UK), says Trump could disrupt global trade and rock the financial system: \u201cA Clinton win would put America in safe(r) hands, but much will depend on the individuals she appoints around her. If she does as expected and plays it safe in her choices, the markets will breathe a sigh of relief. Trump on the other hand, would be a wildcard president and one that few investors would welcome. Trump\u2019s policies would likely see a destabilised financial system and damaged international trade relationships. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom though \u2013 Trump\u2019s pro-business taxation policies may mitigate some of the damage done to the wider economy. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver predicts that the US dollar could fall by up to 10% against the pound. A 5%-10% drop in the value of the US dollar is entirely possible should Trump be elected on November 8th. In terms of the bigger picture, the global implications of this swing in the market becomes a huge issue for countries with US dollar denominated debt in the emerging market amongst others. Should we be trading at 1.2500 just prior to the election, we could be seeing a trading range between 1.3100 and 1.3500 in the instant aftermath of the result. However...there\u2019s also a chance that panicky investors might pile into the US dollar in search of safety. If there\u2019s one thing that agitates Britons more than the US presidential election, it\u2019s a change to their favourite chocolate. And there\u2019s quite an outcry this morning, as people realise that Toblerone has cut the size of some of its bars, and hiked the prices too. This follows fall in the pound since the EU referendum, and frankly the redesign looks like an Photoshopped vision of post-Brexit gloom: Fans are venting their anger, with one claiming that it\u2019s one of the \u201cdumbest corporate decisions of all time\u201d..... Newsflash: British industrial output fell unexpectedly in September, but manufacturing managed a small revival. The Office for National Statistics reports that industrial production shrank by 0.4%, due to a decline in mining and quarrying, and oil and gas extraction. But encouragingly, manufacturing output rose by 0.6% during the month. Senior ONS statistician Kate Davies says we shouldn\u2019t draw any sweeping conclusions about Brexit, though: \u201cManufacturing was broadly flat across the third quarter while oil and gas were weak overall, with widespread summer maintenance shutdowns hampering production more than usual. \u201cThere are no obvious signs so far of either the weaker pound or post-referendum uncertainties affecting the output of UK factories, which continued broadly in line with recent trends.\u201d Today could be a pretty dull trading session in Europe, warns Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: The morning session could be a bit of a duff one this Tuesday, given that nothing concrete from the US in terms state-voting etc is going to be out until this evening. It is likely going to be one of those days where the seismic nature of an event renders the market inert for around 24 hours. The pound has risen 0.3% against the US dollar this morning, to $1.2424, recovering some of yesterday\u2019s selloff. But generally the currency markets are pretty calm. BNY Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor says: \u201cThe markets are in lockdown mode at the moment. There\u2019s a little tentativeness ahead of the election even though polls are giving Clinton the lead.\u201d European stock markets are as flat as an American pancake in early trading (but nowhere near as delicious). The FTSE 100 index has crept up just 3 points, having jumped by 113 points yesterday. The German and French markets are equally dull, while the Italian FTSE MIB has dipped a little. Yesterday\u2019s rally was driven by the news that the FBI had cleared Hillary Clinton over her email server, following a second probe. Now, investors are wondering if the polling are right - they give the Democratic nominee a three point lead nationally. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says that memories of the British EU referendum are still fresh: With the finishing line now in sight financial markets are reacting as if a Clinton win is a done deal, in eerie echoes of the lead-up to the June UK Brexit vote, as markets priced in the preservation of some form of status quo, and we all know how that ended. Financial traders are pretty confident that Hillary Clinton will win, according to spread-betting firm IG\u2019s presidential barometer. It shows that Clinton now has an 81% chance of success, based on IG clients\u2019 trades: City experts are predicting a small rally if Clinton wins the presidency, and a whopping selloff if Trump triumphs. Today isn\u2019t just about the presidential race, of course. City investors are also watching Congressional elections, to see who wins control of Capitol Hill. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the Republicans will retain their grip on the lower house of Congress. In terms of the Senate, Republicans are currently slightly edging out Democrats 51-49 in \u201cno toss-ups\u201d polling. But while the Presidency and Senate are seemingly too close to call, the House looks very likely to remain decidedly in Republican control\u2014they are ahead 224 to the Democrats\u2019 190, not including the 21 toss-ups. Thus, Republicans can achieve a majority of 218 seats without winning any of the toss-ups. That would potentially make it rather harder for Hillary Clinton to push policies through, should she beat Donald Trump tonight. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s only one event on everyone\u2019s mind today, of course, the US presidential elections. And global stock markets looks decidedly nervous this morning as America heads to the polls after one of the more vicious and occasionally unedifying campaigns. Last night, the US stock market posted its best one-day jump since March, with the Dow Jones index rising by 2%. But investors appears to be hunkering down today as they wait to see whether the polls are right, and Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump to the White House. European stock markets are looking becalmed right now, after a lacklustre day in Asia which saw Japan\u2019s Nikkei dip 5 points, or 0.03%. Investors can remember the shock of 24th June, when predictions that Britain would vote to remain in the EU came badly unstuck. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets sums up the situation: Asian markets have struggled for traction overnight, unable to build on Monday\u2019s gains, with momentum fading. Memories of a surprise Brexit result are too fresh to ignore at this late stage and polls so tight. Clinton has enjoyed an early success, claiming the (tiny) constituency of Dixville Notch by four votes to two! But that won\u2019t be enough -- the election will be decided in key battlegrounds like Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire and Ohio. If Trump performs surprisingly well in those states, things could get very \u2018interesting\u2019. We\u2019re already liveblogging all the action from the US, here. Also coming up today...... High street retailer Marks &amp; Spencer has announced a store closure programme as CEO Steve Rowe tries to breath new life into the chain. A looooong-awaited report into Royal Bank of Scotland has shown how the bank mistreated some small customers, following allegations that some were deliberately driven into bankrupcy. RBS is paying \u00a3400m compensation. European finance ministers are holding an Ecofin meeting in Brussels this morning. They\u2019ll be discussing plans to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance. Brexit isn\u2019t on the agenda, but I guess it\u2019ll be discussed in some quiet corners And on the economic front, we\u2019re getting new industrial production figures from Germany and the UK this morning. And at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank will estimate how quickly the UK economy grew in the August-to-October quarter.",

John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval.</p> <p>For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u201cmajors\u201d, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now.</p> <p>In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000. And there would probably a broad-based rout in emerging markets.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We suspect that US Treasuries would rally if Trump won, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.5% from around 1.8%. Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821ee7ae4b029b92ca46a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:31:34.879Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland did not tip healthy small businesses into default and did not seek to profit from their collapse. Nor did it request personal injections of cash from owners when it had already decided a business was doomed, says the Financial Conduct Authority. But it did sometimes charge fees it didn\u2019t explain properly, and there was a failure to support small businesses \u201cin a manner consistent with good turnaround practice\u201d. Thus the bank will pay compensation to address \u201cpoor outcomes\u201d at a cost of about \u00a3400m. Is everybody happy now? Of course not. The period under the microscope is 2008-13, so the process of inspection has been painfully slow. The perception also remains that an apology, not to mention a few quid in redress, has had to be dragged out of RBS. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said on Tuesday the bank had \u201cacknowledged mistakes for some time\u201d, but the latest admission of shortcomings was fuller and franker than any heard previously. Indeed, back in 2014, when an internally commissioned report by the law firm Clifford Chance found no evidence that RBS set out to defraud its small business customers, the bank\u2019s tone verged on jubilant. Tuesday\u2019s response was necessarily humbler. RBS is still innocent on the explosive central charge of wrecking healthy businesses but the FCA\u2019s qualification was significant. Of the potentially viable business customers transferred into the controversial unit called the global restructuring group (GRG), \u201cmost of them experienced some form of inappropriate action by RBS\u201d, said the regulator. Not pretty. Incompetence at RBS \u2013 if that\u2019s what the regulator has decided \u2013 would be understandable. In 2008, the bank was bust and new management, after the state-funded bailout, was fighting fires on many fronts. It would not be a surprise if overwhelmed staff at GRG, facing a steep rise in defaults, took insufficient care with small businesses. Yet the process of ensuring redress has been uncertain and plodding. An adviser to Sir Vince Cable, when business secretary in the coalition government, first made allegations of shabby behaviour in 2013. The subsequent FCA inquiry has run a year behind schedule (and still hasn\u2019t been published in full). Now fees charged as long ago as 2008 will be returned in 2017 and complainants who still feel aggrieved can make their pleas to a retired high court judge, Sir William Blackburne. A just outcome, even when it arrives late, is better than an unjust one. But one sympathises with the small businesses. They should not have had to shout so loudly, or for so long, to be heard. The system has served them poorly. Magic and sparkle dim at M&amp;S When he announced his first strategic update in May, Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new chief executive, Steve Rowe, knocked 10% off the share price. After his second on Tuesday, which sought to answer the questions he raised in the spring, the fall was 5%. One can understand why investors are worried. Over the course of two outings in the City, Rowe has made a strong case that M&amp;S is in need of radical overhaul. But it\u2019s hard to conclude that his plan for action is as bold as his words. Shutting 53 wholly owned foreign stores sounds dramatic, of course. But the combined losses in the 10 affected countries were \u00a345m on turnover of \u00a3171m last year. If you are losing \u00a31 for every \u00a34 of revenue and see few opportunities for expansion, retreat is merely an act of common sense, even when the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es store in Paris was a pet project of your predecessor. Concentrating on franchise stores, where most of the risks sit with a franchisee with local knowledge, is more logical. The charge of timidity really concerns the UK. M&amp;S says 10% of floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close. Is that really enough? The clothing market is shifting online at pace and M&amp;S is seeking smaller (but sharper) ranges. A 10% slimming might be considered fearless if it were happening overnight but this is a five-year overhaul costing \u00a3350m, half of it in cash. Come 2021, it may be time to do it all over again. The supposed compensations for investors are twofold: M&amp;S is still generating plenty of cash and sees 200 pockets of the country that are deprived of the delights of Simply Food. The former is definitely a blessing, but less of the cash may find its way to investors: in the second-half of the financial year, shareholders will get an ordinary dividend but not a special on top. As for 200 more Simply Foods, the format is a proven winner but a 0.9% decline in like-for-like sales in the first half may be the first hint top-of-the-range food is becoming harder to shift. All in all, it\u2019s hard to find reasons to be cheerful. Underlying profits fell 18.6% to \u00a3231m in the first half and the next five years for M&amp;S look like hard graft for uncertain reward.",

      "body": "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland did not tip healthy small businesses into default and did not seek to profit from their collapse. Nor did it request personal injections of cash from owners when it had already decided a business was doomed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/rbs-facing-400m-bill-to-compensate-small-business-customers\">says the Financial Conduct Authority</a>. But it did sometimes charge fees it didn\u2019t explain properly, and there was a failure to support small businesses \u201cin a manner consistent with good turnaround practice\u201d. Thus the bank will pay compensation to address \u201cpoor outcomes\u201d at a cost of about \u00a3400m. Is everybody happy now?</p> <p>Of course not. The period under the microscope is 2008-13, so the process of inspection has been painfully slow. The perception also remains that an apology, not to mention a few quid in redress, has had to be dragged out of RBS.</p> <p>The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said on Tuesday the bank had \u201cacknowledged mistakes for some time\u201d, but the latest admission of shortcomings was fuller and franker than any heard previously.</p> <p>Indeed, back in 2014, when an internally commissioned report by the law firm Clifford Chance found no evidence that RBS set out to defraud its small business customers, the bank\u2019s tone verged on jubilant. Tuesday\u2019s response was necessarily humbler. RBS is still innocent on the explosive central charge of wrecking healthy businesses but the FCA\u2019s qualification was significant. Of the potentially viable business customers transferred into the controversial unit called the global restructuring group (GRG), \u201cmost of them experienced some form of inappropriate action by RBS\u201d, said the regulator. Not pretty.</p> <p>Incompetence at RBS \u2013 if that\u2019s what the regulator has decided \u2013 would be understandable. In 2008, the bank was bust and new management, after the state-funded bailout, was fighting fires on many fronts. It would not be a surprise if overwhelmed staff at GRG, facing a steep rise in defaults, took insufficient care with small businesses.</p> <p>Yet the process of ensuring redress has been uncertain and plodding. An adviser to Sir Vince Cable, when business secretary in the coalition government, first made allegations of shabby behaviour in 2013. The subsequent FCA inquiry has run a year behind schedule (and still hasn\u2019t been published in full). Now fees charged as long ago as 2008 will be returned in 2017 and complainants who still feel aggrieved can make their pleas to a retired high court judge, Sir William Blackburne.</p> <p>A just outcome, even when it arrives late, is better than an unjust one. But one sympathises with the small businesses. They should not have had to shout so loudly, or for so long, to be heard. The system has served them poorly.</p> <h2>Magic and sparkle dim at M&amp;S</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"883bd8110d4c1dff227b50c5c3e57cf13c254fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883bd8110d4c1dff227b50c5c3e57cf13c254fa6/0_165_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks & Spencer logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">M&amp;S says 10% of floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close. Is that enough?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he announced his first strategic update in May, Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new chief executive, Steve Rowe, knocked 10% off the share price. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul\">his second on Tuesday</a>, which sought to answer the questions he raised in the spring, the fall was 5%. One can understand why investors are worried. Over the course of two outings in the City, Rowe has made a strong case that M&amp;S is in need of radical overhaul. But it\u2019s hard to conclude that his plan for action is as bold as his words.</p> <p>Shutting 53 wholly owned foreign stores sounds dramatic, of course. But the combined losses in the 10 affected countries were \u00a345m on turnover of \u00a3171m last year. If you are losing \u00a31 for every \u00a34 of revenue and see few opportunities for expansion, retreat is merely an act of common sense, even when the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es store in Paris was a pet project of your predecessor. Concentrating on franchise stores, where most of the risks sit with a franchisee with local knowledge, is more logical.</p> <p>The charge of timidity really concerns the UK. M&amp;S says 10% of floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close. Is that really enough? The clothing market is shifting online at pace and M&amp;S is seeking smaller (but sharper) ranges. A 10% slimming might be considered fearless if it were happening overnight but this is a five-year overhaul costing \u00a3350m, half of it in cash. Come 2021, it may be time to do it all over again.</p> <p>The supposed compensations for investors are twofold: M&amp;S is still generating plenty of cash and sees 200 pockets of the country that are deprived of the delights of Simply Food. The former is definitely a blessing, but less of the cash may find its way to investors: in the second-half of the financial year, shareholders will get an ordinary dividend but not a special on top. As for 200 more Simply Foods, the format is a proven winner but a 0.9% decline in like-for-like sales in the first half may be the first hint top-of-the-range food is becoming harder to shift.</p> <p>All in all, it\u2019s hard to find reasons to be cheerful. Underlying profits fell 18.6% to \u00a3231m in the first half and the next five years for M&amp;S look like hard graft for uncertain reward.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top companies should ensure that more women make it on to executive committees as well as into boardrooms, a government-backed review has recommended. Companies listed on the FTSE 100 should have at least a third of their executive pipeline positions filled by women by 2020, the independent review led by Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, and Dame Helen Alexander, chair of UBM, concluded. The 33% target is voluntary. The aim is to ensure that there is a broader focus so that more women are employed in other senior roles below board level. At present, a quarter of people either sitting on FTSE 100 executive committees or reporting directly to them are women. Hampton and Alexander were appointed in February to look at the issue of developing senior female talent by then business secretary, Sajid Javid. It followed the work of Lord Davies, who recommended in 2011 that FTSE 100 companies should double the proportion of women in boardrooms \u2013 including non-executive roles \u2013 to 25% by 2015. The target was exceeded, with women accounting for 26.1% of FTSE 100 boards last year. In July, Hampton and Alexander said they supported the Davies review\u2019s subsequent recommendation that FTSE 350 boards should be a third female by the end of 2020. Sir Philip Hampton and Dame Helen Alexander said in a joint statement: \u201cWe are launching the next stage in the journey where FSTE 100 companies will aim for a third of their all-important leadership roles to be occupied by women by the end of 2020. \u201cWe don\u2019t underestimate the challenge the new voluntary target presents for many FTSE companies. However, we are encouraged by the breadth of experienced women ready and willing to step up, the significant efforts under way in many companies on this agenda, and the ability of British business to work together to bring about change when it is needed.\u201d Lady Barbara Judge, the chair of the Institute of Directors and member of the advisory panel for the review, said: \u201cWe have long argued that focusing just on boards fails to build a sustainable pipeline of women leaders. Having a third of executive committees made up by women by 2020 is a very stretching target, and there will have to be sustained political and public pressure for this to be achieved.\u201d Justine Greening, the minister for women and equalities, said bridging the UK gender gap in work could add \u00a3150bn to the UK\u2019s annual GDP in 2025. Melanie Richards, the vice-chair and a partner in KPMG, said that although UK companies had made progress in promoting more women into boardrooms, there had been little improvement at the executive level. \u201cIf we are to continue to make progress towards achieving greater gender balance, it is critical that all levels of the pipeline are addressed,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is shutting 30 UK stores and converting 45 more into food-only shops as part of a major business overhaul that will slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its ailing clothing ranges. The retailer\u2019s new chief executive, Steve Rowe, said more than 100 UK stores were in the firing line as part of a wider shakeup designed to end a long-running slump in clothing sales and devote more space to its more successful food business. He outlined plans to open 200 new Simply Food outlets. M&amp;S refused to identify which 30 \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homewares and food \u2013 are to close or identify the 45 outlets that will be converted into food stores. The chain has 304 full-line stores and the closures and conversions will take five years to complete. The retailer is also looking to relocate underperforming stores. Overall, the changes will mean a reduction of 10% in the floorspace devoted to racks of skirts, jumpers and trousers, with the plan expected to cost \u00a3150m over three years. The turnaround plan outlined by Rowe also includes the closure of 53 loss-making overseas stores in 10 countries. They include 10 stores in China, seven in France and others in Belgium and Hungary, resulting in 2,100 job losses. Only company-owned stores in Ireland, Hong Kong and the Czech Republic will be spared. The embattled retailer intends to put clothing and food on an equal footing with same amount of selling space devoted to both sides of the business. Currently two-thirds of its floor space is given over to racks of clothing and homewares. Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London and took over as chief executive six months ago, insisted the decision to close stores and reduce the space given over to clothing was not an admission of defeat. \u201cThis is not about cutting jobs, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019ve got the right estate for future shopping habits,\u201d he said. Earlier this year, he announced 500 job cuts at the group\u2019s head office in London and a plan to shift another 400 jobs out of the capital. The M&amp;S veteran is seeking to revive the fortunes of the 132-year-old retailer which has seen profits go backwards in recent years. His biggest job is stopping the rot in its clothing business which has now in its fifth consecutive year of falling sales. M&amp;S believes the growth of online fashion shopping means it can devote more store space to food without losing sales. About 17% of M&amp;S\u2019s clothing sales are currently made online, a figure that is expected to grow. Rowe is also axing the chain\u2019s Indigo, Collezione and North Coast labels to focus on brands that are \u201cmost relevant to our customers\u201d including Autograph, Per Una and Blue Harbour. \u201cThese are tough decisions, but vital to building a future M&amp;S that is simpler, more relevant, multichannel and focused on delivering sustainable returns,\u201d said Rowe. The plan was not well received by investors; shares finished the day as the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 \u2013 down more than 5% as analysts complained that Rowe\u2019s plan to revive M&amp;S was not radical enough. \u201cBeing such a large company, it is going to take some time to turn M&amp;S round even if all goes according to plan,\u201d said Haitong analyst Tony Shiret. \u201cWe think that it should have gone further in its UK clothing space closure.\u201d M&amp;S\u2019s decision to retreat from the high street will be a blow for some towns, where it is a main destination store, especially following the demise of BHS. But as more purchases are made online, stores in smaller or less attractive town centres and shopping centres are finding life difficult. \u201cThe closure of the local M&amp;S will have a psychological effect and feel like another nail in the coffin for that town\u2019s high street,\u201d said Local Data Company analyst Matthew Hopkinson. Hopkinson points to places such as Swindon and Stockton-on-Tees where shoppers have been drawn away from the high street by out-of-town retail parks. M&amp;S has been battered by low-cost rivals such as H&amp;M, Zara and Primark and shoppers are increasingly spending their spare cash on leisure activities, rather than buying new clothes. The turnaround plan was unveiled as the retailer reported a 19% fall in underlying profits to \u00a3231m in the six months to 1 October. To win back shoppers, Rowe has already cut clothing prices and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers \u2013 fiftysomething women he has dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. He said changes he had already made in the clothing business were going down well. \u201cThe initial feedback we\u2019ve had from customers has been good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved the fit on many garments and, for the first time in a number of years, we\u2019ve grown full-price market share.\u201d Rowe has promised a less slavish pursuit of catwalk trends after being criticised for failing to meet the needs of its middle-aged customer base. His new strategy is an about turn from that of his predecessor Marc Bolland, who believed the retailer could be a global brand and reopened stores in France after a decade-long absence. \u201cWe have made mistakes in the past and we are taking action to correct some of these,\u201d said Rowe, who revealed M&amp;S would continue to expand overseas using a franchise model. The mistakes are expensive ones \u2013 it will cost up to \u00a3200m to shut loss-making stores in European markets such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as outposts in China.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has apologised to small business customers as it revealed a \u00a3400m bill to compensate them for poor treatment in the wake of the banking crisis. After at least three years of complaining of bad service from the bailed-out bank, small businesses will receive refunds of the fees they were charged and will be allowed to make fresh complaints about their treatment between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: \u201cWe have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made. Some of our customers went through what was a traumatic and painful experience as a result of the crisis. I am very sorry that we did not provide the level of service and understanding we should have done.\u201d A review is under way into whether bonuses should be withheld from former and current staff involved in the bank\u2019s now now-defunct global restructuring group (GRG), which is at the heart of the complaints. The allegations first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Some 12,000 small businesses were forced into GRG but only 4,000 will automatically receive a refund of \u201ccomplex\u201d fee. In total, some 8,000 were potentially viable when they entered GRG, while 4,000 were facing insolvency. Confirmation of the compensation plans \u2013 details of which began to emerge on Monday \u2013 immediately sparked concerns that the sum being aside by the 73% taxpayer-owned bank was inadequate. \u201cGiven the damage to the lives of RBS\u2019s customers, \u00a3400m is wholly inadequate and is a cynical attempt to evade accounting fully for the consequences of RBS GRG\u2019s action. We are disgusted by this proposal,\u201d said David Stewart, of the RBS GRG Business Action Group, which has more than 500 members demanding \u00a32bn in compensation. Another group, RGL Management, is pressing on with a legal claim of at least \u00a31bn. \u201cThe FCA report appears to be utter whitewash,\u201d said Stuart McCredie, who ran a business that entered GRG. Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, said the bill was \u201cnot as big as feared and may also take some heat out of the situation\u201d. The bank\u2019s shares were up 0.4% at 187.3p on Tuesday. The RBS announcement was timed to coincide with an appearance by Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, at the Treasury select committee which has been pressuring the regulator to publish a much-delayed report into GRG. In an update, the FCA said \u201cisolated examples of poor practice were identified\u201d, at RBS but dismissed the most damning allegations that the bank deliberately drove small business to the brink to make a profit. But it also concluded that there was evidence of systemically poor treatment of small business customers. Bailey signalled that further delays to the report \u2013 commissioned from legal experts Promontory and Mazars \u2013 were likely as it would have to undergo Maxwellisation, where anyone facing criticism is allowed to comment, before publication. The FCA also cautioned that the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated. \u201cTherefore, the FCA\u2019s powers are limited in this area,\u201d the FCA said. However, it does not necessarily indicate the bank will escape financial sanction as the regulator said it was \u201ccurrently assessing what further work may be needed given the findings in the report\u201d. McEwan has repeatedly defended the bank against claims that it deliberately tried to profit from small business customers and RBS repeated on Tuesday that it had lost more than \u00a32bn in lending to small businesses. He said the situation could not be tackled until now \u2013 even though a report commissioned from Clifford Chance in 2014 had highlighted the issues of poorly structured fees \u2013 because the FCA review had been continuing. Promontory examined 207 cases and covered a six-year period, analysing 323 gigabytes of data \u2013 approximately 1.5m pages and 270,000 emails.",

But it also concluded that there was evidence of systemically poor treatment of small business customers.</p> <p>Bailey signalled that further delays to the report \u2013 commissioned from legal experts Promontory and Mazars \u2013 were likely as it would have to undergo Maxwellisation, where anyone facing criticism is allowed to comment, before publication. </p> <p>The FCA also cautioned that the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated. \u201cTherefore, the FCA\u2019s powers are limited in this area,\u201d the FCA said. However, it does not necessarily indicate the bank will escape financial sanction as the regulator said it was \u201ccurrently assessing what further work may be needed given the findings in the report\u201d.</p> <p>McEwan has repeatedly defended the bank against claims that it deliberately tried to profit from small business customers and RBS repeated on Tuesday that it had lost more than \u00a32bn in lending to small businesses.<br></p> <p>He said the situation could not be tackled until now \u2013 even though a report commissioned from Clifford Chance in 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/17/rbs-no-evidence-fraudulent-activity-report\">had highlighted the issues of poorly structured fees</a> \u2013 because the FCA review had been continuing.</p> <p>Promontory examined 207 cases and covered a six-year period, analysing 323 gigabytes of data \u2013 approximately 1.5m pages and 270,000 emails.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was with a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu on Tuesday that Marks &amp; Spencer staff and customers at the flagship Champs Elys\u00e9es store learned it was to close \u2013 again. For 15 years, the British company has not known whether it is coming or going in Europe. Its French stores \u2013 including its biggest site on the world famous Parisian shopping street \u2013 were closed in 2001, then reopened in 2011. In subsequent years, further French stores opened. This week, however, M&amp;S revealed it was closing a total of 100 stores worldwide, including seven in France, all in the Paris area, throwing more than 517 French workers out of jobs. In the drizzle outside the Champs Elys\u00e9es store, most shoppers clutching M&amp;S bags were tourists visiting Paris, many of them from China and Japan. \u201cI like the clothes, but I often go to London and can buy them there,\u201d said Andr\u00e9, a 55-year-old French businessman. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity, but I\u2019d have been much more upset if they were closing all the food stores.\u201d Christine, a regular M&amp;S shopper, told journalists gathered outside the store: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. I come here often. It sells interesting things, good clothes at a reasonable price. As for the food: I find things you don\u2019t get elsewhere.\u201d The news came just three years after M&amp;S said France was the cornerstone of the company\u2019s international expansion and just a day after a leading French food website, Le Fooding, named M&amp;S one of the best places in the French capital to find takeaway food. The shops that are closing are entirely owned by M&amp;S. Five sell food and clothes, two are entirely food outlets. A further 11 stores, operated as franchises or joint ventures selling food, are to remain open. M&amp;S insisted the closures would take place in the next 12 to 18 months after consultation with staff unions and representatives. A statement said the targeted stores had made \u00a319m of losses in 2015-16. Among M&amp;S workers, now facing an uncertain future, there was anger and tears. Yasin Leguet, representative of the Seci-Unsa union at M&amp;S in France, said staff at the Champs-Elys\u00e9es store had feared it would close after the firm\u2019s regional director\u2019s fortnightly visits stopped and stock deliveries dwindled. A union representative at another condemned store at Levallois-Perret, east of Paris, told journalists: \u201cIt\u2019s a complete shock. I\u2019ve been working here since M&amp;S returned in 2011. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to tell my colleagues, when I feel so bad myself.\u201d M&amp;S\u2019s remarkable volte-face comes just three years after John Herre, then international director at the retailer, came to France for the opening of a store in the 15th arrondissement and declared he was \u201creally satisfied\u201d with turnover at the Champs-Elys\u00e9es store. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of all our shops including those in the United Kingdom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very positive for us and give us confidence. It\u2019s a priority market for us.\u201d On Tuesday, it was clear the firm\u2019s priorities lay elsewhere.",

    "webTitle": "Natural gas lobby plans campaign to convince Australians of 'long-term necessity'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A coalition of natural gas lobby groups are planning a coordinated campaign to convince Australians gas is \u201ca long-term necessity\u201d, top industry lobbyists have revealed. They also disclosed plans to undermine government attempts to regulate sections of the industry that have been identified by the competition watchdog for price gouging by offering the federal environment minister \u201csomething he can announce\u201d \u2013 but which would not amount to regulation. The president of the Australian Pipeline and Gas Association, Shaun Reardon, told a meeting of the gas industry in Perth last month that the industry had agreed on a message to sell to the public, the industry website Energy News Bulletin reported. \u201cOur objective is to have gas acknowledged as a long-term necessity by policymakers and the public,\u201d Reardon was reported as saying. The chief executive of gas association, Cheryl Cartwright, told Guardian Australia that represenatatives of each of the industry lobby groups had \u201cagreed to a united view regarding gas\u201d. Cartwright said the industry needed to \u201cimprove the public perception of natural gas\u201d. \u201cBasically, we represent the gas industry,\u201d she said. \u201cNatural gas is an important part of the energy mix as we encourage Australia to reduce carbon emissions. It\u2019s cleaner burning than coal, and is an appropriate back-up fuel for renewable energy sources.\u201d A report released last month found unmeasured \u201cfugitive emissions\u201d from the gas industry were likely to be as big as those emitted by the entire transport sector. Since fugitive emissions are rarely measured, they are not properly accounted for, and could jeopardise any attempt to meet emissions reduction pledges made in Paris. If fugitive emissions from the coal seam gas industry in Australia were anywhere near what they are in the US, coal seam gas would be worse for the climate than coal. Cartwright said the industry should fight attempts to regulate gas pipelines. In April the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found evidence that \u201ca large number of pipeline operators have been engaging in monopoly pricing\u201d. The ACCC pointed out that other countries, such as New Zealand and the US, imposed much stronger regulation. Since pipelines are natural monopolies, they are able to dictate prices. \u201cIt is well recognised in these jurisdictions that pipelines can wield substantial market power even where producers and users have a number of transportation options,\u201d the ACCC said. Cartwright told the conference the federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, had told her he wanted to regulate gas pipelines. \u201cMinister Frydenberg actually said to me, quote, \u2018I know supply needs to be addressed but we\u2019re going to fix pipelines first,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Cartwright was reported saying in Energy News Bulletin. \u201cBasically, they are convinced there is something wrong and they want to be able to make an announcement,\u201d Cartwright reportedly said. Cartwright told the gas industry meeting they needed to give Frydenberg \u201csomething to announce\u201d. \u201cSo this is what we are up against,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only do we need to fight back, we have to do it in a way that gives them something to announce and actually I think we can do it.\u201d Cartwright told Guardian Australia she understood that looked like an attempt to give the minister a meaningless announcement but that was not the case. She said she was trying to explain to members of the industry \u201cwho know nothing about politics \u2026 explaining to them that we can\u2019t just fight back and say everything is working without demonstrating that we are actually doing something to tackle the perception of there being a problem\u201d. \u201cWe are taking action \u2013 not necessarily the action demanded by the regulator, but something that\u2019ll actually work \u2013 and we need to explain that to the ministers so they can be part of the announcements when it\u2019s ready to launch.\u201d Cartwright said the plan was to improve transparency of the gas pipeline market through reforms in \u201ccapacity trading\u201d, where spare capacity in the pipelines is traded in a transparent process. She said many members of the industry had fought that move \u201cbecause it will be expensive\u201d. Responding to the industy lobbyists\u2019 comments, Frydenberg told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe ACCC in a recent report raised its concerns with the current regulatory test as it applies to gas pipelines. \u201cThat is why the [Council of Australian Governments] energy council has asked Dr Michael Vertigan, in consultation with stakeholders and working with the ACCC findings, to draw together what we need to do with the coverage criteria under the national gas law to address this issue. \u201cMinisters will consider Dr Vertigan\u2019s report at the next Coag energy council meeting.\u201d The Coag energy council announced in August that it had agreed to ban secret pricing contracts in the gas industry. Frydenberg described the change as \u201cthe most significant reforms to the domestic gas market in two decades\u201d. It did not propose regulating prices, which other commentators have suggested, but which the gas industry strongly opposes. \u201cOf course, if you want to phase out oil and gas completely, you might like the idea of increasing economic regulation, which would stymie investment,\u201d Cartwright told Guardian Australia. Bruce Robertson, an analyst at the pro-renewable Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the industry was overdue for regulation. \u201cThe pipeline companies are gouging the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know it and are fearful that sensible regulation as to price and capacity will come in. Essentially gas transmission pipelines are natural monopolies and Australia is unique in the western world at not regulating them. \u201cThe US has far better disclosure rules and still heavily regulates them. In Australia we need both far more comprehensive disclosure on a pipeline by pipeline basis and also strong regulation. Regulation of monopolies is not anti market. No market exists and hence the need for regulation.\u201d",

Since pipelines are natural monopolies, they are able to dictate prices.</p> <p>\u201cIt is well recognised in these jurisdictions that pipelines can wield substantial market power even where producers and users have a number of transportation options,\u201d the ACCC said.</p> <p>Cartwright told the conference the federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, had told her he wanted to regulate gas pipelines.</p> <p>\u201cMinister Frydenberg actually said to me, quote, \u2018I know supply needs to be addressed but we\u2019re going to fix pipelines first,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Cartwright was reported saying in <a href=\"http://www.energynewsbulletin.net/storyview.asp?storyID=826967733&amp;feature=Pipelines&amp;sectionsource=f2874525&amp;aspdsc=yes\">Energy News Bulletin</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, they are convinced there is something wrong and they want to be able to make an announcement,\u201d Cartwright reportedly said.</p> <p>Cartwright told the gas industry meeting they needed to give Frydenberg \u201csomething to announce\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is what we are up against,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only do we need to fight back, we have to do it in a way that gives them something to announce and actually I think we can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Cartwright told Guardian Australia she understood that looked like an attempt to give the minister a meaningless announcement but that was not the case.</p> <p>She said she was trying to explain to members of the industry \u201cwho know nothing about politics \u2026 explaining to them that we can\u2019t just fight back and say everything is working without demonstrating that we are actually doing something to tackle the perception of there being a problem\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking action \u2013 not necessarily the action demanded by the regulator, but something that\u2019ll actually work \u2013 and we need to explain that to the ministers so they can be part of the announcements when it\u2019s ready to launch.\u201d</p> <p>Cartwright said the plan was to improve transparency of the gas pipeline market through reforms in \u201ccapacity trading\u201d, where spare capacity in the pipelines is traded in a transparent process.</p> <p>She said many members of the industry had fought that move \u201cbecause it will be expensive\u201d.</p> <p>Responding to the industy lobbyists\u2019 comments, Frydenberg told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe ACCC in a recent report raised its concerns with the current regulatory test as it applies to gas pipelines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">Gas supplies to rise and secret contracts to be scrapped under Coag reform plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is why the [Council of Australian Governments] energy council has asked Dr Michael Vertigan, in consultation with stakeholders and working with the ACCC findings, to draw together what we need to do with the coverage criteria under the national gas law to address this issue.</p> <p>\u201cMinisters will consider Dr Vertigan\u2019s report at the next Coag energy council meeting.\u201d</p> <p>The Coag energy council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">announced in August</a> that it had agreed to ban secret pricing contracts in the gas industry. Frydenberg described the change as \u201cthe most significant reforms to the domestic gas market in two decades\u201d.</p> <p>It did not propose regulating prices, which other commentators have suggested, but which the gas industry strongly opposes.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, if you want to phase out oil and gas completely, you might like the idea of increasing economic regulation, which would stymie investment,\u201d Cartwright told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Bruce Robertson, an analyst at the pro-renewable Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the industry was overdue for regulation.</p> <p>\u201cThe pipeline companies are gouging the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know it and are fearful that sensible regulation as to price and capacity will come in. Essentially gas transmission pipelines are natural monopolies and Australia is unique in the western world at not regulating them.</p> <p>\u201cThe US has far better disclosure rules and still heavily regulates them. In Australia we need both far more comprehensive disclosure on a pipeline by pipeline basis and also strong regulation. Regulation of monopolies is not anti market. No market exists and hence the need for regulation.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wind turbines could soon supply most of the UK\u2019s electricity, the boss of the country\u2019s largest windfarm operator has said, as he confirmed plans to sell its oil and gas division. Dong Energy said the sale would underpin its plan to become a \u201cglobal leader in renewables\u201d, 44 years after the company was set up to exploit Denmark\u2019s North Sea oilfields. The chief executive pointed to the tumbling cost of green energy as evidence that wind and solar could supplant fossil fuels quicker than expected. \u201cWhen you look back in 10 years from now, we\u2019ll see this period around 2016-17 as an inflection point,\u201d Henrik Poulsen said. \u201cThe cost of offshore wind, also solar and onshore wind, is coming down at such speed that nobody could have predicted.\u201d Dong Energy is the UK\u2019s largest windfarm operator with stakes in planned or existing projects able to produce five gigawatts (5GW), more than the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors. Poulsen said technological advances in the energy industry meant wind power could end up supplying more than half of the UK\u2019s electricity demand. \u201cWhen you combine different things, you could see offshore wind\u2019s total of the energy mix going a lot higher,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could definitely go above 50%.\u201d He cited the falling cost of wind power, coupled with rapid progress in battery storage technology. Wind power is often criticised for its intermittency, in that it cannot be relied upon to meet the UK\u2019s energy needs because the wind does not always blow. But improvements in battery storage will mean surplus wind energy can be stored for release on windless days. \u201cThere is plenty of room for additional offshore wind capacity in the UK and we would love to play a role,\u201d said Poulsen. Dong Energy confirmed it was seeking buyers for its North Sea oil and gas business, and Poulsen said the decision was more than simply financial. \u201cThe company has an ambition of leading the energy transformation of leading the transition to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been driving us for the past few years and we see this as the natural step to transforming to be fully focused on green energy.\u201d He said the sale had nothing to do with the fact that oil prices have been stubbornly low for two years. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of vision and strategy and not the oil price,\u201d he said. The company is \u201cengaging with potential interested buyers\u201d, said Poulsen, insisting that a glut of oil assets for sale would not hamper the process. He said the division had already sold less profitable, high-cost assets that would have made it less attractive to a buyer. Poulsen was speaking as Dong Energy released third quarter figures that showed a jump in profit to \u00a3400m, compared with just \u00a355m last year. Much of the improvement came from proceeds of the sale of Dong\u2019s gas distribution grid in Denmark. During the quarter renewables overtook oil and gas as the company\u2019s biggest source of earnings, accounting for 42% of operating profit. Despite the sale of its oil business, the firm has no plans to change its name, which is short for Dansk Olie og Naturgas (Danish Oil and Natural Gas).",

    "webTitle": "Cost of British grocery brands to rise due to fall in value of sterling", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prices of Patak\u2019s pickles and Jordans muesli are to rise, after the brands\u2019 owner, Associated British Foods, admitted it was facing cost pressures from the fall in the value of sterling. \u201cThe days of food price deflation are behind us,\u201d said George Weston, the boss of ABF, which owns a string of British grocery brands including Twinings and Kingsmill as well as the Primark clothing chain. \u201cThere is a lot of cost pressure on the supply chain,\u201d Weston added. \u201cIn the next 18 months a lot of cost pressures will feed through to higher prices.\u201d Weston said ABF aimed to offset the rising cost of sourcing ingredients from overseas by buying more in the UK. It expected to buy more British wheat for its Kingsmill bread, switching away from German suppliers, for example. But Weston said some goods, such as spices for Patak\u2019s sauces and pickles and dried fruit and nuts for Jordans and Dorset Cereals mueslis, had to be bought abroad and the pressure for price inflation was increasing. He would not confirm if the company was already in talks with supermarkets about price rises, although he did say ABF had not increased the price of Twinings tea at this stage, despite talk of price rises by rival Typhoo. Any goods bought in euros or dollars have increased in price for British companies as the value of the pound has fallen by about 15% against the euro and the dollar. Analysis by the Guardian suggests price rises have already begun to filter through to the shop floor with a basket of 20 items supplied by Unilever, the maker of Marmite and Pot Noodle, rising by an average of 5.7% since the Brexit vote across the UK\u2019s four biggest supermarkets. The evidence comes after a public spat between Tesco and Unilever over cost rises and the news that Typhoo tea, Birds Eye and Walkers crisps were also asking supermarkets for price rises. Birds Eye is thought to be threatening to reduce pack sizes in order to offset cost increases while Toblerone has remodelled its bar in the UK. Weston said Patak\u2019s would not be changing its recipes to use less spice and reduce costs as products had been \u201cdeveloped to be the best products they can be\u201d. On clothing, Weston said Primark faced cost pressures, as much of its stock was bought in dollars, but he said the company was determined to remain the cheapest chain on the high street. He said it was not clear to what extent suppliers\u2019 cost increases would feed through to the high street but if it needed to it would \u201ctake the hit\u201d on profits. Profit margins at Primark slid by 1 percentage point to 11.6% in the year to 17 September, in the face of the devaluation of the euro against the dollar since early 2015. Overall operating profit rose 2% to \u00a3689m as sales rose 11% to \u00a35.9bn as the chain expanded into the US and Europe. That contributed to a 4% rise in sales at ABF year-on-year to \u00a313.4bn and a 5% rise in underlying pretax profits to \u00a31.07bn. Weston said Primark\u2019s plans were unaffected by the Brexit vote and it intended to open about 10 stores in the UK in the year ahead, out of 25 planned globally. The group is due to open at least three more outlets in the US, two more in Italy, two in France and a flagship store in Amsterdam. He said about half of Primark\u2019s sales were now made overseas and the benefit of the rising value of that business in pound terms provided a \u201cnatural hedge\u201d against the pressure on profits in the UK caused by higher import costs.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer faces a major overhaul. Over the next five years more than 80 stores will be shut; 30 in the UK and the rest abroad. It\u2019s part of plans to reduce reliance on its poorly performing clothing business, and focus more on food sales. The decision has got our readers talking, and many of you took part in a callout on the best and worst of what M&amp;S has to offer. Here are a selection of the responses, add yours in the comments. Nicola Miller, 50, east of England: \u2018M&amp;S has forgotten why people go there: fundamentals, such as good cotton tights\u2019 My favourite Marks &amp; Spencer products have always been the food, lingerie and sleepwear, as well as basic accessories \u2013 scarves, hats and gloves. I am less keen on the new Per Una range because it looks like the clothes have been sprayed with glue and rolled through a haberdashery store. It\u2019s also a shame that they don\u2019t stock the Alexa Chung range (and the other more fashion-forward ranges) in provincial shops. I believe that in M&amp;S\u2019s pursuit of the fashion and cultural zeitgeist the store has forgotten the core reason people shop there: fundamentals, such as a perfectly cut navy sweater, cotton tights that wash well and don\u2019t sag, etc. It\u2019s a store that\u2019s always been there, in the background, and formerly a benchmark for a certain kind of quality, but that\u2019s not the case any more. Many of their clothes are now badly made (the tights ladder and bobble) and there\u2019s just something off about their design. I also find their shops hard to navigate. I often give up in irritation because wading through 20 rails of seemingly identical black work skirts is a waste of my time. Annette Graat, 60, Maastricht: \u2018It\u2019s a popular store in the Netherlands. I like the scones\u2019 I read today that M&amp;S plans to shut 53 international stores, including all its shops in the Netherlands. This is really disappointing because the food department is great as it offers lots of products we don\u2019t usually get here. I like their traditionally British foods, such as scones, and all their nice meats. The clothes are a bit traditional and not really exciting, however. They are also a bit overpriced, but I will definitely miss the food. I also feel it\u2019s a missed opportunity as lots of people in this area could be potential customers and many are upset about the closure. I read a Twitter post today from a food blogger in the Netherlands who said: \u201cNo, not more bad news!\u201d Gregory Baser, 58, Plymouth: \u2018The sizing has really changed over the years, which is frustrating\u2019 I love the Sparks card and its targeted promotions, the underpants and socks, the trousers (especially the coloured ones). I like the suits. I am a loyal customer and have shopped there for more than 45 years, but even though I am a fan of the clothing I do feel it\u2019s got worse over time. For example, with the shirts there are now much less options in terms of colour. Also the sizing has really changed over the years, and shirts I bought years ago that were XXLs are XXXLs today. Being forced up a size means there\u2019s less on offer for me in terms of variety. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s takeaway food is its strongest food selling point, but the lunchtime deals have got a bit more complicated. There\u2019s now more on offer but that shouldn\u2019t be at the detriment of losing classics, such as the cheese and tomato ones. They offer a nice in-store bakery in their main branch in Plymouth but sometimes the portions aren\u2019t big enough. I am disappointed that they are giving up on a lot of their clothes stores overall. I know it must be difficult with stores like Primark opening up but they used to be really great. And it felt like they were taking some steps in the right direction, for example by sorting out their website. Stephanie Wong, 38, London: \u2018The only person the Alexa Chung range looks good on is, well, Alexa Chung\u2019 They do the best lunch salads of any high-street chain. And all the fruit, sweets, drinks \u2013 basically, if you want a posh picnic in the summer you can\u2019t beat M&amp;S. It will cost a bomb though. Baby and children\u2019s clothes, socks and underpants are always reliable, and good value. They do some really lovely textured, super comfortable sleepwear too. I have these lightweight lounge pants that I am obsessed with. The crockery is also good value and reasonable quality. Their women\u2019s daytime clothing range, however, is still terrible. The only person the Alexa Chung range looks good on is, well, Alexa Chung. On any average-sized woman, her whole range looks frumpy. I don\u2019t know who \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d is, but the poor woman has been wearing hideous T-shirts and cardigans in lurid tomato reds and hideous deep electric blues in stiff cotton for far too long. I would love it if M&amp;S refocused its clothing line for women on \u201cbasics\u201d along the lines of its children\u2019s range. They could also take a leaf out of H&amp;M in terms of basic design standards, fabrics and versatile colours. Or just copy their underpants, sock and children\u2019s clothes, to be honest. Just don\u2019t touch the children\u2019s clothes, they are so good. Callum, 35, Merseyside: \u2018The high-quality food products are what makes M&amp;S so brilliant\u2019 M&amp;S food products are brilliant and noticeably higher quality than many other food retailers for the most part. This is their strongest area. They do also have extremely well-designed homeware. This leaves their clothing ranges as the weaker link, but they definitely serve a core audience. Their attempts at chasing a younger market haven\u2019t worked but it would be a shame if their ranges were removed completely. It seems like they need simpler and fewer ranges, with a clearer target market. It would be sad to see stores close. As a British person it is reassuring to see M&amp;S stores in other countries, particularly when buying food. Hopefully this will remain unaltered. I\u2019ve shopped at M&amp;S for more than 10 years, my family always went there and as a young child I was fascinated by their attractive packaging and well-designed food ranges. Their home products have become more contemporary and attractive, and much more informed by Scandinavian design, which is a good thing. Much of their range is similar to the likes of Habitat. So it has definitely changed and very much kept at the forefront of demand. Their staff are also considerably better than many other stores, and it\u2019s good to see that they employ so many people that clearly have experience and manners. Megan Peel, 38, Harrogate: \u2018I used to shop at M&amp;S food but don\u2019t now \u2013 their food is so over-packaged to me\u2019 The only items I now really buy at M&amp;S are clothes for my one-year-old. They are exactly what I want in terms of fabrics and patterns, but when I look for clothes for my four-year-old there\u2019s much less on offer. It\u2019s not stylish and it looks cheaper. I used to shop regularly at M&amp;S food but I don\u2019t any more as their food feels so over-packaged to me. They claim to be sustainable but how can they be when all their food is wrapped in so much plastic? So I shop less at M&amp;S than I used to. I would definitely never shop for women\u2019s clothes there: the price of their clothes is up there with the likes of Jigsaw, but the experience of shopping at Jigsaw is much better. Shopping in supermarkets is not nearly as nice. Strategically, I feel they are missing a massive opportunity; with British Home Stores closing they could champion British retail by promoting young British designers. They could also do more of their manufacturing in the UK. Anonymous, 46, Sheffield: \u2018 I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life\u2019 My current gripes about M&amp;S are as follows: They no longer seem to stock ordinary cotton knickers in a variety of styles. All of their individual knickers that are not part of a matching set seem to be nylon. You can only buy cotton knickers in bags of five, with very few styles/colours to choose from. The choice is so poor that I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life. I never thought this would happen and I hate it. Their women\u2019s clothing range is an incoherent mess. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. They should get back to offering classic pieces for each season, reducing the number of stock items, and presenting them as outfits in the stores instead of just hanging all the trousers together, etc. I\u2019m sick of having to schlep around the store to see if they have a scarf to match a jumper. The quality of the finish needs to improve markedly. I am tired of hems coming down and buttons falling off. I have had to pay for two zips to be replaced on faulty M&amp;S garments this year. I would gladly pay a bit more for better quality. It seems sensible to focus on the successful part of the business \u2013 food \u2013 but this ignores the fact that M&amp;S should be a clothing retailer, not a supermarket. They need to reconnect with their core customers and offer good quality pieces to middle-aged women, rather than trying to compete for the Topshop/Zara market.",

On any average-sized woman, her whole range looks frumpy. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know who \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d is, but the poor woman has been wearing hideous T-shirts and cardigans in lurid tomato reds and hideous deep electric blues in stiff cotton for far too long. I would love it if M&amp;S refocused its clothing line for women on \u201cbasics\u201d along the lines of its children\u2019s range. They could also take a leaf out of H&amp;M in terms of basic design standards, fabrics and versatile colours. Or just copy their underpants, sock and children\u2019s clothes, to be honest. Just don\u2019t touch the children\u2019s clothes, they are so good. </p> <h2>Callum, 35, Merseyside: \u2018The high-quality food products are what makes M&amp;S so brilliant\u2019</h2> <p>M&amp;S food products are brilliant and noticeably higher quality than many other food retailers for the most part. This is their strongest area. They do also have extremely well-designed homeware. This leaves their clothing ranges as the weaker link, but they definitely serve a core audience. Their attempts at chasing a younger market haven\u2019t worked but it would be a shame if their ranges were removed completely. It seems like they need simpler and fewer ranges, with a clearer target market. </p> <p>It would be sad to see stores close. As a British person it is reassuring to see M&amp;S stores in other countries, particularly when buying food. Hopefully this will remain unaltered. I\u2019ve shopped at M&amp;S for more than 10 years, my family always went there and as a young child I was fascinated by their attractive packaging and well-designed food ranges. Their home products have become more contemporary and attractive, and much more informed by Scandinavian design, which is a good thing. Much of their range is similar to the likes of Habitat. So it has definitely changed and very much kept at the forefront of demand. Their staff are also considerably better than many other stores, and it\u2019s good to see that they employ so many people that clearly have experience and manners. </p> <h2>Megan Peel, 38, Harrogate: \u2018I used to shop at M&amp;S food but don\u2019t now \u2013 their food is so over-packaged to me\u2019</h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They claim to be sustainable but how can they be when all their food is wrapped in so much plastic?</p> <footer> <cite>Megan Peel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The only items I now really buy at M&amp;S are clothes for my one-year-old. They are exactly what I want in terms of fabrics and patterns, but when I look for clothes for my four-year-old there\u2019s much less on offer. It\u2019s not stylish and it looks cheaper. I used to shop regularly at M&amp;S food but I don\u2019t any more as their food feels so over-packaged to me. They claim to be sustainable but how can they be when all their food is wrapped in so much plastic? So I shop less at M&amp;S than I used to. I would definitely never shop for women\u2019s clothes there: the price of their clothes is up there with the likes of Jigsaw, but the experience of shopping at Jigsaw is much better. Shopping in supermarkets is not nearly as nice. Strategically, I feel they are missing a massive opportunity; with British Home Stores closing they could champion British retail by promoting young British designers. They could also do more of their manufacturing in the UK.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 46, Sheffield: \u2018 I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life\u2019</h2> <p>My current gripes about M&amp;S are as follows: <br></p> <ul> <li>They no longer seem to stock ordinary cotton knickers in a variety of styles. <br></li> <li>All of their individual knickers that are not part of a matching set seem to be nylon.</li> <li>You can only buy cotton knickers in bags of five, with very few styles/colours to choose from.</li> </ul> <p>The choice is so poor that I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life. I never thought this would happen and I hate it. Their women\u2019s clothing range is an incoherent mess. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. They should get back to offering classic pieces for each season, reducing the number of stock items, and presenting them as outfits in the stores instead of just hanging all the trousers together, etc. I\u2019m sick of having to schlep around the store to see if they have a scarf to match a jumper.</p> <p>The quality of the finish needs to improve markedly. I am tired of hems coming down and buttons falling off. I have had to pay for two zips to be replaced on faulty M&amp;S garments this year. I would gladly pay a bit more for better quality. </p> <p>It seems sensible to focus on the successful part of the business \u2013 food \u2013 but this ignores the fact that M&amp;S should be a clothing retailer, not a supermarket. They need to reconnect with their core customers and offer good quality pieces to middle-aged women, rather than trying to compete for the Topshop/Zara market. </p>",

      "bodyText": "American Apparel\u2019s UK business is likely to be closed after the fashion retailer appointed administrators on Tuesday. The Los Angeles-based company, which makes all its clothes in the US, has endured a difficult period since the departure of its controversial founder Dov Charney in 2014. The parent company filed for Chapter 11, the US version of administration, just over a year ago and is up for sale after its chief executive, Paula Schneider, stepped down in September. The group\u2019s 13 UK stores and some other European operations are not part of the US sale and are therefore likely to be wound down, according to joint administrators Jim Tucker and Richard Beard of KPMG. Tucker said American Apparel\u2019s US parent had been \u201cexperiencing strong retail headwinds\u201d that had led to it halting product shipments to the UK, where the brand was also experiencing trading difficulties. Tucker said: \u201cThe 13 UK stores are well stocked and will continue to trade as usual in the lead-up to the peak Christmas trading period. While the UK business is not part of the US sale, a number of the UK stores are in prime high street locations, and we will also aim to sell individual stores following the Christmas trading peak.\u201d Charney launched American Apparel while at university in 1989, combining sexy, fashionable clothing with ethical production. The brand expanded to more than 200 stores in more than 20 countries but attracted notoriety for racy advertising often featuring young female staff members. He later faced a string of increasingly lurid allegations, undermining the company\u2019s image. He was alleged to have masturbated in the presence of a female journalist and reportedly sent explicit texts to employees. As changing fashion trends and the financial crisis made young shoppers less keen to pay \u00a330 for one of Charney\u2019s plain T-shirts, sales slumped and debts mounted. American Apparel\u2019s board fired Charney as chairman in June 2014 and sacked him as chief executive the following December. He has since attempted to buy back the brand.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s decision to close stores in 10 countries is the latest move in a chequered saga of international expansion and retrenchment dating to the 1970s. 1972 In its first foray abroad, M&amp;S opens a store in Canada and soon after buys three local chains: Walker\u2019s clothing stores, the women\u2019s clothes retailer D\u2019Allaird\u2019s, and Peoples, a general goods retailer. 1975 M&amp;S opens in France with branches in Paris and Lyon. It continues European expansion throughout the 70s including in France and Belgium. 1988 Under chairman Derek Rayner, M&amp;S expands more aggressively. It opens two stores in Hong Kong and moves into the US with the purchase of the New Jersey-based Kings grocery chain and Brooks Brothers, the preppy men\u2019s clothier, for almost $750m. 1992 M&amp;S, by now run by Richard Greenbury, sells Peoples in Canada but continues foreign expansion. 1996 The company opens its first German store in Cologne. By this time M&amp;S was adding countries rapidly through franchises in Denmark, Hungary, Malaysia, Turkey and other countries and ramping up its own operations in France and Spain. In Canada, D\u2019Allaird\u2019s is sold. 1997 South Korea is Greenbury\u2019s next stop as M&amp;S opens two stores in Seoul. M&amp;S announces plans to spend more than \u00a32bn on international expansion to make a quarter of revenues overseas by the early 21st century. 2000 M&amp;S sells its remaining 38 Canadian stores after the loss-making operation fails to shake off its dowdy image. 2001 New Belgian chief executive Luc Vandevelde announces a total withdrawal from mainland Europe to concentrate on rebuilding M&amp;S\u2019s ailing UK business. In the US, M&amp;S sells loss-making Brooks Brothers for $225m \u2013 less than a third of the price it paid 15 years earlier. 2006 M&amp;S cuts its final tie with the US by selling Kings after 18 years of ownership but Stuart Rose, who took over as chief executive in 2004, announces plans to open 150 mainly franchise stores overseas. Rose says M&amp;S was wrong to pull out of Europe under Vandevelde. 2008 Rose takes control of M&amp;S\u2019s franchised operations in eastern Europe and announces plans to open more stores in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. In November M&amp;S opens its first store in China in Shanghai. 2009 Another chief executive, Marc Bolland, announces his goal to be an international retailer. With emerging markets in favour, India and China are high on his list. 2011 Bolland takes M&amp;S back into Paris a decade after Vandevelde\u2019s withdrawal by opening a flagship store on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. 2014 Bolland announces plans to open 250 stores around the world with further expansion in France, Spain and Italy. 2016 Steve Rowe, Bolland\u2019s successor, abandons pretensions to be a global retailer, announcing he will close 53 overseas shops in 10 countries, including the Paris store.",

      "bodyText": "Sky is planning to close 60 of its worst-performing stores, putting 170 jobs at risk. The broadcaster has a network of 260 Sky stores across the UK, providing a physical presence to promote its range of TV, phone and broadband services to consumers. Sky is proposing to shut 23% of its nationwide network, focusing on the stores which are not profitable or where there are a few close to each other. The proposals, which were delivered to staff on Tuesday, will put 170 jobs at risk. This is about 20% of the 850-strong workforce in Sky\u2019s retail operation. \u201cAs we expand our products and services, we want to make sure that our retail stores are in the right place for customers and making the right contribution to our business,\u201d said a Sky spokesman. \u201cWe will continue to have a strong retail presence around the country, but we are proposing to close a number of stores.

      "bodyText": "The cyber heist at Tesco Bank been described by the chief executive of the City regulator as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d incident in the UK. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that \u201cthere are elements of this that look unprecedented and it is serious, clearly\u201d. Tesco Bank stopped all online transactions for 140,000 current account customers on Monday after it discovered 40,000 customers had been targeted by the online attack. Half of the customers had money taken from their accounts, which are operated through an app or online. Customers have reported that sums have been transferred to Spain and Brazil. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is one of a number of organisations scrutinising what has taken place at the supermarket chain\u2019s banking arm, which has more than 7 million customers. A new division of the surveillance agency GCHQ \u2013 the National Cyber Security Centre \u2013 confirmed it was working with the NCA which has launched a criminal inquiry. The NCSC, created only last month as the UK\u2019s authority on cybersecurity, said it was \u201cproviding direct assistance to the company at their request, including on-site assistance\u201d. \u201cIn the case of cyber-related incidents, it can, on certain occasions, take a significant period of time to understand the incident given the technical complexities involved. So the story will emerge over time. During this period it is vital that nothing is said publicly that could interfere with the criminal investigation,\u201d the NCSC said. \u201cGiven the investigation thus far and the evidence at hand, the National Cyber Security Centre is unaware of any wider threat to the UK banking sector connected with this incident.\u201d Bailey told the MPs that the FCA was in close contact with Tesco and that the bank had reassured the regulator that customers whose money had been stolen would be reimbursed by the end of Tuesday. He said it was too early to know the exact cause but said it appeared to be related to debit cards and that computer hackers were looking for weaknesses and \u201cpoints of entry\u201d into banks. \u201cIt looks like its [in] on-line banking, clearly appears to be on debit card side of online banking as far as we can tell. But it requires further urgent analysis ,\u201d said Bailey. He said he was confident that Tesco knew which customers were affected by the incident which began to unfold on Saturday night when the bank began texting customers about unusual activity from their accounts. But Tesco provided no update on the status of its customers on Tuesday after suspending online banking transactions for current accounts in the wake of the incident. Bailey indicated that Tesco would not be able turn those facilities back on until it was confident it knew the service was safe for customers. A number of theories have circulated about the cause of the problem, including that it was caused by an internal security breach. Conservative MP Chris Philp, a member of the Treasury select committee, has raised the idea it could have been the work of a foreign power. \u201cI think we can\u2019t rule out the possibility, at all, that this is state-sponsored,\u201d he told the BBC earlier this week. As the crisis was unfolding, Benny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, had said the decision to suspend some banking activities was an attempt to protect customers from \u201conline criminal activity\u201d. Higgins, who has apologised to customers, has described the raid as \u201ca systematic, sophisticated attack\u201d. The NCSC said its role was to provide support to the investigation, work with the company concerned to manage the incident, investigate the root causes and use any lessons learned to provide future guidance and policy on cyber security. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is also scrutinising the situation. It fined telecom company TalkTalk a record \u00a3400,000 in October for failing to stop the personal data of 157,000 customers being hacked. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said after the hearing that \u201cthe attack on Tesco\u2019s retail accounts is deeply troubling. Banks have a long way to go to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems\u201d. Another member of the committee, Steve Baker, said: \u201cthe vulnerability of Tesco Bank highlights the crucial importance of technical security to the financial system.\u201d",

Setting out regulations about the shares and bonds banks must hold to absorb losses, Threadneedle Street said they would have until 2022, rather than 2020, to build up their buffers. Since 2008, regulators around the world have been trying to find ways to make banks safe during a crisis without recourse to the taxpayer and the latest rules from the Bank are part of a package of measures intended to avoid bailouts. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said: \u201cThis policy is a significant milestone on the journey to end \u2018too big to fail\u2019 in the UK.\u201d The aim, he said, was to \u201censure that banks that provide essential economic functions hold sufficient resources to be resolved in an orderly way, without recourse to public funds, and whilst allowing households and businesses to continue to access the services they need.\u201d The rules will apply to banks that have more than 80,000 accounts \u2013 double the number first suggested by the Bank of England \u2013 which means some of the smallest lenders will not need to comply. The Bank of England said institutions were already holding several times more capital than they did before the crisis and were subjected to annual stress tests.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s industrial sector shrank unexpectedly in September as North Sea oil shutdowns dragged output lower, weighing on the broader economy in the third quarter. Industrial output fell by 0.4% over the month, matching August\u2019s drop and disappointing expectations that production would be flat. While mining and quarrying shrank by 3.8% according to the Office for National Statistics, manufacturing performed better than expected with output growing by 0.6%. The figures were the latest evidence that consumer spending has been the main driver of economic growth following the EU referendum, although the ONS said there was no evidence that the impact of the Brexit vote was directly to blame for the fall in industrial production. Kate Davies, an ONS statistician, said: \u201cThere are no obvious signs so far of either the weaker pound or post-referendum uncertainties affecting the output of UK factories, which continued broadly in line with recent trends.\u201d The UK economy performed better than expected in the months immediately following the referendum, growing by 0.5% between July and September. However, the increase in GDP was driven purely by the services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the economy and includes hotels and restaurants, transport and business services. Industrial production on the other hand shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter. Although manufacturing output grew in the month of September, it fell 0.9% between July and September. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the three months to the end of October, from 0.5% in the three months to September. \u201cRobust consumer spending growth continues to support the economy,\u201d said Oriol Carreras, a research fellow at NIESR. \u201cLooking ahead, this contribution from consumers is expected to wane over the course of next year due to a substantial rise in the rate of inflation.\u201d The institute is forecasting growth of 2% in 2016, slowing to 1.7% in 2017. It expects inflation to rise to 3.8% at the end of next year from a current rate of 1%, as a weak pound pushes up the cost of imports. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the weakness in the UK production sector was concerning, and, contrary to the ONS, said the sharp fall in the pound since the referendum was putting pressure on firms. \u201cThe pick-up in manufacturing output in September was unable to halt the overall decline in total industrial output in the month. It is concerning that the longer-term trends show that manufacturing and total industrial output are adding little to overall UK growth. \u201cWhile the declining value of sterling has provided a boost to some exporters, it has also meant that some manufacturers are facing the increasing cost of imported materials, particularly those who are locked into global supply chains.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s board has said it did not know about or authorise an apparent attempt to secretly record a group of MPs who paid a surprise visit to its warehouse. Six MPs from the business select committee arrived at the site in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, on Monday after giving the company an hour\u2019s notice. They were accepting an invitation made by the founder and chief executive, Mike Ashley, when he appeared before the committee in June. After they were shown round, the MPs went to a meeting room where they claimed a small camera used to record the day\u2019s proceedings was placed under a tray of sandwiches. In a statement to the stock exchange, Sports Direct\u2019s board said it had not been proved that the camera was to be used to record the MPs and complained that the episode had overshadowed good things that came from the visit. The company added: \u201cThe board would like to make it clear that it did not authorise or have any knowledge of the possible recording device.\u201d Sports Direct said it was delighted MPs had \u201cfinally accepted the company\u2019s invitation to visit the Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse on an unannounced basis\u201d but that the board was disappointed they chose a day when they knew Ashley would be away from Shirebrook. Karen Byers, global operations head and one of Ashley\u2019s closest associates, was understood to have shown the MPs round in Ashley\u2019s absence. Ashley invited the MPs to Shirebrook after the Guardian\u2019s investigation exposed how Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the minimum wage. The business committee subsequently accused Ashley of running the business like a Victorian workhouse in a report published in July. The board, led by embattled chairman Keith Hellawell, said it understood the MPs met many staff members who were positive about the company and that employees expressed unhappiness about how the company had been portrayed. Ashley said: \u201cI stand firmly behind the people of Sports Direct, who through no fault of their own have been made a political football by MPs and unions.\u201d Anna Turley, one of the MPs who visited Shirebrook, said they were made to feel unwelcome and were taken on a \u201cwild goose chase\u201d around the vast site before being shown the warehouse at the centre of the row about working practices. Turley told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect them to be overjoyed when we were there but would say: \u2018This is the same as any other day. We are proud of our warehouse, we are proud of our staff, come and meet them and say hello.\u2019\u201d Turley said conditions at Shirebrook were dark, dingy and chaotic but that the MPs had not expected things to be perfect because Ashley had admitted things needed to improve. She said the camera incident had left her and her colleagues uneasy about the treatment of employees. \u201cIf they do this to us as parliamentarians, what do they do to staff who aren\u2019t able to answer back, who aren\u2019t unionised and who fear for their jobs?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets are drifting as the US finally gets to vote in the presidential election, with investors pausing for breath after Monday\u2019s surge on the prospects of a Hillary Clinton victory. But Imperial Brands, the maker of JPS and Gauloise cigarettes and Rizla papers, has dropped 2.5% to \u00a337.07 as news of new investment overshadowed in-line full year profits. The company said it planned to spend \u00a3300m in 2017 on \u201cselected quality growth opportunities\u201d, supported by moves to cut annual costs by \u00a3300m by 2020. It said: To further drive delivery of our strategic priorities and underpin revenue growth over the medium term, we will invest an additional \u00a3300m, which net of investment returns will have a \u00a3200m impact in 2017. This will be partly offset by \u00a390m of cost optimisation savings resulting in a 4% net impact on 2017 constant currency earnings. Its 2016 results showed operating profit rising from \u00a31.9bn to \u00a32.2bn but after financing costs profit before tax fell from \u00a31.7bn to \u00a3669m. It hiked its dividend by 10%. Sales volumes were boosted by its recent US acquisitions, which were up 4.2% but there were declines in Iraq and Syria. Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said: While not set to grow earnings at the same level as peers, it needs to be judged on different parameters, in our view, with too much focus on share trends not doing the name justice. We believe that actions the company has taken has positioned it well to deliver mid-single digit earnings over the medium to long-term (and they committed to this in today\u2019s release). While bears will likely take the additional investment as a sign of weakness we believe the action should be applauded, taking advantage of supportive foreign exchange, and giving them a greater opportunity to improve momentum of growth brands. The medium-term outlook and expected 2017 earnings per share growth of over 10% (even with additional investment) is not appropriately reflected in the valuation, in our view, trading on 13.4 times net twelve month consensus PE, over 20% discount to the global space (we also think Imperial could be a take-out target in the next 18 months). Overall the FTSE 100 has added 10.08 points to 6816.98. Primark-owner Associated British Foods and Marks &amp; Spencer are heading in different directions following their latest updates. ABF has added 136p to \u00a326.25 as it reported a 3% rise in full year operating profits and forecast higher earnings for the current year as the weak pound boosted overseas earnings, making up for the impact of rising import prices on Primark. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Markets [have reacted] very positively to better than expected full year growth (sales, profits, selling space), helping shares extend an October bounce to levels last seen in late September. A global bond rally reducing financing costs coupled with lower tax and helpful foreign exchange moves are helping sugar margins (already up on better global sugar prices), bringing focus back to the \u2018ingredients/agriculture\u2019 segment to prove that the ABF story can still be something other than discount fashion and Primark. The latter\u2019s margins are still likely to suffer as a result of a weak pound/dollar rate, but markets are clearly glad that the overall negative effects to date (and forecast) are no more than the company had previously guided to. But Marks has dropped 5.6p to 343.4p after it reported a 19% fall in profits and said it was shutting 80 stores around the world. Lower down the market Punch Taverns has put on 2.4% to 115p as it said changes to pub regulations were having a negative effect on letting activity in the first half of the year, but its expectations for longer term growth were unchanged. In a buy note Stifel said the results were in line with expectations, adding: We continue to believe that the shares are an overlooked and materially undervalued special situation.",

On Sunday, it emerged that Birds Eye fish fingers and Walkers crisps had joined Typhoo and Unilever, the owner of Marmite, and a number of smaller suppliers in an industry-wide battle over price increases caused by the 14.5% drop in the value of the pound against the euro and 18% against the dollar since the referendum.

    "webTitle": "Gold: key trends helping the metal keep its shine", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gold has long thrived on bouts of uncertainty and right now markets have uncertainty in spades. The Brexit vote in Britain, the prospect of Donald Trump as US president and a raft of elections due in Europe next year have all pushed investors to ramp up their holdings of the precious metal. That strong demand for gold \u2013 seen as a safe haven in troubled times \u2013 has sent its price soaring on world markets this year. But while big investors like pension funds stock up, individuals who fancy their own little pot of gold for a rainy day have been priced out of the market. As the World Gold Council releases its latest figures we look at key trends for the metal. Global climate of uncertainty is boosting investor demand Investment demand for gold was up 44% in the third quarter on a year earlier, dominated by demand from European funds. That was a bright spot in an otherwise weak quarter for gold. Demand was down 10% overall from a year ago, as the growth in investor demand failed to offset a drop in appetite for gold among central banks, the jewellery sector and technology companies that use gold in electronics. The solid demand among institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers builds on a strong first half to 2016. For the year to date, demand from investors is up 98%, according to the World Gold Council, a lobby group for the gold industry. As polls tightened between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election, the gold price rose. But Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, says the demand for the precious metal goes beyond worries about a political upset in the US. \u201cFocus this week is going to be centred around the US election but it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d he says. Uncertainty rose on the back of the vote for Brexit, and with it activity in the gold market, Hewitt adds. Now investors are worrying about a series of elections in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too. \u201cGiven what we have seen in the UK referendum and what we\u2019ve seen in the US election, there is huge uncertainty about what the outcome of these [European elections] is going to be,\u201d says Hewitt. \u201cOne thing that is completely clear to us and certainly to institutional investors is that gone are the days of the predictable status quo.\u201d That has lifted the gold price 20% so far this year There are other factors working in gold\u2019s favour, too. Investor demand has also been helped by the fact interest rates are negative in the eurozone, Japan and elsewhere. That effectively means people end up paying for the privilege of parking their cash with a bank. In the US and UK, official rates remain in positive territory but they are not far off zero, making returns meagre for savers. That has made gold a more attractive asset and coupled with the boost from geopolitical and economic worries has seen the spot gold price rise more than 20% this year to $1,279 an ounce on Monday. Pricier gold has put off retail investors Demand for coins, gold bars and jewellery have all suffered from the rise in prices, says Hewitt at World Gold Council. Both China and India, the world\u2019s leading gold markets, experienced a drop in consumer demand this quarter, of 22% and 28% respectively as price savvy customers waited to buy on a dip - something many did at the start of October, he adds. In China, ongoing economic uncertainty also contributed to a softening in sentiment towards gold, as did changing consumer behaviour. In India, appetite has been affected by more stringent government regulations, such as a 1% excise duty on gold jewellery manufacturing, designed to formalise the gold industry, the World Gold Council said. Added to that is the impact of a squeeze on disposable rural incomes. With consistently high prices hurting demand, one or two stores in Southern India introduced gold-plated silver jewellery. Millennials don\u2019t have the gold bug In China and elsewhere changing tastes are impacting the gold market. Hewitt at the World Gold Council says millennials living in Chinese cities do not go for the top grade gold favoured by their parents but instead tend to look for design over quality. They also share a trend seen among other young consumers around the world to spend on experiences rather than objects. \u201cThe industry also faces the challenge of the rising popularity of \u2018experiential\u2019 purchases at the expense of physical consumption,\u201d says the World Gold Council\u2019s report. \u201cEvidence of this can be seen in the way the Chinese populace chose to celebrate the recent Golden Week national holiday. Over the last three years, the number of people choosing to travel during this holiday has grown by nearly 25%, reaching 589million. 31% of this year\u2019s tourists were millennials, born after 1980.\u201d Gold teeth are out of fashion too Demand from dentists has been on a declining trend and gold used in dentistry fell another 6% year-on-year in the third quarter. \u201cDemand is expected to fade further as the industry and consumers turn to ceramic materials for cosmetic reasons,\u201d says the World Gold Council report. Recycling is all the rage With the gold price high, people are being encouraged to dig around their cupboards and take old trinkets and jewellery into services that buy gold from consumers for recycling. That trend was particularly prevalent in India, where consumers cashed in their holdings, swelling the amount of recycled gold in the region to its highest level for almost four years. Volumes of gold recycling have also \u201cballooned\u201d in recent quarters in China, the World Gold Council says.",

The Brexit vote in Britain, the prospect of Donald Trump as US president and a raft of elections due in Europe next year have all pushed investors to ramp up their holdings of the precious metal.</p> <p>That strong demand for gold \u2013 seen as a safe haven in troubled times \u2013 has sent its price soaring on world markets this year. But while big investors like pension funds stock up, individuals who fancy their own little pot of gold for a rainy day have been priced out of the market. </p> <p>As the World Gold Council releases its <a href=\"http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/gold-demand-trends\">latest figures</a> we look at key trends for the metal.</p> <h2>Global climate of uncertainty is boosting investor demand</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee/0_0_547_321/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gold demand\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold demand in the third quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Metals Focus; World Gold Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Investment demand for gold was up 44% in the third quarter on a year earlier, dominated by demand from European funds. That was a bright spot in an otherwise weak quarter for gold. Demand was down 10% overall from a year ago, as the growth in investor demand failed to offset a drop in appetite for gold among central banks, the jewellery sector and technology companies that use gold in electronics.</p> <p>The solid demand among institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers builds on a strong first half to 2016. For the year to date, demand from investors is up 98%, according to the World Gold Council, a lobby group for the gold industry. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06/65_0_2402_3000/801.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As polls tightened between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election, the gold price rose. But Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, says the demand for the precious metal goes beyond worries about a political upset in the US.</p> <p>\u201cFocus this week is going to be centred around the US election but it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Uncertainty rose on the back of the vote for Brexit, and with it activity in the gold market, Hewitt adds. Now investors are worrying about a series of elections in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too. <br></p> <p>\u201cGiven what we have seen in the UK referendum and what we\u2019ve seen in the US election, there is huge uncertainty about what the outcome of these [European elections] is going to be,\u201d says Hewitt.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that is completely clear to us and certainly to institutional investors is that gone are the days of the predictable status quo.\u201d</p> <h2>That has lifted the gold price 20% so far this year</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171/0_0_1323_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The spot gold price this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"510\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The spot gold price this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other factors working in gold\u2019s favour, too. </p> <p>Investor demand has also been helped by the fact interest rates are negative in the eurozone, Japan and elsewhere. That effectively means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/rbs-charging-customers-cash-negative-interest-rates\">people end up paying for the privilege of parking their cash with a bank</a>. In the US and UK, official rates remain in positive territory but they are not far off zero, making returns meagre for savers. That has made gold a more attractive asset and coupled with the boost from geopolitical and economic worries has seen the spot gold price rise more than 20% this year to $1,279 an ounce on Monday.</p> <h2>Pricier gold has put off retail investors</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f/0_97_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A saleswoman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A saleswoman arranges a gold necklace inside a jewellery showroom in the southern Indian city of Kochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Demand for coins, gold bars and jewellery have all suffered from the rise in prices, says Hewitt at World Gold Council. Both China and India, the world\u2019s leading gold markets, experienced a drop in consumer demand this quarter, of 22% and 28% respectively as price savvy customers waited to buy on a dip - something many did at the start of October, he adds.</p> <p>In China, ongoing economic uncertainty also contributed to a softening in sentiment towards gold, as did changing consumer behaviour. </p> <p>In India, appetite has been affected by more stringent government regulations, such as a 1% excise duty on gold jewellery manufacturing, designed to formalise the gold industry, the World Gold Council said. Added to that is the impact of a squeeze on disposable rural incomes. With consistently high prices hurting demand, one or two stores in Southern India introduced gold-plated silver jewellery.</p> <h2>Millennials don\u2019t have the gold bug</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A trend among millennials to spend more on going out and travel is impacting the gold market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinopix/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In China and elsewhere changing tastes are impacting the gold market. Hewitt at the World Gold Council says millennials living in Chinese cities do not go for the top grade gold favoured by their parents but instead tend to look for design over quality. They also share a trend seen among other young consumers around the world to spend on experiences rather than objects. </p> <p>\u201cThe industry also faces the challenge of the rising popularity of \u2018experiential\u2019 purchases at the expense of physical consumption,\u201d says the World Gold Council\u2019s report. </p> <p>\u201cEvidence of this can be seen in the way the Chinese populace chose to celebrate the recent Golden Week national holiday. Over the last three years, the number of people choosing to travel during this holiday has grown by nearly 25%, reaching 589million. 31% of this year\u2019s tourists were millennials, born after 1980.\u201d</p> <h2>Gold teeth are out of fashion too</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24dd8f2efff4cbe1d9942a7801f50e963fc858c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24dd8f2efff4cbe1d9942a7801f50e963fc858c5/203_587_3124_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Demand from dentists has been on a declining trend and gold used in dentistry fell another 6% year-on-year in the third quarter. \u201cDemand is expected to fade further as the industry and consumers turn to ceramic materials for cosmetic reasons,\u201d says the World Gold Council report.</p> <h2>Recycling is all the rage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e80cd2cebc8f1077faceccc2180899e9888be9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e80cd2cebc8f1077faceccc2180899e9888be9/0_0_5476_3286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shop buying gold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shop buying gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the gold price high, people are being encouraged to dig around their cupboards and take old trinkets and jewellery into services that buy gold from consumers for recycling.</p> <p>That trend was particularly prevalent in India, where consumers cashed in their holdings, swelling the amount of recycled gold in the region to its highest level for almost four years.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A union representing drivers for the takeaway app Deliveroo is requesting recognition from the company, in the latest battle over employment practices in the gig economy. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has written to Deliveroo\u2019s chief executive asking the firm to recognise it as a union representing riders in one area of London. Currently, the riders are classed as self-employed contractors, and are not entitled to the rights available to workers, including sick pay and the national living wage. The firm\u2019s contract even tells those who sign up to make deliveries that they cannot test this status at the employment tribunal \u2013 although lawyers have dismissed this as unenforceable. The request for collective bargaining, which will cover only those working in Camden, north London, is designed to force the company to acknowledge the riders as workers. Independent contractors are not able to request collective bargaining in this way. The letter, sent by the general secretary of the IWGB, Jason Moyer-Lee, and addressed to Deliveroo\u2019s founder and chief executive Will Shu, calls for the company to recognise drivers working in one of its central London delivery zones. The letter gives the company 10 days to respond, and says that if the request is refused or unanswered the union will go to the central arbitration committee. It adds: \u201cOf course, for the CAC to entertain our request they will need to decide that Deliveroo drivers are \u2018workers\u2019 and not the \u2018independent contractors\u2019 you have bogusly deemed them to be.\u201d The somewhat unconventional approach to having riders recognised as workers follows a recent employment tribunal case which found that a group of drivers for car-hailing firm Uber should be classed as workers. That case, which is now expected to go to appeal, put the spotlight on other firms with large self-employed workforces, and may lead to new claims being taken to the employment tribunal. Moyer-Lee said: \u201cThe importance of achieving a collective bargaining agreement for Deliveroo workers is not just the ability to negotiate pay and terms and conditions, but also to keep chipping away at this bogus narrative that gig economy workers are a bunch of independent entrepreneurs who are so lucky to benefit from the generous flexibility provided by the likes of Uber and Deliveroo. \u201cDeliveroo drivers work for Deliveroo and as such they should be entitled to paid holiday, minimum wage, trade union rights, and all the other rights associated with worker status.\u201d If the request does end up with the CAC one thing it will need to determine is whether there is sufficient support for the union amongst the workforce. At least 10% of the proposed bargaining unit will need to be union members, and a majority of the proposed group will need to be considered likely to favour recognition. If Deliveroo does agree to recognise the union it is likely to be the first collective bargaining agreement in the \u201cgig economy\u201d. Although recognition will only apply to riders in Camden, it could set a precedent for other people in insecure jobs. John Hendy, a barrister who has advised IWGB said the application for collective bargaining was \u201ca timely and vital step forward\u201d. He said: \u201cThose working in the gig economy will never see a significant improvement to their terms and conditions without being represented by a union in collective bargaining.\u201d The request follows successful protests by drivers in London who objected to the trial of a new pay structure which would have seen them moved from an hourly rate to a payment per delivery. The change affected several zones, including Camden, and some riders said it would mean their pay was cut. After several days of demonstrations and some drivers refusing to work, the company agreed that it would allow riders who did not want to to move to different zones during the 90-day trial. In a statement Deliveroo did not comment on the IWGB\u2019s request for recoginition. It said: \u201cAs Deliveroo continues to grow, we are committed to providing great opportunities for UK riders, with the flexible work riders value, and a payment model which is fair, rewarding and better matches riders\u2019 time with our customers\u2019 orders. \u201cWe have been in close and regular contact with our riders throughout the trial, and as you would expect we will be writing directly to our riders to inform them of the next steps as the trial comes to an end. The feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive and we welcome the opportunity to further engage with riders, policymakers and the unions as the sharing economy in Britain continues to grow.\u201d The union is set to hold a campaign meeting for drivers and supporters on Tuesday night.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bumper box office takings, strong trade in pubs and a rush for winter clothes drove a solid rise in consumer spending last month, according to new figures. Barclaycard said spending rose 5.5% on a year earlier in October, the strongest growth since it started publishing monthly health checks on consumer finances in 2011. But it warned the trend of solid spending growth could soon fizzle out as households worry about inflation. It also highlighted that not all October\u2019s spending growth was down to consumer resilience, with part of the rise merely reflecting the fact some things were more expensive than a year ago. With the weak pound pushing up prices on forecourts, for example, petrol spending was up 6.6% in October, the fastest increase for more than two years. Hotel spending rose 11.2% as Britons faced unfavourable exchange rates when travelling abroad. Amid warnings that the weaker pound will squeeze living standards in the UK, a poll of 1,655 people to accompany Barclaycard\u2019s spending figures recorded a sharp drop in consumer sentiment. Only a third of people said they felt confident in the UK economy, compared with nearly half in September. The poll also noted widespread worries about higher prices after reports of tussles over pricing between supermarkets and a number of food manufacturers, including Birds Eye fish fingers, Walkers crisps, Typhoo and Unilever, the owner of Marmite. Imports to the UK have become more expensive since the vote to leave the EU sent the pound down sharply against other currencies. The cocktail of slower economic growth and rising inflation is widely expected to erode household incomes and last week the Bank of England warned people to prepare for higher prices. Barclaycard said 81% of shoppers expected to see an impact on the cost of everyday goods from changes in inflation over the next 12 months. The pound slumped the 30-year lows against the dollar after the shock vote to leave the EU in June and then fell further last month as comments from ministers suggested they would go for a hard Brexit deal that leaves the UK shut out of Europe\u2019s single market in return for tighter immigration controls. \u201cThe backdrop of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 headlines, the weakening pound and high profile issues such as \u2018Marmite-gate\u2019 mean consumers are starting to worry about the impact of inflation on their everyday lives,\u201d said Barclaycard managing director Paul Lockstone. \u201cAs we approach Christmas, an expensive time in many households, many consumers are telling us they plan to rein in their spending to ensure they are able to make ends meet.\u201d Cinema takings were one of the key drivers in last month\u2019s rise in consumer spending, helped by the release of The Girl on the Train, Inferno and Trolls. Cinema spending rose a record 20.9% on a year earlier. Reflecting a more general trend for consumers to favour experiences over things, spending at pubs and restaurants was also up strongly, by 12.5% and 12.2%, respectively. Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said spending on clothing rebounded in September as shoppers picked up winter clothing. Spending rose 4% on a year ago following a 1.8% drop in September. Separate figures from the British Retail Consortium also noted a pick-up in clothes sales last month.

But it warned the trend of solid spending growth could soon fizzle out as households worry about inflation.</p> <p>It also highlighted that not all October\u2019s spending growth was down to consumer resilience, with part of the rise merely reflecting the fact some things were more expensive than a year ago. With the weak pound pushing up prices on forecourts, for example, petrol spending was up 6.6% in October, the fastest increase for more than two years. Hotel spending rose 11.2% as Britons faced unfavourable exchange rates when travelling abroad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/six-mps-surprise-visit-sports-direct-shirebrook-warehouse\">Six MPs make surprise visit to Sports Direct's Shirebrook warehouse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid warnings that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/05/higher-inflation-rising-debt-millions-fall-living-standards\">the weaker pound will squeeze living standards in the UK</a>, a poll of 1,655 people to accompany Barclaycard\u2019s spending figures recorded a sharp drop in consumer sentiment. Only a third of people said they felt confident in the UK economy, compared with nearly half in September. </p> <p>The poll also noted widespread worries about higher prices after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/birds-eye-walkers-supermarkets-price-rise-brexit-vote-pound\">reports of tussles over pricing between supermarkets and a number of food manufacturers</a>, including Birds Eye fish fingers, Walkers crisps, Typhoo and Unilever, the owner of Marmite. Imports to the UK have become more expensive since the vote to leave the EU sent the pound down sharply against other currencies.</p> <p>The cocktail of slower economic growth and rising inflation is widely expected to erode household incomes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">last week the Bank of England warned people to prepare for higher prices</a>.</p> <p>Barclaycard said 81% of shoppers expected to see an impact on the cost of everyday goods from changes in inflation over the next 12 months.</p> <p>The pound slumped the 30-year lows against the dollar after the shock vote to leave the EU in June and then fell further last month as comments from ministers suggested they would go for a hard Brexit deal that leaves the UK shut out of Europe\u2019s single market in return for tighter immigration controls.</p> <p>\u201cThe backdrop of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 headlines, the weakening pound and high profile issues such as \u2018Marmite-gate\u2019 mean consumers are starting to worry about the impact of inflation on their everyday lives,\u201d said Barclaycard managing director Paul Lockstone.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs we approach Christmas, an expensive time in many households, many consumers are telling us they plan to rein in their spending to ensure they are able to make ends meet.\u201d</p> <p>Cinema takings were one of the key drivers in last month\u2019s rise in consumer spending, helped by the release of The Girl on the Train, Inferno and Trolls. Cinema spending rose a record 20.9% on a year earlier. Reflecting a more general trend for consumers to favour experiences over things, spending at pubs and restaurants was also up strongly, by 12.5% and 12.2%, respectively.</p> <p>Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said spending on clothing rebounded in September as shoppers picked up winter clothing. Spending rose 4% on a year ago following a 1.8% drop in September. </p> <p>Separate figures from the British Retail Consortium also noted a pick-up in clothes sales last month. That helped lift overall takings for retailers in October with sales up 1.7% on a year earlier in like-for-like terms, the biggest rise since January.</p> <p>The industry group also noted that foreign shoppers continued to boost retail sales as they come over the UK to take advantage of the weak pound to buy luxury items at lower prices.</p>",

In the second phase of the retailer\u2019s \u201cwaste less, save more\u201d programme, which aims to reduce food waste by 50% and save the average household \u00a3350 a year, funding is being extended to regions keen to replicate the lessons learned from an ongoing trial in Swadlincote, Derbyshire. After a nationwide search, Swadlincote was chosen from 200 applicants to trial the scheme, with residents invited to use a range of initiatives over a year including smart fridges and food-sharing apps. The findings from this trial, which started in January, are being used to create a blueprint for other communities. More than 110 regions from Dundee to Truro \u2013 so-called discovery communities \u2013 that have signed up in support of the initiative will receive funding, though other regions are still able to apply. The scheme is being announced at an event in Birmingham on Tuesday. British families could save an average of \u00a3700 a year by wasting less food, according to the government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap, which is monitoring the Swadlincote project. In addition to the funding, Sainsbury\u2019s will advise communities on how to replicate the work in Swadlincote. These free and low-cost solutions include organising community events and schools programmes through to larger initiatives such as the introduction of neighbourhood fridges. \u201cToday marks a significant milestone in our waste less, save more programme as we broaden out our focus from a single trial town to sharing our learnings with communities up and down the UK,\u201d said Paul Crewe, head of sustainability at Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cWith well over 100 communities already signed up, the response so far has been overwhelming and really highlights that the nation is waking up to food waste.\u201d Trials under way in Swadlincote include the Olio app (available worldwide since October), which facilitates food sharing among neighbours, and the Fab Foods project, which engages with local schools. Elsewhere households are testing technology such as smart fridges with internal cameras.
