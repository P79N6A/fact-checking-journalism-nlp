      "bodyText": "The treasurer, Joe Hockey, is preparing to forecast budget deficits totalling about $100bn over four years and reveal deeper cuts to Australia\u2019s foreign aid spending. The government\u2019s mid year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), to be released on Monday, is expected to contain gloomy news on unemployment and will confirm significant revenue write-downs caused by weaker global demand and a large fall in commodity prices. News Corp reported the projected budget deficit for the current financial year would be more than $40bn, up from $29.8bn in the May budget. Myefo is expected to project deficits totalling $100bn over four years, up from the $60.3bn predicted in May. Hockey also told News Corp the government would make further cuts to foreign aid. These saving are expected to be worth about $1bn each year, totalling $4bn over the budget cycle. The government had already targeted the foreign aid budget for the biggest single saving measure in the May budget. That earlier $7.6bn cut from budgeted foreign aid spending did not require specific legislation. In the lead-up to Myefo, Hockey has been preparing the ground for significant revenue write-downs and a delay to the return to surplus. He said on Sunday the document would reveal the biggest fall in Australia\u2019s terms of trade in more than 50 years. In explaining why he would not make further deep cuts to domestic spending, Hockey said the budget needed to act as a \u201cshock absorber\u201d to safeguard jobs and prosperity. Labor has accused Hockey of hypocrisy given his strong criticisms of the former Gillard government over revenue write-downs. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said he would not play the \u201csilly game\u201d of blaming Hockey for the falling iron ore price, but vowed to hold the treasurer to account for the impact of his budget policies on consumer confidence and employment. \u201cHis blunders and his bluster, his words and his actions, have affected the real economy,\u201d Bowen told the ABC.

      "bodyText": "Plans are to be drawn up to give more confidence about the way banks measure their financial strength in the wake of the 2008 crisis. Accountants are to devise standards to measure a key element of the way banks assess how much capital they need to hold, in an attempt to address the concerns of investors and regulators about methods currently being used. The move by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, comes as the banking industry awaits the results of the first annual health check of its financial strength by the Bank of England. The outcome of tests on seven banks and one building society are to be released at 7am on Tuesday and could have repercussions for how the businesses operate in the years ahead. The ICAEW said it was beginning work on drawing up standards for the way bank capital is measured, after discussions with the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, which regulates the major banks and insurance companies. It is looking at devising ways to verify how banks measure their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) \u2013 a key component in their capital ratios which gauge banks\u2019 abilities to withstand losses. The ICAEW said there was not a common way of assessing the risk attached to loans and that it was planning to address this situation. \u201cIf a bank wanted to flatter its market image at present, it is most likely to be through manipulating its RWAs. Some of the lack of comparability relates to the amount of subjectivity in the capital rules themselves,\u201d said Iain Coke, head of the ICAEW\u2019s Financial Services Faculty. \u201cThe time is right to look at providing assurance on RWAs,\u201d he said. The accountancy body had raised concerns during the financial crisis, about the fact that capital ratios were not audited. It was now finding that investors had less trust in the capital numbers being published by banks. A formal consultation is expected to take place in early 2015. The Bank of England\u2019s tests are on eight major lenders. Four of them \u2013 HSBC, Barclays and bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 have previously been subjected to the tests conducted by the European Banking Authority, and four were not (Co-operative Bank, Santander UK, Standard Chartered and Nationwide building society). The Bank is assessing their abilities to maintain a so-called tier-one capital ratio of 4.5% after being subjected to a number of hypothetical scenarios, including a 35% fall in house prices and a rise in base rates to above 4%.",

      "bodyText": "There are many secrets in the legal world but possibly few as bizarre as that of Patrick Drake. Bored with his ill-judged career choice to become a lawyer, the young food enthusiast led a double life while working at Clifford Chance, dealing with his various briefs during office hours but sneaking into the kitchen of the fine dining room on the 30th floor during lunchtime to learn as much as he could. These clandestine sessions were a leading factor in Drake quitting the law \u2013 colleagues thought he had \u201clost his marbles\u201d \u2013 and becoming a founding member of Hello Fresh, one of a new wave of companies working to re-engineer the takeaway meal. Inspired by a similar model in Sweden, the company delivers ingredients and recipes so customers can quickly make their own meals from a menu of dishes such as satay chicken and pasta with roasted squash. Restricting customers\u2019 shopping basket to the exact quantity of ingredients required also reduces the potential for waste because the cooks at home don\u2019t end up with a cupboard full of spice jars they have only used once or twice. Customers generally order three to five meals for two or four people \u2013 the most popular choice works out at \u00a36.50 per meal \u2013 and the meat or vegetarian option is delivered in specially crafted boxes along with a menu and recipes. Drake says the system encourages people to attempt dishes they have not made before by making it simple for them. \u201cThere is that intimidation factor with cooking \u2013 that \u2018I have never tried this recipe before so I am not going to try it\u2019,\u201d says Drake. \u201cLayered on top of that is that, if you want to try a new recipe, you probably have to buy three different types of spices, maybe never use them again and you will have to buy a whole pot which will stay in the back of your cupboard for five, maybe eight, years. I have found a pot in my cupboard from when I was a student and that is a waste of money. \u201cThe core of it is taking away the tyranny of choice for people. Just saying \u2018Here is the option, you don\u2019t need to do any thinking, you just follow the pictures on the back of the recipe card.\u2019\u201d Hello Fresh launched simultaneously in Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and the UK three years ago and has progressed from Drake and his colleagues packing Parmesan cheese in his London flat and making deliveries on the tube to raising more than \u00a345m in three rounds of funding through e-commerce venture capital group Rocket Internet and expanding into the US. The concept of delivering an unprepared meal has attracted other players. Berlin start-up Marley Spoon started delivering in the UK last month after first taking orders in Germany. Co-founder Fabian Siegel says that, rent aside, food is the biggest expenditure for most people. \u201cIt is a bigger industry than the car industry. It is a massive industry that hasn\u2019t been touched by e-commerce, that hasn\u2019t been touched by technology. I won\u2019t even say it is a low-tech industry, I would say that it is a no-tech industry. \u201cThere are hundreds of millions of tonnes of food being thrown away in the European Union every year so we thought that is a massive industry.\u201d Marley Spoon tells its customers they only need salt, pepper and oil and it will provide the rest of the ingredients. Its minimum order is four portions per delivery, at an average price of about \u00a38 per dish, which will last five days in the fridge. Siegel says it can often work out cheaper to buy from his service and get what you need rather than buying ingredients that you end up throwing away. \u201cWhen you cook for yourself, you buy in the supermarket sauces but the quantities are not what you need,\u201d he says. The rise of the celebrity chef in recent years and the boom in television shows and spin-off books has opened up the opportunity for companies like theirs, he says. \u201cI feel the success of cooking shows made the market ready for a product like this. You want to cook and you want to get inspiration for new things and we make it very easy for you,\u201d Siegel says. Drake thinks the service offers access to foods that may otherwise be unavailable. \u201cIf you are living in rural Shropshire, you don\u2019t necessarily have access to an Asian supermarket that does rice noodles and kimchi and mirin. There is a sense for people outside London that we want to be doing what they are doing too,\u201d he says. But they are problems. The perception among customers that what Hello Fresh offers is an alternative to shopping and not an occasional one-off treat is the greatest stumbling block, says Drake. Eager to eat healthily but unable to find consistent options for eating after work in the City, friends Marcus Price and Niall Crowley set up Evolve, a home delivery service for paleo ready-meals. The diet, which is popular in the US, removes dairy, grains and processed sugars with dishes using alternatives, such as swapping standard rice for cauliflower rice or sweet potato noodles. \u201cCooking is not my strong point.\u201d says Crowley. \u201cSo there was a need for people like ourselves that are working long hours and don\u2019t have the ability to cook.\u201d After starting to sell the meals at their local gym, they are distributing about 6,000 meals a month, at \u00a312 each, to a loyal audience of about 300 a week, mostly in the City of London. What\u2019s in the box? The specific shopping box which contains individually proportioned ingredients is dictated by the exact menus on the recipe cards. Dishes typically alternate depending on where you live \u2013 a sample Hello Fresh menu in the UK has peppered pork fillet and a meatball curry while in the US there is a coffee-rubbed steak taco. Single garlic cloves are included instead of a whole bulb along with individual sticks of celery and small pots of sauces and cheeses.",

You want to cook and you want to get inspiration for new things and we make it very easy for you,\u201d Siegel says.</p> <p>Drake thinks the service offers access to foods that may otherwise be unavailable. \u201cIf you are living in rural Shropshire, you don\u2019t necessarily have access to an Asian supermarket that does rice noodles and kimchi and mirin. There is a sense for people outside London that we want to be doing what they are doing too,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But they are problems. The perception among customers that what Hello Fresh offers is an alternative to shopping and not an occasional one-off treat is the greatest stumbling block, says Drake.</p> <p>Eager to eat healthily but unable to find consistent options for eating after work in the City, friends Marcus Price and Niall Crowley set up <a href=\"https://eatevolve.com/\" title=\"\">Evolve, a home delivery service for paleo ready-meals</a>. The diet, which is popular in the US, removes dairy, grains and processed sugars with dishes using alternatives, such as swapping standard rice for cauliflower rice or sweet potato noodles.</p> <p>\u201cCooking is not my strong point.\u201d says Crowley. \u201cSo there was a need for people like ourselves that are working long hours and don\u2019t have the ability to cook.\u201d</p> <p>After starting to sell the meals at their local gym, they are distributing about 6,000 meals a month, at \u00a312 each, to a loyal audience of about 300 a week, mostly in the City of London.</p> <h2>What\u2019s in the box?<br></h2> <p>The specific shopping box which contains individually proportioned ingredients is dictated by the exact menus on the recipe cards. Dishes typically alternate depending on where you live \u2013 a sample Hello Fresh menu in the UK has peppered pork fillet and a meatball curry while in the US there is a coffee-rubbed steak taco. Single garlic cloves are included instead of a whole bulb along with individual sticks of celery and small pots of sauces and cheeses.</p>",

The price of thermal coal has dropped 15% and wheat has fallen 20%.</p> <p>Hockey acknowledged that unemployment was \u201ca tick higher\u201d than expected in the May budget. Growth would remain sluggish at 2.5%, but would increase to 3% in the coming years.<br></p> <p>Labor says Hockey must accept responsibility for the figures.</p> <p>\u201cThe collapse in consumer confidence, the growing unemployment queues, the fall in employment growth have all occurred since Joe Hockey\u2019s budget. This has occurred not only on his watch, but after his budget,\u201d the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said, adding that the \u201cfull catastrophe\u201d would be revealed in Myefo on Monday.<br></p> <p>Hockey implored Labor and the crossbenchers to adopt the government\u2019s key budget savings measures, issuing this warning: \u201cWithout change we are going to weaken ourselves. Therefore, we have to undertake economic reform to strengthen the Australian economy, to make us more robust to meet head-on the challenges of the future.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is important that we allow the budget to continue to be a shock absorber, and I say to the Labor party, the Greens and the independents, if you want to see the Australian economy cope better with the challenges that are beyond our control, work with us to strengthen the Australian budget.</p> <p>\u201cDo not continue to provide mindless opposition to the budget initiatives because ultimately it reduces our capacity as a nation to deal with some of the headwinds that we are facing.\u201d</p> <p>The economist Chris Richardson, from Deloitte Access Economics, told Guardian Australia that the budget savings measures flagged in May were \u201cchicken feed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy is hitting the budget pretty hard rather than the other way around,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThe fall-off in the temporary [resources] boom is accelerating.\u201d</p> <p>He said that the Coalition has faced a worsening economic situation compared with the previous Labor government, and that the budget measures announced in May would not have pushed the budget back into the black even if they had been adopted in full.</p> <p>Earlier in the week Hockey abandoned the 2018 deadline for getting the budget back into surplus, but on Sunday he denied he had ever promised such a strict timeframe.</p> <p>\u201cI never set a target. That was implied by the Labor party,\u201d he said. </p> <p>As recently <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2013/s3677610.htm\">as January 2013</a>, Hockey had committed to returning the budget to surplus within the first full year of the Coalition winning office.</p> <p>Bowen said: \u201cDoes he think the Australian people were asleep at the last election campaign when the now prime minister and treasurer went around the country promising a return to surplus? Of course for every other pathetic broken promise Tony Abbott\u2019s excuse is fixing the budget and returning it to surplus. Even that pathetic excuse has now disappeared.\u201d </p> <p>The nation\u2019s biggest banks are urging the government to get on with implementing its budget policies, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/banks-sound-budget-alert-stalled-budget-hurting-economy-20141213-125ysq.html\">telling Fairfax</a> that delays in implementing the policies are adding to uncertainty and poor consumer confidence.<br></p> <p>Those statements come after reports that the Coalition will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/13/abbott-government-reported-to-be-axing-175-agencies-with-job-losses\">axe a further 175 government agencies</a> on top of the 76 it slashed in the May budget to save money.</p> <p>The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, admitted there would be job losses as a result of the closures, but said they were necessary. </p> <p>\u201cWe inherited a bloated public service from our predecessors,\u201d Cormann told Sky News on Saturday. \u201cIf you reduce the number of government bodies, there will be an impact on jobs across the public service.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we will see is that as a result of our reform efforts so far \u2026 the size of the public service will be back down to the same level as what it was in 2007, 2008. We think that\u2019s appropriate.</p> <p>\u201cThe goal is to ensure that the government is as big as it needs to be but as small as it can be.\u201d</p>",

The price of thermal coal has dropped 15% and wheat has fallen 20%. Hockey acknowledged that unemployment was \u201ca tick higher\u201d than expected in the May budget. Growth would remain sluggish at 2.5%, but would increase to 3% in the coming years. Labor says Hockey must accept responsibility for the figures. \u201cThe collapse in consumer confidence, the growing unemployment queues, the fall in employment growth have all occurred since Joe Hockey\u2019s budget. This has occurred not only on his watch, but after his budget,\u201d the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said, adding that the \u201cfull catastrophe\u201d would be revealed in Myefo on Monday. Hockey implored Labor and the crossbenchers to adopt the government\u2019s key budget savings measures, issuing this warning: \u201cWithout change we are going to weaken ourselves. Therefore, we have to undertake economic reform to strengthen the Australian economy, to make us more robust to meet head-on the challenges of the future. \u201cIt is important that we allow the budget to continue to be a shock absorber, and I say to the Labor party, the Greens and the independents, if you want to see the Australian economy cope better with the challenges that are beyond our control, work with us to strengthen the Australian budget. \u201cDo not continue to provide mindless opposition to the budget initiatives because ultimately it reduces our capacity as a nation to deal with some of the headwinds that we are facing.\u201d The economist Chris Richardson, from Deloitte Access Economics, told Guardian Australia that the budget savings measures flagged in May were \u201cchicken feed\u201d. \u201cThe economy is hitting the budget pretty hard rather than the other way around,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThe fall-off in the temporary [resources] boom is accelerating.\u201d He said that the Coalition has faced a worsening economic situation compared with the previous Labor government, and that the budget measures announced in May would not have pushed the budget back into the black even if they had been adopted in full. Earlier in the week Hockey abandoned the 2018 deadline for getting the budget back into surplus, but on Sunday he denied he had ever promised such a strict timeframe. \u201cI never set a target. That was implied by the Labor party,\u201d he said. As recently as January 2013, Hockey had committed to returning the budget to surplus within the first full year of the Coalition winning office. Bowen said: \u201cDoes he think the Australian people were asleep at the last election campaign when the now prime minister and treasurer went around the country promising a return to surplus? Of course for every other pathetic broken promise Tony Abbott\u2019s excuse is fixing the budget and returning it to surplus. Even that pathetic excuse has now disappeared.\u201d The nation\u2019s biggest banks are urging the government to get on with implementing its budget policies, telling Fairfax that delays in implementing the policies are adding to uncertainty and poor consumer confidence. Those statements come after reports that the Coalition will axe a further 175 government agencies on top of the 76 it slashed in the May budget to save money. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, admitted there would be job losses as a result of the closures, but said they were necessary. \u201cWe inherited a bloated public service from our predecessors,\u201d Cormann told Sky News on Saturday. \u201cIf you reduce the number of government bodies, there will be an impact on jobs across the public service. \u201cWhat we will see is that as a result of our reform efforts so far \u2026 the size of the public service will be back down to the same level as what it was in 2007, 2008. We think that\u2019s appropriate. \u201cThe goal is to ensure that the government is as big as it needs to be but as small as it can be.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "House prices fall by an unprecedented 35% and base rates jump above 4%, putting pressure on household finances already feeling the pain of falling real incomes. Unemployment doubles to 12% and inflation rockets in an economy being buffeted by a sharp drop in the value of the pound. In the worst slump in almost a century, Britain\u2019s big banks are struggling to fund themselves on the international financial markets as they face the prospect of a wave of homebuyers and big companies defaulting on their debts. This bleak scenario is the stress test the Bank of England is running on seven banks and one building society to assess their financial strength, with the results to be released at 7am on Tuesday. These are the first tests to be run concurrently on lenders and are likely to become an annual event, incorporating lessons learned from the 2008 crisis, when banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland were exposed as running on wafer-thin capital ratios and unable to withstand the storm. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said: \u201cAnnual stress tests form the third leg of the Bank of England\u2019s approach to regulating bank capital.\u201d The other two involve looking at the risks attached to assets and the leverage ratio method of assessing capital strength. Although the tests are based on hypothetical scenarios, the results could have implications for the banks taking part. Dividend payouts to shareholders could be at risk or banks could be forced to pull out of businesses. Institutions could be forced to raise more capital. The Co-op Bank has already warned it might fail while Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s hopes to pay a dividend for the first time since 2008 could be scuppered. This comes only weeks after stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which the four UK banks involved \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 all passed. Those four are now being included in the Bank of England\u2019s test along with Co-operative Bank, Nationwide building society, Santander UK and Standard Chartered. Some of the scenarios are the same as those tested by EBA, such as a \u201cmarket tantrum\u201d in Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey, but the UK-specific test is tougher. Threadneedle Street\u2019s approach is also different because the regulator takes accounts of efforts banks would make to improve capital positions once the crisis is under way. But the Bank has said it could exercise discretion and come down hard on a bank even though technically it managed to struggle over the line in terms of capital strength. The market, too, \u201cwill credit those that have a more substantial cushion than those that do not\u201d, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. So how will Britain\u2019s well-known high street names fare? \u25a0 Barclays will want to avoid a re-run of events last year when boss Antony Jenkins was forced to ask shareholders for \u00a36bn. The central bank is not assessing banks on the same measure this time around and Jenkins will want to head off any scenario under which the bank would need to turn to its investors again. \u25a0 Co-operative Bank has already admitted that it looks likely to fail the stress test, which comes after an 18-month period in which it has already been forced to raise almost \u00a32bn of fresh capital. As a result the UK\u2019s largest mutual, the Co-operative Group, has been forced to give up its 100% ownership which now stands at just 20%. A bonus package for Niall Booker, the chief executive, is having to be rewritten and a disposal programme is likely to be accelerated. \u25a0 Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 24% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 is focused on being able to resume dividend payments for the first time since the 2008 crisis. A strong stress test result might be seen as a green light for payments, although its exposure to the mortgage market \u2013 its Halifax arm is the biggest lender \u2013 could be a negative. \u201cWe view Lloyds as most at risk, due to its large exposure to UK mortgages,\u201d say analysts at Citi. \u25a0 Nationwide building society, like Barclays, was forced to take steps to bolster its capital position last year when the Bank of England was focusing on the leverage ratio \u2013 measuring capital relative to the size of loans. \u25a0 Royal Bank of Scotland had to admit it had made mistakes in the European stress tests, which it eventually passed with a narrow margin after taking account of the error. The 81%-taxpayer owned bank will want to avoid embarrassment this time. \u25a0 Spanish bank Santander has been contemplating a flotation of its UK arm since 2010, but that has been postponed on a number of occasions. The results of the stress tests may not revive the process but are a challenge for new boss Nathan Bostock, who joined from RBS six months ago. \u25a0 HSBC was the strongest of the UK banks in the EBA stress tests and will not be as exposed to the UK economy as some of the more domestic banks. \u25a0 Standard Chartered might not have been much of a focus for the City in the past but these tests come at a time when investors are questioning the capital position of the bank because of its exposure to commodities and the economies of India, China and Korea. Any weakness detected in the capital position could intensify the pressure on chief executive Peter Sands. While there are eight lenders on the list this year, more banks could be added next year, according to Robert Smith of KPMG, who believes the large UK subsidiaries of overseas banks could be included in the future. Experts are also watching to see if the Bank of England adopts the approach of the US central bank, the US Federal Reserve, which also includes an analysis of internal control systems. When it announced the terms of the tests in April, the Bank of England said that even if banks did remain above the minimum level it was setting \u2013 4.5% core tier one capital \u2013 it could still demand action. Among the other reasons it cited was \u201cthe extent to which potentially significant risks are not quantified adequately or fully as part of the stress\u201d.",

Those four are now being included in the Bank of England\u2019s test along with Co-operative Bank, Nationwide building society, Santander UK and Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Some of the scenarios are the same as those tested by EBA, such as a \u201cmarket tantrum\u201d in Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey, but the UK-specific test is tougher. Threadneedle Street\u2019s approach is also different because the regulator takes accounts of efforts banks would make to improve capital positions once the crisis is under way. But the Bank has said it could exercise discretion and come down hard on a bank even though technically it managed to struggle over the line in terms of capital strength.</p> <p>The market, too, \u201cwill credit those that have a more substantial cushion than those that do not\u201d, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. So how will Britain\u2019s well-known high street names&#xa0;fare?</p> <p>\u25a0 Barclays will want to avoid a re-run of events last year when boss Antony Jenkins was forced to ask shareholders for \u00a36bn. The central bank is not assessing banks on the same measure this time around and Jenkins will want to head off any scenario under which the bank would need to turn to its investors again.</p> <p>\u25a0 Co-operative Bank has already admitted that it looks likely to fail the stress test, which comes after an 18-month period in which it has already been forced to raise almost \u00a32bn of fresh capital. As a result the UK\u2019s largest mutual, the Co-operative Group, has been forced to give up its 100% ownership which now stands at just 20%. A bonus package for Niall Booker, the chief executive, is having to be rewritten and a disposal programme is likely to be accelerated.</p> <p>\u25a0 Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 24% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 is focused on being able to resume dividend payments for the first time since the 2008 crisis. A strong stress test result might be seen as a green light for payments, although its exposure to the mortgage market \u2013 its Halifax arm is the biggest lender \u2013 could be a negative. \u201cWe view Lloyds as most at risk, due to its large exposure to UK mortgages,\u201d say analysts at Citi.</p> <p>\u25a0 Nationwide building society, like Barclays, was forced to take steps to bolster its capital position last year when the Bank of England was focusing on the leverage ratio \u2013 measuring capital relative to the size of loans.</p> <p>\u25a0 Royal Bank of Scotland had to admit it had made mistakes in the European stress tests, which it eventually passed with a narrow margin after taking account of the error. The 81%-taxpayer owned bank will want to avoid embarrassment this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8da096bbdb05a6d7918c5c9f58d2a1c0fcc3d700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/12/1418404482450/e69dc9ab-90e8-4f4e-885c-ff0177dce3f7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Santander sign\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santander will be entering the tests under a new chief executive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Gee/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u25a0 Spanish bank Santander has been contemplating a flotation of its UK arm since 2010, but that has been postponed on a number of occasions. The results of the stress tests may not revive the process but are a challenge for new boss Nathan Bostock, who joined from RBS six months ago.</p> <p>\u25a0 HSBC was the strongest of the UK banks in the EBA stress tests and will not be as exposed to the UK economy as some of the more domestic banks.</p> <p>\u25a0 Standard Chartered might not have been much of a focus for the City in the past but these tests come at a time when investors are questioning the capital position of the bank because of its exposure to commodities and the economies of India, China and Korea. Any weakness detected in the capital position could intensify the pressure on chief executive Peter&#xa0;Sands.</p> <p>While there are eight lenders on the list this year, more banks could be added next year, according to Robert Smith of KPMG, who believes the large UK subsidiaries of overseas banks could be included in the future.</p> <p>Experts are also watching to see if the Bank of England adopts the approach of the US central bank, the US Federal Reserve, which also includes an analysis of internal control systems.</p> <p>When it announced the terms of the tests in April, the Bank of England said that even if banks did remain above the minimum level it was setting \u2013 4.5% core tier one capital \u2013 it could still demand action. Among the other reasons it cited was \u201cthe extent to which potentially significant risks are not quantified adequately or fully as part of the stress\u201d.</p>",
