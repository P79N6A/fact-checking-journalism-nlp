      "bodyText": "Hong Kong has been named the world\u2019s most expensive city for expats as concerns over a possible UK exit from the EU contribute to London dropping from 12th to 17th, according to an annual survey. As a result, the British capital is now cheaper than New York, Beijing, Tokyo and Zurich. It is also more affordable than Luanda, the capital of Angola, and Chad\u2019s capital, N\u2019Djamena. According to consultancy firm Mercer, all the UK cities included in its cost of living survey have dropped down the rankings this year, with Birmingham and Glasgow falling 16 and 10 places respectively to 96th and 119th. Now in its 22nd year, the survey covers 209 cities across five continents and is designed to help major employers work out living costs for their expatriate workers by looking at the price of more than 200 items, from housing and transport to a cup of coffee and a bottle of beer. It names the three cheapest cities in the world for expats as Windhoek in Namibia, Cape Town, and Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan. Two European cities are in the top 10: Zurich, which takes third place, and Geneva in eighth. Renting accommodation represents one of the largest costs, and to be suitable, a house or flat must be \u201cof international standards\u201d and located in \u201can appropriate neighbourhood\u201d. These requirements, plus the need for the houses and flats to be safe and secure, may help explain why the top 10 includes some cities that not everyone would expect to be judged the world\u2019s priciest. Luanda came in second place after topping the table last year; Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is sixth, and N\u2019Djamena is ninth. According to Mercer, the monthly rent for an appropriate unfurnished three-bedroom house in Luanda would be more than \u00a310,600, compared with the \u00a35,000 figure quoted for London. The falling rankings for UK cities would appear to be connected with the decline in the value of the pound. New York is used as the base city for all comparisons and currency movements are measured against the US dollar. Ellyn Karetnick, the head of international mobility practice at Mercer, said: \u201cAlthough the value of the euro has remained steady against the US dollar, the pound has fallen, largely due to Brexit fears. But while currency fluctuations will always cause a major impact on costs, local conditions such as high property prices can counterbalance the impact of currency movements.\u201d",

US officials alleged that the company did not promptly repair leaks of a hydrochlorofluorocarbon that the chain used as a coolant in its stores\u2019 refrigerators. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons are an ozone-depleting substance and a potent greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. The federal complaint also said the company had not kept adequate records of refrigerator repairs. \u201cSome of the refrigerants now in use by Trader Joe\u2019s are up to 4,700 times more potent than carbon dioxide,\u201d said Alexis Strauss, an EPA official, in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement will affect all of Trader Joe\u2019s current and new stores to prevent the release of approximately 31,000 metric tons of carbon-equivalent greenhouse gases.\u201d The settlement, which was filed on Tuesday, stipulates that the company commit to reducing coolant leaks in its refrigerators in the majority of its stores. Trader Joe\u2019s stores will maintain a leak rate of 12.1% through 2019, according to the consent decree. Across the grocery store industry, refrigerators leak potentially harmful coolants at an average rate of 25%, officials said in a statement. In addition, all new Trader Joe\u2019s stores will use a different refrigerator coolant that is less harmful to the ozone layer. These changes, which include a new leak management system, will cost the California-based chain about $2m over the next three years. Federal officials estimate that the chain\u2019s future reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will equal the amount from 6,500 personal vehicles driven in one year, according to a statement. \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s looks forward to working with the EPA in its mission to reduce air pollution and protect the ozone layer, and, with this agreement, has committed to reducing its emissions to a rate that matches the best of the industry,\u201d the company said in a written statement. The settlement will be made final following a 30-day public comment period. The EPA previously reached similar settlements with Safeway Inc in 2013 and Costco Wholesale Corp in 2014 over refrigerator leaks.",

      "bodyText": "MPs have asked Lady Tina Green, Sir Philip Green\u2019s wife, to explain the \u201cvery opaque web\u201d of family companies behind their retail empire. The parliamentary committee investigating the demise of BHS want her to reveal the offshore companies in which she or other family members are the ultimate controlling party. The request could lead to an unprecedented glimpse into the complex offshore structure behind the Greens\u2019 family businesses, including Arcadia, which runs Topshop, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins. In a letter to Tina Green, the MPs ask for a list of directors and shareholders at each of her companies, and details of her husband\u2019s role in running them. She is also asked to explain which country each company is registered in and the reason for that, and any income she or her companies enjoy from the acquisition of BHS and other retail brands. The letter has been published by MPs along with a collection of other documents that shed further light on the collapse of BHS, which has put 11,000 jobs at risk and left a \u00a3571m deficit in the pension scheme. The Greens controlled BHS for 15 years until they sold it to Dominic Chappell, a three-time bankrupt, for \u00a31 in March 2015. The documents show that Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, defaulted on a loan a week after buying BHS, leading to higher charges, and that his advisers explored the possibility of Green underwriting the professional fees he had to pay to buy BHS. They also show that Arcadia made its \u00a35m annual contribution to the BHS pension scheme, which it agreed when it sold the company, through a \u00a340m loan it had already provided. Iain Wright, the chair of the business, innovation and skills committee, said: \u201cDuring the hearings of our BHS inquiries, a whole array of further questions have been raised about how a big high-street name with 11,000 staff was sold for a \u00a31 to someone with no experience of retail. \u201cThe evidence so far points to a complex and very opaque web of privately-owned family businesses which helped make the deal possible. These complicated arrangements make it very difficult to trace where all the funds have gone. \u201cWe are keen to follow the money and look forward to Lady Green, in her capacity as owner and ultimate beneficiary of these companies, writing to us to explain some of these arrangements and to set out what income her businesses have received from BHS.\u201d MPs threatened to call Lady Green to appear in person before the parliamentary committee after her husband gave evidence last week. The billionaire tycoon promised to resolve the problems facing the pension scheme and apologised for the collapse of the department store chain during an extraordinary six-hour meeting. Green said the problems facing the BHS scheme were \u201cresolvable and sortable\u201d. He pledged to find a solution that involves BHS workers getting a better deal than if the scheme entered the pension protection fund, where they would suffer a 10% cut to their benefits. \u201cWe will sort it, we will find a solution,\u201d Green said. \u201cI want to give assurance to the 20,000 pensioners that I am here to sort this, in the correct way. We are working on it. As we speak there is a team currently working. It is in motion.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "All possible preparations have been made for the EU referendum, the banks keep telling us. Even the cash machines will be stuffed full, just in case an obscure continental lender chooses Friday to go bust and trigger unnecessary panic. One assumes this confidence is well-founded. Presented with an opportunity on Tuesday to help themselves to some extra spare cash courtesy of the Bank of England, UK banks responded with a collective \u201cthanks for the offer, but actually we\u2019re fine\u201d. They took up just \u00a3370m in a special loan facility designed by Threadneedle Street to ensure the financial system is comfortably supplied over the referendum period. This was the second of three special auctions, and the third is next week. The first, conducted last week, saw demand for \u00a32.6bn. As such, Tuesday\u2019s result represented a mere trickle. There are two possible interpretations. One is that the banks, scarred by their experiences in the post-Lehman turmoil of 2008, have done a belt-and-braces job this time. They are prepared for anything and are determined that liquidity will not be a problem even in the event of a strong vote for Brexit. The other explanation is complacency. That would be alarming. It would mean the banks have been infected by the sudden outbreak of confidence that remain is heading for victory. They would rather assume the bookmakers have got their odds correct than pay a small penalty, in the form of posting collateral with the Bank, for the security of extra cash. To repeat, there is no reason to doubt the banks\u2019 confidence. They\u2019ve had an age to prepare, after all. But one can imagine the postmortem in front of a future parliamentary inquiry if liquidity becomes a problem. Mark Carney would be able to report that he did everything. He offered the banks all the help they could require, to the point of catching flak about scaremongering to suit the government\u2019s agenda. The bankers would be reduced to pleading, once again, that nobody could possibly have imagined that markets would run dry. It probably won\u2019t happen. Even if it did, it probably wouldn\u2019t be as severe as 2008. But the banks had better have their calculations right this time. A case of enlightened self-interest at Amazon? Amazon has a new boss in the UK. And finally the company seems to have understood that it was heading towards yet another row over non-payment of tax. On this occasion, the worry is not about corporation tax, or even Amazon directly. Rather, it\u2019s about VAT and the explosion in the number of overseas traders, mostly from China, who use Amazon\u2019s UK website and warehouses to sell goods to British consumers without charging VAT. HMRC seemed to be asleep to the fraud until it realised that \u00a31.5bn of lost tax revenue was a \u201cvery big issue\u201d. It took some diligent reporting by this newspaper to provoke meaningful interest from MPs and the government. Now Doug Gurr, Amazon\u2019s new UK chief, may have realised that the company\u2019s official stance \u2013 simply blame the Chinese traders and argue other people\u2019s VAT scams are not its lookout \u2013 probably wasn\u2019t sustainable indefinitely. As we reported on Tuesday, Amazon is quietly asking Chinese traders who use its website to provide a VAT number. This looks like an outbreak of enlightened self-interest on Amazon\u2019s part. Gurr should do more. There is a simple measure available to Amazon that would demonstrate good intentions and a willingness to make HMRC\u2019s job easier. It could insist that overseas traders selling to UK customers display a VAT number on Amazon\u2019s website, and it could delist those who refuse to comply. A public display of VAT registration would be more effective than a behind-the-scenes cleanup. The effect on Amazon\u2019s business would be minimal and adoption would follow the spirit of the relevant EU directive. Gurr should get on with it. Trouble may be brewing in China for Costa chain New-ish chief executive Alison Brittain hasn\u2019t yet banished the Whitbread doubters. A \u00a341 share price compares unfavourably to the \u00a354 seen in spring 2015, when growth seemed strong and easy to achieve. The latest update, however, provides further evidence that Costa Coffee and Premier Inn in the UK require only fine tuning, rather than an overhaul. In the market for overpriced coffee and pastries, Costa\u2019s like-for-like sales were up 2.6% in the last quarter, a decent recovery from the previous period. Premier Inn is not enjoying the slower London hotel market, but business elsewhere in the UK seems firm. Indeed, if there\u2019s a reason to worry, it\u2019s probably not on the home front. Look at China, billed as the next frontier for Costa. Tuesday\u2019s update contained the obligatory expression of excitement about long-term opportunities, but then came news of a \u201ctougher trading environment due to a weaker Chinese economy\u201d. Costa in China is meant to be young, fresh and exciting, a format immune to the economic weather. If it\u2019s not true, don\u2019t repeat others\u2019 mistakes and get dragged in.",

      "bodyText": "The two most powerful central bankers have warned that they are on high alert for financial and economic fallout from the EU referendum, amid signs that the result of Thursday\u2019s vote still hangs in the balance. On a day that saw Monday\u2019s big rises in shares and the pound halted by polls showing the race too close to call, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said he was prepared to use every available tool to protect the eurozone if the UK decides to leave. Draghi said: \u201cWe will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability. We stand ready to act by using all the instruments available within our mandate, if necessary, to achieve our objective. In particular, the ECB is ready for all contingencies following the UK\u2019s EU referendum.\u201d Janet Yellen, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, told Congress that in a world marked by sluggish growth, weak inflation and low interest rates investors could quickly become more risk averse. \u201cOne development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A UK vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIt could launch a period of uncertainty [with] negative economic consequences for the UK spilling over into Europe.\u201d As the referendum campaign reached its closing stages, the FTSE 100 marked time \u2013 closing 23 points higher at 6,227. The pound reached its highest level against the dollar since January during early trading on the foreign exchanges, but later slipped back to close slightly lower at just under $1.47. George Soros, the speculator who drove Britain out of the exchange rate mechanism, has warned that the UK markets faced a Black Friday in the event of a Brexit vote. This prompted a response from Norman Lamont, who was running the Treasury on Black Wednesday 24 years ago. He said: \u201cThe devaluation of sterling in September 1992 didn\u2019t do the UK economy any harm, far from it. Nor would a fall in the pound this time necessarily be a disaster. The key difference between now and 1992 is that today the pound is floating and any devaluation could be self-correcting and temporary.\u201d But other international economists backed Soros\u2019s view that there would be serious market turmoil in the event of a vote to leave. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, wrote in a blogpost: \u201cA Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15% off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses.\u201d He added that despite attempts to improve supervision of the financial system since the near-meltdown prompted by the Lehman Brothers collapse in September 2008, it was impossible to say how the system would respond to a Brexit vote. \u201cA return of systemic risk as large losses lead to cascading liquidations cannot be ruled out. At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave,\u201d he said. Nouriel Roubini, the economist nicknamed Dr Doom after accurately predicting the 2008 crisis, supported David Cameron\u2019s view that Brexit would leave Britons worse off. \u201cBrexit could stall the UK economy and tip it into a recession as the shock to business and consumer confidence could be severe,\u201d said Roubini, who teaches at New York University\u2019s Stern school of business. While giving evidence to the European parliament, Draghi said: \u201cWe monitor all economic, political and legal developments so we can assess and manage the ensuing risks. We have existing swap lines with other central banks. The agreements are there, we want to make sure they are useable, active and adequate. \u201cThe event will have short and long-term effects. It is hard to say what sort of action we would take in each contingency.\u201d But Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Washington-based thinktank, the Center for Economic Policy Research, said: \u201cThere is a Mafia-like quality to the threats emanating from EU officials, who are acknowledged to be contemplating how much punishment they can mete out to the UK if the people should dare to vote the wrong way.\u201d He added that the message was: \u201cVote remain and nobody gets hurt.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Convenience store chain My Local is on the verge of collapse after filing a notice of intention to appoint administrators, putting 1,700 jobs at risk. Accountancy firm KPMG, which has been working with My Local\u2019s management on considering options for the future of the 120-store chain, was lined up on Tuesday afternoon to handle an administration. It is currently not certain whether or not the administrators will be appointed. The notice provides protection from creditors for 10 days before the company potentially tips into administration. Any appointment could mean a possible liability of up to \u00a320m for Morrisons, which sold the convenience store chain to a group fronted by the retail veteran Mike Greene, who appeared on Channel 4 show The Secret Millionaire, for \u00a325m in September 2015. Greene\u2019s book, Failure Breeds Success, tells how he went bankrupt aged 27 before moving on to work in the retail sector and creating a retail consultancy called him! The My Local deal was backed by Greybull Capital, which was a co-investor, along with OpCapita, in Comet, the electrical retailer that collapsed in controversial circumstances in 2012. As part of the sale of its convenience stores, Morrisons retained a guarantee on a number of lease obligations, meaning that they will revert to the supermarket if My Local collapses. At the time of the sale, the leases on the stores were thought to have an average of about five years remaining. Morrisons sold 140 My Local stores, at which about 2,300 people were employed, but it is understood that 25 have already closed or been sold on, and about 600 jobs have gone as the chain has downsized amid disappointing sales. KPMG has looked at a number of options for the business, including the sale of up to 10 stores to the Co-operative Group. Joanne McGuinness, a national officer for the Usdaw union, said: \u201cMy Local staff are devastated by the news that the company is going into administration. Having been sold by Morrisons last year, there was a mood of optimism that the new owners could turn around the business. \u201cWe are talking to the company in a bid to save jobs and get the best deal for staff. In the meantime, Usdaw is providing the support, advice and representation they need at this unsettling time.\u201d The chain is understood to have suffered because of the poor location of its stores, many of which were former Blockbuster sites bought when the video rental chain went bankrupt. The grocery market is in the middle of a price war prompted by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have been rapidly opening stores and winning over more customers. According to retail analysts The Local Data Company, the convenience store market is reaching saturation, with the number of such shops declining last year in 288 towns in the UK. That comes as the total number of convenience stores increased by 21% from 13,617 in 2010 to 16,426 at the end of 2015. My Local is the latest retailer to come under pressure following the collapse of BHS and Austin Reed, both of which called in administrators in April. Brantano went into administration in January, but the majority of jobs were saved after the footwear chain was bought back by its owner Alteri a month later. Meanwhile, clothing chain Blue Inc, which includes the Officers Club menswear chain, also went into pre-pack administration at the start of this year with a plan to close more than 60 of its 240 stores, threatening 500 jobs. Greybull and My Local were unavailable for comment.",

      "bodyText": "After a shaky start it looked like markets would fail to build on Monday\u2019s strong gains. But shares moved into positive territory by the close as Wall Street edged higher and polls indicated the Remain camp was slightly ahead. But investors were still uneasy ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.36% or 22.55 points at 6226.55 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.54% to 10,015.54 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.61% better at 4367.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.45% to 17,431.17 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.23% at 8667.3 In Greece, the Athens market was 3.71% better at 608.29 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now 29 points or 0.16% higher. Sterling hit a five and a half month high before falling back, trading down 0.12% at $1.4659. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Janet Yellen has now finished her testimony. Another warning there may be liquidity problems on Friday following the referendum result: European markets closed higher, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, expects further volatility ahead of the EU vote: The prospects of a Brexit appears to be on a knife edge just two days before the UK goes to the polls. The IG Survation poll shows a clear narrowing between \u2018remain\u2019 (45%) and \u2018leave\u2019 (44%) campaigns, with the result likely to be dictated by the factors such as turnout and the action of the so far undecided (11%) voters. Yesterday may have seen a sharp relief rally in GBPUSD as \u2018leave\u2019 swung back into the lead, yet the increasingly \u2018too close to call\u2019 nature of this referendum should provide a highly unpredictable and volatile week in the markets. While there is only a marginal lead for \u2018remain\u2019 when polls are concerned, the IG Binary (currently 72% remain) shows that the money is clearly backing a decision to remain in the EU. Back with US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress. Asked further about Brexit Yellen says: It could launch a period of uncertainty [with] negative economic consequences for the UK spilling over into Europe. The market reaction could result in a risk off sentiment that we would see impact on the financial markets. We might see a flight to safety which might push up the dollar and other safe haven currencies. I don\u2019t want to overblow the likely impacts but we will watch it carefully. Could Brexit push the US into recession? I don\u2019t think that is the most likely case, but we just don\u2019t know what will happen. Fund manager Hargreaves Lansdown is the latest firm to say it will extend opening hours and has tripled its number of dealing staff to deal with the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Could we see an emergency bank holiday in the event of Brexit? Or even a Sunday trading session. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: George Soros is correct to say that a Brexit could lead to a catastrophic day for the pound but preparing for a re-run of Black Wednesday is not easy. Very few of those working on trading desks in 1992 are still in the City so there is something of the unknown about what\u2019s coming. Even the dark days of Lehmans are a distant memory for most traders. If Britain votes out, it\u2019s fair to say we will not have seen a day in the markets quite like it. The worry is that a collapse in sterling today could be much more devastating than it was a quarter of a century ago. If the markets go completely crazy we could see an emergency Bank Holiday declared, or even a Sunday trading session to limit panic and losses. Financial markets are much more interconnected than they were in the early 90s, although the processes and trading systems have come a long way. Speed and access to market information is much faster today than it was back in 1992 and Brexit is a known quantity in the sense that we know when it will happen if it does. Crashing out of ERM took everyone by surprise. Central banks are ready to step in with extra liquidity should markets be thrown into chaos and the Bank of England has currency swap lines in place if required. But it\u2019s interesting that the Bank of England says uptake of its most recent extra liquidity auction was lower than expected, which either suggests that UK banks do not anticipate Brexit happening or they have plenty of liquidity to play with. Confidence is high for Remain but markets may be underestimating the chances of Brexit. Equities are more complex. A slump in sterling could be net positive for FTSE 100 companies as up to 80% of earnings come from abroad. In fact the DAX and CAC may be a lot more exposed than the UK\u2019s blue chip index. Yellen had said at previous testimonies that the Fed was looking into whether negative rates would be legal. Asked for an update she says: We have the legal basis to pursue negative rates but it is not something we are considering or looking at. Back with Yellen and the Fed chair says a UK exit from the European Union could bring a period of uncertainty and financial volatility and affect the US outlook. She said the banks had put in place enhancements to liquidity [in the case of Brexit]. In another sign of mounting concern over Thursday\u2019s vote, global law firm Dechert has set up a new hotline for clients who need expert advice about Brexit. They\u2019ll be staffing it with lawyers, who can explain the legal implications if Britain votes to leave the EU. Miriam Gonzalez, co-chair of the firm\u2019s International Trade and Government Regulation practice, says a Leave victory would create \u201cenormous legal uncertainty\u201d. Clients will need to react to questions from employees, shareholders and investors, as well as assess which areas of their businesses would be most at risk. At Dechert we realise that speed will be of essence in the days following the referendum to avoid such legal uncertainly impacting negatively on our clients and that is why we are creating the tools to allow clients to have access to the expertise they will need. Draghi is quizzed further on Brexit and what problems he foresees. He says: I don\u2019t want to speculate on the outcome or the consequences. We monitor all economic, political and legal developments so we can assess and manage the ensuing risks. Mostly, to be able to stabilise markets, provide liquidity. We have existing swap lines with other central banks. The agreements are there, we want to make sure they are useable, active and adequate. The event will have short and long term effects. It is hard to say what sort of action we would take in each contingency. Back with Draghi on Brexit: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has again warned of the risk of the UK voting to leave the European Union. In her testimony to Congress she said: In the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. She also expressed concerns about the domestic US market and the outlook for China: The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk--that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in rece Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. So that means the Fed is \u201cclosely monitoring global economic and financial developments\u201d and taking a cautious approach to raising interest rates: The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further and that the economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds--which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth--mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards. George Soros has warned of the dangers of a \u201cBlack Friday\u201d for sterling in the event of a Brexit vote, and now Ladbrokes is offering odds of 3/1 on that happening. It will pay out if the pound falls by more than 15% against the dollar in the 24 hour window between midnight on the 23rd and 24th in the event of Brexit. Ladbrokes said: Remain gained more ground over leave during trading on Tuesday, with the latest Brexit barometer reading showing a 78% chance of a remain outcome, up from 74%, or 2/9 in betting terms, ahead of leave at 10/3. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: \u201cIn the event of Brexit we\u2019re not ruling out Black Friday at all. Britain has to vote to leave first however, and our barometer continues to tick round in favour of remain hour by hour.\u201d Yellen is delivering the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, and is likely to repeat the caution expressed by the Fed last week. The bank was concerned about weakness in the global economy, poor recent jobs figures and of course, the risks posed by the outcome of the UK referendum. The caution contrasted sharply with a number of hawkish comments made by Fed members in the run up to the disappointing non-farm payroll numbers. Analysts have gone from predicting three or four US rate rises this year to perhaps one at most. There\u2019s a brief moment of levity in Brussels, as Mario Draghi\u2019s mobile phone goes off as he\u2019s answering a question on the eurozone economy. Ahead of the latest testimony from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, Wall Street has opened in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 26 points or 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% and Nasdaq 0.25%. What does Mario Draghi mean when he says the European Central Bank is ready for \u201call contingencies\u201d following Thursday\u2019s vote? Well, the ECB is likely to unleash every weapon at its disposal to prevent a market crash, and prevent the financial system seizing up. And that will include massive injections of liquidity into the euro system, in partnership with the Bank of England. Last week, ECB board member Ewald Nowotny cited the \u2018swap lines\u2019 which central banks have, to share their respective currencies at times of crisis. Nowotny said: \u201cIf needed, it\u2019s secured that neither English nor European banks will have liquidity shortages\u201d. ECB ready to \u2018cushion\u2019 markets with liquidity after Brexit \u2013 Nowotny That would protect banks from having to sell their assets at bargain basement prices, to get their hands on cash. But it wouldn\u2019t prevent a general repricing of assets, such as the pound and UK stocks and shares. Central banks could also act together to prevent a sterling crisis, potentially propping up the pound to prevent it weakening too much against the US dollar, the euro and the yen. Here\u2019s a video clip of David Cameron\u2019s lunchtime skit at Downing Street: Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, has told the European Parliament that he is ready to take action if Britain votes to leave the EU. Draghi singled out the risks posed by Thursday\u2019s vote, while testifying to MEPs on the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee. He says that the recovery of the euro area economy \u201cgained momentum at the start of the year\u201d, but added: At the same time, uncertainty remains high and downside risks are still significant due to the continued fragile state of the global economy and geopolitical developments. We will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability. We stand ready to act by using all the instruments available within our mandate, if necessary, to achieve our objective. In particular, the ECB is ready for all contingencies following the UK\u2019s EU referendum. Draghi also reminded MEPs that further stimulus is coming soon, and urged them to help deepen the single market and reform their economies. Here\u2019s the full statement: The session is being streamed live here. Time for a quick catch-up. The pound has clambered to its highest level against the US dollar since early January today, as international investors continue to expect a Remain campaign victory in Thursday\u2019s EU referendum. Sterling hit $1.4781 this morning, its highest level since David Cameron called Thursday\u2019s vote. But it dipped back after a poll showed the Leave campaign close behind Remain, at 44% versus 45%. After a weak start, the London stock market has crawled back into positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up 2 points, lagging the rest of Europe today. UK banks have only taken \u00a3370m from the Bank of England in a special liquidity auction. One banker has told us that the City is less worried about the referendum. But Brexit fears have also been blamed for pushing Britain\u2019s public borrowing over target in last two months: Three top figures in economics and finance have all warned again leaving the EU. George Soros said it would trigger a sterling crash Nouriel Roubini predicted a recession, Larry Summers warned it could cause a market crash on Friday. But other City experts have warned that investors could be complacent; given the opinion polls are so close. Our main EU referendum liveblog is here (including speculation that the referendum could trigger a general election). The pound has dropped back after David Cameron made a solemn plea to the country to vote Remain. Speaking (unexpectedly) outside Number 10, the PM said the economy will be stronger if we stay, and weaker if we leave. He also cited national security, warning that it will be harder to keep the country safe outside the EU. At one point, Cameron declared that \u201cBrits don\u2019t quit\u201d; and that the EU will carry on making vital decisions without the UK after a leave vote. And he also made a direct appeal to older voters, saying Thursday\u2019s vote was vital for their children, grandchildren and future generations. It\u2019s not clear if this was a scheduled move by the PM, or an off-the-cuff decision. But the pound has now lost its early gains, and is hovering around $1.4688, where it started the day. The FTSE 100 is down 8 points too. But traders are also reacting to the latest Survation poll, which showed Remain just one percentage point ahead of Leave. Our Politics Liveblog will have full reaction and analysis to Cameron\u2019s speech. Hello... David Cameron is speaking outside Downing Street right now. He\u2019s explaining why Thursday\u2019s vote is so crucial economically, and for national security. Our politics liveblog is covering it.... A new survey from Survation has shown that the Remain campaign has 45% support, with Leave very close behind on 44%. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has joined the ranks of international experts warning against Brexit. In a new blog post, Summers predicted wild market gyrations on Friday if the Leave campaign in, and long-term economic damage. Here\u2019s a flavour: First, unlike almost all other economic policy choices, Brexit is irreversible. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s lurch toward socialism in France, Ronald Reagan\u2019s excessive tax cuts in the U.S., and Japan\u2019s encouragement of bubbles were all egregious errors, but all were reversed, albeit not before substantial damage had been done. Divorce can be reversed by remarriage if regretted. There is no reversing Brexit if it proves unwise. Indeed, given the E.U.\u2019s very strong incentive to discourage further dissolution, it is far from clear that there would even be concerted efforts to minimize its cost. Second, markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of Brexit. A Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15 percent off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses. This is a judgement supported by the gyrations in markets induced by relatively small fluctuations in the perceived chance of Brexit and by the very high prices commanded by out of the money options. The truth is that even with all the regulatory changes that have been put in place, we do not know for sure how the financial system will respond. A return of systemic risk as large losses lead to cascading liquidations cannot be ruled out. At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave. Third, Brexit will undermine confidence and increase uncertainty. No one knows what the new structure will be or how soon it will emerge. Quite likely Brexit would lead to changes not only in Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe but also within Europe itself. While businesses wait to see what happens, they will hold off on new investment. Some will decide that it is much safer to base European operations outside the U.K. The small rally in the pound today shows that Brexit fears are easing today, says Bill O\u2019Neill, head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management. \u201cMarkets are now assuming a remain outcome, with sterling edging up slightly against the dollar this morning following the significant gains of yesterday. \u201cPolls released overnight suggest a swing back to show a mixed picture, but there is a sense that the momentum favouring leave has been halted. Additionally, betting odds are now also pointing to that outcome. It is worth bearing in mind that the odds have consistently been in favour of remain, despite the narrowing seen last week. The US stock market is expected to open calmly in 90 minutes time. The main indices predicted to rise by around 0.4%, as investors wait to hear from Janet Yellen, Fed chair, when she starts testifying to the Senate banking committee at 3pm BST (10am local time). JP Morgan have done us a big favour by working out when the key EU referendum results will come. Using data from the University of Bristol, they\u2019ve identified the most pro-Remain and pro-Brexit areas of the country. They\u2019ve also estimated the voting split in each area, based on a national dead-heat. That could help us work out who is actually winning as the results come in (as pro-Remain areas are likely to report first). Veteran US investor Wilbur Ross has revealed that the looming EU referendum has deterred him from buying assets in Europe. Speaking on CNBC, Ross also accused George Soros of \u201cexaggerating\u201d, in The Guardian today. Ross isn\u2019t convinced that the pound would suffer a worse fall than on Black Wednesday if the public vote to leave the EU. Ross also reckons house prices would fall very sharply after a Brexit vote. He also revealed that he\u2019s planning to raise money for Donald Trump\u2019s tilt at the White House... Here are the Reuters snaps: Wilbur Ross on CNBC - Home prices would plummet in the event of a British exit Wilbur Ross on CNBC - George Soros \u201cexaggerating\u201d with his take on Brexit effect on pound Wilbur Ross on CNBC - Intends to work hard to raise funds for Trump Boom! The pound has hit its highest level since the start of the year, in a fresh signal that Brexit fears are easing. Sterling has jumped by almost 0.5% against the US dollar to $1.4781, a level last seen on 4 January - before the whole dratted EU referendum campaign began. The pound is also up around 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.3017, its highest level in June. The rally comes as the Bank of England reveals that UK financial institutions took just \u00a3370m in a special liquidity auction today. That auction was set up to flood the City with liquidity, if needed, by allowing banks to get ready cash off the BoE in return for handing over assets [here\u2019s an explainer] \u00a3370m is the smallest take-up for any such auction since January 2015. Such a small take-up suggests that banks are not worried about panic gripping the financial world on Friday morning, when the referendum result is known. Alternatively, they may feel they have enough liquid assets to sell if needed. City traders need to set their alarm clocks extra early on Friday morning. Assuming they go to bed at all. Fixed income and derivatives platform Tradeweb has announced it will open for business from 4am on Friday morning, as referendum results will be coming in through the night. In a note released to clients late on Monday, reported by Reuters, Tradeweb says it will help traders execute electronic orders outside usual trading hours. Shares in London are recovering from their early losses, on the back of a decent set of financial results from Whitbread (which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn). Investors are also digesting the news that David Beckham has backed the Remain campaign (an interesting way of marking the looming 18th anniversary of his freekick against Columbia in the 1998 World Cup) Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, says investors are taking a breather after Monday\u2019s big gains. After a barnstorming day yesterday markets are, unsurprisingly, much quieter, although the lion\u2019s share of the stock market gains seen yesterday remain intact. Perhaps investors are exhibiting signs of fatigue with the ongoing Brexit debate, with fresh polls and the commitment of a certain Mr D Beckham to the Remain campaign providing little spark. However, sterling remains in demand against both the euro and the dollar, an indication that markets remain confident about the outcome. Away from Brexit, Whitbread has soared to the top of the FTSE, as a return to solid growth for Costa Coffee assuages fears that the hospitality firm\u2019s growth engine is sputtering. Those disappointing UK public finance figures mean Britain\u2019s actually borrowed \u00a3200m more this year than in 2015-16. Ross Campbell, public sector director at accountancy group ICAEW, blames the EU referendum for creating uncertainty - and distracting chancellor George Osborne. \u201cThe impending EU referendum vote has contributed to an uncertainty that has resulted in a sluggish UK economy, therefore it was imperative that the Chancellor put public sector finances at the top of his priority list for May 2016. An increase of \u00a30.2 billion in public sector net borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, when compared with the same period in 2015, illustrates that he has done quite the opposite and has taken his eye off the economic ball.\u201d \u201cWhatever the result on Friday morning, whether we remain in or leave the European Union, it is vital that Government devises a comprehensive and rigorous strategy to kick-start a faltering economic recovery. Back to the referendum....and chancellor George Osborne has seized on the latest warnings from economists: Here come the latest UK public finances..... ... and they show that Britain borrowed \u00a39.14bn in May, to cover the gap between tax receipts and government spending. May is never a good month for the public finances, and this is actually the smallest deficit for a May since 2007 (which tells you something about how bad the situation has been since). But it\u2019s more than expected, and it pushes up the total national debt to \u00a31.6069 trillion, or 83.7% of GDP. And in another blow, April\u2019s borrowing figures have also been revised higher, to \u00a38.2bn from an initial forecast of \u00a37.2bn. It\u2019s too early to say whether the UK is on track for its deficit targets this financial year (which runs from April 2016 to March 2017): Newsflash from Germany: The German constitutional court has rejected attempts to block the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying rescue plan, the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme. That is important, because OMT is a key part of the rescue plan for the eurozone. It allows the ECB to buy unlimited quantities of eurozone government bonds, if they suffer a spike in borrowing costs. This would, in theory, avoid a repeat of the 2011-2012 eurozone debt crisis, when countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland were locked out of the markets. Although it\u2019s never been used, OMT\u2019s very existence helped to calm the crisis in the eurozone (as speculators were reluctant to risk being crushed by the ECB). Campaigners had asked Germany\u2019s constitutional court to block it, claiming it violated rules banning central banks from funding national governments. Back in 2014, the German judges referred the issue to the European Court of Justice, which approved OMT with some minor caveats. That decision has now been rubber-stamped, which will reassure the markets.. Some City experts are concerned that investors may be too complacent about Thursday\u2019s referendum. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, warns that the markets could be overreacting to a few polls putting Remain in the lead. Investors are rolling the dice on Britain choosing to remain part of the EU but there is still plenty of opportunity to get burned. The polls are close and there is still every chance of a Brexit, despite the swing towards the In camp over the last few days. Traders betting the farm on a sterling rally happening on Friday should remember just how wrong polls were at the last General Election and just how far the pound could drop if Britain votes out. While the polls are close, the odds paint a different picture. We\u2019ve lengthened the odds of a Leave vote on our Brexit market, with a roughly 75% probability that Remain will triumph. But it\u2019s far from over \u2013 there is still huge uncertainty for the markets and the City over the coming days as support for the Leave is holding up and could rally further. Duncan Weldon, head of research at the Resolution Foundation, agrees: This chart underlines how strongly the markets reacted yesterday \u2013 with shares rallying around the globe. Bank of America has warned its customers that it could be tricky to trade on Friday. It fears that the huge interest in the EU referendum will make it harder to get accurate, fast quotes and execute orders as fast as usual. Other trading companies have given similar warnings recently, including City firm Charles Stanley. Investors are digesting two new opinion polls this morning, which give conflicting views on the referendum race. An ORB poll for the Telegraph puts remain back in front for the first time in almost a month on 53% to leave\u2019s 46%, among those certain to vote. But a Times/YouGov poll sees leave retain a lead of two points over remain, 51% to 49%. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, reckons the pound could be lively today: The currency continues to reflect market sentiment ahead of the vote and as new polling information is released, we could see further volatility in the currency over today. Sterling has touched a new seven-week high this morning, extending yesterday\u2019s recovery. The pound hit $1.4740 against the US dollar, it\u2019s best level since the start of May. Yesterday it surged by around three cents, in its strongest rally in almost eight years. London\u2019s stock market is falling in early trading, as traders get another dose of Brexit jitters. The FTSE 100 index had shed 40 points in the first few minutes, a drop of 0.6%, to 6165 points. That\u2019s not a reason to panic - given the Footsie surged by 180-odd points on Monday. But it does show that investors are still anxious about Thursday\u2019s vote \u2013 in the light of these fresh warnings from Nouriel Roubini and George Soros. Mining companies are leading the fallers, showing concerns about global economic growth. UK housebuilders such as Berkeley, Barratt and Persimmon are also dropping back. They would probably suffer from Brexit, if it meant higher interest rates and fewer EU workers looking for property. Nouriel Roubini, one of the world\u2019s most famously pessimistic economists, has urged the UK not to quit the EU. Roubini won the nickname \u201cDr Doom\u201d for his dark predictions in the run-up to the financial crisis, and was proved right when the 2007 credit crunch struck, leading to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. And in a flurry of tweets, he predicted that Britain could plunge into recession if it decided to leave the EU - especially given its record trade deficit, and government borrowing needs. Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam reckons this gives Roubini extra credibility, compared to the more \u2018establishment\u2019 voices such as the IMF and the OECD. Roubini is certainly not a dusty old economist. Back in 2013, he was ordered to remove a hot tub from the roof of his New York penthouse. Roubini told one reporter he would cram up to 10 young models into the tub, adding (immodestly) that: They love my beautiful mind. I am ugly, but they\u2019re attracted to the brains. I\u2019m a rock star among geeks, wonks and nerds. Apparently the hot tub returned to action in 2015 - with Roubini hosting \u201cspecial meditation sessions\u201d \u2014 plus a dip in the tub \u2014 during New York Fashion Week. It\u2019s unclear whether last night\u2019s Brexit tweets were sent from the tub...... The warning comes hours after George Soros, the veteran financial speculator-turned-philanthropist, predicted that the pound would plunge if Britain voted for Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With two days to go, Britain is still locked in its referendum bubble. And investors around the globe are pressing their noses against the glass, wondering whether the UK will take the historic step to leave the European Union. Yesterday, shares and sterling both rallied strongly after polls suggested a swing towards the Remain campaign. But this morning, traders are more nervous. The pound has come under pressure overnight in Asia, and the London stock market is expected to dip a little when trading begins. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson reckons it could be a choppy day: Financial markets appear to be taking the view that the race may well already be run, which given the twists and turns seen already in this campaign may well be extremely far sighted, or dangerously premature. With more polls due out later today we can expect to see further volatility unfold in the event of a move either way. As we look ahead to another choppy day European markets look set to pause for breath today, opening mixed after the FTSE100 enjoyed its best one day gain since August last year, surging over 3% yesterday. There\u2019s a lot on the agenda today too to keep us occupied and maybe distract from the referendum battle, including appearances by two top central bankers. The German constitutional court is ruling on the legality of one of the European Central Bank\u2019s key measures to fight the financial crisis, its OMT (outright monetary transactions) programme. OMT allows the ECB to buy up bonds issued by eurozone countries who struggled to borrow in the markets. The ruling could come at 9am BST. At 9.30am, we get the latest UK public finances. Economists believe it will show that Britain borrowed around \u00a37.5bn to balance the books in May. Then at 10am, the ZEW index of German investor confidence is released. It may show Brexit fears hitting the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. At 2pm, ECB chief Mario Draghi will testify to the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affair committee, in Brussels. And at 3pm, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen testifies to the Senate banking panel, in Washington DC. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main action through the day....",

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s lurch toward socialism in France, Ronald Reagan\u2019s excessive tax cuts in the U.S., and Japan\u2019s encouragement of bubbles were all egregious errors, but all were reversed, albeit not before substantial damage had been done. Divorce can be reversed by remarriage if regretted. There is no reversing Brexit if it proves unwise. Indeed, given the E.U.\u2019s very strong incentive to discourage further dissolution, it is far from clear that there would even be concerted efforts to minimize its cost.</p> <p>Second, markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of Brexit. A Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15 percent off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses. This is a judgement supported by <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/05f69210-3684-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f.html#axzz4C8AzRdOS\">the gyrations in markets</a> induced by relatively small fluctuations in the perceived chance of Brexit and by the very high prices commanded by out of the money options. The truth is that even with all the regulatory changes that have been put in place, we do not know for sure how the financial system will respond. A return of systemic risk as large losses lead to cascading liquidations cannot be ruled out. At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave.</p> <p>Third, Brexit will undermine confidence and increase uncertainty. No one knows what the new structure will be or how soon it will emerge. Quite likely Brexit would lead to changes not only in Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe but also within Europe itself. While businesses wait to see what happens, they will hold off on new investment. Some will decide that it is much safer to base European operations outside the U.K.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LHSummers/status/745221782999703552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a>.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is exploring whether to sell off parts of its UK business if it finalises a deal to keep the Port Talbot steelworks. The Indian company is close to a deal with the government to stay in the UK despite launching a sales process for its entire UK business, which employs 11,000 people. At the same time, Tata Steel is sounding out potential bidders about whether they would be interested in buying two of its divisions \u2013 speciality steels and pipeline tube \u2013 if it decides to stay in the UK. The two divisions employ roughly 2,500 people, primarily at sites in Hartlepool, Rotherham and Stocksbridge near Sheffield. They do not include the Port Talbot steelworks. The speciality steels business makes parts for the aerospace industry, including Rolls-Royce. It is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations of forgery, with 10 employees suspended including two executives. A source close to Tata Steel said the company was looking at all the options but nothing had been decided However, they said Tata Steel was poised to announce that it would keep its UK operations including Port Talbot. \u201cThey are most likely to keep it,\u201d the source added. Tata Steel is holding talks with the government about a package of state support for its UK business, potentially worth up to \u00a31bn. An announcement could be made as early as next week, but the deal depends on a major restructuring of the British Steel Pension Scheme that has been criticised by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the government-backed pensions lifeboat. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \u201cThe government is focused on a long-term future for Port Talbot, which keeps blast furnace steel production in the UK, and we are committed to a credible sales process. \u201cWe have set out our high-level offer on commercial funding and we are working on other areas to reach the best long-term outcome for the industry, workers and the supply chain. That includes ports and infrastructure, power and pensions.\u201d Tata Steel sparked concerns about the future of the UK steel industry when it revealed in March that it would look to sell its UK business. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government is willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to a buyer of Tata Steel UK and restructure the pension scheme, which has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and costs more than \u00a3100m a year to support. Tata Steel is now looking to take up this offer itself, although it is not clear whether the company will accept the government\u2019s proposal of taking a 25% stake in the business. The plans to overhaul the pension scheme behind Tata Steel have been supported by the trustees and trade unions. However, in a submission to the government about the proposals, the PPF said the plans offered \u201csignificant risks for relatively limited gains\u201d. The pension scheme is regarded as a hurdle to a rescue deal for Tata Steel. The latest figures show the deficit has ballooned to \u00a3700m, up from \u00a3485m last year. The government has estimated it would cost \u00a37.5bn to buy out the scheme\u2019s benefits. Under the government\u2019s plan, drawn up with trustees, the scheme could be spun off into a new \u201cshell\u201d company and benchmarked against the consumer price index rather than the retail price index, potentially saving billions of pounds in future liabilities. However, the PPF said it was concerned the plans would leave the pension scheme without an employer to protect it. \u201cThere is a risk of setting a precedent. Although the government has been at pains to stress the unique circumstances surrounding the British Steel pension scheme, we would nevertheless expect other employers or industries to seek similar arrangements to reduce their pension scheme liabilities \u2013 effectively transferring value from scheme members to shareholders,\u201d it said. John Ralfe, a pensions consultant, said the restructuring would leave the pension schemes as a \u201czombie scheme\u201d and allow Tata Steel to be released from its guarantees. He added: \u201cIf it [the plan] is to encourage Tata Steel to retain its UK businesses, there are tried-and-tested existing legal mechanisms to reduce its pension liabilities, which should not be side-stepped. Under the proposal 5,800 members will be materially worse off and 70,000 members will be no better off.\u201d Community, the trade union, criticised Tata Steel on Tuesday for the lack of information about the future of Tata Steel UK. \u201cThe UK government stressed the need for Tata to act as a responsible seller, however it is now unclear whether Tata intend to sell the business at all,\u201d it said. \u201cSince that first announcement, the trust and good will of Tata\u2019s loyal workforce has been pushed to the limit. If Tata do indeed intend to retain the business, then they need not only to make this clear to their loyal workforce, but also lay out their long-term plan for investment in steelmaking. \u201cWere Tata to remain, they would have a long way to go in regaining the confidence of steelworkers. Amid this uncertainty, there also remains the hugely important issue of the pension scheme to be resolved.\u201d",

Her comments come after two months of lackluster reports on the US jobs market and growing signs of nervousness about the UK referendum on European Union membership on US stock markets. \u201cOne development that could shift investors\u2019 sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom,\u201d she said in her testimony before the US Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs. \u201cA UK vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions.\u201d When pressed for more details, Yellen said Britain leaving the EU, also known as Brexit, would usher in a period of uncertainty and lead to volatility in financial markets, both of which would affect US economic outlook. Given the considerable challenges faced by China and the situation in the UK, Yellen said the Fed will continue monitoring global economic and financial developments. Pushed further, Yellen added that she said Britain leaving the EU \u201ccould\u201d affect the US economic outlook but that she does not \u201cknow that it would\u201d. Financial reaction could result in a \u201cflight to safety\u201d that might push up the dollar and other safe haven currencies. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overblow the possible impacts but we\u2019ll watch it carefully,\u201d she said. Asked if the US economy could go back into recession if Britain leaves the EU, Yellen said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that is the most likely case, but we just don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d \u201cWe simply cannot predict what will happen on Friday \u2013 no one can,\u201d Carl Weinberg, founder and chief economist of High Frequency Economic, said before the hearing. \u201cThe number of undecided voters is three times the gap between the \u2018leave\u2019 and the \u2018stay\u2019 camp, even with \u2018stay\u2019 pulling ahead over the weekend. The polls are probably useless anyway if their recent forecasting records are indicative.\u201d Weinberg added that \u201cfear of Brexit is likely worse than Brexit itself \u2026 but like dying, we will not know until we get there\u201d. In her remarks, Yellen noted that members of the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), the Fed\u2019s interest policy-setting committee, expect there to be just two more rate hikes this year. \u201cMost FOMC participants, based on their projections prepared for the June meeting, anticipate that values for the federal funds rate of less than 1% at the end of this year and less than 2% at the end of next year will be consistent with their assessment of appropriate monetary policy,\u201d she said. She stressed that monetary policy \u201cremains accommodative\u201d and that \u201cif the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of federal funds rate would be appropriate\u201d. And while the Fed does have legal basis to implement negative rates, it is not something it is considering, she said. In June, the US central bank left interest rates unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5% for a fourth time this year. After the Fed raised rates from near zero for the first time in almost a decade in December, it was expected to hike rates four times this year. Since then, the forecast has been adjusted to just two hikes in 2016. \u201cWe expect the Fed will be tightening again before long, although given the very cautious tone, tightening as soon as July looks quite unlikely, even if the June employment report is quite strong,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThere will be three more employment reports in total before the September meeting.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amazon is quietly rooting out many of its Chinese traders who do not hold UK VAT numbers to try to protect itself from tax evasion inquiries later this year when new HMRC powers come into force, the Guardian has learned. The online retailer has been conducting a review of sellers\u2019 VAT compliance in the UK. It is understood to have contacted many Chinese sellers, giving them until the end of the month to provide their VAT numbers. Recent years have seen an explosion in small, overseas firms using Amazon and other sites to sell to online shoppers in the UK. Large numbers, including many from China, are not charging VAT. As a result, they have been able to reach the \u201cbestseller\u201d rankings, dominating some of the most popular listings on Amazon. While much attention has been paid in recent years to how Amazon, Apple, Google and other tech groups have arranged their affairs internationally so as to avoid corporation tax, the loss to the UK public purse from the hordes of overseas sellers who have found ways to sell online in the UK without charging VAT may be far greater. HMRC has described such VAT evasion as a \u201cvery big issue\u201d, estimated to cost up to \u00a31.5bn a year in lost tax. But officials have been frustrated by what is seen by some as the uncooperative approach taken by many big websites, including Amazon. In January, Lin Homer, then head of HMRC, told a parliamentary committee: \u201cWe do feel, just as with beer and alcohol, that those people who manage the supply chain should ensure enough diligence is built into it. Marketplace providers have responsibilities.\u201d Amazon has rejected this, insisting widespread VAT fraud is not its concern. The company says it is not responsible for policing the VAT compliance of the hundreds of traders who sell goods in the UK via its site. Behind the scenes, however, Amazon\u2019s new UK boss, Doug Gurr, who previously led Amazon\u2019s Chinese business, is thought to be keen to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s embarrassing revelations about VAT abuses among overseas sellers. In the run-up to Christmas, a Guardian investigation identified a wave of overseas traders, many based in China, who were using Amazon UK to warehouse and sell a wide range of goods without charging VAT. In response, George Osborne announced new powers in his March budget to help HMRC police VAT compliance in online retail \u2013 including, in some instances, holding marketplace websites such as Amazon liable for missing tax. The chancellor said these measures would help curb the abuse and restore \u00a3875m in tax receipts over the next four years. Gurr\u2019s recent review of seller compliance is not thought to signal a more collaborative approach to combating VAT fraud. In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson reiterated: \u201cSellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations. \u201cWe do offer tools and information to assist sellers with their compliance, but we don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs.\u201d Amazon said it did nevertheless cooperate with HMRC when required by law. The company spokesperson confirmed there were no plans to require Chinese or other overseas traders to display their UK VAT numbers on Amazon\u2019s site. That decision remains controversial because, under the EU\u2019s e-commerce directive, online sellers are required to make their VAT numbers \u201ceasily, directly and permanently accessible\u201d to customers. Since the Guardian\u2019s investigation into VAT fraud last year, HMRC has carried out a series of raids on independent warehouses in the UK used by overseas traders, seizing goods worth more than \u00a3500,000. Officials have also held urgent meetings with top executives at Amazon and eBay to discuss the problem. Angry UK traders, who have been unable to compete with the new wave of VAT-evading overseas competitors, have called for ministers to clamp down on this widespread tax fraud. Campaign groups representing UK-based sellers, including Ravas and VATfraud.org, have called for Amazon and other sites used by overseas sellers to be held immediately liable for all lost VAT. But Osborne has declined to go that far. Instead, new rules announced in his March budget \u2013 expected to come into force with the 2016 finance bill \u2013 made it clear retail websites would only be held accountable if they failed to act after suspected abuses had been brought to their attention by HMRC. Guardian investigations into VAT fraud last year involved a \u00a31,818.20 sample order placed through Amazon with small overseas seller companies. The order included VAT of \u00a30.00. Among the 24 items ordered were high-value goods such as an Apple watch, iPad, Fitbit and Panasonic camera, as well as cheaper products including a bike light, corkscrew and mobile phone case. The items were being sold by 23 different seller companies that appeared to have minimal or no business operations in the UK. Nine gave addresses in Hong Kong, eight in China and six in the US. All had arranged for Amazon to hold their stock in the UK, pack and send parcels, and deal with payment and returns queries. When contacted by email and asked if they could provide a VAT receipt, many of the 23 sellers declined. \u201cWe are sorry that we are not VAT registered,\u201d said one. Another said: \u201cI am sorry to let you know that we couldn\u2019t supply a VAT invoice as we haven\u2019t charge you for that, right?\u201d A third reply said: \u201cWe don\u2019t provide the VAT invoice, our product is exclusive of VAT, hope you can understand.\u201d Another responded: \u201cWe can provide a VAT invoice but for security reasons we don\u2019t supply the VAT number.\u201d",

But if the financial markets are right in their assumption that the UK will vote to stay in the EU on Thursday, it won\u2019t be long before investors start to focus on some sticky economic problems that have not gone away while politics has been dominated by Europe. The slow progress in reducing the UK\u2019s budget deficit is one such problem. Actually \u201cprogress\u201d is the wrong word since in the first two months of the 2016-17 financial year, Osborne needed to borrow 0.8% more than in the same two months of 2015-16. For the current year as a whole, the chancellor is expecting the deficit to be cut by 23% to \u00a355.5bn, so this has been a pretty unimpressive start. There are a couple of mitigating factors. There was a surge in revenues in March as buy-to-let investors rushed to beat the introduction of a tougher stamp-duty regime, and the chancellor would no doubt argue that the uncertainty caused by the referendum has led to a slowdown in growth in recent months, which has fed through into weaker tax receipts. Yet neither of these explanations are wholly convincing. Even with buoyant stamp duty receipts, the chancellor missed his deficit reduction target for last year by \u00a32.7bn. And as yet, there has been little evidence that the economy has been affected by the referendum, with the latest news from the labour market, industry and the high street all stronger than expected. Whatever the result on Thursday, the chances of Osborne meeting his target of running a budget surplus by the end of this parliament are diminishing. As Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macro notes, the chancellor\u2019s numbers only add up as a result of \u201cvery optimistic\u201d assumptions for welfare savings and from cracking down on tax avoidance. Osborne could well be in the position of having to ask a deeply split Conservative party to back fresh austerity measures in order to achieve his surplus.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s plans to slash public borrowing by a quarter this year have veered off track, according to official figures, after the government\u2019s finances were hit by Brexit worries in May. The government\u2019s spending deficit was just \u00a30.4bn lower than the same month last year, leading to a \u00a39.7bn deficit, which analysts had expected to be no more than \u00a39.5bn. The figures are a setback for the chancellor, who has set himself a target of cutting the annual deficit to \u00a355bn this year and to create a surplus by 2019-20. Osborne\u2019s task was made more difficult after revisions to last year\u2019s figures showed the government had borrowed \u00a374.9bn for the financial year ending in March 2016, overshooting the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of \u00a372.2bn for 2015-16. The Office for National Statistics said the chancellor\u2019s borrowing in the current financial year to date was \u00a317.9bn, a \u00a30.2bn rise compared with 2015. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the public finance figures \u201ccast more doubt\u201d over whether Osborne could achieve a budget surplus by the end of this parliament. \u201cUndeniably, hefty public borrowing reflects the impact of uncertainty created by the EU referendum on the economy,\u201d Tombs said. \u201cThe latest figures therefore provide just a taste of what Brexit would do to the health of the government\u2019s finances.\u201d The government coffers were boosted in the main by stamp duty on land and property, which rose by just over a fifth to \u00a32.1bn in the period. Overall, government tax receipts increased over the period by 3.4% to \u00a3103.8bn. But this was swallowed up by a 2.1% rise in government expenditure to \u00a3119.7bn between April and May this year, as higher state pension payments, net investment and debt interest costs all increased. The figures also show that local authorities borrowed heavily to cope with steep cuts in central government grants. The British Chambers of Commerce chief economist, David Kern, said: \u201cAlthough borrowing fell marginally in May, the first two months of the current financial year point to disappointing progress in reducing the deficit, and our assessment remains that reaching a budget surplus by the end of the decade will be difficult to achieve. \u201cThe slow progress so far is not surprising given the difficult economic circumstances facing the UK, which is making it more difficult to generate tax receipts. Stabilising the public finances remains a critical task, without which it will be difficult to achieve sustainable long-term economic growth,\u201d he said. Tombs agreed: \u201cEven if the UK votes to remain in the EU this week, we think that the chancellor only has a slim chance of meeting his budget surplus goal. In particular, the fiscal projections rest on very optimistic assumptions for revenues from tax avoidance measures and savings from the welfare budget. \u201cMeanwhile, the Conservatives\u2019 slim majority in the House of Commons likely means it will be impossible for the chancellor to get political support for a further intensification of austerity in order to obtain a budget surplus.\u201d",

Stabilising the public finances remains a critical task, without which it will be difficult to achieve sustainable long-term economic growth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tombs agreed: \u201cEven if the UK votes to remain in the EU this week, we think that the chancellor only has a slim chance of meeting his budget surplus goal. In particular, the fiscal projections rest on very optimistic assumptions for revenues from tax avoidance measures and savings from the welfare budget. </p> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, the Conservatives\u2019 slim majority in the House of Commons likely means it will be impossible for the chancellor to get political support for a further intensification of austerity in order to obtain a budget surplus.\u201d <br></p>",

In a note cutting their target price for the mobile phone group from 265p to 245p, the Jefferies analysts said: We continue to believe that Vodafone needs a Liberty transaction to secure its long-term prospects. Last summer we took the (then) anti-consensus view that Vodafone is the more likely acquirer for reasons for regulation (stated EC goal to strengthen \u2018European champions\u2019), capital structure and complexity. Whilst Liberty is not trading at levels likely to encourage its management to resume negotiations with Vodafone, we took comfort from its post-first quarter 2016 commentary that it would not be inclined to execute on potential mobile acquisitions that would rule out other potential deals. Moreover, we think that Vodafone\u2019s approach of putting more of its AMAP [Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific] investments within listed vehicles (New Zealand post-closing of merger with Sky, India post-prospective IPO, Vodacom already listed) could serve two useful purposes: creating a more transparent rump value for Europe and potentially a cleaner path to exit the AMAP businesses in due course. Liberty\u2019s John Malone had already said his company had no interest in Vodafone\u2019s Indian and South African operations. Vodafone shares are currently down 2.15p at 214p while Sky, where Jefferies has cut its price target from 915p to 895p, has fallen9.5p to 878p. Jefferies said: In spite of underperforming the FTSE 100 by 16% year to date, Sky continues to trade at a 4%/13% premium on calendarised 2016/17 PE. Operating headwinds have become more apparent: last quarter\u2019s step-up in churn, BT\u2019s ambitions in mobile/TV, 80% hike in Bundesliga rights costs, Vivendi purchase of Mediaset Premium. But consensus forecasts still imply expansion in Sky\u2019s group operating margins over the long run. We see credible growth initiatives (mobile, Sky Q) but believe they will be capital (and margin) intensive to execute.",

Last summer we took the (then) anti-consensus view that Vodafone is the more likely acquirer for reasons for regulation (stated EC goal to strengthen \u2018European champions\u2019), capital structure and complexity.</p> <p>Whilst Liberty is not trading at levels likely to encourage its management to resume negotiations with Vodafone, we took comfort from its post-first quarter 2016 commentary that it would not be inclined to execute on potential mobile acquisitions that would rule out other potential deals.</p> <p>Moreover, we think that Vodafone\u2019s approach of putting more of its AMAP [Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific] investments within listed vehicles (New Zealand post-closing of merger with Sky, India post-prospective IPO, Vodacom already listed) could serve two useful purposes: creating a more transparent rump value for Europe and potentially a cleaner path to exit the AMAP businesses in due course.</p> </blockquote> <p>Liberty\u2019s John Malone had already said his company had no interest in Vodafone\u2019s Indian and South African operations.</p> <p>Vodafone shares are currently down 2.15p at 214p while <strong>Sky</strong>, where Jefferies has cut its price target from 915p to 895p, has fallen9.5p to 878p. Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In spite of underperforming the FTSE 100 by 16% year to date, Sky continues to trade at a 4%/13% premium on calendarised 2016/17 PE. Operating headwinds have become more apparent: last quarter\u2019s step-up in churn, BT\u2019s ambitions in mobile/TV, 80% hike in Bundesliga rights costs, Vivendi purchase of Mediaset Premium. But consensus forecasts still imply expansion in Sky\u2019s group operating margins over the long run. We see credible growth initiatives (mobile, Sky Q) but believe they will be capital (and margin) intensive to execute.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Whitbread, the owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn hotels, will consider cutting investment and making extra cost cuts if Britain votes to leave the EU on Thursday. The FTSE 100 company said customers had pulled back on spending before the EU vote and that it was concerned about the economic consequences of a vote to leave. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are a very flexible company \u2026 We have capital we would like to spend this year which we don\u2019t have to and a cost programme which we can turn up or down. We will watch very closely but we would like to continue to grow this business.\u201d She said Whitbread wanted Britain to stay in the EU \u201cbased on the level of uncertainty \u2026 and the lower output and GDP that might follow. I don\u2019t think there are storms we can\u2019t weather. I\u2019m not prepared to speculate further. We have got lots of choices we can make in any scenario.\u201d Whitbread is aiming for 2,500 UK Costa stores by 2020 and \u00a32.5bn of sales up from \u00a31.6bn last year. It also wants to add 20,000 UK hotel rooms at Premier Inn to take the total to 85,000. Brittain said she would decide after the EU vote whether those plans remained viable. Brittain made her remarks as Whitbread reported a revival in coffee sales at Costa that helped it overcome a weak London hotel market that has affected business at Premier Inn. Sales at Costa branches open a year or more increased 2.6% in the 13 weeks to 2 June, Whitbread said in a trading update before its annual general meeting. At established Premier Inns, sales rose 2.1%, slightly weaker than the figure reported in March. Whitbread said it was increasing its share of the market but that demand for London hotel rooms had remained weak since the Paris terrorist attacks last November. In London, revenue per available room fell 3% and outside London it rose 0.3%. Performance was affected by weaker demand and the large number of rooms Premier Inn made available as it expanded. But Brittain said trading had also been affected by jitters before the EU referendum that have made consumers and businesses reluctant to spend money. \u201cPeople are reining back on expenditure and until that uncertainty is resolved they are going to be more cautious. We\u2019ve been working hard at our own cost efficiency programme and many other businesses are doing the same. We will watch closely and will react accordingly. Both consumers and businesses are showing signs of this behaviour.\u201d Brittain said Whitbread, which has many European employees at its coffee shops, hotels and restaurants, had encouraged staff to vote in the referendum and wanted to make it easy for them to do so. \u201cWe have communicated with our staff this week and reminded them there is a referendum and reminded them to vote and we have said if they are on shift patterns that make it difficult for them they should speak to their line managers.\u201d Brittain took over at Whitbread in January after joining from Lloyds Banking Group. She had a difficult first few months as sales stuttered after years of almost unrelenting growth. Whitbread has expanded rapidly, capitalising on consumers\u2019 apparently insatiable thirst for caffeine and demand for budget accommodation. But its twin businesses face increasing demand from chains such as Pret a Manger and Greggs and the likes of Airbnb. In March, Whitbread said growth at established Costa stores had dipped sharply to 0.5% in the 11 weeks to 11 February, prompting concerns that competition and weakening consumer confidence had checked the chain\u2019s progress. Brittain said Costa had suffered from slow business in UK town centres that has affected the wider retail industry but that other branches had done better. \u201cThe high street is more flat. Concessions and drive throughs and retail parks are quite buoyant,\u201d Brittain said. She added she was confident about making good progress this year.",

Testimony later from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will see her give an update on the central bank\u2019s view on the outlook, while European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is also due to speak. Anglo American is leading the fallers, down 17p at 653p as its platinum division Amplats said half year profits would drop by at least 20% due to weaker commodity prices. Other mining groups are also lower, with Antofagasta falling 8.6p to 425.3p and Rio Tinto down 38p at 2002.5p. In all mining shares account for seven of the top ten fallers in the leading index. Housebuilders, expected to suffer in the event the UK does vote to leave the European Union, are also under pressure again, with Berkeley Group down 59p at \u00a331.86 and Persimmon 5p lower at \u00a320.51. But banks, which should also be hit by a Brexit vote, have shrugged off the latest worries, with Barclays 1.95p better at 178.8p and Lloyds Banking Group up 0.32p at 70.32p. Whitbread is the biggest riser in the leading index, up 131p to \u00a341.72 after its latest update showed a better than expected performance from its Costa coffee business. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 13.30 points at 6190.70, and Ipek Ozkardeskaya at London Capital Group said: This week\u2019s early enthusiasm in the UK markets appears to have eased this morning. The FTSE 100 is paring gains after having surpassed the 50, 100, 200-day moving averages on hopes that the UK would vote to remain in the EU. Although the latest Brexit polls were in favour of the \u2018Remain camp\u2019, not much has changed fundamentally regarding the Brexit probabilities. At this stage, the market remains heavily hedged against the Brexit risks, while pricing in a \u2018no exit\u2019 as the base case scenario. The FTSE stocks are fragile at the open as a reminder that investors may have gone well beyond themselves just a couple of days before the Brexit referendum. Elsewhere Senior is down 13% at 195p as the engineering group warned of lower revenues at its Flexonics unit, partly due to challenging market conditions in the oil and gas sector. JP Morgan moved its rating from overweight to neutral. Chemring has fallen 22% to 109p after the defence and aerospace group warned 2016 profits were likely to be below market expectations. Investec kept its buy recommendation saying: The company continues to suffer short term headwinds, while the longer term outlook remains brighter given a range of opportunities across the businesses. 150p target price maintained following a peer group re-rating. But Circassia recovered some ground following Monday\u2019s slump in the wake of disappointing results from trials of its cat allergy treatment, adding 9.6p to 100.6p. Analysts at Peel Hunt said: We see more than 70% upside to our revised target price [down from 450p to 160p] post the Phase 3 allergy trial failure but acknowledge the uncertainty overhang medium-term unless a strategic bid emerges.
