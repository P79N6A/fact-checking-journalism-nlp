      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 tumbled to a 16-week low as investors reacted to North Korea\u2019s latest missile test by dumping shares on the London stock market. Stocks listed in Paris and Frankfurt also fell on Tuesday and the dollar came under pressure, underscoring the flight from equities to safe haven assets, including gold. The index of blue chip companies was down more than 1% before rallying to close at 7,337, down 64 points or 0.9%, following the news that a North Korean ballistic missile had flown over Hokkaido in northern Japan. The German Dax was the worst affected, falling by 1.5%, while the French CAC was down 1%. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cThe standoff between the US and North Korea never went away, and as of last night it is back in the forefront of traders\u2019 minds. Tensions have shifted up a gear, and dealers are dumping stocks while the political situation plays out.\u201d In London, financials were the biggest drag on the index, with the sector wiping more than 22 points off the index. Lenders Lloyds, Barclays and Standard Chartered all fell between 1.2% and 2%. In the energy sector, heavyweights BP and Royal Dutch Shell were both down about 1%. The German banks Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank were among the top 10 losers in Frankfurt. But while European stock markets lost ground, the euro and the pound were seen by investors as safe haven currencies. The euro has climbed two cents in as many days in reaction to the row brewing between Washington and Kim Jong-un\u2019s administration. Last week, tensions appeared to ease, but the latest missile launch provoked a demand from Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for further action against North Korea. \u201cThe race to the safe havens has seen the dollar ditched, which is resulting in some fresh and unwelcome sterling and euro strength,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, the head of research at Accendo Markets. Some commentators said the euro\u2019s status as a safe haven was increasing its value to a level where it was harming French and German exports, putting pressure on the European Central Bank to implement policies that will prevent the currency rising any further in value. Surveys of business confidence in Germany have fallen back in recent weeks in response to the euro and its impact on the country\u2019s exports. Wall Street also suffered as the full impact of the heavy rains from tropical storm Harvey became clearer. More than 30 inches (76cm) have fallen in some areas, leading to widespread flooding, and close to two feet (60cm) more could fall over the next few days. Analysts said the cost of the storm could be about $50bn (\u00a343bn). Energy companies also suffered falls following reports that oil producers in Texas had shut wells as a precaution against the storms. The majority of US oil is produced in the Texas region and Goldman Sachs estimated that as much as 17% of production could be affected. Many investors turned to gold as a safe haven, pushing up the price by $4 an ounce to $1,321. In a sign of demand for the precious metal, the investment firm the Pure Gold Company said it had seen a sharp increase in people buying physical gold. Its chief executive, Josh Saul, said: \u201cWe have been taking orders from clients citing fears that tensions between the US and North Korea will escalate after North Korea\u2019s latest missile test over Japan. \u201cPresident Trump has [previously] vowed to respond with \u2018fire and fury\u2019 and many of our clients believe this will make the situation considerably worse, increasing the unpredictability of the geopolitical situation.\u201d The firm reported a 78% increase in clients investing in physical gold on the expectation that the equity markets and the dollar will continue to slip while the gold price rallies. \u201cPhysical gold investment from first-time purchasers has increased by 87% as they worry about market uncertainty in the face of such volatile world leaders,\u201d Saul said.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s financial watchdog is to launch a \u00a342m campaign featuring a model of the Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to raise awareness of the deadline for making complaints about payment protection insurance. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s ad campaign, which is being paid for by the 18 banks, building societies and credit card providers with the most PPI complaints, is being launched exactly two years before the 29 August 2019 deadline for claims. It features an animatronic model head of Schwarzenegger mounted on tracks that pursues supermarket shoppers urging them to stop procrastinating and look into making a PPI claim. \u201cMake a decision, do it now,\u201d says the robotic Schwarzenegger threateningly, in scenes reminiscent of the Terminator\u2019s dogged pursuit of his intended victim, Sarah Connor, in the 1980s film. The mini-terminator is voiced by David Brent, a Canadian actor and comedian. The \u00a342m campaign has been created by M&amp;C Saatchi, the Conservative party\u2019s longstanding ad agency, and will first air during Emmerdale on ITV1 on Tuesday night. \u201cWith this advertising campaign, our biggest challenge is cutting through the noise on PPI and we have created a campaign that is designed to do just that,\u201d said Emma Stranack, the FCA\u2019s head of business and consumer communications. \u201cWe have undertaken extensive testing to ensure the creative idea was impactful and understood by our very broad target audience. The result is a suite of adverts that we are confident will help us achieve our campaign objectives.\u201d The FCA said it was spending \u00a342.2m on the entire \u201cdeadline awareness\u201d marketing push, with \u00a324.4m of that going on the ad campaign across TV, billboards and posters, online and video-on-demand services. In addition, \u00a34.9m was spent producing the ads, to cover items such as talent fees \u2013 including Schwarzenegger\u2019s image rights \u2013 and another \u00a34.2m was spent on a helpline and website. Agency fees, for M&amp;C Saatchi and the media planning and buying agency Manning Gottlieb OMD, totalled \u00a33m. A further \u00a33m was spent on partnerships, PR and social media customer service, and \u00a31m on legal fees, staff costs and contingency. The FCA spent \u00a31.7m on evaluation and testing to ensure the ad campaign hits the mark with consumers. \u201cWhen people hear \u2018PPI\u2019 they switch off. We\u2019ve heard so much about it, we\u2019ve stopped listening,\u201d said M&amp;C Saatchi executive creative director Justin Tindall. \u201cThis campaign is designed to cut through the white noise and capture people\u2019s attention.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "News that North Korea had launched a missile over Japan unnerved investors and sent them scurrying out of shares and into safer assets. Just when some of the belligerence and rhetoric between North Korea and the US seemed to have faded, this latest action ratcheted up the tensions again. President Trump announced \u201call options are on the table\u201d following the missile launch. So European markets fell back with the FTSE 100 hitting a 16 week low and the European Stoxx 600 at a six month low. The Vix volatility index moved sharply higher, reflecting the uncertainty among traders. Gold was in demand as investors sought havens for their cash, as were Swiss francs and the yen. On the currency markets it was a mixed day for the pound. It fell against the euro, both on Brexit worries and thanks to the continuing strength of the euro itself. But Capital Economics believes the current weakness of the pound against the single currency may not last. Against the dollar the pound moved higher, benefiting from the US currency\u2019s weakness on talk another interest rate rise may not be imminent. There were also concerns about the effect of tropical storm Harvey on the US economy. Harvey, formerly designated a hurricane, has seen oil prices slip on uncertainty over the damage it is causing to refineries. On the economic front, France\u2019s GDP grew by 0.5% in the second quarter as expected, while German consumer confidence edged higher. In the UK there were some weak housing market figures. At the moment the FTSE 100 has lost just over 1%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.9%. and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 1.37%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.47%. Gold is up $5 an ounce at $1322, while Brent crude is own 0.15% at $51.81 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In common with the European markets, Wall Street has dropped sharply in the wake of the renewed tensions following North Korea\u2019s launch of a missile over Japan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 127 points or 0.58% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.64% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.84%. More house price data from the US, and it is pretty much in line with expectations: US stock markets look set to open lower when the bells ring in New York this morning. Both the S&amp;P and Dow futures are down ahead of the business day, driven down by fears over North Korea. Economists seem unfazed by the likely impact of Hurricane Harvey, even though gas prices are rising and the region supplies 20% of the US\u2019s total crude oil supply. The US has bounced back quickly from similar disasters and investors are clearly betting the same will be true this time. Pyongyang\u2019s latest moves, however, are another story. Harvey may no longer be a hurricane but a tropical storm, but it is likely to be causing considerable financial damage. Julia Kollewe reports: With the catastrophic Texas floods triggered by Hurricane Harvey set to worsen, early estimates suggest the financial damage it has inflicted has already run into tens of billions of dollars, and one forecaster has predicted the final bill could be as high as $100bn (\u00a377bn). The tropical storm continues to batter south-eastern Texas, where it has so far claimed at least nine lives, and is expected to reach southern Louisiana. Thousands of homes have been flooded forcing residents to seek emergency shelter. US authorities estimate 30,000 people will need shelter. So far predictions of the final cost of the damage vary widely. Some insurance analysts are putting the likely damage at $30 to $50bn \u2013 but point out that not all of this sum will be covered by insurance. However, David Havens, an insurance analyst at Imperial Capital in New York, told Bloomberg News the final bill could reach as much as $100bn. This compares with damage of $120bn caused by hurricane Katrina in 2005, which included $80bn of insured losses, and the $75bn economic losses caused by hurricane Sandy in 2012. As homeowners\u2019 personal insurance policies tend to exclude flood cover, most of the flood-related claims will be borne by the US National Flood Insurance Programme. However, many people in eastern Texas have failed to buy coverage from NFIP or have let their policies lapse, the New York Times reported. It said many never had to buy flood insurance because their property was not listed as being on a 100-year floodplain. Charles Watson of data analytics firm Enki estimates the damage to homes alone could total $30bn. The full story is here: The pound\u2019s current weakness against the euro may not last, says Capital Economics: The White House has issued a response to the North Korea missile launch: Back with Germany, and consumer confidence continues to grow. Released earlier, the GfK consumer consumer confidence survey came in at 10.9, its highest level since October 2001 and up from 10.8 the previous month. Analysts had expected an unchanged reading. GFK said: Consumers in Germany see the domestic economy continuing on a very good path. Evidence of this is provided by the new increases in income expectation and propensity to buy. It has been possible for both to again improve in their high levels. Economic expectation, on the other hand, has suffered a setback. Yet its current level still suggests that consumers nevertheless see the German economy continuing on a course for growth. Oil prices have slipped back, on uncertainty over the damage being caused in Texas by Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical storm. Brent crude is down 0.79% at $51.48 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.09% lower at $46.53. The move in Brent in particular is putting more pressure on markets which are already suffering from the renewed tensions after North Korea launched its missile over Japan. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: North Korea\u2019s provocative missile launch over Japan remained the main market-driver this Tuesday, with the European indices only widening their losses as the morning went on. There were a variety of different reasons, on top of the macro-fears surrounding Kim Jong Un\u2019s itchy trigger figure, driving the European markets lower. In the UK the FTSE\u2019s 1.2% fall \u2013 leaving it only handful of points above 7300 \u2013 was exacerbated by Brent Crude\u2019s own 1% drop, taking the black stuff back below $51.50 per barrel. The commodity is being dragged lower by news that Hurricane Harvey hit several refineries along the US Gulf Coast, and has in turn weighed on the likes of BP and Shell. The DAX and CAC saw their losses increase to 1.9% and 1.5% respectively as the euro went on its latest romp. Against the dollar \u2013 which has myriad problems to deal with both internationally and domestically \u2013 the euro surged half a percent to a $1.205-nearing 2 and a half year high, while against the pound it rose 0.4% to send sterling stumbling towards \u20ac1.075. Germany\u2019s forthcoming federal elections will have little impact on the country\u2019s credit rating over the next four years whatever the outcome, according to a report from Moody\u2019s. Colin Ellis, a managing director at the ratings agency and co-author of the study, said: \u201cAlthough the German elections could result in a number of different potential coalitions, we don\u2019t expect any plausible combination to have a material impact on the credit profiles of the country\u2019s rated debt issuers.\u201d The Moody\u2019s report stated: Germany\u2019s sovereign credit quality is resilient to any plausible election outcome given the country\u2019s very high economic, institutional and fiscal strength. However, growth and debt levels will be influenced by policymakers\u2019 response to rising demographic pressures and their approach to labour market flexibility. At the European level, the government\u2019s stance on issues such as debt pooling or fiscal transfers among European Union countries will be an important factor. Given the main parties\u2019 differing views on these and other important policy areas, the composition of the next coalition will, at the margins at least, influence how Germany\u2019s sovereign credit profile evolves. As the market slide accelerates \u2013 the FTSE 100 is down 1.36%, Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1.96% and France\u2019s Cac is 1.58% lower \u2013 the so-called fear index is on the rise. The Vix volatility index has jumped 25% to 14.16 since the North Korea missile launch, though this is below the year high of 17.28 on 11 August after President Trump made his \u201cfire and fury\u201d comments against Kim Jong-un. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After weeks of quiet, renewed geopolitical tensions and a soaring euro are combining to cause some impressive moves across markets this morning. We have seen triple-digit losses on the FTSE 100, while in Europe the surge in the euro past $1.20 has resulted in brutal morning for European equities. North Korea\u2019s dramatic escalation last night prompted some impressive risk-off moves in Asia, with the European session naturally following suit. US futures are under pressure, although everyone is waiting for the first tweet on the subject from the Commander-in-Chief before hitting the sell button too hard. Hurricane Harvey is hitting insurers hard, as investors try to price in the potential costs of the devastation in Texas, while a drop in US Treasury yields is prompting a mini-rout in bank stocks. Much of what we are seeing in equities this morning is also a reflection of the moves in the foreign exchange space; Jackson Hole duly delivered in terms of lack of news, and the reflex action has kicked in, with investors buying the euro, driving it to a 3-year high, and resuming their selling of the US dollar. We have a few weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, when the bank will get the chance to put a more dollar-positive view forward. Until then, we should expect further euro strength, and thus more downside for European stock markets. Ahead of the open, we expect the Dow to start at 21,666, 142 points lower from Monday\u2019s close. Self explanatory: Sterling is having a tough day against the single currency, thanks to continuing concerns about the outcome of Brexit talks as well as the strength of the euro. The pound is currently down 0.4% at \u20ac1.0751. Investors are nervous about the lack of progress in the Brexit discussions and an uninspiring performance from the UK economy \u2013 it showed the slowest growth of any G7 country in the second quarter. Former MPC member Andrew Sentance tweeted: However the strength of the euro is also a factor. ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers at the end of last week revealed nothing much about future monetary policy; but that did little to dispel the idea the central bank would soon set out plans to cut back its economic stimulus measures, including easing its bond-buying programme. ING Bank said: The euro continues to march higher despite ECB President Mario Draghi staying tight-lipped over future policy plans at Jackson Hole (as we expected). The focus now turns to the crucial 7 September ECB meeting: out economists note that the demand for an ECB game plan on tapering is getting stronger by the day; indeed the key arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. However, we note that the ECB\u2019s preference will be for a cautious tapering, with a very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus that ideally doesn\u2019t cause any tightening of financial conditions. If the pound is weak against the euro, then it is a different story regarding the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on concerns about the continuing uncertainty in the White House, while Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen gave it little support in her own speech at Jackson Hole. Meanwhile the revival of tensions with North Korea in the wake of the missile launch over Japan and worries about the costs of Hurricane Harvey - and its effect on US economic growth - has also had an impact. So against the dollar, the pound is currently up 0.22% at $1.2960. Meanwhile the euro is at an 18 month high of around $1.20 against the dollar. Unsurprisingly, US markets are expected to open lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average future indicating a 118-point decline amid the North Korea tensions and Hurricane Harvey. Gold is up $4 an ounce at $1321 on fears about where the tensions between the US and North Korea will lead. In a sign of demand for the precious metal, investment firm the Pure Gold Company said it had seen a sharp increase in people buying physical gold. Its chief executive, Josh Saul, said: We have been taking orders since 5am this morning from clients citing fears that tensions between the US and North Korea will escalate after North Korea\u2019s latest missile test over Japan. President Trump has [previously] vowed to respond with \u201cfire and fury\u201d and many of our clients believe this will make the situation considerably worse, increasing the unpredictability of the geopolitical situation. We\u2019ve seen a 78% increase in financial professions investing in physical gold on the expectation that the equity markets and the dollar will continue to slip while the gold price rallies. Physical gold investment from first time purchasers has increased by 87% as they worry about market uncertainty in the face of such volatile world leaders. The rise of gold through the $1,300 an ounce barrier \u2013 which had proved resistant for some while \u2013 is likely to lead to continued support for the precious metal, analysts believe. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: Gold seems to have benefited from the tensions [following the North Korea missile launch], currently trading at a nine-month high. However, most of the gains in the precious metal occurred before the missile launch, meaning that there are different factors supporting prices. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields have been falling since 10 July, with total declines of 10.8%. This partially explains gold\u2019s 8.6% surge since then, and investors are still not buying Trump\u2019s tax reforms. Yields should be much higher than current levels, especially since the Fed didn\u2019t seem to back off on raising rates. Gary Cohn, head of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, has a high probability of replacing Janet Yellen when her term ends by January 2018. Cohn is not only expected to back financial sector deregulation, but also to keep interest rates low in order to support the implementation of Trump\u2019s pro-growth economic policies. This provides another valid reason to purchase the yellow metal. With ongoing geopolitical tensions, the looming debt ceiling, threats to scrap Nafta, and a low yield environment, gold prices are likely to remain well supported. $1,300 has been a critical resistance level since the beginning of the year, with four failing attempts to break through; after yesterday\u2019s surge however, $1,300 will likely turn into support. Back with the UK economy, and some weak housing market figures. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the details: UK house prices dipped this month, dragging down the annual growth rate, in further evidence of a cooling market. The average price of a home fell 0.1% between July and August to \u00a3210,495, according to Nationwide, Britain\u2019s biggest building society. Prices rose in July and June but fell between March and May, the first time this had happened since the financial crisis. The latest monthly price drop took the annual growth rate back down to 2.1%, a level last seen in May, which was the lowest rate in four years, from 2.9% in July. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe slowdown in house price growth to the 2-3% range in recent months from the 4-5% prevailing in 2016 is consistent with signs of cooling in the housing market and the wider economy.\u201d He noted that economic growth had halved from last year to about 0.3% per quarter in the first half of this year and that the number of mortgages approved for house purchase hit a nine-month low in June, while surveyors had reported softening in the number of new buyer inquiries. He said in some respects the slowdown in the housing market was surprising, given the strength of the labour market, while mortgage rates have remained close to all-time lows. But household finances are under mounting pressure, with the cost of living rising steadily as the weak pound bites, and wage growth stagnating. The full report is here: With the costs of Hurricane Harvey estimated by some reports to be as much as $100bn when the final tally comes in, insurers have come under pressure. Lancashire Holdings is down more than 2%, Beazley has fallen 1.6% and Hiscox is 1% lower. Amid concerns about North Korea firing a missile over Japan, Europe\u2019s stock markets are sliding in early trading. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 1%, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are down 0.9% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has fallen 0.5%. The European Stoxx 600 has hit a six-month low. France\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to June, in line with the initial estimates and analyst forecasts. This is the third quarter in a row that the country\u2019s GDP has increased by that amount. Exports bounced back, imports slowed significantly and domestic demand held firm, said statistics agency Insee. But corporate investment decelerated sharply, up by 0.7% after a previous rise of 1.3%. Of course the US president has other things on his plate too. There is his tax overhaul speech on Wednesday, but there is also the problem of the debt ceiling and Trump\u2019s threat last week to shut down the government if he does get funds for his Mexican border wall. The arrival of Hurricane Harvey and the cost of repairing the damage will only put more pressure on the country\u2019s finances, and will not help Trump\u2019s attempts to fund his pet project. CMC\u2019s David Madden says: Traders are looking ahead to Donald Trump\u2019s speech on Wednesday, where he is going to talk about bringing in tax reform, and investors are certainly in favour of the President\u2019s pro-business policies, but will the plans get introduced. Mr Trump failed to overhaul the healthcare system, and it wasn\u2019t just the Democrats who scuppered his plans, members of his own party opposed it too. What benefits the President, is that tax reform is the sort of policy that you could imagine support coming from both parties. Keeping with US politics, the debt ceiling is looming and Mr Trump has already warned the US government that it risks being shut down if it can\u2019t find the funds to build the wall along the Mexican border. The timing of Hurricane Harvey is adding to the problems as Washington will have to deal with those costs too. Investors are nervous about the potential political gridlock in the US. President Trump\u2019s response so far to the latest North Korean missile has been fairly measured but investors will be watching what he says or does next. Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities says: Stock traders are concerned that if the situation escalates even further then the markets will look for risk-off assets taking bets off the equities. The US futures are also pointing towards a bearish opening and the important question now is what President Trump\u2019s response is going to be: if the US President opts for a tempered response then stock traders will breathe a sigh of relief but on the opposite case a sharp sell-off can drive the equity indices down to their recent lows. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. News that North Korea had fired a missile over Japan has rattled stock markets, after a calmer period when it looked as though the belligerent words and actions from Kim Jong-un had petered out. Japanese prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe called the missile launch an \u201cunprecedented and grave threat\u201d to the country\u2019s security, and both he and US president Donald Trump have vowed to ramp up the pressure on North Korea. But after the initial reaction, traders recovered some of their nerves. The Nikkei 225 is down 0.47%, while the Hang Seng is 0.27% lower. European markets are forecast to be a bit worse off at the open: David Madden,analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Tensions have been running high for a number of weeks now in relation to North Korea, and this move has sent traders running for cover. The situation surrounding North Korea has become more serious now, and we are seeing a risk-off strategy being adopted by traders. There was a knee-jerk reaction to the missile being launched, but after a while traders nerves settled, and we saw a bounce back in equity markets \u2013 which are off the lows of the session. As usual in these circumstances, traders were looking for havens and the yen, ironically, the Swiss franc and gold were in demand. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Investors rushed to the safe haven assets on Tuesday \u2026 the Japanese 10-year yield fell to the lowest level in more than four months. The USDJPY traded at a fresh August low (108.34). Data-wise, the Japanese household spending unexpectedly contracted by 0.2% year-on-year in June. The latest data is bad news for inflation and could have revived the Bank of Japan doves, however the safe haven inflows overshadowed the yen-bears today. As for gold, it climbed to its highest level for nine months, at $1317 an ounce. Elsewhere, crude recovered some of its recent losses as Hurricane Harvey continues to do its damage to Texas and the oil production sites located there. Brent is up 0.44% at $52.12, but again the move was less than might have been expected. Ozkardeskaya said: The re-energized Hurricane Harvey continues devastating the Texas-Louisiana border and companies including Exxon Mobil and Motiva are expected to pause their operations, which should be reflected in US oil inventories over the coming weeks and support a minor recovery in oil prices. Gasoline prices are up for the sixth consecutive session. Our live coverage of the hurricane is here: There are also some nerves in the market before Trump\u2019s speech on Wednesday when he is due to announce tax reform plans. These have been one of the key reasons for the market giving the president some leeway despite all the controversy, but there is still doubt as to whether he will be able to push his proposals through Congress. On another thin day for data, we have had the latest Nationwide house price index (of which more shortly) and French GDP is also due soon.",

Julia Kollewe reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>With the catastrophic Texas floods triggered by Hurricane Harvey set to worsen, early estimates suggest the financial damage it has inflicted has already run into tens of billions of dollars, and one forecaster has predicted the final bill could be as high as $100bn (\u00a377bn).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/28/ex-hurricane-harvey-houston-flooded-as-catastrophe-unfolds-in-texas-latest-updates\">The tropical storm continues to batter south-eastern Texas</a>, where it has so far claimed at least nine lives, and is expected to reach southern Louisiana. Thousands of homes have been flooded forcing residents to seek emergency shelter. US authorities estimate 30,000 people will need shelter.</p> <p>So far predictions of the final cost of the damage vary widely. Some insurance analysts are putting the likely damage at $30 to $50bn \u2013 but point out that not all of this sum will be covered by insurance.

We have a few weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, when the bank will get the chance to put a more dollar-positive view forward.

ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The euro continues to march higher despite ECB President Mario Draghi staying tight-lipped over future policy plans at Jackson Hole (as we expected). The focus now turns to the crucial 7 September ECB meeting: out economists note that the demand for an ECB game plan on tapering is getting stronger by the day; indeed the key arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. However, we note that the ECB\u2019s preference will be for a cautious tapering, with a very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus that ideally doesn\u2019t cause any tightening of financial conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>If the pound is weak against the euro, then it is a different story regarding the dollar.</p> <p>The US currency has been under pressure on concerns about the continuing uncertainty in the White House, while Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen gave it little support in her own speech at Jackson Hole.

Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gold seems to have benefited from the tensions [following the North Korea missile launch], currently trading at a nine-month high. However, most of the gains in the precious metal occurred before the missile launch, meaning that there are different factors supporting prices. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields have been falling since 10 July, with total declines of 10.8%. This partially explains gold\u2019s 8.6% surge since then, and investors are still not buying Trump\u2019s tax reforms. Yields should be much higher than current levels, especially since the Fed didn\u2019t seem to back off on raising rates.</p> <p>Gary Cohn, head of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, has a high probability of replacing Janet Yellen when her term ends by January 2018. Cohn is not only expected to back financial sector deregulation, but also to keep interest rates low in order to support the implementation of Trump\u2019s pro-growth economic policies. This provides another valid reason to purchase the yellow metal.

Ozkardeskaya said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The re-energized Hurricane Harvey continues devastating the Texas-Louisiana border and companies including Exxon Mobil and Motiva are expected to pause their operations, which should be reflected in US oil inventories over the coming weeks and support a minor recovery in oil prices.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After all the furore, it\u2019s hard to remember now that Donald Trump\u2019s combative press conference earlier this month was supposed to be about infrastructure. Holding two flowcharts, the president explained how his latest executive orders would slash the time it takes to get new buildings improved and that the permitting process would \u201cgo very, very quickly\u201d. History will remember that he immediately went on to \u201cvery quickly\u201d deal with another issue , blaming parties on \u201cboth sides\u201d for the fatal clashes during the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia. However, although his infrastructure reforms were lost in that controversy, his regulatory slashing may yet have a long-term, and controversial, impact of its own. As tropical storm Harvey spins slowly over the Gulf coast, catastrophic flooding has forced tens of thousands from their homes in and near Houston. And with the storm moving into Louisiana, officials only expect the number of people whose lives are upended by it to increase. An executive order issued by Trump earlier this month revoked an Obama-era directive that had established flood-risk standards for federally funded infrastructure projects built in areas prone to flooding or subject to the effects of sea-level rise \u2013 like many of those now sinking in Texas. Houston already has some of the laxest building regulations for structures in potential flood zones and the president wants to spread that policy across the US. \u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d said Steve Ellis, vice-president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \u201cTaxpayers deserve to have the assurance that if they provide assistance to a community to build or rebuild, it\u2019s done in a way that isn\u2019t going to cost taxpayers money in the future.\u201d Storms and flooding are generally becoming costlier and more frequent and data suggests climate change is a leading culprit. Many towns are located in coastal areas and riverine floodplains, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says \u201cbuilding codes are often insufficient in reducing damage from extreme events\u201d. The number of \u201cbillion-dollar events\u201d \u2013 natural disasters ranging from flooding to wildfires that incur more than $1bn in damage \u2013 has risen over the past few decades, increasing in cost from a roughly $10bn five-year average in 1985 to more than $50bn in 2015. Obama signed executive order 13690 in 2015 in response to rising sea levels and surface temperatures and more frequent storms, particularly tropical cyclones. The Obama order, with its references to sea-level rise and climate change, became an instant target for an administration eager to expunge those terms from the political lexicon. \u201cThat executive order was meant to help Fema pressure communities to rebuild in a smarter, more resilient way,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cThis removes that pressure.\u201d The regulations associated with 13690 had not yet gone into effect when it was revoked, but several federal agencies \u2013 including Fema (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which funds and oversees public housing projects \u2013 had already initiated the rule-making process. The flood standard, which among other things would have required structures built within a 100-year floodplain \u2013 an area where a major flood statistically has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year \u2013 to be elevated by two feet to prevent flood damage, had its detractors. The National Association of Homebuilders was a staunch opponent of the standard, and argued that more stringent regulations would reduce working-class people\u2019s access to affordable housing due to its effect upon federal home insurance programs. Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, countered that NAHB may have been less concerned about the standard\u2019s impacts upon private development than they were about the limits it could place on development in general. \u201cIf the federal government isn\u2019t going to support the infrastructure that supports a development \u2013 roads and water treatment plants and that sort of thing \u2013 it could make it impossible for development to occur,\u201d he said. \u201cIf private entities want to go in and develop a flood-prone area on their dime, that\u2019s their prerogative, but I don\u2019t see why the federal government should foot the bill for that.\u201d NAHB did not respond to a request for comment. In the days after Hurricane Sandy \u2013 which ravaged the New York City metropolitan area in the fall of 2012 \u2013 federal, state and municipal government agencies poured billions into repairs for flood-damaged public transit, public housing and other types of infrastructure. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, estimated that repairs cost the state nearly $33bn. New Jersey\u2019s bill was close to $30bn. With no standard in place, much of the federal money spent on rebuilding ended up supporting projects in flood zones. Public housing, which often stands upon flood-prone land that was inexpensive for housing authorities to purchase, is particularly vulnerable. According to HUD, more than 11,000 public housing buildings \u2013 5% of the total \u2013 are in flood zones. In total New Orleans has 1,944 buildings in flood zones; Miami and Jacksonville, Florida, have another 1,157, according to HUD. \u201cIn the wake of Hurricane Sandy, a number of public facilities were knocked out that could have been better protected had they been subject to more stringent regulations,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIn part, this is what pushed the Obama administration in that direction, so that they could avoid having to spend federal dollars to rebuild risky structures.\u201d Although the Obama-era executive order has been revoked, there is still a chance that the regulations it spurred could stand on their own. Fema, HUD and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) all had regulations pending to implement the standard set forth by the executive order, and all those agencies had completed public review and were awaiting final adoption of the new rules. \u201cIt\u2019s possible they could still be adopted absent the president\u2019s action,\u201d Moore said. \u201cFor Fema and HUD, it\u2019s vitally important to do so, as all the post-Harvey rebuilding would have to be done to the more protective standard.\u201d The consequences of making it easier to build in flood zones are likely to be severe. So far 30,000 people are projected to have been displaced by flooding from Hurricane Harvey. This is the third major flood in the US this year, and the third the Houston area has seen since March of last year. Catastrophic flooding, whether on the coast or in the river-hashed central plains, is a given. \u201cRevoking the flood standard was a bad idea, but the president can work with lawmakers to protect taxpayers by requiring any rebuilding using federal funds to be built to a higher standard,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIf policymakers don\u2019t protect taxpayers there is going to be a lot of waste and we\u2019re going to be rebuilding again after future storms.\u201d",

And with the storm moving into Louisiana, officials only expect the number of people whose lives are upended by it to increase.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/15/presidential-executive-order-establishing-discipline-and-accountability\">executive order</a> issued by Trump earlier this month revoked an Obama-era directive that had established flood-risk standards for federally funded infrastructure projects built in areas prone to flooding or subject to the effects of sea-level rise \u2013 like many of those now sinking in Texas.</p> <p>Houston already has some of the laxest building regulations for structures in potential flood zones and the president wants to spread that policy across the US.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d said Steve Ellis, vice-president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \u201cTaxpayers deserve to have the assurance that if they provide assistance to a community to build or rebuild, it\u2019s done in a way that isn\u2019t going to cost taxpayers money in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Storms and flooding are generally becoming <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2016-historic-year-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-us\">costlier and more frequent</a> and data suggests climate change is a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-level\">leading culprit</a>.</p> <p>Many towns are located in coastal areas and riverine floodplains, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says \u201cbuilding codes are often insufficient in reducing damage from extreme events\u201d. The number of \u201cbillion-dollar events\u201d \u2013 natural disasters ranging from flooding to wildfires that incur more than $1bn in damage \u2013 has risen over the past few decades, increasing in cost from a roughly $10bn five-year average in 1985 to more than $50bn in 2015.</p> <p>Obama signed <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/30/executive-order-establishing-federal-flood-risk-management-standard-and-\">executive order 13690</a> in 2015 in response to rising sea levels and surface temperatures and more frequent storms, particularly tropical cyclones. The Obama order, with its references to sea-level rise and climate change, became an instant target for an administration eager to expunge those terms from the political lexicon.</p> <p>\u201cThat executive order was meant to help Fema pressure communities to rebuild in a smarter, more resilient way,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cThis removes that pressure.\u201d</p> <p>The regulations associated with 13690 had not yet gone into effect when it was revoked, but several federal agencies \u2013 including Fema (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which funds and oversees public housing projects \u2013 had already initiated the rule-making process.</p> <p>The flood standard, which among other things would have required structures built within a 100-year floodplain \u2013 an area where a major flood statistically has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year \u2013 to be elevated by two feet to prevent flood damage, had its detractors.</p> <p>The National Association of Homebuilders was a <a href=\"https://www.nahb.org/en/research/nahb-priorities/federal-floodplains-management.aspx\">staunch opponent</a> of the standard, and argued that more stringent regulations would reduce working-class people\u2019s access to affordable housing due to its effect upon federal home insurance programs.</p> <p>Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, countered that NAHB may have been less concerned about the standard\u2019s impacts upon private development than they were about the limits it could place on development in general.</p> <p>\u201cIf the federal government isn\u2019t going to support the infrastructure that supports a development \u2013 roads and water treatment plants and that sort of thing \u2013 it could make it impossible for development to occur,\u201d he said. \u201cIf private entities want to go in and develop a flood-prone area on their dime, that\u2019s their prerogative, but I don\u2019t see why the federal government should foot the bill for that.\u201d</p> <p> NAHB did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>In the days after Hurricane Sandy \u2013 which ravaged the New York City metropolitan area in the fall of 2012 \u2013 federal, state and municipal government agencies <a href=\"https://www.esa.gov/sites/default/files/sandyfinal101713.pdf\">poured billions</a> into repairs for flood-damaged public transit, public housing and other types of infrastructure. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, estimated that repairs cost the state nearly $33bn. New Jersey\u2019s bill was close to $30bn. With no standard in place, much of the federal money spent on rebuilding ended up supporting projects in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/after-sandy-government-lends-to-rebuild-in-flood-zones%20FEMA-designated\">flood zones</a>.</p> <p>Public housing, which often stands upon flood-prone land that was inexpensive for housing authorities to purchase, is particularly vulnerable. <a href=\"https://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2015-OE-0007S.pdf\">According to HUD,</a> more than 11,000 public housing buildings \u2013 5% of the total \u2013 are in flood zones. In total New Orleans has 1,944 buildings in flood zones; Miami and Jacksonville, Florida, have another 1,157, according to HUD.</p> <p>\u201cIn the wake of Hurricane Sandy, a number of public facilities were knocked out that could have been better protected had they been subject to more stringent regulations,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIn part, this is what pushed the Obama administration in that direction, so that they could avoid having to spend federal dollars to rebuild risky structures.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Obama-era executive order has been revoked, there is still a chance that the regulations it spurred could stand on their own. Fema, HUD and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) all had regulations pending to implement the standard set forth by the executive order, and all those agencies had completed public review and were awaiting final adoption of the new rules.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible they could still be adopted absent the president\u2019s action,\u201d Moore said. \u201cFor Fema and HUD, it\u2019s vitally important to do so, as all the post-Harvey rebuilding would have to be done to the more protective standard.\u201d</p> <p>The consequences of making it easier to build in flood zones are likely to be severe. So far 30,000 people are projected to have been displaced by flooding from Hurricane Harvey. This is the third major flood in the US this year, and the third the Houston area has seen since March of last year. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-river-flooding\">Catastrophic flooding</a>, whether on the coast or in the river-hashed central plains, is a given.</p> <p>\u201cRevoking the flood standard was a bad idea, but the president can work with lawmakers to protect taxpayers by requiring any rebuilding using federal funds to be built to a higher standard,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIf policymakers don\u2019t protect taxpayers there is going to be a lot of waste and we\u2019re going to be rebuilding again after future storms.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK house prices dipped this month, dragging down the annual growth rate, in further evidence of a cooling market. The average price of a home fell 0.1% between July and August to \u00a3210,495, according to Nationwide, Britain\u2019s biggest building society. Prices rose in July and June but fell between March and May, the first time this had happened since the financial crisis. The latest monthly price drop took the annual growth rate back down to 2.1%, a level last seen in May, which was the lowest rate in four years, from 2.9% in July. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe slowdown in house price growth to the 2-3% range in recent months from the 4-5% prevailing in 2016 is consistent with signs of cooling in the housing market and the wider economy.\u201d He noted that economic growth had halved from last year to about 0.3% per quarter in the first half of this year and that the number of mortgages approved for house purchase hit a nine-month low in June, while surveyors had reported softening in the number of new buyer inquiries. He said in some respects the slowdown in the housing market was surprising, given the strength of the labour market, while mortgage rates have remained close to all-time lows. Household finances are under mounting pressure, with the cost of living rising steadily as the weak pound bites, and wage growth stagnating. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the slowdown in house price growth reflected the squeeze on real wages (adjusted for inflation) and the slowdown in the pace that mortgage rates are falling. \u201cPrices likely will continue to struggle to rise much, given that inflation still has further to rise, consumer confidence has deteriorated sharply since June and lenders intend to reduce the supply of unsecured credit. \u201cFrom February, new lending also will not generate borrowing allowances from the Bank\u2019s term funding scheme, raising the costs of credit significantly. Accordingly, we still think that prices will be up just 1.5% year-over-year in December.\u201d A shortage in the number of homes on the market is underpinning house price growth, with the number of properties on estate agents\u2019 books close to 30-year lows. Nationwide expects prices to rise by 2% over 2017 as a whole. It says house prices across the country are still 12% above their 2007 peak. After increases in stamp duty in spring 2016, revenues from the tax have reached all-time high highs, rising to \u00a312.8bn in the 12 months to June, well above the \u00a310.6bn peak recorded in late 2007.",

      "bodyText": "New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals that management of Australian businesses is dominated by men to an extent that far outweighs the level of men and women in the total workforce. Given the increased number of women staying in the workforce through their 20s and 30s, the reasons for such a disparity are quickly fading. One of the biggest changes in the labour force over the past 40 years has been the increased number of women at work. But while we currently have a higher percentage of women in the workforce than ever before, the latest gender figures on managers across industry shows that women remain massively underrepresented in positions of power. The data on management and organisational capabilities of Australian business provides a quite detailed snapshot of the demographics of Australian managers. It shows for example that the education level of managers for the most part reflects that of all Australian workers. Across all private sector industries (the data excludes the public sector-dominated education and public administration industries) 34% of all managers have a bachelor degree or higher. This compares with 33% of all employees. Managers are slightly more likely to have a diploma or advanced diploma than all workers and slightly less likely to have only completed year 12. But overall the educational level of managers is much the same:: A big reason for this is that most managerial positions are in small to medium-sized businesses. When the educational levels of managers is broken down by size of business, it becomes quickly apparent that the larger the business the more likely the manager will have a university education. Only 32% of managers in business with fewer than five people have a bachelor degree or more, but 46% of managers in businesses of 20-199 people do and a whopping 78% of those in business of more than 200 workers graduated from university: Managers are much more likely to be older than the average worker. While 27% of all employees are under 30, they account for just 5% of all managers. At the other end of the age scale, only 10% of all workers are over 60 years of age, but they make up 19% of all managers: And age is important because it affects the biggest disparity between employees and managers \u2013 gender. While men account for 56% of all employees, they make up 80% of all managers. In no industry is the share of male managers less than the share of male employees. In some cases the disparity is huge. In the healthcare sector, men account for just 22% of all employees, but for 56% of all managers. Just under half of all employees in the real estate services industry are men, but they make up just over three-quarters of the managers: This disparity is even worse once we take into account the size of the business. In every industry except for the professional, scientific and technical services industry, businesses with 200 or more employees have a higher share of male managers than the overall industry: Even in the retail industry \u2013 which is one of the few where a majority of workers are women \u2013 big business managers are more likely to be men than across all industries. The age of managers becomes important when you take into account that most managers are over 40 \u2013 and for most men, unlike for most women, that means having been in work continuously for around 20 years. Women are much more likely than men to have left the workforce in their mid-20s to first give birth and then stay at home to raise children. That time out of the workforce meant that those women were losing experience to their male counterparts \u2013 men who already had the head start given the inherent sexism of employment practices and a corporate world where only 25% of the board members of ASX200 companies are women. But things are improving. The working life of a 55-year-old woman is greatly different from a woman who was born 15 years later in 1977 and is now entering the prime managerial age of her 40s. Only 58% of women born in 1962 were employed in their mid-30s compared with 71% of women born in 1977: And the crucial aspect, given the disparity of male and female managers is that the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s employment rate has also shrunk. The different working lives for men and women born in 1962 is stunning to observe. Just over 86% of men born in 1962 had a job when they were in their early 30s \u2013 28 percentage points higher than for women: For those born 15 years later, in 1977, the gap has closed considerably. By the early 2000s women were returning to the workforce in greater numbers after having children and the difference in the employment rates of men and women in their early 30s was down to 23 percentage points: For those in their early 30s now, the gap is just 17 percentage points: The data on managers provides a nice wake-up call for those who think the issues of gender equality are well on their way to being solved. Across all industries, male managers not only greatly outnumber women, they do so disproportionately to the gender breakdown in those industries. One large historical factor has been the loss of women to the workforce during their mid 20s to early 40s \u2013 years where skills, contacts and experience are gained that lead to managerial work. Better employment practices, funding of childcare, parental leave as well as societal expectations have all led to the gap closing between men and women in the workforce. But this has yet to flow through into the managerial positions. With women who are in their 40s now being among those who have had more time in the workforce than any women previously, the excuses for the disparity of women in managerial positions has fast run out.

But overall the educational level of managers is much the same::</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Manager and employees by education attainment\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tG24m/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> A big reason for this is that most managerial positions are in small to medium-sized businesses. When the educational levels of managers is broken down by size of business, it becomes quickly apparent that the larger the business the more likely the manager will have a university education.</p> <p>Only 32% of managers in business with fewer than five people have a bachelor degree or more, but 46% of managers in businesses of 20-199 people do and a whopping 78% of those in business of more than 200 workers graduated from university:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Education attainment of managers by business size\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iTirK/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Managers are much more likely to be older than the average worker. While 27% of all employees are under 30, they account for just 5% of all managers. At the other end of the age scale, only 10% of all workers are over 60 years of age, but they make up 19% of all managers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of managers and employees by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5UyF2/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And age is important because it affects the biggest disparity between employees and managers \u2013 gender. While men account for 56% of all employees, they make up 80% of all managers.</p> <p>In no industry is the share of male managers less than the share of male employees. In some cases the disparity is huge. In the healthcare sector, men account for just 22% of all employees, but for 56% of all managers. Just under half of all employees in the real estate services industry are men, but they make up just over three-quarters of the managers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percent of managers and employees who are men\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Jm3MA/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> This disparity is even worse once we take into account the size of the business. In every industry except for the professional, scientific and technical services industry, businesses with 200 or more employees have a higher share of male managers than the overall industry:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of managers who are men by business size\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TtOpP/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Even in the retail industry \u2013 which is one of the few where a majority of workers are women \u2013 big business managers are more likely to be men than across all industries. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of managers who are men by business size\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/s1ktC/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The age of managers becomes important when you take into account that most managers are over 40 \u2013 and for most men, unlike for most women, that means having been in work continuously for around 20 years.</p> <p>Women are much more likely than men to have left the workforce in their mid-20s to first give birth and then stay at home to raise children. That time out of the workforce meant that those women were losing experience to their male counterparts \u2013 men who already had the head start given the inherent sexism of employment practices and a corporate world where <a href=\"http://aicd.companydirectors.com.au/advocacy/board-diversity/statistics\">only 25% of the board members of ASX200 companies are women</a>.</p> <p>But things are improving. The working life of a 55-year-old woman is greatly different from a woman who was born 15 years later in 1977 and is now entering the prime managerial age of her 40s.</p> <p>Only 58% of women born in 1962 were employed in their mid-30s compared with 71% of women born in 1977:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average employment rates of women by year of birth and age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zegvt/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And the crucial aspect, given the disparity of male and female managers is that the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s employment rate has also shrunk.</p> <p>The different working lives for men and women born in 1962 is stunning to observe. Just over 86% of men born in 1962 had a job when they were in their early 30s \u2013 28 percentage points higher than for women:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average employment rates of people born in 1962 by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Fnyqz/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> For those born 15 years later, in 1977, the gap has closed considerably. By the early 2000s women were returning to the workforce in greater numbers after having children and the difference in the employment rates of men and women in their early 30s was down to 23 percentage points: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average employment rates of people born in 1977 by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/maKDw/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> For those in their early 30s now, the gap is just 17 percentage points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment rate of men and women aged 30-34\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AaiKJ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/mar/14/stay-at-home-mums-a-drain-on-the-economy-actually-the-problem-might-lie-with-men\">Stay-at-home mothers a drain on the economy? Actually, the problem might lie with men | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The data on managers provides a nice wake-up call for those who think the issues of gender equality are well on their way to being solved. Across all industries, male managers not only greatly outnumber women, they do so disproportionately to the gender breakdown in those industries.</p> <p>One large historical factor has been the loss of women to the workforce during their mid 20s to early 40s \u2013 years where skills, contacts and experience are gained that lead to managerial work. Better employment practices, funding of childcare, parental leave as well as societal expectations have all led to the gap closing between men and women in the workforce. </p> <p> But this has yet to flow through into the managerial positions. With women who are in their 40s now being among those who have had more time in the workforce than any women previously, the excuses for the disparity of women in managerial positions has fast run out.</p> <ul> <li>Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</li> </ul>",
