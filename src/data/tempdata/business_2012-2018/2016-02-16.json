    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prospects of a rise in interest rates from the Bank of England has receded after the latest official figures showed only weak upward pressure on the cost of living. The annual rate of consumer price inflation (CPI) rose to 0.3% in January, compared with 0.2% in the year to December. The 0.3% level is the same as January 2015, since when the figure has been below that. Inflation has now been below the government\u2019s 2% target level for two years \u2013 and analysts believe it will remain below 1% for all of 2016. A rate increase is not thought to be imminent, especially as the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, is focusing on core inflation \u2013 which strips out the impact of changing petrol and food prices. On this measure, inflation fell to 1.2% from 1.4% in December. \u201cGovernor Carney has said recently that he would need to see a pickup in core inflation before raising interest rates,\u201d said Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cAccordingly, the first rate hike looks to still be some way in the distance. Inflation will be going nowhere fast \u2013 it is set to average less than 1% this year.\u201d The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the the main reason for the slight rise in inflation was fuel prices falling by less in January than they did at the same point in the previous year. Petrol prices fell by 2.6% in January compared with a 6.8% fall a year earlier. Clothing, food and alcoholic drinks \u2013 up 5.2% in the month \u2013 also helped to push up inflation. The impact of those increases was offset by falling air fares. Food prices continued to drop last month, but still pushed inflation higher because the fall of 0.6% was less than the 1% a year ago. \u201cThe deepest deflation in the food cabinet came from fish, down 6.8% year-on-year, followed by milk, cheese and eggs and vegetables,\u201d said analysts at Shore Capital. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payments company World First, said: \u201cIt is strange to think that an inflation rate of 0.3% year-on-year is the highest reading we have seen for a year but that is the reality of the global inflation picture.\u201d Interest rates will have been at their 0.5% historic low for seven years next month, and the subdued pace of inflation is being closely watched by Carney and other members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC). Earlier this month, Carney said interest rates would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d go up over the next two years. The one member of the MPC who had been voting for a rise, Ian McCafferty, changed his mind last month. Global markets have been in turmoil as investors digest the implications of interest rates remaining lower for longer than expected, particularly for the banking sector. In Japan, interest rates turned negative on Tuesday as the Bank of Japan attempted to bolster growth and pull the country out of deflation. Investec\u2019s Chris Hare said: \u201cOur central view is that the MPC will not begin raising rates until November this year, but if wobbly market sentiment ends up taking a bite out of the real economy, there is a risk the MPC will wait even longer than that\u201d. Hare said he thought it was unlikely that the Bank of England would need to consider negative interest rates. \u201cIt would take a really major downshift to the inflation outlook for the MPC to even consider joining the expanding club of central banks opting to set negative interest rates,\u201d he said. Oil prices are keeping inflation low, which James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said was good news for Britain. \u201cWhatever turmoil may be stalking the global economy, we should be under no illusions: cheap oil and low inflation are good news for Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the cost of moving goods and people around the world drops, UK households have a bit more to spend or save, and firms can boost their bottom lines, cut prices for their customers or increase their investments. \u201cBritain is in the sweet spot where prices are barely going up, and consumers are happy to keep on spending.\u201d The news is not so good for savers, however, as rates are coming down. Moneyfacts said it had recorded just 21 savings rate rises, compared with 138 rate cuts for savers in January.",

The impact of those increases was offset by falling air fares. </p> <p>Food prices continued to drop last month, but still pushed inflation higher because the fall of 0.6% was less than the 1% a year ago. </p> <p>\u201cThe deepest deflation in the food cabinet came from fish, down 6.8% year-on-year, followed by milk, cheese and eggs and vegetables,\u201d said analysts at Shore Capital.</p> <p>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payments company World First, said: \u201cIt is strange to think that an inflation rate of 0.3% year-on-year is the highest reading we have seen for a year but that is the reality of the global inflation picture.\u201d</p> <p>Interest rates will have been at their 0.5% historic low for seven years next month, and the subdued pace of inflation is being closely watched by Carney and other members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC). </p> <p>Earlier this month, Carney said interest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/bank-of-england-votes-9-0-to-keep-interest-rates-on-hold\">rates would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d go up over the next two years</a>. The one member of the MPC who had been voting for a rise, Ian McCafferty, changed his mind last month.<br></p> <p>Global markets have been in turmoil as investors digest the implications of interest rates remaining lower for longer than expected, particularly for the banking sector. In Japan, interest rates turned negative on Tuesday as the Bank of Japan attempted to bolster growth and pull the country out of deflation. <br></p> <p>Investec\u2019s Chris Hare said: \u201cOur central view is that the MPC will not begin raising rates until November this year, but if wobbly market sentiment ends up taking a bite out of the real economy, there is a risk the MPC will wait even longer than that\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/bank-of-japan-launches-negative-interest-rates-yen-markets\">Bank of Japan launches negative interest rates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hare said he thought it was unlikely that the Bank of England would need to consider negative interest rates.</p> <p>\u201cIt would take a really major downshift to the inflation outlook for the MPC to even consider joining the expanding club of central banks opting to set negative interest rates,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Oil prices are keeping inflation low, which James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said was good news for Britain.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever turmoil may be stalking the global economy, we should be under no illusions: cheap oil and low inflation are good news for Britain,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cAs the cost of moving goods and people around the world drops, UK households have a bit more to spend or save, and firms can boost their bottom lines, cut prices for their customers or increase their investments. </p> <p>\u201cBritain is in the sweet spot where prices are barely going up, and consumers are happy to keep on spending.\u201d</p> <p>The news is not so good for savers, however, as rates are coming down. Moneyfacts said it had recorded just 21 savings rate rises, compared with 138 rate cuts for savers in January. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The price of an average home in Britain rose \u00a318,000 last year, according to government figures that also revealed sharp regional differences in the housing market. The 6.7% pace of growth was slower than the 9% rise recorded in 2014, but far exceeded increases in wages or general inflation. The average home in the UK was valued at \u00a3288,000 at the end of the year compared with \u00a3270,000 in January 2015 and \u00a3252,000 in January 2014. While prices rose fastest in the east of England, in Scotland they ended the year below where they started. Prices in England were up 7.3%, led by rises of 9.7% in the east of England region and 9.4% in London, but they fell by 0.2% in Scotland. In Wales, prices edged ahead just 1% over the year, while in Northern Ireland they were up 1.5%. In contrast, the annual pace of rises in the cost of living in January was only 0.3%, the Bank of England said on Tuesday, the highest level for a year. Meanwhile, wages were ahead just 2% in 2015. The Office for National Statistics said that while house prices in England were now one-fifth higher than their pre-financial crash peak, in Scotland they remained 1.7% below the June 2008 level, while they languished 44.6% below the heights of 2007 in Northern Ireland. Jan Crosby, head of housing at accountants KPMG, warned that the huge gap between house price rises and wage growth was a \u201ccrisis that will only worsen\u201d unless more was done to boost the supply of new homes. \u201cIn 2005, the average price of a home was \u00a3186,000 \u2013 by 2015 it was \u00a3288,000. An increase of more than \u00a3100,000, or 55%, in just 10 years is concerning. In 2005, average annual earnings were \u00a318,949 and by 2015 the ONS recorded them as \u00a322,487. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see reform, in another 10 years the gap between house prices and earnings may have become truly impassable.\u201d One crumb of comfort for hard-pressed first-time buyers is that the ONS recorded a month-on-month fall in house prices between November and December 2015, when they dropped by 0.2%. Estate agents said a short-lived boom by buy-to-let landlords snapping up homes before planned tax changes was now petering out. Paul Smith, chief executive of haart estate agents, said prices had been driven up in part by buy-to-let investors. \u201cThey sought to complete on their second home purchase in anticipation of the 3% stamp duty surcharge coming into effect in April. As we reach mid-February there is little chance of any investor, especially where the transaction is part of a property chain, being able to complete by April and as a result this market anomaly is tailing away.\u201d The ONS figures are regarded as the most reliable data on house prices and its 6.7% figure for the calendar year suggests that the commercial indices produced by Halifax and Nationwide were wide of the mark in 2015. Halifax said house prices grew 9.2% in 2015, while Nationwide put the figure at 4.5%. The Land Registry of England and Wales said the annual inflation rate was 6.4%. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it handed out loans worth \u00a346.7bn to first-time buyers in 2015, up slightly on the \u00a345bn lent in 2014. Lending to landlords jumped sharply, rising from \u00a326.9bn (including remortgages) to \u00a337.5bn in 2015, an increase of 39%. Howard Archer, an analyst with IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cWe expect house prices to rise by around 6% over 2016 amid healthy buyer interest, which could well be fuelled by increased expectations that interest rates will not rise this year, and a relative shortage of properties.\u201d",

But European markets are still putting in a mixed performance after the meeting of - some - oil producers agreed to curb output at January levels but failed to unveil cutbacks. The FTSE 100 is currently 32 points or 0.5% higher while Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.6% and France\u2019s Cac is virtually flat. Meanwhile Brent crude has edged back into positive territory, up 0.4% at $33.53 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More doubts about the oil production agreement unveiled earlier: Wall Street will shortly reopen after the long weekend which included the Presidents Day holiday. The full details of the New York Empire State manufacturing survey can be found here. Oil prices have now fallen into negative territory after their early gains, on disappointment with the agreement to keep production at January levels announced by a group of producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia. Brent crude is now down 0.6% at $33.19 a barrel, having early climbed 4.5% on hopes of output cuts. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down 0.37% at $29.33. Continuing signs of a mixed performance n the US economy have come from the New York Federal Reserve. Its Empire State manufacturing index came in at -16.64 in February, an improvement on the -19.37 in January but well below expectations of a figure of -10. But there was better news on jobs, with the employment index improving from -13 to -0.99, the best level since August. Time for a quick roundup. A group of oil producers have come up with an agreement to keep output pegged at January levels, but the deal needs others to sign up, which could prove a problem. Markets have come off their best levels after news of the outcome of the oil meeting, with investors hoping for news of a cut. UK inflation rose to 0.3% in January but is still well below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. German consumer confidence fell sharply in February in the wake of the market turmoil since the start of the year. Indeed, Iran has already said it will not give up its market share, and will reportedly only discuss output cuts when its production is back to pre-sanction levels. Here\u2019s a graphic showing the world\u2019s biggest oil producers. No Iran shown, which has been producing around 2.9m barrels a day in recent years but had nowhere to export it due to sanctions. Now the restrictions have been lifted it aims to produce another 1m or so barrels a day. More on the UK inflation figures, which could prove a problem for the country\u2019s economy, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: The level of inflation poses a risk to the UK economy but not in the way that you might think. Inflation is worryingly low rather than worryingly high. That may seem a perverse idea at a time when the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index has risen to its highest level in a year... [But] core inflation - the measure of the cost of living that strips out food, fuel and the impact of the chancellor\u2019s decisions on excise duties in the budget - fell from 1.4% in December to 1.2% in January. None of this is a problem at the moment. Inflation at 0.3% coupled with earnings growth of 2% means that real incomes are growing at a reasonably healthy rate. That should help to underpin the economy over the coming months... But low inflation could become a big problem if it morphs into deflation, which means a prolonged period of falling prices rather than the sporadic dips into negative territory seen in 2015. Read Larry\u2019s full analysis here: Here\u2019s Reuters on the agreement to freeze oil output following the meeting in Doha: Top oil exporters Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed on Tuesday to freeze output levels but said the deal was contingent on other producers joining in - a major sticking point with Iran absent from the talks and determined to raise production. The Saud, Russian, Qatari and Venezuelan oil ministers announced the proposal after a previously undisclosed meeting in Doha - their highest-level discussion in months on joint action to tackle a growing oversupply of crude and help prices recover from their lowest levels in more than a decade. The Saudi minister, Ali al-Naimi, said freezing production at January levels - near record highs - was an adequate measure and he hoped other producers would adopt the plan. Venezuela\u2019s Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino said more talks would take place with Iran and Iraq on Wednesday in Tehran. \u201cThe reason we agreed to a potential freeze of production is simple: it is the beginning of a process which we will assess in the next few months and decide if we need other steps to stabilise and improve the market,\u201d Naimi told reporters. \u201cWe don\u2019t want significant gyrations in prices, we don\u2019t want reduction in supply, we want to meet demand, we want a stable oil price. We have to take a step at a time,\u201d he said. The full story is here. Over to Greece, and the task force set up by the European Commission had only mixed results in helping implement reforms. That is the view of the European court of auditors. In a new report it said the task force, set up in 2011, focussed on reforming public administration in Greece, improving the tax system and helping a return to growth by improving the business environment. But it said: Although the Task Force proved itself as a mechanism for delivering complex technical assistance, there were weaknesses in the design of some projects and only mixed results in terms of influence on the progress of reform,. Technical assistance was delivered to the Greek authorities in accordance with the mandate, but it did not always advance the reforms sufficiently [although this] has to be seen in the context of the volatile political situation in Greece. The need for urgency meant that the Task Force was set up very rapidly, without a full analysis of other options or a dedicated budget. It had no single comprehensive strategic document for delivering assistance or for deciding priorities. The delivery of assistance was relevant and broadly in line with the programme requirements, and the Task Force developed a flexible and diversified system for delivery. However, there were weaknesses at project level: procedures to select service providers were not always based on a thorough analysis of the available alternatives, and some long-term assistance contracts did not clearly state what they were expected to deliver. Back with UK inflation, and Chris Hare at Investec expect a gradual rise in inflation with a rate rise in November. But even if market turmoil causes the Bank of England to delay any increase, he cannot see it following others into negative rates: We maintain our view that rises in inflation should be in store in the coming months, driven by (i) the effect of late-2014/early 2015 oil price falls \u201cdropping out\u201d of the annual inflation rate entirely (ii) a waning drag from falls in import prices, which have been pushed down by past strength in the pound (mitigated by a 7% in trade-weighted sterling fall since mid-November) (iii) further rises in wage growth, given strength in the labour market. The prospective rise in inflation is only likely to be gradual, though. That is not least because the oil price has fallen by more than a third since last November. But more importantly for the medium term, wage growth remains stubbornly weak. An absence of significant inflationary pressure, coupled with worries about market volatility and the global economy seen so far this year lead us to think that the Bank of England is in no hurry to raise interest rates. Indeed, the lone MPC hawk, Ian MacCafferty, backtracked from voting for a rate hike at this month\u2019s policy meeting. Our central view is that the MPC will not begin raising rates until November this year, but if wobbly market sentiment ends up taking a bite out of the real economy, there is a risk the MPC will wait even longer than that. We do think though, that it would take a really major downshift to the inflation outlook for the MPC to even consider joining the expanding club of central banks opting to set negative interest rates. And here\u2019s Reuters on what Iran might be thinking about oil output: It appears oil prices and stock markets have once again raced ahead on hopes of a cut in crude production to help deal with the supply glut, only to be once again disappointed. At least this time there was a meeting - unlike previous rumours which proved unfounded. But the suggestion of keeping output at January levels turned out not to be the message the market wanted. So Brent crude, up 4.5% earlier, is now up around 2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.7%, France\u2019s Cac has slipped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 is up just 7 points. The Dow futures have slipped from a near 250 point rise to a 189 point gain at the open. Mike van Dulken, Head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Equity markets slipped from their highs to trade slightly negative. Indices exposed to commodities are giving up gains after several OPEC oil ministers agreed to freeze production at 11 Jan levels, which isn\u2019t quite the \u2018cut\u2019 that oil bulls had been hoping for. Oh and it\u2019s also contingent on other oil producing nations agreeing to the freeze, which Iran is unlikely to given has only just returned to the market after sanctions were lifted. With Opec kingpin Saudi Arabia adding that it\u2019s absolutely comfortable with current prices, it looks like yet another attempt to buoy the oil price with mere rhetoric. The problem is, we\u2019re not fooled by that any more. The poor German consumer confidence figures put the spotlight firmly on the European Central Bank again, and specifically, what it can do at its March meeting, says Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank. On Monday ECB president Mario Draghi promised the bank would not hesitate to act, but Brzeski said: Growth prospects for the German economy have taken a hit from latest market turbulences. At least this seems to be the main message of the just released ZEW index for the German economy. The index, which measures investors\u2019 confidence, dropped to 1.0 in February, from 10.2 in January, and now stands at the lowest level since October 2014. At the same time, the current assessment component fell to 52.3, from 59.7 in January. Against the background of the latest market turmoil, this drop in investors\u2019 sentiment is anything but a surprise. Tumbling stock markets, a stronger euro and more general concerns about the global growth outlook have clearly dented optimism about the German economy\u2019s growth prospects. With these disappointing sentiment data, market participants will look even closer at possible next steps by the ECB. The period in which more or less everyone tries to give the ECB advice on what to do at the next meeting should gradually come to an end. With the release of the January\u2019s meeting minutes on Thursday, the discussion should start to move to what the ECB actually can and wants to deliver in March. In our view, official ECB comments since the January meeting suggest two things: one, the ECB is trying hard to temper and align market expectations to avoid another disappointment as after the December decision; and, two, banks as the crucial link and transmission channel between ECB measures and the real economy are in the limelight again. Particularly the latter is a big concern for the ECB as it shows the limits of what monetary policy can do. With growing despair and fears of monetary policy\u2019s impotence, the ECB will either have to decide on new bold and unprecedented measures or revert to \u201cmore-of-the-same\u201d. Given institutional, legal and political constraints, the \u201cmore of the same\u201d option seems in our view the most likely one for the March meeting. German consumer confidence slumped this month, according to the latest survey from the ZEW institute. The economic sentiment index dropped from 10.2 in January to just 1 so far this month, albeit slightly better than the zero figure many economists had expected. Unsurprisingly sentiment has been hit by falling oil prices, the general turmoil in the financial markets seen since the start of the year and concerns about the state of the global economy. Inflation is unlikely to hit the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target until well into 2017, says Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: The weakness in oil and commodity prices means that consumer price inflation will likely remain extremely low for longer. Furthermore, recent additional price cut initiatives announced by both Asda and Morrisons indicate that the supermarket pricing war is continuing. Consumer price inflation will likely hover around 0.3% in the near-term, before gradually trending up in the second half of the year. It currently looks unlikely to get up to 1.0% until the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect inflation to then trend gradually higher to reach the Bank of England\u2019s target rate of 2.0% late on in 2017. Inflation is likely to remain low for some time, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: After a year of inflation being glued very close to zero, it is now finally rising, although it will surely remain well below the 2% target for some time to come. Many observers predicted that after the US raised interest rates it would just be a matter of months before Britain followed suit. However, global economic pressures have put paid to that and there are no signs of an imminent rate hike on this side of the pond. Inflation may well continue to slowly climb up, but in the grand scheme of things it remains at a very low level. Plus, there are still many factors out there that have the potential to cause havoc with the markets, not least the UK\u2019s EU referendum. Here\u2019s our inflation story: Inflation edged up to its highest rate for a year last month as rises in the price of alcohol and clothing pushed up the cost of living. The consumer prices index (CPI) rose to 0.3% in January from 0.2% in December, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Alcohol and tobacco rose by 1.3% compared with January 2015, when there were heavy discounts on beer. The ONS said inflation also rose as fuel and food prices dropped less than they did a year ago. But despite the rise in CPI, inflation still remains historically low, with the Bank of England predicting inflation to remain far below the government\u2019s 2% target for some time yet. The full report is here: House prices rose by 6.7% annually in December, according to figures also released by the ONS. This compares to an increase of 7.7% in November. In 2015 overall prices rose by 7.9%, up from 5.1% the previous year. Consumer price inflation rose to 0.3% year on year, but month on month it fell by 0.8%. The month on month fall reflected the fall in air fares, as previously mentioned, as well as discounting in the post-Christmas sales. The inflation rate is of course still well below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. The Retail Prices Index grew by 1.3% in the year ending January 2016, up from 1.2% in December 2015. Core consumer price inflation - which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell by more than expected to 1.2%. Meanwhile factory gate prices fell 1% on the year compared with forecasts of a 0.9% decline. And the contributions to the change in CPI: Here\u2019s a summary of the notable movements: The main contributors to the rise in the rate were motor fuels, and to a lesser extent food, alcoholic drinks and clothes, said the Office for National Statistics. Air fare prices fell by more than they did a year ago after a large increase in December, and partially offset the increase in the inflation rate. On motor fuels the ONS said: Motor fuels and lubricants, where overall, prices decreased by 2.6%, compared with a larger fall of 6.8% a year ago. The largest upward contribution to the change in the 12- month rate came from prices for petrol, which dropped by 1.9%, compared with a larger fall of 7.3% between the same 2 months a year ago. A similar, though less pronounced, effect was seen for diesel, with prices falling by 4.0%, compared with a fall of 6.0% a year ago. Breaking news: UK CPI rose by 0.3% in January year on year, in line with expectations and up from 0.2% in December. This is the highest annual rate since January 2015. Qatar\u2019s energy minister Mohammad bin Saleh al-Sada said the decision by his country, Saudia Arabia, Russia and Venezuela to freeze output at January\u2019s levels depended on other major producers following suit. A strategist at Petromatrix, Olivier Jakob, told Reuters: It\u2019s really the first supply management decision taken since November 2014 so even though there will be some that will try to discount it and say it\u2019s not a cut, it\u2019s a change. It\u2019s a big change in policy. Brent crude is now up 1.4%, down from its early 4.5% rise, while shares are also slipping. Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped into negative territory, down 0.14% while the FTSE 100 is now up just 15 points. The Opec news has hit the oil price, which had earlier jumped on hopes of a cut. Saudi Arabia says there has been an agreement to freeze oil production at January levels, Reuters is reporting, in order to cope with the falling crude price. The news comes after a meeting in Doha between Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister Ali al-Naimi and his Russian, Qatari and Venezuelan counterpart. The Saudi minister said they would assess the next steps to stabilising the market in the next few months, and he hoped oil producers both inside and outside Opec would agree to the proposal. He added that the Saudi economy could cope with the current oil price with no problem. The pound is moving higher ahead of the UK inflation numbers. Which has brought renewed talk of possible leaks of government data: As a reminder the UK statistics authority said this last month: The Authority is deeply concerned about the impact that breaches (and apparent breaches) relating to the unauthorised, widespread sharing of statistics before their publication may have on the trustworthiness of the UK\u2019s official statistics system. As expected, Europe has followed Asian markets with a positive start in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up 54 points or 0.9%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has opened 0.4% higher, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.8% better. With crude prices higher and commodity prices recovering, mining shares and oil companies are among the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: We are seeing yet more gains added on to the FTSE-100 in early trade as the bargain hunting continues. The fact that crude oil has broken back above $30/barrel however shouldn\u2019t be ignored either \u2013 Saudi Arabia and Russia are scheduled to meet later today so there\u2019s clearly hope of a deal being struck here, but the obvious flaw here has to be that any failure to progress the idea of production cuts between these two major players could see confidence in this rally undermined. This cycling into risk-on investments has hit gold once again, with miner Randgold being pushed into negative territory, whilst Standard Chartered is also struggling after some negative broker comment [Investec has cut its recommendation from buy to hold]. The Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise negative interest rate policy has come into effect today. Here\u2019s the story: Here\u2019s more on the oil producers\u2019 meeting in Doha which is pushing crude prices higher: Oil prices surged to their highest levels in more than a week as news of a meeting of top officials from the world\u2019s biggest oil producers spurred speculation of an eventual deal to tackle a deep supply glut. US crude rose by as much as $1.50, or 5.1%, to $30.94, the highest since 8 February, building on Friday\u2019s gains of more than 12%. Brent crude for April delivery was up $2 at $35.39 a barrel, on top of 11% gains over the past two days. Top oil officials from Saudi Arabia, Russia and several key Opec members will meet on Tuesday for their highest-level discussion in months, a potentially pivotal sign that producers are at last preparing to tackle a devastating supply glut. The talks in the Qatari capital Doha, which had been kept under wraps until recent days, involve powerful Saudi Oil minister Ali al-Naimi and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak, sources said, two figures who must reach an accord for any co-ordinated global action to hold any hope of success. Full story here: Here\u2019s the schedule of the key events: 9.30 GMT UK inflation 10.00 GMT German and eurozone ZEW consumer confidence index 13.30 GMT US Empire manufacturing The stock market rally of the past couple of days looks as if it is continuing, with positive moves in Asia and an opening rise predicted for European markets. The Nikkei is up 0.2% while the Hang Seng has added just over 1%. In China the CSI300, which dipped back on Monday after its week long break, has climbed 3%. In Europe markets are expected to edge up in early trading: And in the US, the Dow Jones futures are indicating a near 250 point gain when Wall Street reopens after Monday\u2019s Presidents Day holiday. After all the recent turmoil and worries about the state of the banking sector, investors are taking heart from central bank comments suggesting they will do whatever is necessary to support the global economy. The Chinese central bank suggested as much yesterday, as did European Central Bank president Mario Draghi in his appearance at the European Parliament. In the UK Ian McCafferty, who sits on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee and had until recently been voting for a rate rise, has now become more dovish. He said: \u201cI think an immediate rate rise isn\u2019t as necessary as I had felt last autumn.\u201d Meanwhile commodity prices have stablised, with Brent crude currently up 4.5% ahead of a meeting in Doha between Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister Ali al-Naimi and his Russian, Qatari and Venezuelan counterparts. This has prompted hopes that production cuts could be on the table to help stem the supply glut. Elsewhere there are some key economic numbers due, including UK inflation, German consumer confidence and in the US, the Empire manufacturing survey. On inflation the expected range for CPI is 0.3% to 0.5%. Analysts at RBC said: We look for UK inflation to have picked up in January, despite recent news to the downside. We forecast CPI inflation of 0.5% year on year, up from 0.2% year on year in December, as a result of energy-related base effects. Alongside this we see RPI inflation coming in at 1.4% year on year, up from 1.2% year on year (an index level of 258.8). Since last month\u2019s forecast update a number of energy providers have cut household utility bills. This, along with the further dramatic moves to the downside in the oil price since the start of the year, means that our profile for CPI inflation has once again shifted down. We now see CPI inflation only getting to 0.9% year on year by the end of 2016, compared to a forecast of 1.2% year on year as recently as last month. On the ZEW German confidence index, Michael Hewson of CMC Markets UK said: Today\u2019s German ZEW economic expectations survey is likely to give us an insight into how the recent volatility has clobbered overall sentiment. Expectations are for a sharp decline from January\u2019s 10.2 to 0, which would be the lowest reading since October 2014.",

Inflation at 0.3% coupled with earnings growth of 2% means that real incomes are growing at a reasonably healthy rate.

But even if market turmoil causes the Bank of England to delay any increase, he cannot see it following others into negative rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We maintain our view that rises in inflation should be in store in the coming months, driven by (i) the effect of late-2014/early 2015 oil price falls \u201cdropping out\u201d of the annual inflation rate entirely (ii) a waning drag from falls in import prices, which have been pushed down by past strength in the pound (mitigated by a 7% in trade-weighted sterling fall since mid-November) (iii) further rises in wage growth, given strength in the labour market.</p> <p>The prospective rise in inflation is only likely to be gradual, though. That is not least because the oil price has fallen by more than a third since last November. But more importantly for the medium term, wage growth remains stubbornly weak.</p> <p>An absence of significant inflationary pressure, coupled with worries about market volatility and the global economy seen so far this year lead us to think that the Bank of England is in no hurry to raise interest rates. Indeed, the lone MPC hawk, Ian MacCafferty, backtracked from voting for a rate hike at this month\u2019s policy meeting.</p> <p>Our central view is that the MPC will not begin raising rates until November this year, but if wobbly market sentiment ends up taking a bite out of the real economy, there is a risk the MPC will wait even longer than that. We do think though, that it would take a really major downshift to the inflation outlook for the MPC to even consider joining the expanding club of central banks opting to set negative interest rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56c2fb90e4b0978a80bfb76d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-16T10:36:24.040Z\">10.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s Reuters on what Iran might be thinking about oil output:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/livesquawk/status/699542389174759424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rtrs snr srce &quot;familiar with Iranian thinking&quot; says Iran willing to discuss oil output freeze once production is back to pre-sanction levels</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/livesquawk/status/699542389174759424\">February 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56c2f8bfe4b0978a80bfb768\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-16T10:33:21.304Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It appears oil prices and stock markets have once again raced ahead on hopes of a cut in crude production to help deal with the supply glut, only to be once again disappointed.</strong></p> <p>At least this time there was a meeting - unlike previous rumours which proved unfounded.

At least this seems to be the main message of the just released ZEW index for the German economy. The index, which measures investors\u2019 confidence, dropped to 1.0 in February, from 10.2 in January, and now stands at the lowest level since October 2014. At the same time, the current assessment component fell to 52.3, from 59.7 in January. Against the background of the latest market turmoil, this drop in investors\u2019 sentiment is anything but a surprise. Tumbling stock markets, a stronger euro and more general concerns about the global growth outlook have clearly dented optimism about the German economy\u2019s growth prospects.</p> <p>With these disappointing sentiment data, market participants will look even closer at possible next steps by the ECB. The period in which more or less everyone tries to give the ECB advice on what to do at the next meeting should gradually come to an end. With the release of the January\u2019s meeting minutes on Thursday, the discussion should start to move to what the ECB actually can and wants to deliver in March.</p> <p>In our view, official ECB comments since the January meeting suggest two things: one, the ECB is trying hard to temper and align market expectations to avoid another disappointment as after the December decision; and, two, banks as the crucial link and transmission channel between ECB measures and the real economy are in the limelight again. Particularly the latter is a big concern for the ECB as it shows the limits of what monetary policy can do. With growing despair and fears of monetary policy\u2019s impotence, the ECB will either have to decide on new bold and unprecedented measures or revert to \u201cmore-of-the-same\u201d. Given institutional, legal and political constraints, the \u201cmore of the same\u201d option seems in our view the most likely one for the March meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56c2f67be4b0fc61b98c2de2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-16T10:17:05.341Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German consumer confidence falls sharply</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>German consumer confidence slumped this month, according to the latest survey from the ZEW institute.</p> <p>The economic sentiment index dropped from 10.2 in January to just 1 so far this month, albeit slightly better than the zero figure many economists had expected.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly sentiment has been hit by falling oil prices, the general turmoil in the financial markets seen since the start of the year and concerns about the state of the global economy. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56c2f591e4b0fc61b98c2de1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-16T10:11:25.148Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Inflation is unlikely to hit the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target until well into 2017, says Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The weakness in oil and commodity prices means that consumer price inflation will likely remain extremely low for longer.

This, along with the further dramatic moves to the downside in the oil price since the start of the year, means that our profile for CPI inflation has once again shifted down.

      "bodyText": "Anglo American has revealed plans to accelerate the sale of its iron ore, coal and nickel mines, in a sweeping overhaul after its annual profits more than halved and its bonds were downgraded to junk status. The UK-listed global mining company said it was reviewing its options regarding its 70% stake in Kumba Iron Ore, Africa\u2019s biggest miner of steel\u2019s key ingredient. The decision speeds up a plan to pull out of coal and iron ore to concentrate on materials that are in greater demand, such as its De Beers diamond operations, platinum and copper. Anglo American suspended its dividend in December and said it would sell or close more than half its mines in response to the plunging price of iron ore and other metals. The Kumba disposal is part of a plan to raise $4bn (\u00a32.8bn) from asset sales, to cut net debt to less than $10bn this year. The company also said it would review its options on the ill-fated Rio-Minas iron ore project in Brazil after three years. It said it would exit its entire coal operations in Australia, South Africa and Colombia, subject to offers. Mark Cutifani, Anglo American\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe have made significant progress, albeit in an environment that has been deteriorating at a faster pace. Today we are announcing detailed and wide-ranging measures to sustainably improve cash flows and materially reduce net debt, while focusing on our most competitive assets to create the new Anglo American.\u201d Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, cut Anglo American\u2019s rating to junk status on Monday, making it the first London-based miner to suffer the fate amid falling commodity prices. Moody\u2019s said Anglo American would find it more difficult than first thought to reduce debt. Metal prices have fallen because of slowing global economic growth and falling demand from China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of iron ore, copper, nickel and most other commodities. Anglo American\u2019s shares fell by 75% last year and the FTSE mining index almost halved as the slump battered companies\u2019 valuations. Analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland predicted last month that the dividends of oil and mining companies would come under threat from the gloom sweeping through the global economy. Rio Tinto, Anglo American\u2019s larger competitor, scrapped a pledge to maintain its dividend last week after slumping to a net loss for 2015 and posting its worst underlying earnings in 11 years. Anglo American will consider spinning off the Kumba business to shareholders and will also try to sell the Moranbah and Grosvenor coal mines in Australia. Anglo\u2019s nickel business is also for sale, the company said. Earnings before interest and tax fell 55% to $2.2bn in the year that ended in December. Analysts had expected earnings to fall 70% to $1.5bn, according to a Reuters poll. The company\u2019s shares, down 23% this year, fell 6% to 370p in late morning trading.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The level of inflation poses a risk to the UK economy, but not in the way that you might think. Inflation is worryingly low, rather than worryingly high. That may seem a perverse idea at a time when the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index has risen to its highest level in a year. But consider the following. The annual inflation rate did not rise in January because retailers were jacking up their prices. On the contrary, a representative sample of goods and services measured each month by the Office for National Statistics was 0.8% cheaper in January than it was in December. Inflation rose because the January 2016 fall in prices was not quite as big as the January 2015 fall in prices. But the first few weeks of 2015 was when motorists really felt the benefit of the first plunge in oil prices. There has been another downward lurch in oil prices early this year, but its impact has not been as great. Motor fuels and lubricants \u2013 the category in the CPI that covers the cost of petrol and diesel \u2013 fell by 6.8% in January 2015, but by 2.6% in January 2016. As a result, the annual inflation rate was always likely to rise in early 2016. The surprise is that it has not risen more. Indeed, core inflation, the measure of the cost of living that strips out food, fuel and the impact of the chancellor\u2019s decisions on excise duties in the budget, fell from 1.4% in December to 1.2% in January. None of this is a problem at the moment. Inflation at 0.3% coupled with earnings growth of 2% means that real incomes are growing at a reasonably healthy rate. That should help underpin the economy over the coming months. Moreover, since the Bank of England is more concerned about core inflation than it is about headline inflation, there is no immediate prospect of interest rates going up. That too should help to keep activity buoyant. But low inflation could become a big problem if it morphs into deflation, which means a prolonged period of falling prices rather than the sporadic dips into negative territory seen in 2015. How would that happen? Initially, inflation continues to undershoot official forecasts because employers think they can get away with lower pay offers. There are already signs of this happening. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said median basic pay rises of 1.2% are expected in the year to December 2016, down from 2% three months ago. That would leave the economy one moderately serious recession away from outright deflation, because a period of weak growth and rising unemployment would bear down on pay settlements and prices in the shops. Does that recession look imminent? No, it doesn\u2019t. Is one possible within the next 12-18 months? One look at the financial markets provides the answer. Oil\u2019s slippery floor Imagine for a moment that the United States, the European Union and India announced that they were willing to freeze carbon emissions at their current level on the condition China did the same? Would anybody believe that this was a serious attempt to tackle global warming? Unlikely, in all honesty, yet the financial markets seemed to get awfully excited about talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia that would limit oil output at its January level provided Iran and Iraq agree to do the same. Let\u2019s be clear: this is not a deal to put a floor under oil prices; it is a pretty lame attempt at hoodwinking the markets into thinking a deal has been done to put a floor under oil prices. The current state of play is that Russia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest supplier, are flooding the global market with oil. Production is at record levels and is more than enough to meet the needs of a faltering global economy. Even were Iran to agree to limit its output, the freeze agreed by the Russians and the Saudis would do nothing to affect the mismatch between supply and demand that has been driving down the cost of oil. But there is not the slightest possibility that the Iranians \u2013 who are at loggerheads with the Saudis and who have only just been able to regain access to global oil markets after the lifting of sanctions \u2013 will fall into line, and the government in Tehran has said as much. No matter how low the oil price goes, Iran is going to be better off than it was while sanctions were in force. Oil prices rose on Monday when rumours were swirling about that the clandestine talks between the Russians and the Saudis would lead to production cuts. The cost of crude came crashing down again on Tuesday when it was announced that the outcome was a freeze, and a contingent freeze at that. Even so, the downside potential for oil may be limited. The Russian-Saudi talks show that both countries are feeling the pain from the drop in the cost of crude from $115 a barrel to just over $30 a barrel in the past 18 months. They are as yet unwilling or unable to do anything meaningful to reverse that fall. But the pressure is mounting: they will try a bit harder next time.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil flowing easily from a well near Gatwick airport proves large quantities can be brought to the surface, bringing the prospect of an oil bonanza in Sussex closer, the company responsible for the site has said. Shares in UK Oil &amp; Gas Investments jumped more than 40% after it said oil had flowed to the surface under its own pressure at a rate of 463 barrels a day at Horse Hill in Sussex\u2019s Weald Basin. UKOG owns just over 20% of the licence for the HH-1 well. The site has been the subject of fevered speculation since 2014, when test results showed that a well could contain millions of barrels of oil. UKOG sent spirits racing last April when it said there could be 100bn barrels of oil at the site in woodland near the border with Surrey \u2013 dubbed the \u201cGatwick Gusher\u201d. It predicted that up to 15% of the oil could be reached. However, there have been persistent doubts about claims made for Horse Hill\u2019s potential. A week after the announcement, the stock exchange made UKOG clarify that the oil in place should not be treated as a contingent or prospective resource or preserve. Stephen Sanderson, UKOG\u2019s executive chairman, said on Tuesday: \u201cThis is a very significant event for the company and for oil and gas activity in the Weald Basin of southern England. The flow test, the first ever in the lower Kimmeridge limestone within the Weald Basin, provides proof that significant quantities of moveable oil exist within the Kimmeridge section of the well and can be brought to surface at excellent flow rates.\u201d UKOG has faced criticism from environmental groups, which argue that it can only get to the oil using the fracking technique. Other analysts have cast doubt on whether the oil at Horse Hill can be economically viable. The company\u2019s latest announcement suggested that the Gatwick Gusher might turn the area into a mini-Dallas without using fracking after all. Sanderson said: \u201cTests so far show oil has flowed to the surface under its own pressure and has not, so far, required artificial lift. While these flow rates are significant and in excess of management\u2019s expectations, it should be borne in mind that the planned future use of a horizontal well and appropriate conventional reservoir stimulation techniques could likely increase flow rates even further.\u201d Sanderson took over last July from David Lenigas, an Australian entrepreneur with various interests in the oil industry. Lenigas was in charge when the stock exchange ordered UKOG to clarify its claims about Horse Hill\u2019s potential. In late morning trading, UKOG shares were up 33% to 1.9p. The shares, which trade on London\u2019s Aim market, peaked at 3p last June.",

      "bodyText": "EDF plans to extend the life of four nuclear power plants in the UK and has said it is close to announcing a decision on its investment in two new reactors at Hinkley Point. The French energy company said the lives of the Heysham 1 and Hartlepool plants would be extended by five years until 2024, and the closure dates of Heysham 2 and Torness will be delayed by seven years to 2030. The decision will preserve 2,000 jobs and help with tight energy supplies as Britain manoeuvres to keep power flowing during future winters. The plants provide electricity for about a quarter of British homes. EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, announced the extensions as it reported a 68% plunge in profits last year and cut its annual dividend. The company, which has been hit by falling power prices, said net debt increased by \u20ac3.2bn (\u00a32.5bn) to \u20ac37.4bn. The fall in EDF\u2019s annual net profit to \u20ac1.19bn was caused by a tripling of provisions, asset writedowns and other one-off items to \u20ac3.64bn. EDF surprised markets by cutting its dividend to \u20ac1.10 a share after paying \u20ac1.25 for the previous three years. But the company restated the appeal of the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset. EDF has delayed deciding on the plan due to funding problems, according to reports in France. It said: \u201cHinkley Point C is a strong project which is fully ready for a final investment decision and successful construction. Final steps are well in hand to enable the full construction phase to be launched very soon.\u201d A final decision has been pending since October, when China\u2019s state nuclear firm CGN announced that it would take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The deal with EDF and CGN to build Hinkley Point was backed strongly by the chancellor, George Osborne. At the time, EDF said work would begin within weeks to build the two reactors. The company\u2019s share price has fallen by about 40% since the announcement. EDF\u2019s chief executive, Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, said on Tuesday that the decision on Hinkley Point was \u201ccoming closer\u201d, according to Reuters. He said EDF was negotiating final details with CGN and looking at how to finance the operation in the light of low electricity wholesale market prices. Paul Dorfman of the UCL Energy Institute said EDF\u2019s financial position cast doubt on the prospects for Hinkley Point. \u201cUnfortunately, with the best will in the world, it may just not happen,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. \u201cEDF shares have crashed to half their value a year ago; the budget for Hinkley alone is bigger than EDF\u2019s entire market value.\u201d Greenpeace said EDF and the French government were in disarray over the cost and risk of the Hinkley project. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK\u2019s policy director, said: \u201cEDF\u2019s accounts show growing debts and falling earnings. Hinkley is a bad investment and most people with an ounce of financial acumen have now come to realise this. George Osborne stands alone in defending Hinkley\u2019s honour.\u201d",

They are investing in renewables, and that\u2019s a fantastic story, but if they are going to expand the grid, the way to do that, he made it very clear, is coal and Australian coal has a role to play. \u201cI got the clarification that he will need Australian coal for some time to come.\u201d Pressed on whether that demand would increase, Frydenberg said: \u201cBased on the arithmetic I have seen, I think it will.\u201d But Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, urged the government to tread cautiously. \u201cJosh Frydenberg\u2019s general disposition is very bullish for Australian coal but several of his points are factually inconsistent with the existing data,\u201d said Buckley, a financial markets expert. \u201cFor example, he doesn\u2019t clarify the distinction between India\u2019s increasing reliance on coking coal imports versus the declining Indian reliance on imported thermal coal, which is down 15% year on year.\u201d Buckley said while four-fifths of India\u2019s coal usage comprised thermal coal, or the type used in power plants, just 20% comprised coking coal, or the type used in steel production. This meant that coal imports were likely to experience an overall decline, with India aiming to double its domestic thermal coal production by 2020. \u201cEnergy minister Goyal has made it very clear his top priorities are driving improvement in grid efficiency, energy efficiency, solar, wind, hydo capacity expansions and a diversification away from coal over time,\u201d Buckley said. During his speech, Frydenberg also indicated the government was looking at ways to support mineral exploration in Australia, including using Geoscience Australia\u2019s technical expertise to map deposits near the surface and to depths of hundreds of metres. Frydenberg waded into industrial relations, saying the government wanted to \u201crestore some balance\u201d to union right-of-entry laws because officials had, in some cases, made hundreds of site visits over a short period of time.",
