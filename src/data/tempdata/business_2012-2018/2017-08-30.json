      "bodyText": "Luton airport has been named the worst in the UK for the fifth consecutive year, after passengers branded it a \u201crip-off\u201d charging penny-pinching prices despite constant overcrowding. The Bedfordshire hub received a score of 29%, the lowest ever in the annual airports survey carried out by Which? consumer group. Home to short-haul airlines easyJet and Monarch, London Luton has been undergoing a \u00a3110m expansion Doncaster Sheffield notched up the top overall score (87%) in the poll of passengers\u2019 experiences of the UK\u2019s 31 airport terminals, published on Thursday in Which? Travel. Disgruntled Luton users gave the hub the lowest possible score \u2013 one star out of five \u2013 in five of the 10 categories, including queues at security, range of shops and food outlets, provision of seating, toilet facilities and staff helpfulness. In the other five, Luton garnered only two stars \u2013 queues for bag drop, check-in and security control, shop prices and baggage reclaim. Which? said: \u201cThe \u00a3110m Luton expansion project, which began last year and aims to increase capacity by 50% by 2020, cannot have helped the appallingly low customer satisfaction score of 29%. \u201cBut Luton has languished at the bottom of our survey for five years, and building work is no excuse for the one-star staff rating \u2013 or lack of sufficient seats, shops or toilets and the penny-pinching prices.\u201d However, the hub said the Which? findings did not match its ongoing customer service survey, which had responses from 1.7 million people. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in these results as they don\u2019t accurately reflect the experience of the majority of our passengers. Which? polled just 435 of its subscribers who had travelled through London Luton airport between May 2016 and May 2017 \u2013 the most intensive phase of the airport\u2019s redevelopment,\u201d the airport said. \u201cSome 75% [of respondents to our survey] told us they were happy with their experience, a 5% improvement on the same period last year. Since then we have made significant improvements to the airport\u2019s infrastructure, added new shops and restaurants and passenger services, such as free wifi. \u201cAs Which? acknowledges, the airport is currently undergoing the biggest transformation in its history. We appreciate the patience of our passengers as we develop the airport, which will result in a better experience for everyone.\u201d Customer satisfaction at airports attracting more than 10 million passengers every year was getting worse, the survey found. The scores for all but two of the large airports declined since last year, as passenger numbers across the country continue to rise. The scores for all airports, with the exception of Doncaster Sheffield and Southend, slipped year on year, and only four of the UK\u2019s 31 terminals scored more than two stars for prices in shops and food outlets. Doncaster Sheffield and Southend \u2013 the latter regarded as the best alternative to Luton for travellers in and around London \u2013 scored five stars for customer service, but both are small airports with limited services and destinations. Birmingham and Heathrow Terminal 5 were voted joint best large airport, notching up a customer score of 61%. Heathrow T3 and T4 scored 52% \u2013 the same as Gatwick\u2019s South Terminal; Heathrow T2 fared slightly better at 57%. Gatwick\u2019s North Terminal received 51%. Manchester airport scored 43% for T3 and 53% for T2. Aberdeen was another poor performer with 44%. Which? subscribers completed the online survey in April and May and were asked to rate the airports they had used over the past year. The results are based on 10,532 separate experiences, Which? said, with the final score based on overall satisfaction and the likelihood of a recommendation to a friend or relative.",

    "webTitle": "Dara Khosrowshahi's Uber in-tray: 20 issues new chief must address", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Dara Khosrowshahi takes the chief executive\u2019s chair at Uber, his in-tray is groaning with issues in urgent need of addressing. In no particular order, here are 20 of the problems on his extensive to-do list. Deal with the \u2018Kalanick problem\u2019 Uber founder Travis Kalanick might have resigned as chief executive but he still looms large: he has a seat on the board and the right to fill two more chairs. Rumours abound that he wants the top job back one day \u2013 a situation that will surely be intolerable for a new boss with a job to do. Heal the boardroom rift Kalanick\u2019s not-quite-departure has left boardroom harmony in a parlous state. He is in a legal dispute with investor Benchmark Capital, which also has a seat on the board. The firm is suing him for fraud in an attempt to oust him from the boardroom. Address sexism concerns Kalanick\u2019s legacy includes a sexual harassment scandal centred on claims by a former engineer and documented in a report by former US attorney general Eric Holder. More than 20 staff were sacked but the whiff of \u201ctech bro\u201d culture remains. There were also reports of executives \u2013 including Kalanick \u2013 visiting escort bars in South Korea, and an interview with GQ in which Kalanick referred to his supposed desirability among women. \u201cWe call that Boob-er,\u201d he quipped. Shed \u2018creepy\u2019 image If \u201cBoob-er\u201d wasn\u2019t bad enough, Uber is also trying to clean up its act on privacy. It has just announced it will stop its controversial practice of tracking users\u2019 phones for five minutes after they leave the car. This gave the company useful information but was of questionable benefit to users. It also spawned a distracting row with the technology world\u2019s alpha tech bro, Apple. A former employee also testified that Uber spied on celebrities and politicians thanks to its ability to track phones. Most seriously of all, concerns about Uber\u2019s prying eyes reached their zenith when a senior executive was fired over reports he obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India. He reportedly shared that information with Kalanick. Driver behaviour Uber faces serious concerns about the behaviour of its drivers. Police in the UK have accused the firm of failing to report sex attacks by drivers, which the company said was down to a misunderstanding. Separately, Transport for London\u2019s statistics show car accidents in the capital are up since the ride-hailing app arrived on the scene. Employee relations Sticking with drivers, the company is battling a tribunal ruling in the UK that they should be treated as employees, a status conferring rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay. Its appeal against the ruling is due in mid-September. In the US, Kalanick didn\u2019t help labour relations by being filmed berating one of the company\u2019s drivers. Make a profit Despite a reported valuation of $70bn (\u00a354bn) and its global presence, the company has never made a profit. Uber lost $2.8bn in 2016, the largest in a string of annual losses. This, Uber would argue, is because it is in a phase of rapid growth, requiring billions of dollars of investment. Others say its growth is founded partly on subsidising cheap fares to undercut the competition, a practice that cannot continue forever. Go on a hiring spree Uber has been without a finance chief since 2015 . This is particularly pressing if the company is to float on the stock market. There should be plenty of applicants. It also needs a chief operating officer, an engineering chief, a driverless car tech boss and a new company president. The last on, Jeff Jones, quit afetr six months because he said Uber was incompatible with his values. Tackle political opposition National and municipal governments around the world have lined up to put legal roadblocks in Uber\u2019s way, spurred on by vocal taxi lobby groups. From Brussels to Berlin and Rome to Rio de Janeiro, the San Francisco-based firm has been shelling out eye-watering sums on lawyers. Fend off competition Uber may be the best known ride-hailing service but it faces stiff competition from the likes of Lyft, which is quietly wooing customers while Uber acts as a lightning rod for criticism of their shared industry. In China, Uber gave up the ghost and surrendered its business to domestic champion Didi Chuxing. Fighting bribery allegations Closer to home, the fearsome US Department of Justice is investigating whether Uber executives breached the stringent Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which deals with bribery of foreign officials. Dealing with \u2018Greyball\u2019 inquiry As if one DoJ investigation was not enough, prosecutors are also examining whether Uber misused software known as \u201cGreyball\u201d, which it uses to block potentially fraudulent or dangerous customers. Uber allegedly used Greyball to deny rides to officials who might have been investigating its compliance with regulations. War with Waymo (Google) Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is suing Uber. It claims former employee Anthony Levandowski took trade secrets to Uber after leaving Waymo and the joining self-driving truck firm Otto, which Uber then bought. A driverless future? The Waymo suit raises questions about how far and how fast Uber is heading towards a driverless future. Uber has struck deals with auto firms including Ford to research driverless technology but how much of its money should be spent on developing tech it could simply buy at a later date? Take on Transport for London The capital\u2019s transport body wants private hire cab drivers in the UK capital to take English tests, including a written essay segment. Uber is fighting a protracted courtroom battle against this, saying the requirement for good written English is needless and will put drivers out of business. Settle SoftBank investment issue Japan\u2019s SoftBank, known for its fondness for technology start-ups, has been pondering whether to invest in either Uber or Lyft. The change of chief executive could tip the balance in Uber\u2019s favour. Take on Trump Donald Trump can send company\u2019s share prices into a nosedive with a single tweet. Uber is not listed but Khosrowshahi could still feel the force of the US president. Like Kalanick before him, Khosrowshahi has been a vocal critic of Trump \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t pay to have the White House as an enemy. To fly or not to fly? Supposedly, Uber could be testing flying cars in Dallas and Dubai by 2020. Now Uber is under new management, will that be pie in the sky or something to spend investors\u2019 money on? Uber Freight Uber Freight allows companies to hire independent truck drivers to make deliveries. Now Uber owns Otto, it will have to decide how big the opportunity for driverless freight really is. Make nice with the neighbours Uber has been weighing up plans to move away from its HQ from San Francisco, across the Bay to Oakland. It now appears likely to scale back this plan. That might be a blessing, as locals were complaining that an influx of tech employees would gentrify the area and push up prices.",

Matthew Goodman, who served as White House coordinator for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) and the East Asia Summit in the previous administration, told Guardian Australia he believed the Trump administration had given Australia licence to \u201cjust keep the seat warm for the United States\u201d. \u201cI have no hard evidence of this, but I\u2019ve heard senior Trump administration officials have acknowledged Japan and Australia\u2019s interests in moving forward [with the TPP] and haven\u2019t expressed any objections to that,\u201d Goodman said. He said Japan had been \u201crattled\u201d when Donald Trump confirmed the US wouldn\u2019t proceed with the controversial regional trade pact. \u201c[Japan] approached the Trump administration and got their tacit approval to drive this forward\u201d. Goodman, who now holds the William E Simon chair in political economy at the respected Washington thinktank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the US in the Trump era had to look for \u201cworkarounds\u201d given it had enduring interests, both economic and strategic, in this region. He said the US would look to Australia to keep issues of mutual interest ticking over. \u201cWe have to coordinate with allies like Australia to be, in a sense, our proxy, during this period where we are not leading on these issues\u201d. Lead negotiators from the 11 remaining TPP countries met in Sydney in an effort to keep the trade deal alive after the Trump withdrawal. The deal pursued by the Obama administration secured agreement from Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Goodman said Trump\u2019s decision to exit the trade pact was \u201ca mistake\u201d, and had set back America\u2019s strategic interests in the region. \u201cI am critical of the administration on these issues \u2013 this was not helpful to our interests out here, to withdraw from the TPP.\u201d He said the TPP was the economic expression of US influence and connectedness in the region, and he insisted an economic strategy was required in Asia, not just a military presence. \u201cWe have to work at being here, because we are a Pacific power but not an Asian country,\u201d Goodman said. He acknowledged that the TPP was controversial with the public, but he said the trade pact had become a scapegoat of a lot of anxieties, and \u201can easy target\u201d. Goodman said there was a big challenge ahead for supporters of trade liberalisation given there was an underlying set of economic anxieties in developed economies which gave rise to populism, and to Trump. He said the benefits of trade liberalisation were not always obvious to Americans, but the specific transitional costs were front of mind for many people. \u201cWe have to have real answers to those questions,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "US GDP beats forecasts with 3% growth, as markets recover from Korea shock - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After Tuesday\u2019s falls in the wake of the latest North Korean missile launch, markets have regained some of the lost ground. Meanwhile the pound is also recovering after its Brexit-induced weakness. On a busier day for economic data, UK mortgage approvals moved higher but consumer credit slowed. Eurozone economic sentiment also improved and hit a ten year high, although the UK figure showed a decline. In the US, GDP grew by a better than expected 3% annualised in the second quarter, while private sector employment also beat forecasts. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.47%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.62% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.58%. But on Wall Street, markets are struggling after President Trump tweeted that \u201ctalking is not the answer\u201d regarding North Korea. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It was all looking fairly promising, with better than expected US growth and jobs numbers and Wall Street set to open higher. But then Donald Trump tweeted and raised the tensions with North Korea again: So US markets struggled at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 10 points or 0.06%, the S&amp;P 500 down 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite uup 0.1%. Can the US growth continue? Fidelity International\u2019s global economist thinks not. The US growth figures are good news for Donald Trump at least, who promised to boost the economy and increase jobs. The 3% jump in US GDP in the second quarter is more than double the 1.2% increase seen in the first three months of the year. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The acceleration in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected upturns in private inventory investment and federal government spending and an acceleration in PCE [personal consumption expenditure] that were partly offset by downturns in residential fixed investment and state and local government spending and a deceleration in exports. BREAKING: After the ADP jobs data, more evidence of a strong US economy. The country\u2019s economy grew by an annualised 3% in the second quarter, up from an initial estimate of 2.6% and expectations of a rise of 2.7%. From the ADP report: \u201cIn August, the goods-producing sector saw the best performance in months with solid increases in both construction and manufacturing,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u201cAdditionally, the trade industry pulled ahead to lead job gains across all industries, adding the most jobs it has seen since the end of 2016. This could be an industry to watch as consumer spending and wage growth improves.\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said, \u201cThe job market continues to power forward. Job creation is strong across nearly all industries, company sizes. Mounting labor shortages are set to get much worse. The initial BLS employment estimate is often very weak in August due to measurement problems, and is subsequently revised higher. The ADP number is not impacted by those problems.\u201d Ahead of the widely watched US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, a private sector payroll survey has substantially beaten expectations. The ADP jobs report shows US private sector employment increased by 237,000 in August, compared with a 178,000 rise in July and expectations of a 185,000 increase. Here is a breakdown of the German inflation figure, from the Federal Statistics Office: Inflation figures just out from Germany show a higher than expected figure for August. The harmonised consumer price index - using the same methodology across the European Union - came in at 1.8% year on year compared to forecasts of 1.7 which was also the July figure. The month on month figure was also higher than expected at 0.2% rather than 0.1%. Here\u2019s our report on the UK consumer credit figures: The rapid growth in borrowing by consumers appears to be slowing amid a squeeze on households, despite remaining at levels unseen since the financial crisis. The annual rate of growth for consumer borrowing through credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans slowed to 9.8% in July, the lowest rate of expansion since April 2016, according to the Bank of England. The growth rate was a little weaker than in recent months, when the pace of expansion was above 10%. Spending by British consumers is growing at the weakest rate in almost three years, as households come under pressure to tighten their belts from higher prices fuelled by a drop in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. Wages rose by 2.1% in June, while inflation stood at 2.6% in July, leading to negative earnings growth. The figures come as research from Citizens Advice suggests credit card lenders may be targeting people struggling with unaffordable levels of debt, a practice that it said Britain\u2019s financial watchdog should ban. Weaker levels of growth in consumer credit could relieve pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates to slow the rapid expansion in the supply of money. Sluggish GDP growth and inflation coming close to its peak could put off a rate rise until late 2018, or even early 2019. The full story is here: The pound is holding steady against both the dollar and euro after its recent Brexit-induced weakness. It is up 0.027% at $1.2927 and 0.3% to \u20ac1.0821. Economic sentiment in the eurozone may be holding up, but the same cannot be said for the UK, judging from the European Commission\u2019s figures. The overall index for the UK fell from 113.2 to 109.6, with construction and consumer sentiment particularly weak. European markets have lost some of their earlier gains but remain in positive territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Europe\u2019s Wednesday rebound lost some of its shine as the day went on, with investors perhaps struggling to justify their initial cheeriness. The FTSE saw its gains shrink from 0.6% to 0.2%, in large part due to a reversal from Brent Crude, which is once again threatening to fall below $51.50 per barrel. This in turn erased BP\u2019s early growth and sent Shell lower by half a percent, explaining the UK index\u2019s own slowing. The FTSE also wasn\u2019t helped by the pound\u2019s latest attempt at a comeback against the euro, sterling climbing above \u20ac1.08 with a 0.4% increase. Like the FTSE, the DAX and CAC fell from their morning peak, and are now up 0.4% apiece. This despite the euro dropping 0.4% against both the dollar and the pound \u2013 though in the grand scheme of the currency\u2019s summer that kind of pull back is a hill of beans compared to its mountainous climb. Not everyone believes the pound\u2019s recent weakness may not last. Peter Rosenstreich at Swissquote Bank says: Although the pound has recovered slightly against the US dollar and the Euro, it is not a sustainable course. The Bank of England remains dovish: the central bank will not tighten money until there is clear political direction around Brexit. One key indicator will come in October, as the major parties hold their conferences. Investors will also be watching German elections. A decisive victory by Chancellor Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats will boost the Euro. She and France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron intend to cooperate in advancing the European Union\u2019s financial integration. GBP/USD is consolidating around 1.30, while EUR/GBP has no real resistance till 0.9415. EUR/USD should top 1.20, and favourable European economic/political conditions suggest further upside for the pair. After the latest eurozone sentiment survey and ahead of next week\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank, economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said: The August survey indicators all point to some modest improvements compared to July, but the main message is that the economy maintains a healthy cruising speed. Economic growth in the Eurozone seems to be stable at around 2% year-on-year for the moment, well above trend growth. The Economic Sentiment Indicator showed improvements in both services and industry, showing the current economic strength is widespread. Production and employment expectations both improved in the industry sector, but a drop off in employment expectations in services shows there could be some levelling off regarding job market recovery in the months ahead. The key takeaway for monetary policy is inflation expectations did not show an uptick. The current weak inflation environment is likely to have continued in August as we expect the inflation rate to have ticked up marginally to 1.4% and core inflation to have remained stable at 1.2%. In fact, it is unlikely that inflation will increase much above 1.5% for the rest of the year and the ESI inflation expectations confirm that. Consumer inflation expectations decreased marginally from 11.7 to 11.6 in August, and industrial selling price expectations were stable but below the March reading. In the service sector, selling price expectations improved marginally, but they are also still below levels seen earlier in the year. The difficult situation of healthy growth and weak inflation continues to trouble the ECB ahead of next week\u2019s governing council meeting. Although we do expect at least a game plan from the ECB next week and probably a tasking of the relevant committees to investigate tapering options, ongoing weakness in inflation expectations will not make Draghi\u2019s life easier. For those curious about what Moody\u2019s did with its UK growth forecasts in its Global Macroeconomic outlook, it kept them unchanged. Here are the full forecasts: Eurozone economic sentiment came in higher than forecast in August, thanks to optimism in the industrial and service sectors, and among consumers. The European Commission\u2019s sentiment index rose from 111.3 in July to 111.9, better than the 111.3 expected and hitting a ten year high. The figures for the EU as a whole was more or less static (-0.3 points to 111.9), just below its 10-year high of July. And more from the Bank\u2019s lending figures: More on UK consumer credit: Despite July being a traditionally quiet month for the UK housing market, mortgage approvals for that month have come in higher than analyst forecasts. They rose from 65,318 in June to 68,689 last month, according to the Bank of England, better than the 65,500 expected. But consumer credit rose by less than forecast, up \u00a31.179bn compared to expectations of a \u00a31.5bn increase and down on June\u2019s figure of \u00a31.351bn. That was the smallest increase this year. Back with the US, and Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tax reforms will add billions to the already burgeoning US debt mountain, it has been claimed. Speaking of the pound, some analysts believe its current weakness - due in large part to the tortuous Brexit talks - may not last. Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: It is looking increasingly like grid-lock [in the Brexit discussion] and we may need some compromise at a higher level to move forward. That might not come until later in the year, which would mean negotiations being behind schedule. This potential delay is the dominant driver of pound selling that has now taken EUR/GBP to levels that look very much over-extended. While the negative Brexit sentiment could certainly take the pound lower still over the coming weeks, a continued slide in the pound NEER [nominal effective exchange rate] value assumption \u2013 currently averaging 76.650 on a year-to-date basis - would start to add to the inflation overshoot. If the economic data was to show some improvement, then that combination would help provide support for the pound. So we remain sceptical of how much further scope there is for pound selling. On the market recovery, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With little yet to come from North Korea\u2019s latest missile launch \u2013 including an unusually restrained comment from Donald Trump \u2013 the markets felt free to rebound this Wednesday. The European indices were fairly uniform in their gains after the bell. The FTSE jumped 40 or so points, pushing the index to the upper end of the 7300 to 7400 trading bracket it has found itself in for the last 3 weeks. Alongside the general reversal of yesterday\u2019s losses the FTSE also benefited from Brent Crude\u2019s slight rise; the black stuff is now tickling $52 per barrel having slipped under $51.50 on Tuesday, allowing BP and Shell to pull back from yesterday\u2019s lows. Over in the Eurozone the situation was much the same, with the DAX and CAC climbing 0.5% to 0.6% apiece. However, unlike in the UK \u2013 where a similar rise effectively reclaimed Tuesday\u2019s losses \u2013 such growth could only take the tip off of yesterday\u2019s Eurozone plunge. Tuesday saw the Eurozone\u2019s losses exacerbated by the latest romp from the euro, so the German and French indices will be happy to see the currency has calmed somewhat this Wednesday. Against the dollar it\u2019s down 0.4%, and back below $1.195 having crossed $1.205 during Tuesday\u2019s peak, while against the pound the euro has slipped 0.2% (though sterling is still trapped underneath \u20ac1.08). Moody\u2019s has raised its growth forecasts for Germany, France and Italy, and says the eurozone can expect \u201cabove potential\u201d growth this year and next. But it has lowered its prediction for the US outlook. In its Global Macroeconomic Outlook it said the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018 compared to 1.7% last year. \u201cRobust survey indicators in euro area countries suggest that growth should accelerate through the rest of the year, while the consumer confidence indicator at a 16-year high bodes well for the consumer-driven recovery,\u201d said Madhavi Bokil, a vice president at Moody\u2019s and author of the report. In detail it says: Moody\u2019s has revised up Germany\u2019s GDP growth forecasts to 2.2% and 2.0% for 2017 and 2018 respectively. Similarly, Moody\u2019s has raised its forecasts for France to 1.6% for both 2017 and 2018, from 1.3% and 1.4% as the recovery remains on track, driven by net exports and investment. In Italy, Moody\u2019s expects that the recovery will also continue to benefit from supportive monetary and fiscal policies, as well as stronger growth in the rest of the European Union. Moody\u2019s has revised up its real GDP growth forecast to 1.3% in 2017 and 2018 from 0.8% and 1% respectively. G20 economies will collectively grow at an annual rate of slightly more than 3% in 2017 and 2018, higher than last year\u2019s 2.6%. With considerable slack remaining in some euro area economies and some emerging market countries, the current pace of growth around 2% in advanced economies and more than 5% in emerging markets is not only sustainable in the near term, there is potential for upside. As for the US: Moody\u2019s expects US growth of 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018, down from 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively. The revisions in 2017 are a result of weaker performance in the first half of the year. The lower growth forecast for 2018 reflects expectations of a more modest fiscal stimulus than previously assumed. On actions by central banks, Moody\u2019s says: Monetary policy in the US should continue to tighten this year and next. Moody\u2019s also expects euro area monetary policy to become less supportive in 2018, provided that the current growth momentum remains intact. The Bank of Japan\u2019s policy stance will likely become less accommodative once the 2% inflation target is reached, which the central bank expects in 2019. But it warned there were a number of risks, not least the situation with North Korea: \u201cA significant escalation of any of the situations in Korea, the South China Sea and other areas could have significant negative credit implications for the global economy,\u201d said Elena Duggar, an associate managing director at Moody\u2019s. Other risks include a protectionist turn by the US, and any financial market volatility stemming from sudden changes in market expectation regarding monetary policy tightening. After Tuesday\u2019s slide in the wake of North Korea\u2019s latest missile launch, European markets are heading higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.7%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.6% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.7% better. The pound is having another mixed day, but it is not exactly suffering any dramatic moves so far. Against the dollar, sterling has edged down 0.08% to $1.2909 as the US currency steadies after its recent losses. But against the euro, the pound has recovered a little ground, up 0.04% at \u20ac1.0793. Meanwhile gold - which jumped on Tuesday as investors sought havens for their cash - has dipped $1 to $1307 an ounce. The economic impact of tropical storm Harvey will not be felt until next month\u2019s figures at the earliest, so the US data to be released later will be considered in the light of the next Federal Reserve meeting and the central bank\u2019s interest rate policy. Expectations of another US rate rise in the near future have receded - part of the reason for the recent weakness in the dollar - but stronger than expected figures today and on Friday with the non-farm payroll numbers could see sentiment change again. As it it, the ADP report is expected to show around 185,000 new private sector jobs in August after a 178,000 rise in July. Second quarter GDP is forecast to rise from the initial estimate of 2.6% to 2.7% or even 2.8%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets look a little calmer after Monday\u2019s slide in the wake of North Korea\u2019s provocative missile launch over Japan. Investors took some reassurance from President Trump\u2019s relatively measured response. Stating that \u201call options are on the table\u201d is a lot less bellicose than promising \u201cfire and fury\u201d, so after an early fall the Dow Jones Industrial Average actually ended in positive territory, up 0.26%. The positive mood has filtered through to Asia, with the Hang Seng up 0.94% and the Nikkei 225 0.72% better. So European markets are expected to recover a little of Monday\u2019s lost ground: But some believe the markets may be too calm, given the tensions with North Korea and the country\u2019s promise of more action in the region. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Having seen stock markets in Asia and Europe drop sharply and the traditional haven trades rally in the aftermath of North Korea\u2019s provocative missile launch over Japan earlier this week, it wouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to see US markets follow suit. Despite the escalation in tension and the universal condemnation the missile launch has provoked, US markets, despite initially opening sharply lower, rallied strongly in the afternoon session to close the day higher. It is true that flare ups on the Korean peninsula are nothing new and previous instances have always resulted in a winding back of tension, and it would appear that US investors have decided that recent events are likely to go the same way, as the markets \u201cmuscle memory\u201d of selling the panic and then buying the dip kicked in. In ordinary circumstances this might seem sensible, however the events of the last few weeks can hardly be described as ordinary, which suggests that markets could be being rather na\u00efve that current events can be contained. President Trump of course also has to contend with the devastating floods from tropical storm Harvey, both the damage done and the cost to the US economy. Our live coverage of the impact of the storm is here: On top of that, he is expected to give more details of his long awaited tax reform programme. It is also a fairly busy day for data as the month comes to and end. Still with the US, there are second quarter GDP figures and the latest private payroll numbers, which are scoured for clues to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. In the UK there are the latest bank lending and mortgage figures, and in Germany, inflation data for August. The Agenda: 9.30 BST UK consumer credit and mortgage lending (July) 10.00 BST Eurozone confidence figures (August) 13.00 BST German inflation (August) 13.15 BST US ADP employment data (August) 13.30 BST US GDP (second quarter)",

Economic growth in the Eurozone seems to be stable at around 2% year-on-year for the moment, well above trend growth. The Economic Sentiment Indicator showed improvements in both services and industry, showing the current economic strength is widespread. Production and employment expectations both improved in the industry sector, but a drop off in employment expectations in services shows there could be some levelling off regarding job market recovery in the months ahead.</p> <p>The key takeaway for monetary policy is inflation expectations did not show an uptick. The current weak inflation environment is likely to have continued in August as we expect the inflation rate to have ticked up marginally to 1.4% and core inflation to have remained stable at 1.2%. In fact, it is unlikely that inflation will increase much above 1.5% for the rest of the year and the ESI inflation expectations confirm that. Consumer inflation expectations decreased marginally from 11.7 to 11.6 in August, and industrial selling price expectations were stable but below the March reading. In the service sector, selling price expectations improved marginally, but they are also still below levels seen earlier in the year.</p> <p>The difficult situation of healthy growth and weak inflation continues to trouble the ECB ahead of next week\u2019s governing council meeting. Although we do expect at least a game plan from the ECB next week and probably a tasking of the relevant committees to investigate tapering options, ongoing weakness in inflation expectations will not make Draghi\u2019s life easier.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a67de5e4b0f1f2450ba1d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T09:44:36.864Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those curious about what Moody\u2019s did with its UK growth forecasts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/30/markets-recover-after-korea-shock-and-ahead-of-us-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-59a6695ee4b0f1f2450ba190#block-59a6695ee4b0f1f2450ba190\">its Global Macroeconomic outlook, </a> it kept them unchanged.

Against the dollar it\u2019s down 0.4%, and back below $1.195 having crossed $1.205 during Tuesday\u2019s peak, while against the pound the euro has slipped 0.2% (though sterling is still trapped underneath \u20ac1.08). </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a6695ee4b0f1f2450ba190\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T07:40:22.389Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Moody's raises growth forecasts for France, Germany and Italy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Moody\u2019s has raised its growth forecasts for Germany, France and Italy, and says the eurozone can expect \u201cabove potential\u201d growth this year and next. But it has lowered its prediction for the US outlook.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Euro-area-to-achieve-above-potential-growth-over-next--PR_371889\">its Global Macroeconomic Outlook</a> it said the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018 compared to 1.7% last year.</p> <p>\u201cRobust survey indicators in euro area countries suggest that growth should accelerate through the rest of the year, while the consumer confidence indicator at a 16-year high bodes well for the consumer-driven recovery,\u201d said Madhavi Bokil, a vice president at Moody\u2019s and author of the report. In detail it says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Moody\u2019s has revised up Germany\u2019s GDP growth forecasts to 2.2% and 2.0% for 2017 and 2018 respectively. Similarly, Moody\u2019s has raised its forecasts for France to 1.6% for both 2017 and 2018, from 1.3% and 1.4% as the recovery remains on track, driven by net exports and investment.</p> <p>In Italy, Moody\u2019s expects that the recovery will also continue to benefit from supportive monetary and fiscal policies, as well as stronger growth in the rest of the European Union. Moody\u2019s has revised up its real GDP growth forecast to 1.3% in 2017 and 2018 from 0.8% and 1% respectively.</p> <p> G20 economies will collectively grow at an annual rate of slightly more than 3% in 2017 and 2018, higher than last year\u2019s 2.6%. With considerable slack remaining in some euro area economies and some emerging market countries, the current pace of growth around 2% in advanced economies and more than 5% in emerging markets is not only sustainable in the near term, there is potential for upside.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for the US:</p> <blockquote> <p>Moody\u2019s expects US growth of 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018, down from 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively. The revisions in 2017 are a result of weaker performance in the first half of the year. The lower growth forecast for 2018 reflects expectations of a more modest fiscal stimulus than previously assumed.</p> </blockquote> <p>On actions by central banks, Moody\u2019s says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Monetary policy in the US should continue to tighten this year and next. Moody\u2019s also expects euro area monetary policy to become less supportive in 2018, provided that the current growth momentum remains intact. The Bank of Japan\u2019s policy stance will likely become less accommodative once the 2% inflation target is reached, which the central bank expects in 2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it warned there were a number of risks, not least the situation with North Korea:</p> <blockquote> <p> \u201cA significant escalation of any of the situations in Korea, the South China Sea and other areas could have significant negative credit implications for the global economy,\u201d said Elena Duggar, an associate managing director at Moody\u2019s. Other risks include a protectionist turn by the US, and any financial market volatility stemming from sudden changes in market expectation regarding monetary policy tightening. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a664b8e4b06fe41d888944\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T07:15:23.248Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After Tuesday\u2019s slide in the wake of North Korea\u2019s latest missile launch, European markets are heading higher in early trading.<br></p> <p>The FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.7%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.6% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.7% better.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a66024e4b0f1f2450ba171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T07:03:58.820Z\">8.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound is having another mixed day, but it is not exactly suffering any dramatic moves so far.</p> <p>Against the dollar, sterling has edged down 0.08% to $1.2909 as the US currency steadies after its recent losses.</p> <p>But against the euro, the pound has recovered a little ground, up 0.04% at \u20ac1.0793.</p> <p>Meanwhile gold - which jumped on Tuesday as investors sought havens for their cash - has dipped $1 to $1307 an ounce.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a65d62e4b0f1f2450ba15a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T06:46:56.784Z\">7.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The economic impact of tropical storm Harvey will not be felt until next month\u2019s figures at the earliest, so the US data to be released later will be considered in the light of the next Federal Reserve meeting and the central bank\u2019s interest rate policy.</p> <p>Expectations of another US rate rise in the near future have receded - part of the reason for the recent weakness in the dollar - but stronger than expected figures today and on Friday with the non-farm payroll numbers could see sentiment change again.</p> <p>As it it, the ADP report is expected to show around 185,000 new private sector jobs in August after a 178,000 rise in July.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-op Group has entered exclusive talks to buy the wholesale group Nisa in a deal worth more than \u00a3130m, as the major supermarket chains attempt to extend their reach into convenience stores. The move comes as Tesco attempts to take over the Booker wholesale group, which supplies thousands of independent convenience stores operating under the Londis, Premier and Budgens name. Morrisons recently signed a wholesale deal with the McColl\u2019s chain in an attempt to adapt to shoppers\u2019 move away from big supermarkets towards smaller stores. Co-op already runs its own convenience store chain and is a wholesaler to a number of regional co-operatives. The potential deal with Nisa would be the first major acquisition for the group since its major financial crisis in 2013, partly caused by ill-advised buy-outs of the Somerfield grocery chain and the Britannia building society. Nisa, which is owned by more than a thousand independent convenience store owners and supplies 2,500 outlets, said it had granted the Co-op a period of exclusive due diligence in the hope that a deal could progress \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. The exclusive talks come after discussions with Sainsbury\u2019s ground to a halt earlier this month over fears of intervention by competition authorities. Sainsbury\u2019s stepped back after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed serious concerns about the much larger merger between Tesco and Booker. The CMA referred the \u00a33.7bn Tesco deal for an in-depth competition investigation in July and the initial findings of the investigation expected in October. A spokesman for the Co-op said: \u201cWe can confirm that we\u2019ve entered into a period of exclusivity with Nisa, which will provide the opportunity for us to carry out more detailed due diligence in the coming weeks.\u201d Nisa\u2019s chairman, Peter Hartley, wrote to the shareholder-shopkeepers, more than 70% of whom will have to approve any deal: \u201cShould an offer of merit emerge from this process, it will be for you, the members, to decide on whether to accept it. However, it is important to stress, that there is no guarantee that an offer will be forthcoming. \u201cAs you are all aware our business and the convenience sector continue to evolve at pace and the board of Nisa will continue to review serious queries and offers which emerge (within the constraints of any agreed exclusivity period) and which it believes are in the best long-term interest of the members.\u201d It is possible that Sainsbury\u2019s might return with a new bid, but such a move is unlikely until after the CMA releases its findings on the Tesco Booker deal in October. Nisa\u2019s board has been in talks with the Co-op for some time but initially preferred Sainsbury\u2019s. Many of the group\u2019s shopkeeper members, however, are more keen to explore joining up with the mutual as they want to preserve their independence and control over their supply chain. The Co-op is thought to be prepared to offer up to \u00a3140m for Nisa subject to due diligence, which is expected to take about a month. Molly Johnson-Jones, senior analyst at Global Data Retail, said a Co-op acquisition of Nisa would help extend its geographical reach, improve the sourcing of products for both parties and cut costs, creating the opportunity to offset inflation currently affecting UK grocers. She said that Sainsbury\u2019s investors should be relieved that the Co-op had taken the lead in takeover talks as the supermarket was now likely to avoid a CMA investigation and Nisa shareholders\u2019 discontent. \u201cA Co-op-Nisa partnership provides more benefits than a partnership with Sainsbury\u2019s would have done due to complementary business models, supply chains, and customer requirements,\u201d she said. As shoppers have begun to switch away from big supermarkets to buying little and often locally, there has been a rush for consolidation in the highly complex convenience store sector. Both Nisa and the Co-op are understood to have been in talks to take on supplying the 2,200 store Costcutter group, owned by the Bibby Line distribution firm. Industry insiders suggested a three way deal could now be on the cards. Earlier this month, Morrisons signed a wholesale supply agreement with McColl\u2019s, the chain that makes up about 35% of Nisa\u2019s supply business. That deal will see McColl\u2019s gradually withdraw from Nisa over the next year.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland has been criticised for employing jobseekers, without pay, for up to two months under a deal with the government. Several of those who have worked on the scheme told the Guardian they had worked up to 30 hours a week for at least three weeks stacking shelves in Poundland. They were told that the work experience was voluntary but one said: \u201cI had no say in it really.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how many jobseekers have been used by Poundland under the scheme as the government said it did not collect information centrally and the work experience was managed locally by jobcentres across the country. However, one store in Bolton has taken on 21 placements since last August, according to information provided in response to a freedom of information request by the Boycott Workfare pressure group. \u201cConsidering it is supposed to be work experience you\u2019d think they would teach you how to work the till. But we have just been stacking shelves all day,\u201d one person on the scheme told the Guardian. More than one work experience participant in Bolton said that their local jobcentre had provided a bus pass to cover travel expenses and suitable clothing \u2013 of black trousers and a polo shirt. Poundland paid no wages and made no other contribution. Participants said they were not provided with any paperwork to record the time they had spent in a store. All the participants contacted by the Guardian said they had been told they needed to do work experience by a \u201cwork coach\u201d at their local jobcentre. The coach selected Poundland from a list of potential employers. Poundland said it had signed a deal in January with the Department for Work and Pensions, which oversees the Jobcentre Plus work experience programme, to take jobseekers on work experience on condition that this was voluntary and not part of any benefit assessment. It said the programme was designed to \u201chelp provide a taste of the world of work\u201d largely for 18- to 24-year-olds with placements lasting between two and eight weeks and for between 25 to 30 hours a week. Those taking part continue to receive their benefits and store managers had been explicitly briefed that volunteers could not replace any paid employment. \u201cThis is not work experience, this is work \u2013 and Poundland should pay for it,\u201d said Tanya de Grunwald of the Graduate Fog website, which first revealed the existence of the Poundland work experience scheme. A spokesman for the retailer said Poundland did not participate in work programmes such as workfare that could lead to benefits being withheld from participants. It said a number of work experience workers had been given a permanent job, but could not say exactly how many. In 2013, the chain was at the centre of a legal action against the government by Cait Reilly, a geology graduate, who won a case arguing that it was unlawful to force her to work for free at the budget chain as a condition of her claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance. A spokesman for Poundland said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry some of the people you spoke to felt their time with us wasn\u2019t worthwhile. Our stores try hard to make it a positive experience and we know it has been for many. We\u2019re always open to being told directly how to make it better.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that all opportunities \u2013 including those in the retail sector \u2013 are made available to jobseekers to help them move towards permanent work. Work experience is entirely voluntary and gives people the chance to increase their skills and gain vital on-the-job experience, something that businesses really value.\u201d It said that, ideally, claimants should complete only one work experience opportunity, although it is not clear whether this happens in practice.",

      "bodyText": "Credit card lenders appear to be targeting people struggling with unaffordable levels of debt, according to a new report calling on Britain\u2019s financial watchdog to intervene. Research from Citizens Advice finds almost one in five people struggling with debts have had their credit card limit raised without them requesting it. The charity has demanded the Financial Conduct Authority bans the practice, amid growing concerns over a boom in lending. Unsecured lending is returning to levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis, raising alarm bells at the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn, thus putting financial stability at risk. The Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that irresponsible behaviour by some lenders is making people\u2019s debt situation worse \u2013 such as offering more credit when they already have thousands of pounds of unpaid debt.\u201d She said lenders must act responsibly to direct people struggling with debt towards free and independent advice and support \u2013 rather than offering them more credit. People with long term outstanding balances were more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users seeing their limit increased in the past year without requesting it, compared to 12% of all credit card holders, Citizens Advice found. People with credit card debts were also more likely to get into long-term debt than those with personal loans, and were less able to pay their debt down. One pensioner helped by the charity was repeatedly called by firms offering more credit cards, despite the fact that she could only afford to make minimum repayments on her existing debts. She used these to pay essential bills and ended up with a total of 21 credit cards and debts totalling \u00a370,000. Citizens Advice said it has helped 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems in the last year. The most recent figures from the Bank of England showed total levels of consumer debt grew by 10% in the year to June, to almost \u00a3201bn. The last time outstanding debt reached those levels was December 2008, while more than a third of the current levels of outstanding borrowing \u2013 \u00a368.5bn \u2013 is on credit cards. The rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans was among reasons behind a move by Threadneedle Street earlier this year forcing banks to strengthen their financial positions. The FCA is preparing fresh rules to protect consumers from spiralling debt, as it looks to crack down on the high cost of overdrafts and review the booming car loan market. The regulator is moving to force firms to contact customers with persistent debt problems after 18 months, to ask them if they can manage faster repayments. Those that struggle for another 18 months would then be put on a repayment plan. The watchdog estimates that 3.3 million people have fallen into a persistent credit card debt spiral.",

The last time outstanding debt reached those levels was December 2008, while more than a third of the current levels of outstanding borrowing \u2013 \u00a368.5bn \u2013 is on credit cards. </p> <p>The rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans was among reasons behind a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/27/uk-banks-ordered-to-hold-more-capital-as-consumer-debt-surges\">move by Threadneedle Street earlier this year forcing banks to strengthen their financial positions. </a> <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/persistent-debt-earlier-intervention-cp17-10\">The FCA is preparing fresh rules to protect consumers from spiralling debt</a>, as it looks to crack down on the high cost of overdrafts and review the booming car loan market.</p> <p>The regulator is moving to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/03/struggling-credit-card-holders-fees-charges-waived-fca-proposals-persistent-debt\">force firms to contact customers with persistent debt problems after 18 months, to ask them if they can manage faster repayments.</a> Those that struggle for another 18 months would then be put on a repayment plan. The watchdog estimates that 3.3 million people have fallen into a persistent credit card debt spiral. </p> <p><br></p>",
