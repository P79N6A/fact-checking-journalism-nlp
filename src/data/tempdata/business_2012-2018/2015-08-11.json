In a letter to George Osborne, Carney said the Bank would \u201clook at the effects of its policies cumulatively as they are implemented, to consider whether policies designed in pursuit of its primary objective give rise to unintended, undesirable consequences when considered in aggregate.\u201d Carney was writing to the chancellor in his capacity as chairman of the financial policy committee (FPC), set up by the coalition government to attempt to avoid bubbles emerging that could threaten financial stability.

Osborne had written to Carney after his July budget, called after the Conservatives won May\u2019s general election.

Everything depends on what happens next. If the tweak heralds the start of a proper devaluation to boost exports, the world economy will have to adjust to a new China. The process would be painful. The \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d argument dominated on Tuesday. The People\u2019s Bank of China described the move as a \u201cone-off\u201d and presented its decision as part of the five-year plan to allow more liberal winds to blow in China\u2019s markets. Investors had thought the yuan should be lower against the surging US dollar; now it will be and, in future, market forces will play a greater role in fixing the value of the Chinese currency. One can understand how the script could develop happily. Beijing is obsessed with the idea of the yuan becoming one of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s reserve currencies alongside the dollar, the euro, sterling and the yen. Pro-market reforms might encourage the IMF to give a thumbs-up in November, thereby pulling China closer into a global financial system that Beijing would be less inclined to upset. The alternative theory is alarming. Maybe the Chinese economy is weaker than indicated by the official statistics, which nobody trusts anyway. Wages are rising, corporate debts are mounting and the struggle to maintain a loose peg with the dollar has caused a loss of competitiveness against Asian rivals. A classic solution would be to give exporters a shot in the arm by cutting interest rates sharply and allowing the currency to fall. If that were to happen, prepare for upsets. China\u2019s trading partners in Asia would hate the new terms of trade, commodity prices might fall further and fresh currency wars could break out. September\u2019s likely rise in US interest rates would compound tensions. For the moment, judging which interpretation of Beijing\u2019s move is correct is a guessing game. It could indeed be a minor and logical policy shift. The trouble is, the scary theory is also simple: the Chinese economy is stalling and Beijing wants its currency to weaken. If that\u2019s right, the story has only just begun. Co-op Bank\u2019s risky business \u201cCo-op Bank\u2019s failings stand out both for the duration and seriousness of the risk management and control deficiencies uncovered,\u201d says Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). You bet. Read the reports by the PRA and Financial Conduct Authority and be astonished by the feebleness of the Co-op Bank\u2019s approach to assessing and managing risks. In 2009, the bank was, in effect, contemplating betting its future on a merger with the Britannia Building Society. Surely the bosses would wish to know what they were buying in minute detail; and Britannia\u2019s corporate loan book deserved deep scrutiny given that the UK was in post-crisis recession at the time. Instead, an in-house team spent just two days inspecting only 30 corporate loans representing a small portion of Britannia\u2019s credit exposure. \u201cThis was carried out by a review of files which contained little information, often with no reference to the name of the borrower but to a reference number from which the borrower could not be identified,\u201d says the PRA. No written report was prepared for the board and \u201cbetween January 2009 and 1 August 2009, when the merger took place, no further due diligence was carried out in respect of the Britannia corporate loan book\u201d. Extraordinary. The sorry tale continued all the way to early 2013 when the Co-op Bank reassured bondholders and the market that it had enough capital, a claim the FCA calls \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d. The PRA and FCA deem the bank, even today, to be too weak to pay a heavy fine. Fair enough. A censure for the bank will have to suffice for now because, in truth, it is individual culpability that really matters. That is harder to prove because individuals tend to dispute findings when their reputations are on the line and hefty fines a possibility. But, hurry up, dear regulators, we want to hear where individual blame lies. It would be disgrace if the full account of the Co-op Bank\u2019s horrors takes as long to appear as the postmortem on HBOS. Retirement planning When specialist annuity providers Just Retirement and Partnership Assurance came to the stock market in 2013 they were worth a combined \u00a32.5bn.

The chancellor, George Osborne, unleashed a popular storm when he removed the obligation on pensioners to buy an annuity. It makes sense for two providers of \u201cimpaired\u201d annuities \u2013 those for ill pensioners with short life expectancies \u2013 to huddle under a single umbrella. They can cut a few costs and try to win bulk annuity business from corporate defined-benefit schemes. It\u2019s a plan, but it certainly isn\u2019t a quick fix.

      "bodyText": "August 2009 After almost a year of talks, the Co-operative bank and the building society Britannia agree a merger. The former Britannia boss Neville Richardson takes over as the chief executive of Co-operative Financial Services (CFS) and says the deal marks the \u201cnext step in the renaissance of the co-operative and mutual sector\u201d. July 2011 Richardson quits after a restructuring that leads to the loss of 670 financial adviser jobs. He takes away a package worth \u00a34.6m. The bank\u2019s finance director, Barry Tootell, takes the reins. August 2011 The Co-operative Group announces it is bidding for 632 Lloyds branches. December 2011 The Lloyds board approves the Co-op bid. It is warned by the regulator that the Co-op lacks the necessary reserves to underwrite the deal. July 2012 The deal to purchase the branches wins \u201cheads of terms\u201d agreement after a warning four months earlier that it might not get done. George Osborne praises the deal, saying it creates \u201ca new challenger bank\u201d. March 2013 The Co-op Group is dragged to a \u00a3600m loss by its banking arm, which is hit by compensation for PPI mis-selling, bad loan losses and a writedown of its IT system. Britannia is blamed for the bank\u2019s \u00a3257m loss in 2012. These are the last results for the group\u2019s chief executive, Peter Marks, who retires in May. The life insurance, asset management and general insurance businesses are lined up for sale. April 2013 The Co-op withdraws its offer for the Lloyds branches, citing a \u201cworsened outlook\u201d in the economy and \u201cincreasing regulatory requirements\u201d. May 2013 Moody\u2019s downgrades the bank\u2019s credit rating and Tootell resigns. The former HSBC executive Niall Booker is named as his replacement. Euan Sutherland becomes the chief executive of the wider Co-op Group. June 2013 The bank announces a \u00a31.5bn shortfall in reserves after talks with the new regulator, the Prudential Regulatory Authority. It says it will offer up to 49% of shares in the bank to bondholders in exchange for a \u00a3500m debt writeoff. The Co-op Bank chairman, Paul Flowers, is replaced by the former Alliance &amp; Leicester boss Richard Pym. August 2013 The bank reveals the then largest loss in its history \u2013 \u00a3709m \u2013 and warns that without new capital it will not be a going concern. Co-op members begin a campaign to prevent flotation. November 2013 Flowers, when questioned by the Treasury select committee about the Lloyds deal, shows a limited grasp of the bank\u2019s affairs. The Mail on Sunday publishes a video showing him arranging to buy illegal drugs. December 2013 The Co-op Group hires the former City minister Lord Myners to review its operations for a \u00a31 salary. April 2014 The Co-op Group reveals losses of \u00a32.5bn after the most \u201cdisastrous year\u201d in the mutual\u2019s 150-year history. The bank itself reports a \u00a31.3bn loss. May 2014 Flowers pleads guilty to drug charges. The Co-op\u2019s stake in its banking arm is expected to shrink to 20% after rescue fundraising, which includes US hedge funds taking control of the bank. December 2014 The Co-op Bank fails Bank of England stress tests and agrees a plan to accelerate a disposal programme of risky assets. March 2015 Booker is handed a potential \u00a35m pay deal, prompting a row as he prepares to axe more jobs and close further branches. Losses more than halved in 2014. April 2015 The Co-op Group boss, Richard Pennycook, hails the end of the rescue phase as the group returns to profit and cuts debt. June 2015 The Co-op Bank reveals it will begin settlement talks in July with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England after an 18-month investigation. August 2015 The bank escapes a fine but a series of regulatory failures is found by the FCA and the Bank of England. Other investigations are continuing.",

      "bodyText": "Greece has agreed a deal in principle with its lenders about a third bailout, worth around \u20ac85bn and allowing some \u20ac10bn to be disbursed to the country\u2019s struggling banks almost immediately. There is a long list of reforms the country has to carry out in return for the cash. But the agreement needs to be approved by state parliaments, with Greece set to discuss it on Thursday. The Eurogroup of finance ministers is expected to meet on Friday to examine the deal, after conference calls between deputies taking place today. Meanwhile Germany - which seemed to be pressing for a bridging loan for Greece to allow more time to discuss the details of any agreement - has said it would \u201cclosely examine\u201d the bailout deal. But in terms of global stock markets, the optimism over Greece has been put in the shade by the unexpected news that China has devalued its currency, casting doubt on the outlook for the world\u2019s second biggest economy. News that the ZEW German confidence index had declined again in August also unsettled European markets. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to follow all the latest developments. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has said he wants a draft law on the bailout to be discussed in parliamentary committee on Wednesday, with a vote on Thursday. In a letter to the parliament speaker, reports Reuters, Tsipras said: The crucial nature of the situation requires the immediate convening of parliament to proceed with the deal\u2019s approval and allow the disbursement of the first installment. If all is agreed, and eurozone finance ministers give approval on Friday, the agreement will allow Greece to deal with an immediate financial problem, a payment due to the European Central Bank on 20 August. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s story on Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras calling an emergency session of parliament on Thursday to vote on the deal: There may be signs that a deal between Greece and its creditors for a third bailout is on the verge of being agreed, but you would not know it from the day\u2019s performance on global stock markets. Instead investors have taken fright about the surprise devaluation of China\u2019s yuan, and the implications for the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy (poor). The Chinese move sent commodity companies lower as well as the oil price, with Brent crude currently down 3% at $48.9 a barrel. So the commodity heavy FTSE 100 in the UK has been hit hard, while Germany\u2019s stock market also suffered from a disappointing Zew confidence index. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 71.68 points or 1.06% at 6664.54 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.68% to 11,293.65 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.86% lower at 5099.03 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.12% to 23,698.49 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.41% down at 11,152.3 But, as reported earlier, the Athens market closed 2.14% better as a bailout deal edged closer On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently off 1.35% or 238 points. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is wasting no time in pushing through the bailout deal, asking the parliament speaker to complete proceedings for approval by Thursday. But no word on Greece yet from the Eurogroup chair: News of the Greek bailout deal - which Athens said was worth up to \u20ac85bn over three years and would mean an immediate \u20ac10bn for the country\u2019s struggling banks - has lifted its stock market. The Athens exchange has closed up 2.14% and the banking index is 2.95% better - albeit they are still sharply lower on the year. The yield on Greek two year bonds has fallen 4.7%, signalling cheaper borrowing costs. As for Greece, the EU Commission\u2019s chief spokesman sounds optimistic: And from Manulife\u2019s chief economist: Back with China, and London Capital Group\u2019s Brenda Kelly points out: Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, reminds us that Greece is not out of the woods just yet: Whilst an agreement may have been reached and Greece looks increasingly likely to meet the 20 August payment deadline, we are not out of the woods yet. In spite of Greece reaching a technical agreement in principle, the risk of Grexit has not disappeared altogether. There are a number of challenges ahead, including securing passage through the Greek parliament, and some other European parliaments including Germany. Furthermore, other headwinds may emerge in the event of a snap general election and the future debt restructuring talks. Greece will also have to make sufficient progress with reforms, privatisations and achieving a flat primary position for 2015. This is no mean feat with the current state of the banking system and debt burden still weighing on the Greek economy. This bailout agreement is a reassuring sign, but should serve as a reminder of other risks on the road ahead. Another detail about some of the possible changes to come in Greece: As expected, Wall Street has opened lower after China\u2019s surprise devaluation of the yuan cast more doubt on the state of the world\u2019s second largest economy. Greece, which has dominated sentiment for so long, was a secondary issue despite the signs that a third bailout was close to being done. The China syndrome has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 151 points or 0.845 in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 is off around 0.5%. Germany will closely examine Greece\u2019s third bailout deal over the next few days to ensure that it lasts several years, deputy finance minister Jens Spahn has told Reuters. It is decisive that this is a basis for the next few years; it cannot just last a few months. Growth and attractive and reliable conditions for more investments must be the goal. He stressed that it is important for Germany that the IMF stays on board and agrees with the assessment of the European Central Bank and European Commission on Greek debt sustainability and the agreed reforms. The euro has extended gains versus the dollar, hitting a fresh 1 1/2 week high of $1.10750 [see 9:42]. Wall Street is expected to open lower after China\u2019s currency devaluation, the biggest in two decades. Bhaskar Laxminarayan, chief investment officer of Pictet Wealth Management Asia, has looked at the outlook for the reminbi, or yuan, and other Asian currencies. The move looks to have been designed mainly to support the renminbi\u2019s internationalisation, and specifically the Chinese authorities\u2019 aim to have the currency included in the IMF\u2019s SDR basket. In this sense it is a positive step. However, it caught markets off-guard\u2014expectations were for a gradual depreciation to around the renminbi\u2019s current level by the end of the year\u2014and the PBoC\u2019s communication was rather muddled. The Chinese authorities\u2019 intentions are not yet entirely clear. The renminbi is likely to find a new level in the next few days, and to depreciate gradually over the rest of the year. The authorities will not want the currency to depreciate sharply, as this would damage the goal of renminbi internationalisation and stoke capital flight. The Chinese authorities may also have aimed to reduce pressure on exports\u2014on a trade-weighted basis the renminbi had risen by around 13% in the past year. However, the impact on GDP growth from the stimulus to exports is likely to be marginal.\u201d Capital flight is a concern, but cuts in reserve requirements and interest rates are likely. The liquidity situation appears manageable, and there is not a systemic risk to financial stability. In a context of other measures to support the economy, we expect a small boost to economic activity over the remainder of the year, sufficient to support real GDP growth at just below 7%. The Chinese authorities are muddling through as they attempt to maintain growth at the 7% target, but this is complicating long-term efforts to rebalance the economy. Asian currencies face downwards pressure The Korean won, Taiwanese dollar and Singapore dollar appear especially susceptible to further weakening. Outflows from Asia as a region stand to rise, since the renminbi no longer appears the stronghold that many investors had thought. Regionally, the Hong Kong dollar and the Hang Seng may be the only alternative \u2018safe haven\u2019 at present, but are already expensive. Meanwhile, the Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy said the Spanish parliament will probably vote on the bailout package next week. His centre-right People\u2019s Party, which has a majority in parliament, will be asking the other parties to back the deal. He told journalists at an even in northern Spain: The European Union is once again making a big bet. Let\u2019s hope that once and for all this bet will help things get back to normal.\u201d Stubb told reporters, according to Reuters: We must take one step at a time; agreement is a big word. There remains work to be done with details.\u201d The Finnish finance minister said his government will decide its stance later this week, adding that the International Monetary Fund needs to participate in the aid package. He also said Greece\u2019s loan maturities could be extended, but ruled out debt cuts. The Finns have just poured cold water on the deal, with the finance minister Alexander Stubb saying more work needs to be done. He is busy preparing Finland\u2019s budget \u2013 but never too busy to comment on the Greek bailout. Here\u2019s a rough timeline of what\u2019s going to happen next: Tuesday afternoon: Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to speak with German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande Conference call of EU deputy finance ministers Thursday: Greek parliament expected to vote on deal Friday: Eurogroup to meet to approve bailout deal The deal also has to be approved by the other national parliaments. 20 August: Greece has to make \u20ac3.2bn bond repayment to ECB Spain\u2019s prime minister Mariano Rajoy says the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers will meet on Friday to approve the Greek bailout deal. Reuters has reported that the new bailout deal is worth about \u20ac85bn over three years, and that the Greek government did not accept a proposal from creditors to have distressed funds buy bad bank loans, citing a Greek finance ministry official. A spokeswoman for the European Commission has confirmed that a deal has been agreed \u201cin principle\u201d. The Athens stock market is up 2%, while banking shares jumped 7.8%. News of the bailout has failed to lift other European stock markets, which have been dragged lower by carmakers, mining shares and luxury goods stocks such as Burberry \u2013 hit by worries over China. China\u2019s central bank took global markets by surprise when it devalued the yuan by nearly 2%, raising the cost of imports. The move sent Asian stocks and currencies lower. Commodities and oil are also sliding again, with aluminium hitting a six-year low. Brent crude was down 1.3% at $49.75 a barrel while New York light crude slid 1.6% to $44.23. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.9% at 6673.44 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.7% at 11,410.68 France\u2019s CAC down 1.2% at 5132.70 The commission spokeswoman indicated that negotiations should be concluded later on Tuesday. Greece has reached a bailout deal with its creditors \u201cin principle\u201d and a political assessment will be made now, Reuters reported, citing a European Commission spokeswoman. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will hold talks later on Tuesday with German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He spoke to Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Monday. There will also be a conference call of EU deputy finance ministers later in the day. Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt told reporters: The institutions and the Greek authorities achieved an agreement in principle on a technical basis. Now as a next step, a political assessment will be made. There are some small details that need to be finalised.\u201d Reuters has compiled a handy list of the reforms Greece needs to carry out in return for securing up to \u20ac86bn in fresh loans: TARGETS - Greece to produce primary budget surplus starting 2016. - Primary budget deficit of 0.25% of GDP in 2015, followed by surpluses of 0.5% in 2016, 1.75% in 2017, and 3.5% in 2018. - Greek economy to shrink between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2015, contract by 0.5% in 2016, and return to 2.3% growth in 2017. \u201cPRIOR ACTIONS\u201d Some of the \u201cprior actions\u201d, or measures required before bailout aid is disbursed, are expected to include: - New laws on non-performing loans held by banks. - Deregulation of the natural gas market. - Setting up an independent sovereign wealth fund in Greece intended to raise \u20ac50bn, three-quarters of which would be used to recapitalise banks and decrease debt. - Scrapping tax breaks for farmers who now receive subsidised fuel. - Tighter regulation of a repayment system for individuals owing back taxes to the state. - A gradual increase in a system under which taxpayers ranging from the self-employed to small businesses pay tax in advance on their forecast income. - Increase to 6% from 4% of a \u201csolidarity tax\u201d paid by those earning \u20ac50,000-100,000 a year. PASSED Greece passed a number of reforms in July including: - Simplifying VAT rates and applying the tax more widely. - Cutting back on pensions and making the national statistics agency independent. - Measures to overhaul the civil justice system - Adopting EU bank resolution and bail-in rules, applicable from 1 January, 1 2016. TO COME Greece\u2019s bailout agreement is also expected to set a clear timetable for the following measures: - Ambitious pension reform. - Reforms covering Sunday trading, pharmacy ownership, milk sales and bakeries. - Privatisation of electricity transmission network. - Review of rules on collective bargaining, industrial action and collective dismissals. Aline Schuiling, senior economist at ABN Amro, says the decline in German sentiment is probably related to ongoing worries about a Grexit, and a combination of fears of a sharp slowdown of the Chinese economy and falling commodity prices. However, she is not concerned about the outlook for the German economy. Germany\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment unexpectedly staged its fifth monthly decline in a row in August. The ZEW index is largely influenced by sentiment on financial markets, and we do not think that the decline in August is reflecting weaker growth in the German economy. Indeed, we expect GDP growth in Germany to have picked up in Q2, following the slowdown in Q1 and to continue to grow robustly in the second half of this year. Q2 GDP data will be published on Friday and we have penciled in growth of 0.6% qoq. Germany\u2019s economy is benefitting from the weak euro, low energy prices and improved financial conditions due to the ECB\u2019s QE programme. Moreover, employment is growing, real wage growth has jumped higher and corporate profitability has improved as well. Therefore, we expect a broad-based improvement in GDP growth in the coming quarters.\u201d The closely watched ZEW survey of economic sentiment in Germany declined again in August. The index, which gauges the mood among German analysts and investors, fell to 25.0 points from 29.7 in July. This was far worse than expected \u2013 analysts had forecast an improvement in confidence \u2013 but the Mannheim-based think tank noted that the reading is still just above the long-term average of 24.9 points. ZEW president Professor Clemens Fuest said: The German economic engine is still running smoothly. However, under the current geopolitical and global economic circumstances a substantial improvement of the economic situation in Germany over the medium term is improbable. That is why economic sentiment has declined.\u201d You can read the full press release from ZEW here. The assessment of the current situation in Germany improved slightly, with that index rising by 1.8 points to 65.7 points. Whether Berlin accedes to Tsipras\u2019 game plan is another question. Earlier, Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister Jens Spahn contradicted the Greeks\u2019 announcement, saying on German television: \u201cThere are negotiations still going on in Athens\u201d. Our Brussels correspondent Ian Traynor says: The Merkel government has consistently stressed that the fine print of a three-year programme is too important to be rushed and it would prefer to drag the negotiations out while granting Athens \u20ac5bn in bridging loans to help it meet the 20 August \u00a33.2bn bond repayment to the ECB. Chancellor Angela Merkel was said to have reemphasised these points in a telephone conversation with Tsipras on Monday. The leading hawk on Greece, finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, is likely to query the deal when the Eurogroup committee of eurozone finance ministers meet to review it, possibly on Friday.\u201d It is not clear when Athens can tap the first funds from a bailout expected to total around \u20ac86bn over three years, our man in Brussels, Ian Traynor, reports. Nor has the size of the first disbursement been revealed. The Greeks are hoping for \u20ac25bn. As reported earlier, Greece\u2019s Kathimerini newspaper has published a list of 35 \u201cprior actions\u201d the Greeks committed to legislating on before any funds could be disbursed. They included raising the retirement age, phasing out preferential tax treatment for many Greek islands, scrapping fuel subsidies for farmers, and raising taxes for shippers. Traynor writes: Given the dire state of the Greek economy and new figures predicting a slump of up to 2.3% this year, the creditors from the ECB, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the Luxembourg-based bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, appeared to have backed down on setting a key metric for the deal - the level of the primary budget surplus which is the balance of revenue over spending when debt servicing costs are left out of the equation. The Greeks said the primary surplus target was set at 0.25% of GDP for this year, rising to 3.5% by the end of the three-year bailout. In earlier failed negotiations the creditors insisted on 1% for this year. Tsipras has been keen to wrap up the talks on Greece\u2019s third bailout in five years as quickly as possible and the Greek team is said to have been unusually helpful and cooperative given the rancour and recrimination that have characterised relations all year. It is believed that Tsipras is pushing for a quick deal not least for political reasons as his popularity is likely to wane the longer the situation remains unresolved and capital controls remain in place. A quick deal may also enable him to risk early elections to secure his base and rid himself of far left rebels in his Syriza movement who reject the rescue terms and would prefer Greece to quit the euro. The yuan depreciation, which caught many off-guard, has helped the beleaguered euro, lifting it to an 11-day high against the dollar, as investors unwound euro-funded positions on the Chinese currency. The euro hit a low of $1.0960 earlier but has now recovered to trade at $1.041, up 0.2% on the day. Against the yuan, the euro hit a 1 1/2 month high of 6.9816 yuan. Sterling hit a ten-month peak against the Chinese currency, of 9.8690 yuan. Shares in Athens rose 1.36% on Tuesday morning, a cautious reaction to news that a bailout deal is all but sewn up. The Greek banking index jumped 6%, with National Bank of Greece, the country\u2019s biggest lender, gaining 6.6%. Greece\u2019s sovereign borrowing costs also fell: two-year bond yields dropped more than 4 percentage points to 15.27%, while 10-year yields fell 70 basis points to 10.5%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has looked at the European markets. Whilst this [the Greek bailout deal] would in theory bring with it the end of this ugly, and painfully revealing, period for Greece and the eurozone alike, for Alexis Tsipras it provides another stick to be beaten with ahead of his reportedly planned autumn elections. Frustratingly for the DAX and CAC, this news failed to buoy investors, with actions in China taking the focus away from the positive end to the Greek saga; the region\u2019s ZEW economic sentiments later this morning [at 10am London time] could provide some respite, but if the successful resolution of the Greek nightmare couldn\u2019t inspire any growth, it will take some pretty spectacular figures to change investors\u2019 minds. The FTSE once again failed to escape the weight of its oil and mining stocks this Tuesday morning, with the decision by China to devalue the yuan taking its toll on the commodities as a whole... It continues China\u2019s \u2018see what sticks\u2019 approach to fixing its economic woes, and failed to help the already choppy situation in the commodity sector. It\u2019s a move that will also incense the US, which has already accused China of manipulating its currency lower in the past.\u201d The bailout deal, which has apparently been agreed bar a couple of \u201cminor\u201d issues, still needs to be approved by the Greek and other national parliaments. Nick Kounis, head of macro and financial markets research at ABN Amro, talked of a \u201cremarkable turnaround\u201d but warned that Greece is far from being out of the woods, and highlighted five pitfalls. These are the deep recession, ongoing tough austerity, the lack of resolution for the Greek debt mountain, the big financing gap in the programme and the complete lack of ownership of the measures. 1. Deep recession: The economy looks set for another sharp dive, contracting 3% this year and 5% next year in our view. That will be a very tough environment to implement difficult measures. 2. Austerity: Although we do not yet have the details, it seems likely that Greece will be asked to carry out further sharp budget cuts. With the economy slumping, these may prove counter-productive, leading the country to miss targets as tax revenues plummet. 3. The debt mountain: With government debt heading for 200% GDP or above, Greece needs major debt relief. A number of eurozone member states sound like they only want to provide a modest debt reduction by extending maturity of debt, but that may not be enough. 4. Insufficient finance: The ESM will provide EUR 50bn of the EUR 86bn needed. The IMF may provide EUR 15bn, but even then there is a financing gap. 5. Lack of ownership: Greece, Germany and the IMF have expressed doubts about the programme. What happens when the going gets tough?\u201d You can read Kounis\u2019 full note here. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FxPro, says China\u2019s currency devaluation could be seen as a retaliation to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s recent announcement that they believe it\u2019s too early to give the yuan reserve currency status. The People\u2019s Bank of China aims to move the renminbi to a freer floating and accessible currency, prerequisites for it to be given the IMF\u2019s reserve stamp of approval and will see it move in a wider band. The move should also act as a stimulus to Chinese exporters and assist in injecting a little inflation domestically in the face of the continuing decline in commodity prices.\u201d The move has certainly helped the dollar, which retreated on Monday after comments about low inflation from US Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer, who snuffled out the flames lit by Dennis Lockhart last week. Lockhart, another Fed member, reinforced expectations that the first Fed rate hike could come at the meeting in mid-September. This shows how next month\u2019s FOMC meeting and interest rate decision is finely balanced. With the words \u201cdata dependent\u201d being more widely used special scrutiny will be given to US data releases with Thursday\u2019s retail sales being this week\u2019s highlight as today sees yet another quiet economic calendar apart from the German and eurozone ZEW surveys.\u201d European stock markets have opened lower, dragged down by carmakers and luxury goods stocks after China devalued its currency. Germany\u2019s BMW and Swiss luxury group Swatch were among the worst performers as investors worried that the Chinese move smacks of desperation, sparking fresh fears over the state of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.6% at 6697.78 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.7% at 11,526.06 France\u2019s CAC down 0.7% at 5160.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.1% at 11295.9 Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib down 0.4% at 23,872.64 The price of oil, commodities such as copper and gold was also hit as the US dollar strengthened following China\u2019s currency move, ending a brief rally in commodities. The yuan depreciation boosted the dollar and make dollar-denominated currencies more expensive for buyers using other currencies. Copper lost up to 1.9% to $5,209 a tonne; spot gold slid nearly 1% to $1,093.25 an ounce and Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, slipped below $50 a barrel again before recovering somewhat. Germany has once again sounded a note of caution about Greece\u2019s third bailout, saying the new cash-for-reforms deal must address the debt-stricken country\u2019s \u201cbusiness model\u201d over the next three years. German deputy finance minister Jens Spahn told Germany\u2019s ARD television shortly before news emerged that Greece and its creditors had effectively hammered out a new bailout package (apart from a couple of minor issues): We\u2019re talking about a programme for three years, it needs to be negotiated thoroughly. It must be convincing that it\u2019s not just about 20 August.\u201d Germany has repeatedly urged \u201cquality before speed\u201d in the negotiations. It\u2019s not just about making savings, that it works for the budget, but above all about how Greece... earns money in the next few years, what is the \u2018business model\u2019 so to speak.\u201d Last month, the German parliament gave the green light for the eurozone to negotiate a third bailout for Greece, but nearly a fifth of chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives voted \u201cnein\u201d. More instant reaction as \u201cwhite smoke\u201d rises in Athens. Back to Greece, where officials have indicated that they expect the new bailout deal \u2013 Greece\u2019s third \u2013 to be ratified by parliament on Wednesday or Thursday and to be vetted by eurozone finance ministers on Friday. During the marathon talks which started on Monday afternoon and carried on through the night, the debt-laden country and its international creditors agreed on final fiscal targets, aiming for a primary budget surplus (which excludes interest payments) form 2016, Reuters reported, citing a government official. Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services International Limited, has sent us his thoughts on China\u2019s currency devaluation: a) While the perception that this is a \u201cdevaluation\u201d is natural, it is misplaced. In very simple terms, if China is to move towards being part of the SDR [the IMF\u2019s reserve currency fund] and a more liberal FX regime, it is totally inconsistent to have two FX exchange rates, i.e. \u201cfloating\u201d market rate and the daily People\u2019s Bank of China midpoint fix, and obviously it has to be the market rate that has to take precedence. b) Let us also not forget that China\u2019s Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), as calculated by the Bank for International Settlements, has risen by some 14% in the past year, today\u2019s 2.0% drop pales into insignificance. c) Of course, markets that are already fretting about Fed rate lift-off will not appreciate this surprise, but in truth this has been coming for quite some time, China equity market reaction has for choice been quite muted (Shanghai Comp currently +0.3% on the day) d) Has China bitten off rather more than it can chew by enacting all these reforms simultaneously? More than likely. But there are not many choices on that front... The yuan dropped the most in two decades after the devaluation, sending ripples across Asia where stocks slipped and government bonds rallied. Asian currencies lost ground against the US dollar, led by the Australian dollar, as traders and investors reckoned they would need to fall to stay competitive with China. Singapore\u2019s dollar hit a five-year low while the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah fell to levels last seen during the Asian financial crisis 17 years ago. Oil prices slumped, with Brent crude losing 0.87% to $49.97 a barrel while New York light crude shed 1.16% to $44.44. Meanwhile, China has devalued the yuan in an attempt to help exporters after a spate of disappointing economic data, allowing its currency to fall to three-year lows. The move was billed as free-market reform. China\u2019s central bank described it as a \u201cone-off depreciation\u201d of nearly 2%, based on a new way of managing the exchange rate that better reflected market forces. The move risks deepening the global currency war. Here is our full story. New figures out over the weekend showed that China\u2019s exports tumbled 8.3% in July, hit by falling demand from three major trading partners: Europe, the US and Japan. Guo Lei, economist at Founder Securities in Shanghai, told Reuters: We think the move is aimed to ease pressure on China\u2019s weak exports performance in recent months and relieve imported deflation pressure.\u201d British economist Gerard Lyons says: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After all-night negotiations, Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos emerged on Tuesday morning to declare that a bailout deal is imminent, according to Reuters. \u201cTwo or three small issues\u201d remain, he told reporters after a marathon 23-hour session with Greece\u2019s European creditors and the International Monetary Fund in Athens: Greece needs up to \u20ac86bn to stay afloat, with a \u20ac3.2bn bond repayment to the European Central Bank due on 20 August. Earlier, a senior Greek finance ministry official said the two sides had agreed on a wealth fund to handle privatisations, and how to handle non-performing loans in Greece\u2019s banking sector. Both had been sticking points in negotiations. The official said: Finally, we have white smoke. An agreement has been reached. Some minor details are being discussed right now.\u201d For those who speak Greek:",

The renminbi is likely to find a new level in the next few days, and to depreciate gradually over the rest of the year. The authorities will not want the currency to depreciate sharply, as this would damage the goal of renminbi internationalisation and stoke capital flight.</p> <p>The Chinese authorities may also have aimed to reduce pressure on exports\u2014on a trade-weighted basis the renminbi had risen by around 13% in the past year.

They included raising the retirement age, phasing out preferential tax treatment for many Greek islands, scrapping fuel subsidies for farmers, and raising taxes for shippers. Traynor writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the dire state of the Greek economy and new figures predicting a slump of up to 2.3% this year, the creditors from the ECB, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the Luxembourg-based bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, appeared to have backed down on setting a key metric for the deal - the level of the primary budget surplus which is the balance of revenue over spending when debt servicing costs are left out of the equation.</p> <p>The Greeks said the primary surplus target was set at 0.25% of GDP for this year, rising to 3.5% by the end of the three-year bailout. In earlier failed negotiations the creditors insisted on 1% for this year.</p> <p>Tsipras has been keen to wrap up the talks on Greece\u2019s third bailout in five years as quickly as possible and the Greek team is said to have been unusually helpful and cooperative given the rancour and recrimination that have characterised relations all year.</p> <p>It is believed that Tsipras is pushing for a quick deal not least for political reasons as his popularity is likely to wane the longer the situation remains unresolved and capital controls remain in place. A quick deal may also enable him to risk early elections to secure his base and rid himself of far left rebels in his Syriza movement who reject the rescue terms and would prefer Greece to quit the euro.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-11T09:01:26.359Z\">at 10.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55c9b496e4b0115c88093887\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-11T08:42:37.969Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Euro gains following yuan depreciation</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The yuan depreciation, which caught many off-guard, has helped the beleaguered euro, lifting it to an 11-day high against the dollar, as investors unwound euro-funded positions on the Chinese currency.</p> <p>The euro hit a low of $1.0960 earlier but has now recovered to trade at $1.041, up 0.2% on the day.</p> <p>Against the yuan, the euro hit a 1 1/2 month high of 6.9816 yuan.

Des Quinn, the Unite officer for JLR, said the company\u2019s global expansion \u201cshould not be to the detriment of the UK workforce who have built the foundations for that global success\u201d. He added: \u201cThey made sacrifices and worked tirelessly through the dark days to make JLR the world leader it is today and their skills and craftsmanship are central to the carmaker\u2019s continued success. We trust that JLR recognises this by giving assurances on job security for the future.\u201d JLR now employs more than 36,000 people in the UK across its factories in the Midlands and north-west England. However, it also produces cars in India and China, and will open a factory in Brazil next year. In a statement, JLR said the UK will remain the cornerstone of the business. A spokesman added: \u201cWe talk regularly with our trade unions and will discuss with them any concerns they have with this matter.\u201d JLR\u2019s chief executive, Ralf Speth, admitted in 2012 that the firm\u2019s immediate manufacturing ambitions were outside the UK, saying the firm needs to \u201cgo where the markets are\u201d. The company, which has enjoyed a surge in sales and profits since it was bought by India\u2019s Tata in 2008, is carrying out a feasibility study for a factory in the western Slovak town of Nitra. It wants to reach an annual output of up to 300,000 cars over the decade from 2018 when the plant could start production. Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, hailed the decision, saying it was helped by the fact his country is a member of the eurozone, unlike some central European neighbours. JLR said it had turned down other locations in Europe, the US and Mexico in favour of Nitra because of a strong supply chain and good infrastructure. Poland has claimed that Slovakia offered high state subsidies to win the factory, which it was not prepared to match. Slovakia has already attracted Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, South Korea\u2019s Kia and France\u2019s PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, which together build hundreds of thousands of cars in the country each year. The average hourly labour cost in Slovakia is below \u20ac10 (\u00a37), less than half that of Britain, according to Eurostat figures. The plant could help reduce JLR\u2019s reliance on Britain, where it had to offer an improved pay and pensions deal last year to avoid strike action. Last week, JLR\u2019s owner admitted it had cut the carmaker\u2019s prices, sales and production targets in China amid a slowdown in the premium car market. Chinese sales at BMW and General Motors have also been affected. China\u2019s car manufacturing association has cut its 2015 sales growth forecast to 3% from 7%.",

      "bodyText": "Fresh jobs and wages data for the UK will be closely scrutinised by the Bank of England and the City for evidence that the surprise jump in unemployment reported last month was a blip. With the economy growing strongly in the second quarter, the latest figures for the labour market are expected to show a modest improvement in employment and annual earnings growth running close to 3%. Financial markets were taken aback when the Office for National Statistics reported that unemployment on the internationally agreed measure stood at 1,853,000 in the three months ending in May \u2013 15,000 higher than it had been in the quarter ending in February. The narrower yardstick of unemployment, the claimant count for June, showed a 7,000 increase to 804,200, the first monthly jump since October 2012. Some economists believe that the weaker labour market data is evidence of tougher times ahead. Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee and a labour market expert, said: \u201cOil prices are falling. Commodity prices are falling. Chinese exports are falling. In the UK, the last labour market data showed unemployment and inactivity both up.\u201d Blanchflower said the fact that only one MPC member, Ian McCafferty, voted for rates to increase this month suggested that the Bank also suspected the economy was on the turn.

      "bodyText": "The growing row over the price of milk is a \u201cmorality issue\u201d and farmers will not stop their protests despite Morrisons launching a new milk brand designed to support the dairy industry, the head of the campaign group Farmers For Action has warned. Morrisons tried to calm the milk crisis on Tuesday by announcing it will launch a new brand that will give customers the choice of paying more to support farmers. Morrisons Milk for Farmers will cost 10p extra per litre than Morrisons\u2019 current own-brand milk, with the premium paid directly to dairy farmers. This means that a four-pint bottle of the new milk will cost \u00a31.12, compared to 89p for Morrisons\u2019 own-brand milk, which will remain on sale. The announcement followed talks between Morrisons and disgruntled farmers, who have blockaded the company\u2019s distribution centres and overseen the mass purchase of milk from supermarket shelves. However, David Handley, the chairman of Farmers For Action, which organised the protests, said Morrisons had not gone far enough. \u201cWe welcome it, but it is just not going to inject enough money into the industry,\u201d he said. Handley will meet Morrisons for further talks on Friday, with the National Farmers Union (NFU) and other union leaders also in attendance. The campaign against Morrisons will be halted until then, but Handley said that \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d there would be further protests if more concessions were not offered. \u201cAm I optimistic? Probably yes,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the initiative they have started, they can see there is a major problem and it needs to be dealt with.\u201d Handley said that dairy farmers were being used by Morrisons so it could get more shoppers into its stores. \u201cWhy is it necessary to use milk as a loss leader to get people into a shop? Why should farmers bear the brunt of that? There is a morality issue here, and corporate responsibility. Now we will see if there is a moral corporate responsibility within the Morrisons business,\u201d he said. Meurig Raymond, the NFU president, said: \u201cThis is a welcome first step. We need Morrisons to make sure there are plenty of resources available to promote this product. It must also be displayed prominently in store.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have also had discussions with Morrisons about how it can introduce further initiatives to support dairy, including cheese, butter and yoghurt. We will continue to urge Morrisons and all retailers to ensure that farmers from all sectors who supply their food get a fair price.\u201d The NFU has warned that farming is in a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and that many farms are on the brink of financial ruin because the price of milk has fallen by 25% over the past year. Figures from AHDB Dairy, the trade body, show that the average UK farm gate price for milk has fallen to 23.66p per litre. However, industry experts claim it costs farmers 30p per litre to produce milk, meaning farms are facing financial ruin as a result of the fall in prices. Protesters have targeted Morrisons and Asda because they have not followed Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s in paying farmers a higher price based on production costs. Farmers have blamed the fall in prices on a supermarket price war but retailers claim the drop reflects an international decline in commodity prices and an oversupply of milk partly caused by Russia\u2019s block on western imports. Martyn Jones, corporate services director at Morrisons, said the price the supermarket pays for milk \u201creflects the highly competitive retail market\u201d. He added: \u201cWe recognise that the current market for liquid milk is impacting on hardworking dairy farmers and their families. \u201cWe want to reassure the industry that the retail price we charge for Morrisons milk reflects the highly competitive retail market. It is not linked to the price we pay our milk suppliers.\u201d The new Morrisons milk brand will be launched in conjunction with Arla, the UK\u2019s largest milk supplier. Arla works with 3,000 dairy farms, about a third of the total in the UK, which will share the extra proceeds from the milk. Morrisons Milk for Farmers will go on sale in the autumn in all Morrisons stores. Jones said: \u201cWe want to offer practical help by launching a range of four-pint milk at a retail premium of 10p per litre, all of which will be passed back directly to dairy farmers. We will stock this product in all our stores, offering our customers the choice to support dairy farmers directly.\u201d",

You bet. Read the reports by the PRA and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and be astonished by the feebleness of the Co-op\u2019s approach to assessing and managing risks. In 2009, the bank was, in effect, contemplating betting its future on a merger with the Britannia building society. Surely the bosses would wish to know what they were buying in minute detail \u2013 especially about Britannia\u2019s corporate loans, given that the UK was in post-crisis recession at the time. Instead, an in-house team spent just two days inspecting only 30 corporate loans, representing a small portion of Britannia\u2019s credit exposure. \u201cThis was carried out by a review of files which contained little information, often with no reference to the name of the borrower but to a reference number from which the borrower could not be identified,\u201d said the PRA. No written report was prepared for the board and \u201cbetween January 2009 and 1 August 2009, when the merger took place, no further due diligence was carried out in respect of the Britannia corporate loan book\u201d. Extraordinary. The sorry tale continues all the way to early 2013 when the Co-op reassured bondholders and the market that it had enough capital, a claim the FCA calls \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d. The PRA and FCA deem the bank, even today, to be too weak to pay a heavy fine. Fair enough. A censure for the bank will have to suffice because, in truth, it is individual culpability that really matters. That is harder to prove because individuals tend to dispute findings when their reputations are on the line and hefty fines a possibility. But, hurry up, regulators, we want to hear where individual blame lies. It would be a disgrace if the full account of the Co-op\u2019s horror show takes as long to appear as the postmortem on HBOS.",

In 2009, the bank was, in effect, contemplating betting its future on a merger with the Britannia building society.

      "bodyText": "What is the dispute about? British farmers are unhappy that the price they are paid for milk has fallen by 25% over the past year. They are blaming supermarkets for the slump, and specifically the price war that has been caused by the \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 losing sales to the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Asda and Morrisons have been targeted by protesters because they have failed to follow Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s in agreeing to pay a higher price for milk that is based on the cost of production. Why are farmers concerned? A 25% drop in the price of the product you sell is difficult for any business to deal with, but the problem is even worse for farmers because many are being forced to sell milk for less than it costs to produce. According to AHDB Dairy, the average farm gate price for a litre of milk is 23.66p. However, industry experts say it costs farmers 30p per litre to produce milk. If this gap in prices continues, farms face financial ruin. Dairy farms have been closing at the rate of nine a week in the past year in England and Wales. Protests have been taking place most years. Why is this year different? The price of milk is notoriously volatile, as is the relationship between supermarkets, milk processors such as Dairy Crest, and farms. However, the difference this year is the magnitude of the fall in milk prices, and the fact that there is a ferocious price war taking place between supermarkets, making them a lightning rod for criticism from angry farmers. Are supermarkets actually to blame? Roughly 80% of UK milk is sold through retailers, with the remaining 20% used in ingredients for other products, so they are clearly vital customers for farmers. However, supermarkets have used milk as a weapon in the price war, boasting about cuts to prices. For example, according to mySupermarket, Morrisons has cut the price of a two-pint bottle of milk from 89p at the end of May to 74p. Not only that, but farmers are unhappy that the supermarkets do not promote British-sourced products and label them clearly. In response, the supermarkets claim that the fall in the price reflects declining commodity prices around the world and an oversupply of milk in Europe, partly caused by Russia\u2019s block on western imports. What will Morrisons\u2019 new milk brand mean for shoppers and farmers? Morrisons has announced it will sell a new brand called Morrisons Milk for Farmers, which will allow shoppers the option of paying more for their milk to support farmers. A four-pint bottle of the new brand will cost \u00a31.12, compared to 89p for Morrisons\u2019 existing own-brand milk, which will remain on sale. The extra money will go directly to 3,000 dairy farmers who work with Arla, Morrisons\u2019 main supplier. However, campaigners have said that this is not enough to end the crisis, and will hold further talks with Morrisons aimed at winning more concessions from the supermarket chain. Are all the supermarkets the same? Not at all. The best big stores have agreements in place to buy milk with guaranteed prices \u2013 with around 30p per litre deemed the minimum \u2013 but this only covers around 14% of milk sold for home consumption. Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and M&amp;S, are considered the good \u2013 or at least, the better \u2013 guys because 100% of their own-brand milk is bought under fair trade deals. Waitrose pays 32.1p per litre, while Tesco pays 31p per litre \u2013 but the fair trade deals they have in place only cover their own brands of milk. Other milk products such as cheese and yoghurt are mostly not covered. M&amp;S on 1 June cut the price it paid suppliers to 32.8p. Sainsbury\u2019s pays 30.9p per litre. Who is the best? In May 2014, Booths launched a Fair Milk scheme, pledging to pay the highest prices to farmers. The chain, which has more than 30 stores across the north, pays 33p per litre, the highest price among the big retailers \u2013 10p per litre more than the worst-paying stores. What about the Co-op? The big player in the convenience sector raised prices for farmers in 2012 but has since cut back. It now pays 28.3p per litre to its 200 dedicated farm suppliers, which is better than the worst offenders, but still less than the 30p that farmers demand. Which shops should I avoid? Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl and Asda have been singled out by farmers as not paying a fair price \u2013 or hiding behind the fact that they buy their milk from the big producers, who pay well below 30p. Arla, a milk co-operative which is owned by farmers, cut the price it pays for milk to 23p. It supplies a number of stores and has its own brand of milk. Is buying from the doorstep delivery service better? Yes and no. Last week, Dairy Crest, the UK\u2019s biggest milk processor, cut its price by 1.4p to just under 22p, way below the 30p guide. However, small independents often pay better rates as many are connected to a dairy.",

    "webTitle": "Why has China devalued its currency and what impact will it have?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What has China done? China\u2019s central bank has devalued the yuan by nearly 2% against the US dollar for the second time in two days to boost exports and take it a step nearer to becoming an official reserve currency. Why has Beijing acted now? Industrial production, investment and retail sales data for July were weaker than expected, while at the weekend figures showed Chinese exports tumbled 8.3% in July, their biggest drop in four months. After a string of weakening output growth figures going back to last year, the authorities have come intense pressure internally to address the slowdown with a dramatic policy shift. Why focus on the currency\u2019s value? The dollar has appreciated over the past year in anticipation of the US raising interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. Since the yuan loosely tracks the dollar, it has been dragged higher \u2013 keeping its differential with the greenback roughly the same, but at the expense of making the country\u2019s goods dearer compared to regional rivals, especially South Korea and Japan. That has hit Chinese exports badly. Now the US Federal Reserve is close to its first rate rise in seven years, potentially pushing the dollar to new highs, the situation is set to worsen from China\u2019s point of view. What has the central bank done exactly? On Monday, the People\u2019s Bank of China set its daily \u201creference rate\u201d for the yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan \u2013 in effect 1.86% lower. That triggered a further fall in the currency markets. As the authorities pick the mid-point from the previous day as the basis for the next day\u2019s reference rate, they were forced to devalue again or risk ignoring market forces. Choosing the former, it set the rate at 6.3306, fractionally weaker than Monday\u2019s market close. The spot rate has responded by falling another 1.6% on Tuesday, likely forcing a further devaluation. The currency moves are the biggest one-day falls in 20 years, and in particular, since China reformed its currency system in 2005. Back then, it unpegged the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), from a strict tie with the dollar in favour of a looser tracking policy. The successive devaluations follow a further shift in policy that means the bank will now expand the criteria used to calculate the daily fix \u2013 the rate at which it determines the currency\u2019s value each morning and from which it is in theory allowed to move 2 percentage points in either direction, although in practice the moves are much smaller. How can it help the Chinese economy? Chinese businesses compete with regional rivals to supply the world with everything from raw steel to fridges, and a cheaper yuan will make Chinese exports less expensive, potentially boosting the overseas sales that have been among the main drivers of growth during the nation\u2019s remarkable rise over the past three decades. However, controls on the currency have given Chinese businesses a high degree of predictability when they plan investments in industries heavily dependent on exports. How can this move help the yuan become a reserve currency? China is seeking to build on its 2005 reforms in an effort to have the yuan included in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) basket of special drawing rights (SDR) reserve currencies. Its remaining controls have been a stumbling block in gaining admittance to the select group of the US dollar, the euro, the pound and the yen. The bank\u2019s move to include more information when setting its daily fix can be seen as a relaxation of controls, moving the currency a step closer to satisfying the IMF\u2019s entry requirements. The organisation said this month that significant work still needed to be done for the yuan to be considered before its next review in November. Will it do the trick? Liu Dongmin, director of the international finance research office at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: \u201cA reasonable adjustment of the RMB\u2019s value is good for China\u2019s exports and also good for the RMB to be admitted to the SDR. But most importantly, this marks key progress for RMB exchange rate reform since 2005 and a major step for RMB marketisation.\u201d Despite this, Beijing\u2019s long-promised goal of free currency convertibility probably remains distant. How will the US react? The devaluation could prompt an angry reaction from the US, which has consistently argued that the yuan is undervalued, damaging US exports. It could also force other Asian countries to devalue, making exports to the US cheaper and increasing Washington\u2019s trade deficit further. Will China export more than just cheaper goods and services? Central banks in the US and the UK are toying with raising interest rates to combat the prospect of higher inflation. But cheaper Chinese goods will reduce inflationary pressures and keep interest rates lower for longer. Less welcome will be the export of unemployment, as Beijing effectively prices western workers out of a job to protect its own economy. Why does the Chinese currency have two names? It is similar to referring to the pound and sterling. Renminbi is the official name of the currency and means the people\u2019s currency. Yuan, like the pound, is the name of a unit of the currency.",

After a string of weakening output growth figures going back to last year, the authorities have come intense pressure internally to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/31/emergency-measures-fail-to-halt-chinas-stock-market-nosedive\">address the slowdown</a> with a dramatic policy shift.</p> <h2>Why focus on the currency\u2019s value?</h2> <p>The dollar has appreciated over the past year in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/29/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged-september-hike\">anticipation of the US raising interest rates</a> for the first time since the financial crisis. Since the yuan loosely tracks the dollar, it has been dragged higher \u2013 keeping its differential with the greenback roughly the same, but at the expense of making the country\u2019s goods dearer compared to regional rivals, especially South Korea and Japan. That has hit Chinese exports badly. Now the US Federal Reserve is close to its first rate rise in seven years, potentially pushing the dollar to new highs, the situation is set to worsen from China\u2019s point of view.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/11/china-devalues-yuan-by-2-to-boost-flagging-economy\">China devalues yuan by 2% to boost flagging economy</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What has the central bank done exactly?</h2> <p>On Monday, the People\u2019s Bank of China set its daily \u201creference rate\u201d for the yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan \u2013 in effect 1.86% lower. That triggered a further fall in the currency markets. As the authorities pick the mid-point from the previous day as the basis for the next day\u2019s reference rate, they were forced to devalue again or risk ignoring market forces. Choosing the former, it set the rate at 6.3306, fractionally weaker than Monday\u2019s market close. The spot rate has responded by falling another 1.6% on Tuesday, likely forcing a further devaluation.</p> <p>The currency moves are the biggest one-day falls in 20 years, and in particular, since China reformed its currency system in 2005. Back then, it unpegged the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), from a strict tie with the dollar in favour of a looser tracking policy.</p> <p>The successive devaluations follow a further shift in policy that means the bank will now expand the criteria used to calculate the daily fix \u2013 the rate at which it determines the currency\u2019s value each morning and from which it is in theory allowed to move 2 percentage points in either direction, although in practice the moves are much smaller.</p> <h2><strong>How can it help the Chinese economy?</strong></h2> <p>Chinese businesses compete with regional rivals to supply the world with everything from raw steel to fridges, and a cheaper yuan will make Chinese exports less expensive, potentially boosting the overseas sales that have been among the main drivers of growth during the nation\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/01/fears-for-chinese-economy-as-shares-fall\">remarkable rise over the past three decades</a>. However, controls on the currency have given Chinese businesses a high degree of predictability when they plan investments in industries heavily dependent on exports.<br></p> <h2>How can this move help the yuan become a reserve currency?</h2> <p>China is seeking to build on its 2005 reforms in an effort to have the yuan included in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) basket of special drawing rights (SDR) reserve currencies. Its remaining controls have been a stumbling block in gaining admittance to the select group of the US dollar, the euro, the pound and the yen. The bank\u2019s move to include more information when setting its daily fix can be seen as a relaxation of controls, moving the currency a step closer to satisfying the IMF\u2019s entry requirements. The organisation said this month that significant work still needed to be done for the yuan to be considered before its next review in November.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Will it do the trick?</h2> <p>Liu Dongmin, director of the international finance research office at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: \u201cA reasonable adjustment of the RMB\u2019s value is good for China\u2019s exports and also good for the RMB to be admitted to the SDR. But most importantly, this marks key progress for RMB exchange rate reform since 2005 and a major step for RMB marketisation.\u201d Despite this, Beijing\u2019s long-promised goal of free currency convertibility probably remains distant.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/11/australian-dollar-falls-to-735-us-cents-as-chinas-central-bank-devalues-yuan\">Australian dollar falls to 73.5 US cents as China's central bank devalues yuan</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How will the US react?</h2> <p>The devaluation could prompt an angry reaction from the US, which has consistently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/06/china-yuan-us-economy-trade-deficit\">argued that the yuan is undervalued</a>, damaging US exports. It could also force other Asian countries to devalue, making exports to the US cheaper and increasing Washington\u2019s trade deficit further.<br></p> <h2>Will China export more than just cheaper goods and services?</h2> <p>Central banks in the US and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/06/super-thursday-interest-rates-bank-of-england\">UK are toying with raising interest rates</a> to combat the prospect of higher inflation. But cheaper Chinese goods will reduce inflationary pressures and keep interest rates lower for longer. Less welcome will be the export of unemployment, as Beijing effectively prices western workers out of a job to protect its own economy.<br></p> <h2>Why does the Chinese currency have two names?</h2> <p>It is similar to referring to the pound and sterling. Renminbi is the official name of the currency and means the people\u2019s currency. Yuan, like the pound, is the name of a unit of the currency.<br></p>",

Operating profit for the six months to the end of June increased 17% to \u00a31.9bn, easily beating a consensus of \u00a31.74bn. Prudential increased the interim dividend by 10% to 12.31p.

Wells said Prudential\u2019s business in China was less dependent on the wider economic climate than some people realised and that with a large population, a growing economy and low market penetration by insurance companies, \u201cwe remain fairly confident\u201d in the long run.

    "webTitle": "China devalues yuan by 2% to boost flagging economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China has sent shockwaves through global markets by moving to prevent a further drop in exports with the biggest one-off devaluation of its currency in 20 years. Stock markets fell and commodity prices tumbled as the cut in the yuan\u2019s value sparked concerns that Beijing will suffer a longer period of lacklustre growth before it can revive its flagging economy. The FTSE fell 1% while the Dow Jones plummeted 250 points [1700 BST] and the price of Brent crude dropped to almost $48.5 a barrel, its lowest point this year. After recent Chinese data showed falling exports and a stalling manufacturing sector, the country\u2019s central bank said on Tuesday it was allowing the yuan to weaken by nearly 2%. The hope is it will make exports more competitive and push down borrowing costs. The People\u2019s Bank of China said the centre of the yuan\u2019s trading band was reset 1.9% lower at 6.2298 per US dollar, its weakest point against the US dollar for almost three years. In a loosening of central controls, each day\u2019s midpoint will now be based on the previous day\u2019s closing price, rather than being controlled centrally. The impact of the decision was felt across regional markets as investors fretted about a prolonged fall in demand from the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Carmakers and luxury goods stocks were among the worst performers in European markets. China is an important export market for European luxury goods companies and carmakers, and shares in those two sectors were among the hardest hit by the yuan devaluation. Miners were also affected. Carmaker BMW fell 2.7% in early trading while luxury goods group Swatch and LVMH both weakened by more than 3%. Burberry, the British luxury group, was one of biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 35p at \u00a315.72, while mining group Glencore posted the largest decline, falling by more than 7% to \u00a31.91 The US dollar gained against a basket of currencies, moving up 0.2% but the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the Chinese currency, slid more than 1% to as low as US$0.73. Share prices across the region were down, with the Nikkei index in Tokyo falling 0.36% and the ASX200 in Sydney down more than 0.5%. The Hang Seng, however, was up 0.72% in Hong Kong. The move is a sign that the country\u2019s leaders are increasingly concerned about the economy, which has lost competitiveness as the yuan has climbed in relation to other currencies such as the yen and the euro as it tracked the US dollar higher. A series of interest rate cuts have failed to kickstart the economy, which has also been hit by turbulence on the country\u2019s stock markets after more than a year of unprecedented rises. But it could trigger copycat devaluations by central banks as they attempt to maintain their own competitiveness against China. Australia, Korea and India are among the leading Asia Pacific economies where central banks have cut interest rates to force local currencies down and boost exports hit by flagging world demand. \u201cThe yuan had become relatively expensive as other Asian currencies weakened against the dollar. With fears of an economic slowdown mounting, devaluing the yuan was the only thing China had not tried after implementing monetary, fiscal and equity-boosting policies,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, senior strategist at Monex in Tokyo. It may also draw criticism from the US which has in the past accused China of manipulating its currency lower. The issue is likely to be discussed when Chinese president Xi Jinping visits the US for talks with President Barack Obama in September. Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Lombard Street Research, said the devaluation was a necessary re-balancing of global currencies that would encourage Chinese companies and households to spend their savings. She said it was necessary for the US to accept the move and Japan to end its reliance on competitive devaluations to maintain its own exports. Another dimension is Beijing\u2019s attempts to win greater status for the yuan. It has been lobbying the International Monetary Fund to include the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies known as special drawing rights (SDR), which are used by the Washington based fund to lend to sovereign borrowers. The current members of the group are the US dollar, yen, euro and British pound. The devaluation may be an attempt to make trading more open and market-based, observers said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a reaction to the weak trade data over the weekend, I think it\u2019s because of the SDR,\u201d said Zhou Hao of Commerzbank in Singapore. \u201cThey need to have a market-based mechanism and they need volatility.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is to launch a new milk brand that costs 10p extra, with the premium paid directly to British dairy farmers, in an attempt to end a dispute over the falling price of milk. The supermarket chain will sell four-pint bottles of \u201cMorrisons Milk for Farmers\u201d alongside its existing own-brand milk, which will remain at the same price and therefore 10p cheaper. The announcement follows talks between Morrisons and disgruntled farmers, who have blockaded the company\u2019s distribution centres and overseen the mass purchase of milk from supermarket shelves. The new milk brand will offer shoppers the option of paying more to support dairy farmers, or choosing cheaper alternatives. Martyn Jones, corporate services director at Morrisons, said: \u201cWe will stock this product in all our stores, offering our customers the choice to support dairy farmers directly.\u201d It remains to be seen whether farmers and the leading agriculture unions will welcome the move. Farmers For Action, which has organised the protests, had called for a halt to the campaign until the end of talks with Morrisons. The National Farmers Union and other leading unions have warned that the farming industry is in a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and that many farms are on the brink of financial ruin because the price of milk has fallen by 25% over the last year. Protesters have targeted Morrisons and Asda because they have not followed Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s in paying farmers a higher price based on production costs. Figures from AHDB Dairy, the trade body, show that the average UK farmgate price for milk has fallen to 23.66p per litre. Industry experts claim it costs farmers 30p per litre to produce milk. The farming unions held an emergency summit on Monday to discuss the crisis. Following the talks, they called on the government to introduce long-term contracts between farmers, distributors and supermarkets and to force retailers to label clearly whether their products are British or imported. The presidents of the NFU, NFU Scotland, NFU Cymru, Ulster Farmers Union and four other unions, warned of \u201cdire consequences for the farming industry and rural economy\u201d if the way in which food is sold does not change in the near future. In a direct message to retailers, they added: \u201cStop devaluing fresh British food like milk purely to get customers through the door.\u201d Farmers have blamed the fall in prices on a supermarket price war but retailers claim the drop reflects the decline in commodity prices and an oversupply of milk, partly caused by Russia\u2019s block on western imports. Jones said that the price Morrisons pays for milk \u201creflects the highly competitive retail market\u201d. He added: \u201cWe recognise that the current market for liquid milk is impacting on hardworking dairy farmers and their families. \u201cWe want to reassure the industry that the retail price we charge for Morrisons milk reflects the highly competitive retail market. It is not linked to the price we pay our milk suppliers.\u201d The new Morrisons milk brand will be launch in conjunction with Arla, the UK\u2019s largest milk supplier, which works with 3,000 dairy farms. Ash Amirahmadi, head of milk at Arla, warned that some farmers were being paid as little as 12p or 13p per litre and that the present situation was unsustainable. He added: \u201cOur farmers are incredibly concerned at the moment. There is a reason why farmers are going out protesting; they are not bad people.\u201d Amirahmadi urged retailers to make themselves \u201cpart of the solution\u201d by signing up to the new conditions and improving the labelling of British products. \u201cSome retailers are not far off following this already but it is not transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make it more transparent for our farmers.\u201d",

Just Retirement and Partnership Assurance, both involved in the annuities market, lost half their market capitalisation last year when the chancellor changed the rules to give retirees greater flexibility over pensions. The new rules, which came into force in the spring, give people more autonomy over their retirement savings. Steve Groves, chief executive of Partnership, is leaving as part of the deal because the top job is going to Just Retirement\u2019s Rodney Cook. Just Retirement shareholders will own 60% of the combined company. Groves is expected to sell his \u00a320m-plus shareholding. The deal was brokered by the groups\u2019 private equity backers, Permira and Cinven. Both backers have had a disappointing experience since floating the groups in the IPO boom of 2013. Partnership, for example, issued new shares at 385p. On Tuesday, they jumped 8% to168p. Shares in Just Retirement rose 1.6% to 202p. The insurers, which were presenting to analysts at Deutsche on Tuesday, say they will raise \u00a3150m from the issue of new shares, to give the combined company a market capitalisation of \u00a31.6bn. Advisers say there are savings of about \u00a340m from duplication. The private equity shareholders are tied in for 90 days.",

Just Retirement shareholders will own 60% of the combined company. Groves is expected to sell his \u00a320m-plus shareholding.</p> <p>The deal was brokered by the groups\u2019 private equity backers, Permira and Cinven. Both backers have had a disappointing experience since floating the groups in the IPO boom of 2013. Partnership, for example, issued new shares at 385p. On Tuesday, they jumped 8% to168p. Shares in Just Retirement rose 1.6% to 202p.</p> <p>The insurers, which were presenting to analysts at Deutsche on Tuesday, say they will raise \u00a3150m from the issue of new shares, to give the combined company a market capitalisation of \u00a31.6bn. Advisers say there are savings of about \u00a340m from duplication. The private equity shareholders are tied in for 90 days.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank has been spared a \u00a3120m fine by City regulators even though they found the bank had misled investors and pursued growth at the expense of its financial stability in the run-up to its near-collapse two years ago. Even as the bank escaped a fine to preserve its financial health, the regulators said they were still continuing to investigate individuals associated with the bank, which until two years ago was fully owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes. The findings come after an 18-month investigation by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, triggered by the bank\u2019s announcement of a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall two years ago when it was trying to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. The bank had to be rescued by hedge funds, leaving the Co-op Group with a 20% stake and prompting a wave of recrimination about its management and the way it was regulated, accusations of political interference and scrutiny of the former chairman Paul Flowers who later pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine. Dennis Holt, the new chairman of Co-op Bank, apologised and stressed there would be no impact on customers, many of whom picked the bank because of its proclaimed ethical stance. Holt said the bank was committed to working on its five-year turnaround plan. \u201cWe have a five-year plan that ends up with a sustainable, independent bank \u2026 The good news is we don\u2019t have to do a transaction to be a viable bank. \u201cHaving said that I believe that there will be consolidation in the UK banking sector. You will only get truly efficient challenger banks if they have reasonable scale. We [will] not preclude looking at those sort of opportunities as we go forward.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, would have levied a \u00a3120m fine \u2013 a record sum, easily surpassing its only other fine levied on Royal Bank of Scotland for \u00a314m. The FCA did not disclose what level of financial penalty it would have imposed but publicly censured the bank. \u201cCo-op Bank\u2019s failings stand out both for the duration and seriousness of the risk management and control deficiencies uncovered. This was compounded by a lack of openness with their regulator,\u201d said Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who runs the PRA. Covering the period from July 2009 \u2013 around the time of the Co-op Bank\u2019s deal with Britannia building society \u2013 to December 2013, the bank was found to have committed three rule breaches: The Bank of England found serious and wide-ranging failures in the bank\u2019s systems and controls, which meant the board of the bank was not being kept informed of decisions. The Bank and the FCA both found the Co-op Bank had not been \u201copen and cooperative\u201d by failing to inform them of changes to senior management between April 2012 to May 2013. The management changes are not identified but Flowers and chief executive Barry Tootell left around this period. The FCA found the bank made \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d claims by saying it had enough capital in 2012 \u2013 a year in which it reported a \u00a3674m loss \u2013 when it did not. The loss was caused by a \u00a3474m hit for bad loans. Georgina Philippou, the FCA\u2019s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said: \u201cFirms have a very basic but extremely important responsibility to be transparent with their investors and with us, as their regulator, and Co-op Bank fell short of this. As a result, investors were left unaware of Co-op Bank\u2019s true capital position and we were left in the dark about intended changes to senior personnel at the bank.\u201d No individuals are named but the bank was found to have a culture which prioritised short-term gain. The Bank of England found the bank was too optimistic about the prospects for bad debts in the Britannia corporate loan book. It cites the bank\u2019s determination to hit profit targets for its parent, the Co-op Group, for a delay in taking provisions for bad debts in 2012. The Bank of England also highlighted the events surrounding the Britannia deal. At one point it was found that Britannia\u2019s capital position was deteriorating. That came close to triggering a \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d clause which would allow the Co-op or Britannia to withdraw from the deal \u2013 but the board was not informed. A report commissioned last year by the Co-op Group from Sir Christopher Kelly, a former top civil servant, concluded the Britannia deal should probably never have taken place. It is not the end of the investigations. The FCA said: \u201cInvestigations into senior individuals at Co-op Bank during the relevant period are ongoing.\u201d The accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, is still investigating the accounts for the year ended 2012 which were audited by KPMG. In November 2013, the government pledged to hold an independent inquiry into events at the bank, although an individual has not yet been named to conduct the review. Holt said the Co-op Bank had made progress in addressing the shortcomings identified by Kelly. Stressing that the censure related to past events, Holt said: \u201cOn behalf of the bank, I would like again to apologise to customers for these past failings and reassure them that the bank is a significantly strong organisation today under the leadership of the current senior management team.\u201d",
