      "bodyText": "As many as 4,000 British pubs will deservedly go out of business over the next year because they are \"stuck in the 1980s\" and complacently offering \"indifferent\" food, drink and service, a national industry guide has predicted. The editors of the Good Pub Guide 2014, published today, forecast that between 2,500 and 4,000 of the 49,500 public houses in the UK will be forced to shut and even says it is \"high time that they closed their doors\" to make way for more energetic and dynamic new licensees. The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) has reported that 26 pubs are closing a week (a total of 1,300 a year) but the Good Pub Guide editors, Alisdair Aird and Fiona Stapley, expect the figure to escalate over the next 12 months due to the increase in disposals by pub companies and predictions from insolvency experts. Camra described the findings from a guide that claims to support the industry as bizarre. Although the scale of closures will mean bad news for staff and regulars, the joint editors said in the introduction to this year's guide that the pubs forced to close will be \"bad pubs at the bottom of the pecking order\", which are \"happy with indifferent food, drink, service and surroundings\". Stapley said: \"The worst quality a pub can have is a landlord that doesn't care much about the customers. Licensees like that give the pub trade a bad name. Pubs closing keeps the trade healthy and robust. They have got to diversify if they want to succeed \u2013 they just can't open for lunch and open again in the evenings any more.\" However, the guide also predicts that more than 1,000 new pubs will open next year, often in former premises that have been shuttered for years. The once thriving pub industry has been brought to its knees due to cheap beer and lager on sale in supermarkets, leading to mass closures. As a measure to relieve some pressure, it was announced in the March budget that the price of a pint would be cut by a penny, in a surprise reversal of the chancellor's commitments to annually increase beer duty by two percentage points above inflation until 2015. The Pub of The Year was named as the Olive Branch in Clipsham, Rutland, which was hailed as \"a first class all-rounder\" with \"sublime food\". Other awards including best landlord (Tim Gray, of the Yew Tree, in Lower Wield, Hampshire), brewery (Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner), new pub (Bulls Head, Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire), dining pub (Stagg, Titley, Herefordshire) and whisky pub (Bon Accord, Glasgow). More than 4,700 pubs are featured in the guide and those with full entries are required to pay a fee, which helps to cover research and production costs. The guide singles out what it calls the \"good pubs\" \u2013 the 4,800 or so excellent establishments \u2013 although between the two extremes are the remaining 40,000 or so \"average pubs\" which range from \"straightforward locals to the big chains of standard-pattern eateries and drinkeries with their reliably consistent offerings: you always get what you expect, no less \u2013 but no more\". The editors also call for pubs to name their chefs on menus and websites and help close the \"absurd status gap\" between the growing horde of TV superstar chefs and talented pub chefs. But the editors' apparent support of large-scale closure attracted fury from Camra, which publishes its own guide in September, in which it will highlight some 100 pubs that have been saved by their communities using the new Localism Act. A spokesman said: \"How bizarre that a book called the Good Pub Guide should welcome the closure of as many as 4,000 pubs. Pubs need to be saved \u2013 not thrown on the scrapheap. I would say there is a degree of cruelty in the editors' call for pubs to be closed as people will lose their jobs and, in the case of publicans who live on the premises, their home as well. \"Unlike the Good Pub Guide, Camra's Good Beer Guide does not charge for entries and pubs are selected on their merit alone. These pubs \"at the bottom of the pecking order\" may suit the needs of their regulars and be the focus and hub of their communities and should not be left to the vagaries of the market.\" Bitter sweet Such is the popularity of the Bull's Head in Mottram St Andrew, word has it that Manchester United's Brazilian midfielder, Anderson, had to leave hungry a fortnight ago. \"It was unfortunate, but that's the way it is,\" said the pub's manager, Andrew Coverley. \"There's no VIP policy, and I think even the VIPs who come here respect that. We just hope Anderson tries us again some time.\" He might well want to. The pub, in the heart of Cheshire's stockbroker belt, has been named best new pub of the year by The Good Pub Guide. Eight months ago the pub was an Italian restaurant serving posh pizza and pasta to the glitterati of Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Prestbury. But the former coaching inn returned to its past courtesy of a \u00a31.5m refit by the pub company Brunning and Price. Out went an interior dominated by chrome, plastic and orange upholstery; in came oak floors, an eclectic mix of old furniture, and a liberal covering of prints and paintings in every room and corridor. Oh, and a head chef called Jamie Oliver. Same spelling, same passion for inventive food, but a little younger than Essex's best-known culinary export. The Cheshire Jamie Oliver was off-site on Wednesday, but reportedly as proud as everyone else with the judges' early accolade. His menu \u2013 littered with \"well-sourced classics\" and tweaked with the likes of tandoor roasts, balsamic jellies and carpaccios \u2013 will change every month. \"Just to be in The Good Pub Guide is reward enough for everyone's hard work,\" said Coverley. \"But to win a national award after only a few months is the icing on the cake. It's fabulous.\" He believes the Bull's Head is one of a new breed of pub restaurants that flies in the face of those who see the whole industry in meltdown. \"For us it's all about consistency. There's a lot of competition and you have to be genuinely welcoming and serve good fresh food day in, day out.\" Between courses there's always the chance for celebrity watching. Anderson may have been unlucky, but others to have found a table include footballers Sergio Ag\u00fcero, David Silva, Robbie Savage and Michael Carrick, and cricketer Andrew Flintoff.",

The US crude price, for West Texas intermediate oil, hit a two-year high, rising above $112 for the first time since May 2011.</p> <p>\"We believe that in the coming days Brent could gain another $5-$10, surging to $120-$125, either in anticipation of the attack or in reaction to the headlines that an attack had started,\" Wittner said in an investment note to clients.</p> <p>\"If the regional spillover results in a significant supply disruption in Iraq or elsewhere, Brent could spike briefly to $150,\" he added.</p> <p>Syria is not an important oil producer or transit country but the wider area including Saudi Arabia produces 35% of the world's supplies. If Iraq or Iran were affected by any fallout from a military strike on Syria, the global oil market would rely on extra output from Saudi Arabia, the only member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with significant spare oil production capacity.</p> <p>\"The Saudis could handle most likely scenarios, but the markets will look at the shrinking spare capacity that remains after any disruption is made up, and that would be bullish [for higher oil prices],\" said Wittner.</p> <p>The oil price spike was a boost to Shell, whose share price rose almost 4% to \u00a322.25, and BP, whose shares rose by more than 1% at 452p.</p> <p>The wider FTSE 100 index of leading companies fell by nearly 0.5% early on , adding to an already 3% slump since the middle of the month on the back of fears about Syria, allied with concerns that the US would finally halt a long-running government economic stimulus package.</p> <p>Stock markets in continental Europe were also down, as was the Nikkei index in Japan, which fell by more than 2% to 13,264 points, with companies such as Toyota and Sony down up to 3%. The Dubai Financial Market index closed at 2,549.61 points, with Emaar Properties leading the rout. Shares in the developer that built Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the largest freestanding structure in the world, fell almost 8.5%.</p> <p>Most mining companies based in London, such as Glencore Xstrata, were hit by the political uncertainty, but the price of gold \u2013 seen as a haven \u2013 continued to rise as did the US currency. The dollar strengthened 0.5% against the Japanese yen and 0.3% versus the euro.</p> <p>Ishaq Siddiqi, London-based market strategist at ETX Capital, explained the dangers to the wider economy of higher crude values on the back of foreign aircraft strikes on Syria. \"Once filtered through to the real global economy, the increase in oil prices will put a halt to the pace of economic momentum we are currently experiencing in major parts of the world.</p> <p>\"It's plausible that Brent oil prices could be over $120 a barrel in the coming days and, if oil prices spike even higher, it wouldn't be out of the question for the US Federal Reserve to hold off on tapering stimulus measures this year.\"</p> <p>Threats of a $150 oil price take the markets back to July 2008 when Brent briefly traded at US$147.50, the highest intraday price on record. This was the height of the economic boom, which was followed by the autumn collapse of Lehman Brothers and then a full-scale banking crisis.</p> <p>Crude then crashed to $40 but has largely been priced at over $100 since the middle of 2010, despite a relatively slow recovery in the world economy. Prices have been pushed upwards due to a mixture of stronger demand and supply problems. Oil supply from Opec producer Libya has already been reduced to a trickle after an armed group shut down a pipeline linking its largest western oilfields to the ports.</p>",

The Petrol Retailers Association also warned motorists that it was only a matter of time before the price of petrol at the pump would have to rise and the outlook was \"grim\". The FTSE 100 index fell further in London as investors worried about the potential for a wider conflict involving Iran and even Russia wading in on the side of the embattled government of Assad.

The US crude price, for West Texas intermediate oil, hit a two-year high, rising above $112 for the first time since May 2011. \"We believe that in the coming days Brent could gain another $5-$10, surging to $120-$125, either in anticipation of the attack or in reaction to the headlines that an attack had started,\" Wittner said in an investment note to clients. \"If the regional spillover results in a significant supply disruption in Iraq or elsewhere, Brent could spike briefly to $150,\" he added. Syria is not an important oil producer or transit country but the wider area including Saudi Arabia produces 35% of the world's supplies. If Iraq or Iran were affected by any fallout from a military strike on Syria, the global oil market would rely on extra output from Saudi Arabia, the only member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with significant spare oil production capacity. \"The Saudis could handle most likely scenarios, but the markets will look at the shrinking spare capacity that remains after any disruption is made up, and that would be bullish [for higher oil prices],\" said Wittner. The oil price spike was a boost to Shell, whose share price rose almost 4% to \u00a322.25, and BP, whose shares rose by more than 1% at 452p. The wider FTSE 100 index of leading companies fell by nearly 0.5% early on , adding to an already 3% slump since the middle of the month on the back of fears about Syria, allied with concerns that the US would finally halt a long-running government economic stimulus package. Stock markets in continental Europe were also down, as was the Nikkei index in Japan, which fell by more than 2% to 13,264 points, with companies such as Toyota and Sony down up to 3%. The Dubai Financial Market index closed at 2,549.61 points, with Emaar Properties leading the rout. Shares in the developer that built Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the largest freestanding structure in the world, fell almost 8.5%. Most mining companies based in London, such as Glencore Xstrata, were hit by the political uncertainty, but the price of gold \u2013 seen as a haven \u2013 continued to rise as did the US currency. The dollar strengthened 0.5% against the Japanese yen and 0.3% versus the euro. Ishaq Siddiqi, London-based market strategist at ETX Capital, explained the dangers to the wider economy of higher crude values on the back of foreign aircraft strikes on Syria. \"Once filtered through to the real global economy, the increase in oil prices will put a halt to the pace of economic momentum we are currently experiencing in major parts of the world. \"It's plausible that Brent oil prices could be over $120 a barrel in the coming days and, if oil prices spike even higher, it wouldn't be out of the question for the US Federal Reserve to hold off on tapering stimulus measures this year.\" Threats of a $150 oil price take the markets back to July 2008 when Brent briefly traded at US$147.50, the highest intraday price on record. This was the height of the economic boom, which was followed by the autumn collapse of Lehman Brothers and then a full-scale banking crisis. Crude then crashed to $40 but has largely been priced at over $100 since the middle of 2010, despite a relatively slow recovery in the world economy. Prices have been pushed upwards due to a mixture of stronger demand and supply problems. Oil supply from Opec producer Libya has already been reduced to a trickle after an armed group shut down a pipeline linking its largest western oilfields to the ports.",

      "bodyText": "The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, has called in the City of London police to investigate alleged fraud by Serco staff working on a \u00a3285m contract to transport prisoners to and from courts across London and East Anglia. Grayling said it had \"become very clear there has been a culture within parts of Serco that has been totally unacceptable\". Last month, Grayling asked the Serious Fraud Office to investigate potential overcharging by tens of millions of pounds by the private security company G4S on a \u00a3700m contract for the electronic tagging of offenders. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said detailed audit work initiated as a result of the investigation into the tagging contract in July had shown that some Serco staff were recording prisoners as having been ready for court when in fact they were not. This data is a key performance measure for the contract that could determine whether or not it is terminated. It is thought the \"potentially fraudulent behaviour\" has been going on since last summer, when persistent delays in transporting prisoners between jails and courts led to an official improvement notice being issued. It is alleged that instead of ending the delays, Serco staff simply fiddled the paperwork, for example by recording the time that the van arrived at court as if that meant prisoners were ready to appear in the dock. The ministry said in a statement: \"MoJ has informed Serco in the light of the new evidence, it is putting the contract under administrative supervision with immediate effect. Serco have agreed to repay all past profits made on the prisoner escorting and custodial services contract and to forgo any future profits.\" The decision to call in the City of London police is particularly embarrassing for Grayling as two of his department's major private sector suppliers are now being investigated for fraud at a time when he is trying to accelerate the pace of his probation and prison outsourcing programme. Serco is also involved in the allegations involving overcharging on the bigger tagging contract, but unlike G4S it agreed to co-operate with an outside forensic audit to establish whether there had been any dishonest behaviour on its part. Ministry sources said Serco had asserted that no member of the company's board had any knowledge of the alleged fraud on the prisoner transport contract. \"If any evidence of corporate as opposed to individual wrongdoing emerges, MoJ will terminate this contract,\" it said. The company has been put on three-month notice that it will have to overhaul its management, strengthen its internal audit procedures and open up its accounts to much more intense government scrutiny. After three months a specially convened committee of government non-executive directors will assess whether the necessary changes have been put in place. \"Unless government is satisfied the changes made by the company are sufficient to guarantee the future integrity of government contracts, Serco will face exclusion from all new and future work with the government,\" the MoJ said. The threat is serious for Serco which is one the government's most important private sector suppliers managing services that range from running prisons and local education authorities to the atomic weapons establishment. Grayling said: \"We have not seen evidence of systemic malpractice up to board level, but we have been clear with the company: unless it undertakes a rapid process of major change, and becomes completely open with government about the work it is doing for us, then it will not win public contracts in future. The taxpayer must know that their money is being properly used.\" Chris Hyman, chief executive of Serco, said: \"The justice secretary is right to expect the highest standards of performance from Serco.

      "bodyText": "Even by Michael O'Leary's standards, it was an impressive rant. By ruling that Ryanair should sell down its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, the UK Competition Commission had produced a \"bizarre and manifestly wrong\" report and was engaged in a \"corrupt and politically biased charade\". Calm down, old fruit, the commission's findings tally with common sense.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. We'll be back tomorrow morning - until then, thanks and goodnight. GW Robert Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, argues that Mark Carney will struggle to keep UK bond yields down because of the impact of America's monetary policy: He says that US Treasury yields will be driven higher as the US Federal Reserve tapers, or slows, its asset purchases -- and UK market rates are likely to follow suit. The Bank of England will find it hard to control longer-term [market] interest rates because they tend to move in line with U.S. Treasurys. I think he can control the rates up to about two years, but it gets more tricky after that. It will be hard to do it by words and not actual action. More here on Marketwatch: Mark Carney can\u2019t fight the Fed After those early losses, European stock markets clawed back some ground this afternoon. The recovery appears to be due to the latest twists over Syria. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, has called on Washington and London to hold off from military action while weapons inspectors continue their work, as Andrew Sparrow explains here: US and UK under pressure to delay Syria intervention Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 1o points at 6430, -0.1% \u2022 German DAX: down 84 points at 8157, - 1.03% \u2022 French CAC: down 8 points at 3960, -0.2% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 163 points at 16743, +1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX, up 4 points at 8398, +0.05% In London, oil producers were among the biggest risers, following recent increases in the cost of crude and the prospect of further rises. BG Group closed 4.7% higher, Royal Dutch Shell rose 2% and BP gained 1.2%. Airline group IAG, which operates British Airways and Iberia, fell 4.4%, for the same reason. Here's Nick Fletcher's closing market report: Pennon pumped up by broker upgrade, as FTSE recovers from worst levels despite Syria fears Nida Ali, economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, suggests Mark Carney chose Nottingham for his first speech in a symbolic attempt to speak directly to the public. Carney is trying to bypass financial markets altogether and choosing to communicate directly with businesses and households about the future path of interest rates in the hope that this will encourage them to spend and invest. Indeed the fact that his first non-MPC speech was addressed to businesses, rather than financial markets, lends credence to this view. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, has given Mark Carney a broad thumbs-up. He's particularly pleased that UK banks are being allowed to hold less cash on their balance sheets, as the governor announced in today's speech. Cridland said: Business leaders will be encouraged by the strength of Governor Mark Carney's message explaining in more detail how Forward Guidance will benefit the real economy. This policy should give impetus to the recovery and support investment and spending. The Governor clearly recognises the important role of a healthy banking sector in supporting the economic recovery. The easing of liquidity requirements for banks when they have met their capital tests should help spur more lending. Carney argued that the move will get more money flowing to firms. But Peter Spence of City AM flags up that the move could boost bank earning too: Carney's liquidity rule loosening could boost bank earnings by up to 10 per cent. James Knightley of ING still isn't convinced that interest rates will stay at their current record lows for three years, despite Carney's efforts in Nottingham. The problem with forecasting when interest rates will rise based on this 7% unemployment threshold is that there are so many assumptions to make, but we are of the view that it is more likely to fall below 7% closer to early 2015 than late 2016. The BoE is assuming a big increase in productivity and that lots of workers will be prepared to work longer hours (part timers want to work full time) and this will mean that employers won\u2019t need to hire lots of new workers. That may well happen, but weak productivity hasn\u2019t prevented 900,000 jobs being created in the past three years. The BoE also assume a sizeable increase in the participation rate as discouraged workers return to the workforce and more workers aged 65+ continue working. This means that more new jobs will be required to push down the unemployment rate than would otherwise be the case. Clearly invigorated by his trip to Nottingham, economics editor Larry Elliott writes: As if to show what a hip dude he is, Mark Carney chose the singer songwriter Jake Bugg to give some local flavour when he addressed business bigwigs in Nottingham in his first set-piece speech as governor of the Bank of England. Not Brian Clough. Not DH Lawrence, although one of the Eastwood-born author's aphorisms did spring to mind as Threadneedle Street's new boss spoke: never trust the author, trust the tale. And as Larry explains, that tale has not been swallowed by the City -- which believes the UK economy is in stronger shape and a rate rise will be needed before 2016. More here: Mark Carney tries to persuade the City on forward guidance: part two And that was the end of the press conference. Reaction to follow.... And finally...during his speech (online here), Mark Carney defied convention by inserting a popular culture reference, rather than one of Mervyn King's sporting comparisons. Productivity growth has been anaemic and \u2013 remarkably \u2013 the UK is no more productive than it was back in 2005 \u2013 before Jake Bugg got his first guitar. Kathryn Hopkins of The Times calls him up on it, asking \"Is Jake Bugg is the sort of music you listen to at home?\" Carney, a man blessed with daughters, jokes that he hopes he hasn't \"jinxed\" the 19-year old singer-songwriter, who hails from Nottingham. The governor then reveals that he saw Bugg play an oustanding set at Hyde Park recently, adding that he was \"very good\". Kathryn Hopkins of The Times asks Carney about firms who are forced to turn to alternative sources of funding such as crowd sourcing, because their banks aren't supporting them. Are they safe? Carney declines to comment directly on crowd-sourced funding models, before outlining several ways that the environment has improved \u2013 including the funding for lending scheme and George Osborne's support for mortgages. There's no 'mission accomplished' banner behind us on banking reform, he adds. Larry Elliott, the Guardian's economics editor, challenges Carney again over the market reaction to forward guidance. Surely he's concerned that the policy hasn't dampened rate rise expectations? Larry also points out that the only real new news today is the decision to relax liquidity requirements for banks (see 2.17pm)., Surely that could bring a rate rise nearer, if it really does succeed in getting more money into the real economy? Carney repeats some of the key lines from his speech, saying that the Bank is \"very consciously pursuing a mixed strategy\" of stimulus measures, and trying to provide as much certainty as possible as the UK economy returns to strength. Asked about the effectiveness of forward guidance, Carney insists the policy makes sense (as a tool in the monetary toolkit): It's an important change in policy... It reaches out to those who put capital to work, firms and businesses.... How much faith can we have in the Bank of England's forecasts that the UK unemployment rate probably won't fall to 7% until 2016, Carney is asked. The governor replies that this is the first time the UK central bank has drawn up an explicit official forecast for the unemployment market. We've given you all the Bank's forecasts on unemployment. It's only one data point, he says. How will the Bank assess how much spare capacity remains in the UK economy, asks Claire Jones of the Financial Times? Carney replies that issues such as average hours worked, and the participation rate in the UK labour market, will be considered. Ed Conway of Sky News gets the third question. He follows up on the issue of why the City is pricing in an interest rate rise before 2016 despite Carney's insistance that it will take three years for the UK jobless rate to drop to 7%. Carney replies that focusing on the market reaction is 'missing the point' of forward guidance. The Bank governor repeats that the 7% target is a threshold -- not a trigger. There's a lots of spare capacity in the UK economy, he insists, the question is how much: Until we hit the 7% threshold, the Monetary Policy Committee don't need to take that decision about when to raise bank rates, Carney adds. Stephanie Flanders of the BBC goes next: She points out that the City now expects an interest rate rise rather earlier than they did three weeks ago today, when the Bank first pinned interest rate policy to unemployment. Is it a worry that the City don't believe the guidance? Carney argues that he's not keen to pin too much importance to relatively recent market moves. The guidance is not around a date, it's around an outcome. QUESTION TIME: Rebecca Barry of Channel 5 gets the first question, and very nearly scatters Carney's stumps by saying she spoke to a business leader today whose bank had told him he would rather see his business fail than cut his loan repayments. Carney replies that the 'direction of travel' of UK banks was towards a stronger lending environment. There's more work to do, though, he admids. Mark Carney's press conference is underway - it's being livestreamed here. Next up from Nottingham, the press conference.... Mark Carney does not appear to have convinced his critics in the City, as Larry Elliott flagged up. There are still plenty of doubters who don't believe the Bank of England will leave interest rates at record lows until 2016. The pound has risen by around half a cent against the dollar since the speech began, erasing most of its losses to $1.551. And UK sovereign debt have fallen in value slightly, pushing up the yield on 10-year gilts to 2.797%, from 2.78% last night (a small move, but Carney may be disappointed that it's not the other way). From Nottingham, our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: That question from Michael Saunders really put Carney on the spot. Carney is trying to talk market rates down but reaction to his speech shows City is sceptical. Decision to loosen bank liquidity has made City hawks more convinced that economy will recover faster than BoE expects, thus forcing earlier tightening. More titters in Nottingham - as Michael Saunders of Citigroup get his mitts on the microphone. Mark Carney is surprised to see a senior City economist in the wilds of the UK Midlands, joking that it's probably his first visit to Nottingham. He also declines to answer Saunders' question about monetary policy. Asked about the output gap in the UK, Carney replies that he doesn't see evidence of a \"Soviet-style\" collapse in the British economy since the recession began. Instead, he believes that considerable uncertainty has held firms back -- something he hopes to tackle with the forward guidance on interest rates. Mark Carney is taking a few questions from business leaders at the lunch in Nottingham (the press conference grilling comes next, at 2.45pm BST). Governor Carney declines to comment on whether he's support the creation of a state bank in the UK, saying it's a decision for politicians. Another business leader who runs an exporter asks for predictions on exchange rates. Carney give the full weight of his wisdom: Some are going to go up, and some are going to go down. Cue much guffawing in the audience.... The other important news from Mark Carney today is that the Bank of England will relax the rules imposed on commercial banks, regarding capital that they hold on their balance sheets. Carney says that the move will help get credit flowing: I can confirm today that, for major banks and building societies meeting the minimum 7% capital threshold, the Bank of England will reduce the level of required liquid asset holdings. The effect will be to lower total required holdings by \u00a390 billion, once all eight major banks and building societies meet the capital threshold. That will help to underpin the supply of credit, since every pound currently held in liquid assets is a pound that could be lent to the real economy. Mark Carney's speech can be seen in full on the Bank's website. here. Governor Carney challenges City experts who don't believe in his forward guidance and predict an interest rate rise in two years, not three as the Bank forecasts show. He insists that there's only a one in three chance that the jobless rate will drop from today's 7.8% to 7% in 2015. Carney also says that the Bank would be prepared to launch further stimulus measures in the future, if the recovery falters. Mark Carney tells business leaders in Nottingham that the commitment not to even consider raising interest rates until the jobless rate has dropped to 7%, from 7.8%, should encourage household spending and business investment. He says this forward guidance is a 'stabiliser' that will secure \"the scale and duration of recovery that is needed to bring unemployment down. \" He admits, though, that it's not welcome news for savers; I have tremendous sympathy for them \u2013 after all they have done the right thing, set money aside, and now they are earning returns that are substantially below what they would have expected. But raising interest rates now is not the answer \u2013 instead what savers need is a stronger economy. In the long term, Carney says, savers will benefit through higher asset pricess, and will allow interest rates to return to normal levels in a sustainable way. A strong economy is in all of our interests, as it will deliver better job prospects for our friends, neighbours, children and grandchildren. Early reaction from the press pack in Nottingham: As expected, Carney is giving a dovish message to Nottingham, and beyond (this was the big event for City traders today). He reiterates the historic 'forward guidance' which the Bank of England announced earlier this month: In particular, we will have to see the rate of unemployment, currently 7.8%, fall at least to a threshold of 7% before even beginning to consider whether to raise Bank Rate. A reminder that you can see Mark Carney's speech on the Bank website (here), or on Bloomberg TV. Carney point out that Britain has suffered badly since the financial crisis began: Over the past five years, a pervasive sense of uncertainty has held the economy back. The British people have been through the virtual collapse of the financial system, the worst recession in living memory, large job losses, falls in real wages and an at times harrowing crisis in the euro area, our largest trading partner. Mark Carney says he has spoken with many regional business leaders in Nottingham - saying that as a central banker there is 'no substitute' for actually meeting people who run companies. Carney says that he's convinced that \"a renewed recovery it taking hold amid a rising tide of optimism\", after the worst recession in living memory. Breaking: Mark Carney is reiterating his commitment to keep UK interest rates at record low levels until the employment market and wider economy has recovered. In his first speech since becoming Bank of England governor, Carney told regional business leaders that he would not risk derailing Britain's 'fledgling recovery'. He says: It will take a period of robust growth to begin to reduce meaningfully this spare capacity in the labour market and in companies. The Bank of England\u2019s task now is to secure the fledgling recovery, to allow it to develop into a period of sustained and robust growth. We aim to get there in part by reducing the uncertainty that has held back growth. And we are using our full suite of policy tools to help rebuild confidence so that we all can move forward in a sustainable manner. He's starting to give the speech right now. More to follow.... Bank of England governor Mark Carney's maiden speech, which begins in 10 minutes, will be streamed on the Bank's website. Here's a link. It's also being carried by Bloomberg. In Nottingham, the press pack are getting ready for Mark Carney's first speech.... I mentioned earlier (12.16pm) that shares in energy companies are up today, on the back of the rising oil price. That surge in crude is bad news for airlines, though, as it heralds higher fuel costs. British Airways parent company IAG is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down over 5%, with Easyjet not far behing with a 3% slide. IAG also owns Spain's Iberia, whose staff held a series of strikes this year in protest at planned job cuts. Turmoil in the Middle East could be adding to its problems.... As I type, Brent crude is up $1.5 to $115.9 per barrel, having hit a new six-month high of $117 early this morning. Just 30 minutes until Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives his eagerly awaited speech to business leaders in Nottingham. This photo, from the Bank of England, shows Carney looking typically poised as he arrived for his meeting with local business leaders: As explained earlier (see 10.07am), Carney is expected to repeat his message that UK borrowing costs will remain at current record lows until the economy is stronger. Europe's stock markets remain in negative territory after a morning of trading dominated by the situation in Syria. All the main indices are in the red, led by the German DAX (down over 1%). However, shares in energy firms have risen today, with Royal Dutch Shell up 2.1% and BP 1.1% higher. As my colleague Nick Fletcher reports, that follows the rise in the oil price in recent days. Oil shares on the rise as Syrian tensions continue to push crude prices higher I'm a bit late to this... but over in Germany, the eurozone crisis continues to loom over next month's general election. And last night, Angela Merkel blasted her predecessor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der for allowing Greece into the eurozone in the first place. Speaking at a rally in the northern German town of Rendsburg yesterday, Merkel declared that previous leaders were to blame for the eurozone's debt crisis. She said: For example, Greece shouldn\u2019t have been allowed into the euro [in 2001]. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der accepted Greece in and weakened the Stability Pact and both decisions were fundamentally wrong, and one of the starting points for our current troubles. Merkel, who defeated Schr\u00f6der and his SPD party in 2005, is still holding a solid lead in the opinion polls. But her handling of the debt crisis will probably be criticised by the SPD's candidate for the chancellery this time round, Peer Steinbruck, when the pair hold a TV debate on Sunday. Just in: UK retail sales have raced ahead in August, giving further evidence that the British economy is recovering. The CBI's monthly distributive trades figures showed the strongest growth since November 2012. Here are some highlights: \u2022 This was the second consecutive quarter of growth and was broad-based across a number of sectors, with clothing sales, grocers and recreational goods performing particularly well. \u2022 Retailers reported that sales volumes were above average for the time year, for the first time since January 2011. Sales are expected to grow robustly again in September. \u2022 Employment in the sector grew at its fastest pace since May 2002 and is expected to grow firmly again next month. Retailers also expect their overall business situation to improve over the next three months, with the survey balance at its highest for three years. And the 'net balance' of retailers reporting stronger sales came in at +26 - which is a nine=month high. Encouraging, but also raising fresh questions over the Bank of England's forward guidance on interest rate (which we'll hear more about in a few hours) Traders who don't believe Mark Carney will keep rates at 0.5% until 2016 (and there are plenty of them) may conclude this supports their case, as Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets tweets: Today's spike in the oil price has also subsided, a little, on the latest Syria developments (see last post). Oil is still up again, though, with a barrel of Brent crude costing $1 more ($115 per barrel). Volatile trading on the Dubai stock market. Having slumped by 6% in early trading, it's now recovered most of its losses. It looks like the early panic selling subsided, with investors watching to see how the Syria crisis plays out. My colleague Shiv Malik is covering all the latest Middle East developments in a live blog here. The latest news is that the UK has drafted a UN resolution condemning last week's chemical weapons attack which killed hundreds of people, and giving approval for 'necessary measures'. The UK parliament will debate the issue tomorrow- with the Labour Party today calling for UN involvement in any military action: Syria crisis: Labour deals blow to Cameron's hopes for Commons support. Much anticipation in the City ahead of Bank of England governor Mark Carney's first UK speech today, to regional business leaders in Nottingham. Held at the City's university, the event will include an hour-long speech from Carney, starting at 1.45pm, followed by a short press conference (which I'll cover in the blog). The governor is expected to reiterate the Bank's new 'forward guidance' on interest rates -- ie, no rise in borrowing costs until the jobless rate drops from 7.8% to 7%. Many City economists and traders aren't convinced by forward guidance -- so Carney must hope to have more success with people who actually run British firms. Here's a preview: Bank of England boss Mark Carney sidesteps City to ease rate rise fears Carney is expected to reiterate the low-interest commitment in an attempt to persuade business leaders that conditions are right to start spending cash hoarded up during the downturn and end an investment drought acting as a restraint on growth. But he will also undoubtedly want his words to resound back in London where interest rates determined by the market help set the borrowing costs ultimately faced by those same businesses. Meanwhile, the governor is expected to defend the Bank's tough rules on leverage ratios for lenders amid robust criticism from the business secretary, Vince Cable, last month. Speaking of emerging markets, Brazil's central bank is expected to raise interest rates again today in another attempt to underpin its currency and calm the rising cost of living in the country. Economists expect a half-point rise, which would take Brazil's headline borrowing rate up to 9%. More here. India's own financial crisis is deepening today, as the rupee tumbles to a new record low against the US dollar. The Indian rupee slumped by 3.7% earlier today to just 68.75 to the dollar, as foreign investors continue to pull out of the market. It recovered slightly after the central bank of India intervened, selling dollars and buying rupees in an effort to reverse the slide. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale comments: Oil prices are up, emerging market currencies are weaker (much weaker, in the case of the Indian Rupee). Risk aversion has markets in its grip. The concerns over Syria are exacerbating the damage already caused in emerging markets in recent weeks, due to the prospect of the US ending its monetary stimulus programme. India, with its trade deficit and high inflation, is being hit hard. It's not alone. though. as my colleague Heather Stewart explained on Monday: The Brazilian real has lost 20% of its value against the dollar since the start of the year, the rupee is down 15% and the Turkish lira down 10%. The situation has alarming echoes of the catastrophic Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. More here: US to relax quantitative easing but emerging markets grow tense Economist Shaun Richards has also written about the Indian situation here: The gold price is also up again this morning, hitting a three-month high of $1,433 per ounce. Gold has risen by over 20% in the last two months (after hitting a three-year low in June), with several central banks adding to their reserves in recent weeks (details here). Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, agrees that oil prices could remain high for some time: Assuming they [Western governments] take action, it's likely for the risk premium to be built in for quite a while. (via Reuters) Heavy selling in Dubai has send its stock market down by 6% this morning, to a six-week low. That's on top of the 7% slide yesterday: European stock markets have opened lower, adding to yesterday's declines. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed another 25 points, or 0.4%, to 6415. The German Dax fell 0.5%, while Spain's IBEX slipped 0.6%. Less dramatic than some of the overnight falls in Asia, reflecting the fact that European markets fell by between 1% and 2% on Tuesday. The US crude oil price hit a two-year high of $112.2 per barrel this morning, and analysts suspect they could climb rather higher if Western governments do engage in military action: Brent crude (oil sourced from the North Sea), is now trading $1.5 higher at $116 per barrel, having nudged $117 earlier today. Back in April it was below $100/barrel, and economists warn that motorists will soon see higher prices: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the financial markets, the global economy and the eurozone. It's another nervy day on the stock markets as the looming prospect of military action against the Syria government hits shares and drives oil prices higher. Already, Asian markets have posted hefty losses. Japan's Nikkei index fell 1.5% to a two-month low and the Philippines market slid by 5%, amid reports that the US and UK governments are finalising possible air strike plans. And Dubai's stock market tumbled by 5% when trading began a few minutes ago \u2013 meaning it has dropped 12% so far this week. European stock markets are expected to show more modest falls when trading begins. From Melbourne, Chris Weston of IG reports: The world is transfixed on Syria and rightly so given the Syrian foreign minister\u2019s comments that its defence would surprise the world. This is a market where the bulls are happy to revert to the sidelines and watch the situation unfold... The fact that both Syria and Iran are responding and now saying any attack by the west would give them full justification to attack Israel is not helping sentiment either. The prospect of military action in Syria has also pushed oil prices higher overnight -- with US crude oil spiking by $3 to a two-year high of $112 per barrel overnight. Brent crude rose by over $2 to $117 per barrel in early trading, the highest since February. (Reuters has more details here). This comes as emerging markets continue to be pummelled, with the Indian rupee hitting another record low this morning (more on this shortly). Also coming up, Bank of England governor Mark Carney will give his maiden speech in Nottingham today, followed by a press conference. He's expected to challenge critics who aren't convinced by his new 'forward guidance' that interest rates will remain at record lows until the unemployment market has improved. I'll be tracking all the market action, the Carney speech, and other developments through the day.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, sought to convince a sceptical City that borrowing costs will remain on hold for the next three years on Wednesday, as he warned that Britain needs a prolonged period of low interest rates to make up the ground lost during the recession. In his first big speech since taking charge in July, Carney left the door open for fresh stimulus measures if adverse market reaction to the Bank's new forward guidance regime threatened the UK's \"fledgling recovery\". The governor said he was trying to provide certainty to businesses and households that the recent signs of growth would not be followed swiftly by a tightening of policy. \"We have a recovery that's just beginning. It's a very long way back. We are lagging just about everybody else in the advanced world. There's a lot of spare capacity\", Carney said in a press conference following his speech to business leaders in Nottingham. The City was left unimpressed by the renewed commitment to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5% and to maintain the level of assets purchased under the Bank's quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. Sterling jumped by half a cent against the dollar after he spoke, while yields on 10 year gilts rose from 2.73% before his speech, to 2.8% afterwards \u2013 the opposite direction to the move Carney might have hoped for. Traders believe that the pick-up in economic activity will strengthen over the coming months and that the unemployment rate will fall to 7% \u2013 the threshold at which Carney might raise interest rates - well before the 2016 date pencilled in by the Bank. The governor's announcement on Wednesday that banks would be able to reduce their holdings of liquid assets by \u00a390bn, thereby making it easier for them to lend, strengthened the belief that Threadneedle Street was being too pessimistic about growth prospects. But Carney insisted that the 7% jobless rate was a \"staging post\", which would not necessarily lead to borrowing costs going up but only require the nine-strong monetary policy committee to re-think its approach. The jobless rate stands at 7.8% currently. He said the Bank's task was \"to secure the fledgling recovery, to allow it to develop into a period of sustained and robust growth. We aim to get there in part by reducing the uncertainty that has held back growth.\" Since the MPC adopted its new policy of forward guidance in July, investors have brought forward their expectations of a rate rise, amid strong economic data for the UK, and fears about the knock-on effects if the US Federal Reserve phases out its own $85bn(\u00a355bn)-a-month programme of QE. But the new governor insisted the Bank will not be swayed by decisions made thousands of miles away in Washington. \"While much has been made of the special relationship between the US and UK, it is not so special that the possibility of a reduction in the pace of additional stimulus in the US warrants a current reduction in the degree of monetary stimulus in the UK,\" he said. City analysts said, however, that the speech lacked details of how exactly Carney and his colleagues will respond if the current market reaction persists. \"If market rates are at 'unwarranted' levels and rise further, putting recovery in the real economy at risk, what would the BoE do?\", said Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. Simon Wells, of HSBC, said: \"There was little attempt to talk the market down with threats of imminent easing. Even if Mr Carney is personally irritated or concerned by the rise in market rates, he probably knows that there is little chance of garnering a majority on the MPC for policy loosening at this stage\". Carney did explain how he plans to use the Bank's new powers to supervise Britain's banks, in order to underpin recovery. He confirmed that once individual banks have increased their capital levels to the new minimum level of 7% of their risk-weighted assets, the Prudential Regulatory Authority will relax liquidity rules, allowing them to hold less of their capital in the form of the most liquid instruments such as government bonds. In total, the Bank says the move could free up \u00a390bn for new lending. The governor also addressed fears that the government's various schemes to rekindle the housing market, coupled with the Bank's promise to keep rates low, risked stoking a new speculative bubble. He said there was little evidence of a boom, with mortgage approvals running at just over half their pre-crisis level, and debt servicing costs low. But he added that the Bank was \"acutely aware of the risk of unsustainable credit and house price growth and will be monitoring it closely\".",

If there is an air attack (and at this stage it is still an if), and it is short-term and does not involve ground troops then the markets may be soothed. Hence, in the absence of other news it looks like oil and gold may have made a temporary top, stocks could be due a mini-recovery and the dollar may see an extended period of strength. So the FTSE 100 finished down 10.91 points at 6430.06, but well off the day's low of 6393. With the recent strength in crude - Brent added another 1.4% to nearly $116 a barrel - energy companies bucked the downward trend. Royal Dutch Shell B shares climbed 44p to \u00a322.21, BP was 5.55p better at 452.65p, BG added 57.5p to 1267.5p, while Tullow Oil rose 8p to \u00a310.26. Petrofac edged up 2p to \u00a313.75, a day after the oil services group issued an upbeat trading outlook. But the prospect of higher jet fuel prices continued to hit British Airways owner International Airlines Group, down 13.5p at 287p and the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 for the second day in a row. Low cost rival easyJet fell 22p to \u00a312.12. Legal and General ended 6.7p lower at 187.4p as its shares went ex-dividend. Miners came under pressure again amid the uncertainty, with Randgold Resources off 140p at \u00a351.95 and Glencore Xstrata down 2.85p at 311.35p. Irish-based Kenmare Resources slumped nearly 0% to 27p after first half profits tumbled 85%. The fall to $6.9m was blamed by the ilmenite and zircon specialist on higher operating costs, lower mineral prices and subdued demand. It has completed plans to increase production by 50%, and managing director Michael Carvill said: With increasing production and the completion of the major investment phase, management's focus is now on controlling operating costs, conserving cash and de-risking the business. But African Barrick Gold added 9.6p to 179.9p after a positive note from Nomura, which raised its target price from 155p to 250p. Finally Oxford BioMedical climbed 23% to 1.74p as the pharmaceutical group announced a $1m milestone payment from Pfizer had been triggered, following the entry of an antibody therapy into clinical trials.",

Not Brian Clough. Not DH Lawrence, although one of the Eastwood-born author's aphorisms did spring to mind as Threadneedle Street's new boss spoke: never trust the author, trust the tale. Certainly that was the case on Wednesday. The speech was supposed to hammer home the message contained in the Bank's inflation report three weeks ago \u2013 that interest rates were going nowhere fast. Yet the markets ignored Carney's doveish words and instead focused on the governor's one policy announcement: a loosening of liquidity requirements for banks that will make it easier for them to lend. The City's instant judgment was that the economy would grow more quickly than Carney is expecting. Since the Bank's forecasting recent forecasting record has been abysmal, traders don't believe it will take until 2016 for unemployment to come down from 7.8% to 7%, which is when the monetary policy committee will start to think about raising the cost of borrowing. As a result, Carney's second stab at explaining forward guidance was as big a failure as the first. The idea was to bear down on short-term market interest rates: instead, they rose. This is frustrating for the governor, who gave a sound explanation for avoiding a premature tightening of policy. The UK's recovery is just beginning and starts from a low base. Other developed countries have bounced back far more quickly and there is a non-negligible risk that Britain could be the new Japan if interest rates are raised at the first signs of growth. Carney was also right to point out the reasons unemployment could come down more gradually than the City's interest rate hawks believe. The governor noted that growth prospects were \"solid not stellar\"; getting the unemployment rate down from 7.8% to 7% would require the creation of 750,000 new jobs (and 1 million in the private sector due to public sector cuts); and there was the possibility that faster growth would result in higher labour productivity as well as job creation. What he didn't say, but is equally relevant, is that getting unemployment down to 7% through the creation of full-time jobs is one thing; getting the rate down to 7% by an additional 750,000 people on zero-hour contracts quite another. Carney professed to be untroubled by the market reaction and stressed that if the increase in market interest rates threatened to choke off the recovery, the Bank would provide further stimulus. The key passage of the speech said: \"The monetary policy committee will be watching these (market) conditions closely. If they tighten, and the recovery seems to be falling short of the strong growth we need we will consider carefully whether, and how best, to stimulate the recovery further.\" But what the past few weeks have shown is that forward guidance without policy action is a less than fully potent policy instrument. Indeed, as one leading City analyst noted, a lot of Carney's post-speech press conference was waffle. Lawrence's principle applies. It's the tale not the author that matters. Markets may demand action before taking Carney seriously.",

A rise in spending is welcome news, but the bottom line is that confidence will not bounce back fully until family finances improve further.\" Growth came from all areas, including clothing, food and recreational goods, while employment in the retail sector is expected to increase, according to the CBI. In its quarterly survey, the reported employment balance improved to its highest level since May 2002, while the business situation index rose to its highest in three years. The supposed green shoots come as the UK's third biggest supermarket, Sainsbury's, defied the march of the discount retailers Aldi and Lidl as the only one of the big four supermarkets not to lose market share in the last 12 weeks. Tesco, Asda and Morrisons all lost out, although the UK's fourth biggest supermarket, Morrisons, did manage to stem the tide of recent falls in sales, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has been ordered by the competition commission to sell down its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%, in a move that crushes the airline's ambitions to take over its Dublin-based rival. The final ruling confirmed the commission's provisional finding that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus had lessened, or would lessen, competition on air routes between Britain and Ireland, flown by some 14 million passengers a year. Ryanair said it was a baseless claim \"manifestly disproven by seven years of evidence\". Aer Lingus welcomed the report, saying it confirmed that Ryanair's shareholding was anti-competitive and against passengers' interests. The no-frills airline first bought a stake in Aer Lingus in 2006 with a view to a takeover bid. However, the European commission has on three occasions blocked Ryanair from acquiring more shares. Simon Polito, who chaired the competition commission inquiry, said it had \"confirmed our provisional view that Ryanair's minority shareholding has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition between the airlines\". He said the inquiry \"recognises that Ryanair and Aer Lingus compete intensely for passengers travelling between Great Britain and Ireland\" and that competition between them was \"at least as intense now as it was when Ryanair first acquired its stake\".

Mobile now represents around 17% of UK revenue, while it has also shown growth in its Spanish and Italian operations. It is on track to enter the potentially lucrative US market within the next few weeks, offering poker and casino products in New Jersey in partnership with Caesars Interactive Entertainment. It said:</p> <blockquote> The potential of the US market is generating excitement in the industry although we remain realistic about potential time frames. However, we are confident that 888 has the right strategy, partnerships and expertise to take advantage of the opportunity and maximize market share as regulation takes place. </blockquote> <p>Since the half year, the company said daily revenue during the third quarter was flat compared to the same period last year, but this was expected by the City. After an early surge, the shares have settled 0.2p higher at 145.2p. Analyst Michael Campbell at Daniel Stewart said:</p> <blockquote> The business should be well placed for the US market though we are only likely to see the benefits in 2014 and beyond in this regard. There is around $40m of cash (ex-customer balances) which the business can utilise to growth into new markets. We retain our buy recommendation and 200p target price. <br> </blockquote> <p>Nick Batram at Peel Hunt was also positive:</p> <blockquote> 888 is a business at the top of its game and the group is well positioned in the US. The challenge will be to generate enough profit out of the US to offset the impact from the UK point-of-consumption tax. Ultimately, given the quality of the product and the US angle, we believe 888 can continue to deliver. <br> </blockquote> <p>At Numis, Ivor Jones said:</p> <blockquote> Revenue from mobile/touch devices is growing rapidly, accounting for 17% of UK casino/poker/sports revenue in the first half of 2013 and catching up fast in other territories too. This shows, once again, the benefit 888 derives from having its principal technologies, as well as its operations, under one corporate roof. <br> The group is ready for launch in the US with B2B and B2C arrangements in place. The 888 poker brand is expected to launch in Nevada before the end of next month. The start of trading in the US ... will, in our view, increase investor interest in 888. We retain our buy rating and 220p price target. </blockquote>",

Analyst Michael Campbell at Daniel Stewart said: The business should be well placed for the US market though we are only likely to see the benefits in 2014 and beyond in this regard. There is around $40m of cash (ex-customer balances) which the business can utilise to growth into new markets. We retain our buy recommendation and 200p target price. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt was also positive: 888 is a business at the top of its game and the group is well positioned in the US. The challenge will be to generate enough profit out of the US to offset the impact from the UK point-of-consumption tax. Ultimately, given the quality of the product and the US angle, we believe 888 can continue to deliver. At Numis, Ivor Jones said: Revenue from mobile/touch devices is growing rapidly, accounting for 17% of UK casino/poker/sports revenue in the first half of 2013 and catching up fast in other territories too. This shows, once again, the benefit 888 derives from having its principal technologies, as well as its operations, under one corporate roof. The group is ready for launch in the US with B2B and B2C arrangements in place. The 888 poker brand is expected to launch in Nevada before the end of next month. The start of trading in the US ... will, in our view, increase investor interest in 888. We retain our buy rating and 220p price target.",
