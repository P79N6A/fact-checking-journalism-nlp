      "bodyText": "A group of City investors and pension funds have called for a return to \"simple banking\" as they launch a bid to take over more than 300 branches put up for sale by Royal Bank of Scotland. W&amp;G Investments, a consortium of City funds, is to file its official offer today to take over the 315 branches that RBS is being forced to sell off by Brussels as a condition for approving the bank's \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout at the height of the banking crisis. The consortium is a roll call of more than a dozen blue-blood City names, including Schroders, Threadneedle and Lansdowne Partners, and floats on the London stock exchange today with the aim of raising \u00a315m to fund its bid. RBS has already received two rival offers for the branches, which have 1.7 million retail customers and 230,000 small and medium-sized business accounts. One is from a consortium backed by the Church of England that is promising \"ethical\" investments; another is promoted by private equity firms AnaCap and Blackstone. The bank is expected to announce its decision in the next few weeks, but could reject all three bids and float the branches as a standalone company on the stock exchange. The head of W&amp;G Investments, former Tesco finance director Andrew Higginson, said the consortium, with \u00a320bn of assets, was big enough to be the \"challenger bank\" needed to inject more competition into the UK banking sector. \"We are taking a long-term view about building a genuine challenger bank,\" he said. \"These institutions want a simple banking business that takes deposits in from its customers and lends them out to others and makes a good margin in the middle.\" The bank's customers should not necessarily expect the cheapest products, because that was what went wrong during the financial crisis, he said. \"There is no great eureka magic formula. It is just a question of behaving well and doing the right thing for them [the customers].\" The group has offered \u00a31.1bn up front, rising to \u00a31.5bn once the branches are formally separated from RBS. The W&amp;G investors would get a \u00a355m payout from the state-backed lender even before the branches were sold, according to the stock market prospectus. Higginson said this was \"a very, very low rate of interest\" for the risk any investors would be taking on. \"We are giving [RBS] \u00a31.1bn on day one and we are getting a 5% coupon \u2013 I think it is reasonable.\" The bidding for the RBS branches has sparked fierce competition. John Maltby, the former Lloyds Banking Group banker who leads the church-backed bid, insisted this offer was the best value for the taxpayer. \"We have completed full due diligence. We have raised the money and we are ready to go.\" To entice bidders, RBS is reviving the Williams &amp; Glyn's brand, which disappeared from British high streets in 1986.But the return to an old brand \u2013 created by RBS in 1969 to unite its English and Welsh banks \u2013 has risks for any investor. Higginson played down the potential for an exodus of customers. \"We have come through that phase of disruption,\" he said. \"This is a business that has had the 'for sale' sign above the door for five years.\" He said the W&amp;G team would be ready to exchange contracts this year, with the Williams &amp; Glyn's sign going up on high streets \"as soon as possible after that\".",

      "bodyText": "Male bosses are being paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs \u2013 a disparity that means men enjoy salary top-ups of \u00a3141,500 more than women over the course of a working lifetime. The figures, released today by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of \u00a36,442 last year \u2013 compared with \u00a33,029 for women. In the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of \u00a336,270 over the past 12 months, compared with \u00a363,700 awarded to male directors. The latest figures highlighting the inequitable nature of pay in British business led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality. Ann Francke, the CMI's chief executive said: \"It's time to move this [issue into] the mainstream management agenda. \"This is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards. \"In solving this issue we would actually raise the performance of organisations and the wellbeing of individuals at work. What are we waiting for?\" Dr Ruth Sealy, a senior research fellow at Cranfield School of Management, added: \"It is not surprising. Bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion. As to what should be done about it, these things should be made more transparent.\" While statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the discrepancies in the sizes of awards do appear to be aggravating Britain's pay gap, which the government says is closing but still sees full-time male employees earn 10% more than women. Maria Miller, the minister for women and equalities, said: \"[The CMI] figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that, in the world of work, women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from equal. \"Changes in the workplace are happening and it's good that the pay gap is closing \u2013 but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace. \"The government is playing its part, we have made pay secrecy clauses illegal; given tribunals the power to force employers who break equal pay laws to carry out equal pay audits and signed 120 companies up to our Think, Act, Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women. \"We've also looked at other pay gap causes such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities by introducing shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees.\" Large companies such as Tesco, BT, Unilever, and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think, Act, Report. The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence \u2013 having risen from 54 participants last November. However, the CMI's data did provide some evidence to support Miller's contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to shrink from last year, decreasing from an average of \u00a310,060 in 2012 to \u00a38,502 in the CMI's most recent figures. However, the body cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples \u2013 which both polled around 40,000 managers \u2013as they are not identical. A sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years, showed that male managers' earnings are rising faster than women's for the first time in five years, with men enjoying total increases of 3.2% compared with 2.8% compared to women when salaries and bonuses are combined. At the most senior level, male directors' earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.",

      "bodyText": "Spain's bad bank loans hit a fresh high in June, according to Bank of Spain figures that underscore the continued fallout from the country's property crash. Bad loans as a proportion of total credit rose to a record 11.6% or \u20ac176.4bn (\u00a3150.5bn) in June, Bank of Spain data showed on Monday. That was a rise from 11.2% in May as more households and smaller companies struggled with debt, and exceeded a previous peak of 11.4% in November. Spain's banks have been hit particularly hard by bad property loans and the country is battling high unemployment, with a jobless rate of 26.3%. There had been a slight fall in the bad debt ratio at the end of last year, when the country's so-called \"bad bank\" swallowed up large amounts of the toxic real estate that had brought down several Spanish banks. The bad bank was set up by the government to fulfil one of the demands made by the eurozone countries providing a loan facility to Spain's banks. It deals with property left over from the housing construction bubble that burst in 2008, just as the credit crunch hit, and that lies at the root of Spain's protracted recession and high unemployment. The bad bank receives building plots and unfinished developments from developers and will be expected to sell this stock at a profit over the next 10 to 15 years. Spanish lenders' earnings were gutted last year by steep government-enforced provisions on properties and loans to developers in the wake of the crash. Those unable to cope were bailed out with European funds. Some top lenders, including healthy ones such as BBVA, have said that bad debts with property-related businesses in particular could keep rising into the first quarter of 2014.

The stock market is plunging, bond yields are nudging 10% and capital is flooding out of the country. In a sense, this is a classic case of deja vu, a revisiting of the Asian crisis of 1997-98 that acted as an unheeded warning sign of what was in store for the global economy a decade later. An emerging economy exhibiting strong growth attracts the attention of foreign investors. Inward investment comes in together with hot money flows that circumvent capital controls. Capital inflows push up the exchange rate, making imports cheaper and exports dearer. The trade deficit balloons, growth slows, deep-seated structural flaws become more prominent and the hot money leaves. The trigger for the run on the rupee has been the news from Washington that the Federal Reserve is considering scaling back - \"tapering\" - its bond-buying stimulus programme from next month. This has consequences for all emerging market economies: firstly, there is the fear that a reduced stimulus will mean weaker growth in the US, with a knock-on impact on exports from the developing world. Secondly, high-yielding currencies such as the rupee have benefited from a search for yield on the part of global investors. If policy is going to be tightened in the US, then the dollar becomes more attractive and the rupee less so. But while the Indonesian rupiah and the South African rand are also feeling the heat, it is India \u2013 with its large trade and budget deficits \u2013 that looks like the accident most likely to happen. On past form, emerging market crises go through three stages: in stage one, policymakers do nothing in the hope that the problem goes away. In stage two, they cobble together some panic measures, normally involving half-baked capital controls and selling of dollars in an attempt to underpin their currencies. In stage three, they either come up with a workable plan themselves or call in the IMF. India is on the cusp of stage three. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2013.

      "bodyText": "British shoppers are three times more likely to choose environmentally friendly products than they were in 2011, despite the squeeze on their incomes. A quarter of UK consumers said they would take the green option even if it cost them more money, up from 8% 17 months earlier, according to a survey by Nielsen, the market research company. The UK trend reflects a global surge in interest in environmentally friendly products with the proportion of consumers prepared to pay more to protect the natural world more than doubling to 46% last autumn from 22% in spring 2011, according to Nielsen. That change partly reflects rising concerns about the provenance of food and other products in the wake of series of scandals and easier access to information about the working practices of factories and farms around the world. Mike Watkins, senior manager of retail services at Nielsen, said that greater availability of eco-friendly products and improved marketing was also driving consumers towards pro-environment goods. Fairtrade and organic foods and green cleaning products such as Ecover, for example, are now widely stocked by supermarkets. \"Improved marketing contributes to better awareness and education about such products and helps compensate for any perceived quality trade-off between eco-friendly and standard versions,\" Watkins said. However, sales of relatively expensive organic produce have declined in the UK during the economic slump as consumers prioritise saving money over ecological concerns. The organic market dipped 1.5% this year according to The Soil Association, following much larger drops in the previous three years. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino, said that the increased interest in environmental products suggested by Nielsen was surprising and did not entirely tally with other industry data. But he said the price difference between green options and their traditional rivals had reduced, making them more acceptable for shoppers. \"It's easier to make that decision to switch,\" he said. But Brits lag behind others when it comes to active changes in their lifestyle to save energy and reduce their carbon footprint, according to Nielsen's survey of 29,000 people in 58 countries via the internet. Just 43% of UK participants said they were changing their behaviour compared with six in 10 globally and 55% in France and 52% in Germany, the nearest major economies.",

As house prices continue to lag behind inflation, the average sale price of a Bovis home shot up 15% to \u00a3188,500.</p> <p>Sales have been brisk with less of a summer lull than usual. Home reservations are up 43% on last year to a total of 1,712 homes. This includes 500 reservations under the state-backed mortgage guarantee scheme Help to Buy, which was launched on 1 April, and compares with 300 reservations last year under alternative shared equity schemes.</p> <p>Bovis is a bigger business than last year, accounting for some of this increase in reservations, but Help to Buy is also \"a better product\" than its predecessors, said David Ritchie, chief executive of Bovis. \"It is a product not just for first-time buyers, but for second-time buyers as well \u2026 it is better understood, people are more aware of it.

      "bodyText": "Bovis has reported a sharp increase in profits, driven by rising sale prices of its homes and strong consumer sentiment boosted by the government's controversial Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. The homebuilder also revealed that southern and central England occupies an increasingly dominant place in its land-buying strategy, and that it has not bought any land in Yorkshire or the East Midlands since the onset of the recession. Pre-tax profits at Bovis jumped 19% to \u00a318.6m in the first half of 2013 compared to \u00a315.6m in the same period last year. As house prices continue to lag behind inflation, the average sale price of a Bovis home shot up 15% to \u00a3188,500. Sales have been brisk with less of a summer lull than usual. Home reservations are up 43% on last year to a total of 1,712 homes. This includes 500 reservations under the state-backed mortgage guarantee scheme Help to Buy, which was launched on 1 April, and compares with 300 reservations last year under alternative shared equity schemes. Bovis is a bigger business than last year, accounting for some of this increase in reservations, but Help to Buy is also \"a better product\" than its predecessors, said David Ritchie, chief executive of Bovis. \"It is a product not just for first-time buyers, but for second-time buyers as well \u2026 it is better understood, people are more aware of it. We have used it healthily in the business.\" He dismissed claims that the scheme was creating a housing bubble. \"We have seen market prices up 1%-2%, which means real prices are still falling.\" The chief executive also confirmed that the housebuilder was concentrating its land-buying strategy on the south of England and the M6 corridor between Birmingham and Manchester. Bovis has always been more dominant in the south, but three-quarters of its land bank is now in southern England, compared with 60% before the economic crisis. \"We still have some locations in Yorkshire, where house prices are still falling, so investing in a market place where prices may be lower than they are today really is quite a challenge. I would far rather invest in those locations where I feel pricing has a chance to remain steady or potentially increase,\" said Ritchie.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has been fined \u00a3300,000 for mislabelling its strawberries, selling them at \"half price\" for three months after they were on sale at the full price for just seven days. The supermarket, which is trying to shed its \"big and bad\" image, made a \u00a32.3m profit from the promotion after a customer complained to Birmingham trading standards, a court heard. Judge Michael Chambers said at Birmingham crown court that the case was \"shocking by its very nature\" because customers had a high degree of trust in national chains. For seven days in 2011 Tesco sold 400g punnets of strawberries at \u00a33.99, reducing them to \u00a32.99 for a further week before marking them as half price at \u00a31.99 for a further 14 weeks. The promotion was a breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations Act 2008, which bars retailers from running a promotion for longer than the period over which the product was sold at full price. Birmingham city council argued that the offer had been presented in a way that could mislead or deceive the average consumer into thinking they were getting a good deal. It also complained about a further promotion involving the same strawberries in which Tesco offered a free pot of single cream with each punnet but then removed the free cream offer, returning the strawberries to their \"half-price\" status. The guilty plea by Tesco followed a preliminary hearing this year when the supermarket argued the council lacked the jurisdiction to proceed outside Birmingham on the case. The court threw out that claim. Tesco apologised to the court for the mis-selling, and said its internal processes had been tightened to avoid any repetition. It also agreed to pay Birmingham city council's \u00a365,000 legal bill. A spokesperson said: \"We apologise sincerely for this mistake, which was made in the summer of 2011. \"We sell over 40,000 products in our stores, with thousands on promotion at any one time, but even one mistake is one too many. \"Since then, to make sure this doesn't happen again we've given colleagues additional training and reminded them of their responsibilities to ensure we always adhere to the guidelines on pricing.\" On Monday Tesco was selling 454g punnets of British strawberries for \u00a32. Sajeela Naseer, head of trading standards at the council, said the victory would have benefits for consumers across the country. She added: \"It was the council's case, confirmed by Tesco's guilty pleas today, that this was a misleading offer which deceived the purchasers of strawberries over many weeks during the summer of 2011. \"Food pricing, presentation and the depiction of promotional practices is a crucial issue for retailers, and in turn, consumers.\" In November last year the Office of Fair Trading tightened its rules on promotions, with Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose, M&amp;S, Aldi, the Co-op and Lidl all signing up to a new code to avoid similar abuses. The fine is the latest labelling embarrassment for Tesco, which was caught up in the horsemeat scandal after horse DNA was found in its beefburgers. In that case the company attempted to reassure customers by publishing full-page adverts in several newspapers. Since then Tesco has launched a major new marketing campaign in an attempt to regain consumer confidence. However, some experts have suggested this latest scandal may have dented trust even further.",

This doesn't promise to be hugely exciting this year however, according to CMC's&#xa0;<strong>Michael Hewson</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&#xa0;In previous years this event has been a keenly watched event by markets for clues as to central bank policy, however on this occasion it is unlikely it will offer up much in the way of surprises given that neither the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi or the Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney, will be there.</p> </blockquote> <p>A flash estimate of the <strong>US manufacturing PMI</strong> for August will also be published on Thursday, and is expected to show a slight pick-up of growth in the sector with the index rising to 54 from 53.7 in July (where anything above 50 indicates expansion).</p> <p>Here in the <strong>UK</strong> figures on Wednesday are expected to show <strong>government borrowing</strong> was in surplus in July. A surplus is typical in July, as medium and large companies pay the first of four corporation tax installments. On an underlying basis with special factors aside, economists at <strong>Investec</strong> are expecting a \u00a31.5bn surplus, virtually unchanged compared with July last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Also on Wednesday, the <strong>CBI</strong> will publish its August <strong>Industrial Trends</strong> survey.</p> <p>The <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> will publish its <strong>first revision of second-quarter UK GDP</strong> on Friday. The consensus among economists is that a first estimate of 0.6% growth will remain unchanged, although some are predicting a small upward revision.</p> <p>The focus in the <strong>eurozone</strong> will be on Thursday's <strong>flash PMI estimates</strong> for the services and manufacturing sectors in August. Both are expected to rise and show modest improvement.</p> <p><strong>Germany's second-quarter growth</strong> is expected to be confirmed at 0.7% on Friday.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52121e68e4b02ef8c5064a49\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-19T13:36:24.707Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets open down slightly</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US is open for business and markets have nudged lower:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dow Jones</strong>: -0.1% at 15,059</li> <li><strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>: -0.1% at 1,65</li> </ul> <p>Meanwhile losses&#xa0;in <strong>Europe</strong> have accelerated:</p> <ul> <li><strong>FTSE 100</strong>: -0.5% at 6,470</li> <li><strong>CAC 40</strong>: -0.8% at 4,091</li> <li><strong>DAX 30</strong>: -0.3% at 8,369</li> <li><strong>IBEX</strong>: -1.5% at 8,685</li> <li><strong>FTSE MIB</strong>: -1.9% at 17,336</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-19T13:41:28.851Z\">at 2.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52120f74e4b0e9205ebe7b8c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-19T12:48:32.821Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spain's bad bank loans rise</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bad bank loans as a proportion of total credit&#xa0;rose to a new high of 11.6% or \u20ac176.4bn&#xa0;(\u00a3150.5bn) in June according to <strong>Spain</strong>'s central bank.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was a rise from 11.2% in May according to the <a href=\"http://www.bde.es/bde/en/secciones/prensa/Agenda/Datos_de_credit_983b4a5369f0041.html\">Bank of Spain</a>, as more households and smaller companies struggle with debt, and exceeded a previous peak of 11.4% in November.</p> <p>Spain's banks have been hit particularly hard by bad property loans, following the nation's housing crash, and the country is battling high unemployment with a jobless rate of 26.3%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5211fcd8e4b0e9205ebe7b82\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-19T12:14:07.683Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Angela Merkel says German elections will be a close call</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-997852f6-555a-46c6-becd-09bc0b5df976\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/19/1376914841857/228d43c1-2551-48fb-b62d-55ef9c514cd6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

      "bodyText": "We are signing off a little earlier today, but will be back again in the morning. Thank you for following our coverage and for all the comments. Please join us again tomorrow. Anticipation is building ahead of the latest minutes from the US Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, to be published on Wednesday. Investors will be looking in particularly for any hint on the pace of the Fed's bond-buying easing, which markets seem convinced will begin in September. Also in the US, the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole will begin on Thursday. This doesn't promise to be hugely exciting this year however, according to CMC's Michael Hewson: In previous years this event has been a keenly watched event by markets for clues as to central bank policy, however on this occasion it is unlikely it will offer up much in the way of surprises given that neither the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi or the Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney, will be there. A flash estimate of the US manufacturing PMI for August will also be published on Thursday, and is expected to show a slight pick-up of growth in the sector with the index rising to 54 from 53.7 in July (where anything above 50 indicates expansion). Here in the UK figures on Wednesday are expected to show government borrowing was in surplus in July. A surplus is typical in July, as medium and large companies pay the first of four corporation tax installments. On an underlying basis with special factors aside, economists at Investec are expecting a \u00a31.5bn surplus, virtually unchanged compared with July last year. Also on Wednesday, the CBI will publish its August Industrial Trends survey. The Office for National Statistics will publish its first revision of second-quarter UK GDP on Friday. The consensus among economists is that a first estimate of 0.6% growth will remain unchanged, although some are predicting a small upward revision. The focus in the eurozone will be on Thursday's flash PMI estimates for the services and manufacturing sectors in August. Both are expected to rise and show modest improvement. Germany's second-quarter growth is expected to be confirmed at 0.7% on Friday. The US is open for business and markets have nudged lower: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 15,059 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 1,65 Meanwhile losses in Europe have accelerated: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 6,470 CAC 40: -0.8% at 4,091 DAX 30: -0.3% at 8,369 IBEX: -1.5% at 8,685 FTSE MIB: -1.9% at 17,336 Bad bank loans as a proportion of total credit rose to a new high of 11.6% or \u20ac176.4bn (\u00a3150.5bn) in June according to Spain's central bank. It was a rise from 11.2% in May according to the Bank of Spain, as more households and smaller companies struggle with debt, and exceeded a previous peak of 11.4% in November. Spain's banks have been hit particularly hard by bad property loans, following the nation's housing crash, and the country is battling high unemployment with a jobless rate of 26.3%. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she is not taking for granted an election victory in September, despite her Christian Democratic Union party's lead in the polls. She also rejected speculation that she might step down before completing a third term if the party is elected. She told German broadcaster ZDF: I am indeed sure of the fact that the elections will be a very, very close call. It would be extraordinarily careless to think I'll be re-elected chancellor in any case and don't need to do anything about it anymore. I am campaigning to be chancellor for another four years and in the next five weeks I will put all my effort into making that possible. Shaun Richards, an independent economist, has posted a blog on the rupee's record low, which he says has developed into a currency crisis. He argues that while India has to an extent been a victim of market fears over US \"taper talk\", it also has its own specific problems: On the same February 27th blog I pointed out that in my opinion the Reserve Bank of India was making a mistake by pressing the stimulus button. One more time we find ourselves reviewing a situation where a central bank has posed as Superman and ended up looking much more like Clark Kent. In fact in the case of the RBI the analogy is unfair on Clark Kent! This sadly does not seem to deter those who call for ever more central planning and involvement. Read the full post here. Sticking with Germany, the Bundesbank is expecting growth rates in Europe's largest economy to return to \"normal and steady\" rates in the second half of 2013, following its strongest growth in more than a year in the second quarter. Gross domestic product increased by 0.7% between April and June compared with the first quarter. The central bank said in latest monthly report that Germany, along with other eurozone member states, would benefit from record low interest rates set by policymakers at the European Central Bank. However, it said the ECB's forward guidance indicating rates would remain low did not preclude a rate hike should inflationary pressures build: This is not an unconditional commitment and does not mark a change in the ECB's monetary policy strategy. The actual key ECB interest rates will continue to depend on the medium-term outlook for inflation, which is based on expectations regarding future developments in the real economy and on credit and money aggregates. It seems Germany has taken an official view on Bitcoin, recognising the online currency for legal and tax purposes. According to German reports, Berlin has acknowledged Bitcoin as a currency unit and private money. It would potentially mean that some commercial profits related to Bitcoin would be taxable, while personal use would be tax-free. Read the Guardian's latest on Bitcoin here. Tourism receipts in Greece jumped 21% to \u20ac1.59bn (\u00a31.35bn) in June compared with a year earlier. It meant tourism receipts in the first half of the year overall were up 18% at \u20ac3.32bn according to the Bank of Greece. The lure of the Grecian sun, as well as a smaller trade gap, helped to lift the country's current account balance to a surplus of \u20ac663m in June from \u20ac73.1m in the same month last year. Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, says fears about the impact of a slowdown in US bond buying on emerging markets is overdone. He told CNBC: This fear of tapering is quite overdone. What people fail to realize is that the so-called tapering is on top of an incredible increase in money supply in the US. These QE programs have been cumulative. It's not a situation where one stops and all that money goes away. It stays in the system. You're going to see more money going into emerging markets. However this from Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management. As ShiresofEngland points out in the comments below, the Indian rupee has fallen to a new record low. It fell to 62.49 against the US dollar, despite recent measures by the government to limit the decline. Britain's self-styled 'voice of business' is feeling more optimistic about the outlook for the UK economy, raising its forecast for growth this year to 1.2% from an earlier forecast of 1%. That means the CBI is expecting growth of twice the rate predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility - the Chancellor's official forecaster - in the March Budget. The business group highlighted a broad pick up in confidence across the services, manufacturing and construction sectors. It also raised its forecast for growth in 2014 to 2.3% from a May forecast of 2%.

Last week's news that the eurozone emerged from recession in the second quarter has failed to lift investors in early trading, with major indices down: FTSE 100: -0.3% at 6,482 CAC 40: -0.5% at 4,105 DAX 30: -0.3% at 8,364 IBEX: -0.3% at 8,793 Michael Hewson, senior markets analyst at CMC Markets, described last week's performance on stock markets as \"schizophrenic\", with \" the worst weekly performance for US stocks this year, the FTSE posting its second weekly decline in succession and the French CAC40 closing up for the eight successive week in a row\". Good morning. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Japan's trade deficit ballooned in July on surging energy imports and a weaker yen which made imported goods more expensive. Imports jumped 19.6%, outpacing a 12.2% rise in exports and driving the trade deficit from \u00a5944bn (\u00a36.2bn) in June to \u00a51.02tn in July \u2013 the third largest on records dating back to 1979. Despite the swelling deficit, the details were not as bad as the headline looked because the rise in exports showed Japan is starting to benefit from a recovery of demand in the US and Europe. The Nikkei closed up 0.8% at 13,758. The yen has fallen 11% against the dollar this year and the expectation is that Japan's trade position will improve as the global economic recovery becomes more established. Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo, told Bloomberg: The weakening of the currency will benefit the economy as it will help companies in the auto and information technology sectors. I\u2019m not so concerned about the trade deficit because energy prices will fall sooner or later and export volumes will rise as the global economy improves. Japanese exports to the European Union jumped 16.6% in July, driven higher by cars, machinery and steel, and reflecting data last week which showed the eurozone finally emerged from recession in the second quarter with 0.3% growth. It followed an 8.6% rise in June. Japan\u2019s exports to the US rose 18.4%, faster than the 14.6% rise in June.",

      "bodyText": "When the Reserve Bank (RBA) slashed rates in 2001 it provoked a massive housing boom that saw prices sky rocket and housing affordability deteriorate. This time, despite some commentators worrying about another boom, so far there does not appear to be evidence of a similar escalation in prices. The housing market is one of the more data heavy areas of economics or finance. You can access data for auction clearance rates, housing prices, loans, different types of loans, whether the loans are for constructions of new houses or established ones, or if the buyers are first-home buyers. You can break down the data by capital city and regional areas. In short, there are many tales to tell about the housing market. Recently a number of articles have emerged about the boom in the market citing the increase in the clearance rate of auctions as a reason. But thus far, while it appears there is increased demand for housing, it is not transferring into a boom in prices. The latest Established Houses Price Index (which includes the value of the house and the land) shows a national increase of 5.3% in the year to June. While this is an improvement from the decline in prices in 2011-12, it is nowhere near the growth of the early 2000s, nor even the period leading up to the GFC: Of course housing prices on a national scale can be rather misleading but the long-term path of national rate is not too out of whack with most capital cities. While both Sydney and Perth are currently experiencing annual price growth above the national rate, neither of those cities has growth close to that of their respective booms in the early 2000s. Perth\u2019s annual house price rise of 11% is far and away the biggest to the capital cities (only Darwin with 7.7% and Sydney with 6.1% come close), but it still pales in comparison to the 47% growth of 2004. Sydney remains the most expensive market with average house prices around $680,000 and Melbourne is second with just over $600,000. Perth\u2019s recent rise now has it battling with Canberra for the third most expensive capital city to buy houses with prices just below the $600,000 mark. The general view is that it takes a good 18 months for the impact of interest rate cuts to start to flow through to lending rates. Back in June I used housing finance data to compare the impact of the RBA\u2019s 225 basis points interest rate cut since November 2011 with the 200 cut which occurred from February 2001 to December 2001. With the addition of two more months since that analysis, we can now compare the growth in both the number of housing loans and their value over a period of 20 months. What we find accords with the views of those 'on the ground' at auctions - that sales of homes have increased. There has been an almost identical growth in the number of housing loans taken out (10% compared to 9.74%) but whereas the value of those loans in the 20 months after February 2001 grew by 32%, since November 2011 the value of housing loans has only increased by 11%. The big difference is back in 2001, it wasn\u2019t only interest rates that were changing. In March 2001, John Howard doubled the first home buyers grant from $7,000 to $14,000.

So yes things are doing better than they were, but this boom is no early 2000s boom. Households however are much more in debt now. Back in 2001 the debt to household disposable income was around 79%; now it is around 133%. But because of the low interest rates, the percentage of disposable income spent on mortgage interest payments has fallen from a high in September 2008 of 10.9% to 7.8%.
