      "bodyText": "As Australia reached a population of 25 million this week there was much discussion about whether or not we were growing too quickly and whether or not we should scale back immigration. While such a debate can often see racism and xenophobia come to the fore, it is also far too often used by politicians eager to look like they have found easy solutions. We should not let them get away with it and demand more, not just of our debate but of government policy. For those like me who favour migration the argument is always rather more difficult than for those who would see migration as the cause \u2013 and its cutting as the solution \u2013 of so many problems. Low wages growth, congestion, poor schooling, crime \u2013 pretty much whatever you want can fit under the \u201cif only we cut back migration things would improve\u201d argument. All you need to do is point to problems and then hark back to some mythical better time. You of course hasten to add that you are very much in favour of multiculturalism, and think migration has been great for Australia; you\u2019re just worried that things are changing too fast and that, well, look at the congestion on the roads, look at the state of our schools, look at our low wages ... It seems logical, but it really only looks at half of the equation. Tony Abbott captures the essence of this argument quite well when he suggests \u201cit\u2019s an iron law of economics that more supply cuts price, hence the impact of high immigration on wages; similarly more demand boosts price, hence the impact of high immigration on housing affordability\u201d. It is a perfect example of only seeing what you want to see or, as economist Tom Westland stated rather drolly, how \u201cfor anti-immigration types, migrants exist only on the demand side of the housing market and only on the supply side of the labour market\u201d. Yes, migrants affect the supply of labour, but they also increase the demand for goods and services, which creates a demand for more workers to produce those goods and deliver those services. Yes, they increase the demand for housing, but the market reacts to this by increasing the supply of housing. That can be a slow process, especially in times of a large increase in the demand for housing, but oddly we don\u2019t actually have a fixed stock of housing or labour \u2013 both respond to demand and supply. A speech by the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, this week noted that this response is now occurring as the \u201cgrowth in the number of dwellings\u201d has been \u201cexceeding growth in the population over the past four years\u201d. The reality is our housing affordability issue is not just about supply and demand but that government policies at a federal, state and local level are, as Ross Gittins noted, massively skewed in favour of home owners at the expense of would-be home buyers. Lowe\u2019s speech was a very timely push back to some of the pretty lazy claims against migration, and pointed to the actual economic benefits it brings. The suggestion that migrants are over-supplying our labour market is an interesting one. Yes, Australia has had low wages growth, but so too has a host of countries which have not seen anywhere near our level of migration growth. And were the influx of migrants leading to residents missing out on jobs, you would expect the percentage of adults in work would fall. After all, if Abbott\u2019s supply of labour fallacy were to hold, you would expect the population to increase faster than the employment. However, the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds in employment is higher now than at any time in our past. This is mostly because of more women working now than in the past, but even the 83% of men aged 25 to 64 who are employed is not much below the post-1990s recession high of 84% that occurred just prior to the GFC. The level of men working full-time is lower (about 73% compared with an average since 1990 of 74%), but that is due to the changing nature of work in our economy, and anyone telling you slowing migration will halt the shift towards the services sector and part-time work is selling you snake oil. Lowe noted as well that migrants are more educated and younger on average than residents \u2013 meaning that they not only boost our national capital and productive capacity, they also have greatly helped the problem of our ageing population. While much has been made in the past week that we reached 25 million much faster than expected, because of immigration we are also a much younger nation than expected. In 2002 the median age of Australians was by now expected to be 40. Instead it is 37. Back then it was projected to hit 45 by 2040; now it looks likely to be just above 40. This means the ratio of people in retirement to the working-age population is rising much slower than other nations in the OECD, an important factor when it comes to the government being able to fund health and social services for those in retirement. But this does not of course make the increase in migration an easy step. It\u2019s true that our infrastructure has not kept pace. But the argument that we should ease back migration while we wait for infrastructure to catch up suggests, much like a mythical past where apparently we were all happy with the level of migration and multiculturalism, that in the future we will see a time when people will think we have enough infrastructure to cope and will thus be open to more migrants. The pressure should not be for governments to cheat the way to improving the situation by cutting migration, it should be on them to actually deliver the services that are needed. The calls for cuts to migration gives governments an easy pass. We should pressure governments to deliver the needed services, to look for ways to fund them and not have then cut taxes and then claim later that there is no money and blame migrants. The calls for lower migration (or worse the euphemism of a \u201csustainable\u201d Australia) often leads to some pretty dark places, but just as bad it lets governments off the hook. Yes the solutions to a growing population might be hard, but finding them is what they are paid to do. If they can\u2019t, then we should elect someone who can, not someone who wants us to re-elect them because they are seeking cover by blaming others. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s largest DIY retailers is reviewing the sale of Roundup weedkiller products amid mounting concerns about their use, after a US jury found that the herbicide had caused a terminally ill man\u2019s cancer. The manufacturer of the weedkiller, Monsanto, has insisted that British consumers are safe to continue using Roundup products, which are widely sold at DIY stores and used by British farmers. But a spokesperson for Homebase said it would be reviewing its product range after the ruling in California. A spokesperson for B&amp;Q said it had already been undertaking a broader review of all garden products in an attempt to manage the range responsibly. On Friday, Dewayne Johnson, a 46-year-old former groundskeeper, was awarded $289m (\u00a3226m) in damages from Monsanto after a jury ruled that Roundup had caused his terminal blood cell cancer and the company had failed to warn him of the health risk from exposure. The jury also found that Monsanto had \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d and ruled that it knew or should have known the weedkiller was dangerous. During the trial, the court heard that Johnson may have just months to live and his wife had been forced to work two jobs to help pay for his treatment for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Monsanto\u2019s vice-president, Scott Partridge, said on Friday that hundreds of studies had shown that glyphosate, one of the world\u2019s most widely used herbicides and a key ingredient of Roundup, does not cause cancer. Monsanto would be appealing against the jury\u2019s verdict, he added. \u201cIt is completely and totally safe, and the public should not be concerned about this verdict. It is one that we will work through the legal process to see if we can get the right result. The science is crystal-clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury made a decision, but the decision that a jury or a judge makes has to be based on the weight of the evidence, and the overwhelming weight of the evidence that went in the trial was that science demonstrates glyphosate is safe; there\u2019s no credible evidence to the contrary.\u201d The German pharmaceutical group Bayer, which owns Monsanto, said: \u201cBayer is confident, based on the strength of the science, the conclusions of regulators around the world and decades of experience, that glyphosate is safe for use and does not cause cancer when used according to the label.\u201d The scientific world, however, has raised doubts about glyphosate. A ruling in 2015 by the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d. Campaigners are now calling for a review of pesticide regulations in the UK after the case, saying that glyphosate poses a risk to public health, soils and the environment. More than 2m hectares (5m acres) of farmland across Britain are treated with glyphosate annually, according to a study of government data by Oxford Economics. Emma Hockridge, head of policy at the Soil Association, described the ruling as a \u201cdramatic blow\u201d to the pesticide industry. \u201cThis is a landmark case, which highlights not only the problems caused by glyphosate, but also the whole system of pesticide use. We need to urgently change our systems of weed control to stop relying on herbicides,\u201d she said. But the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) said use of the pesticide should not be reviewed after the court ruling. Glyphosate\u2019s licence was extended for five years in Europe by the EU last November, despite a petition by 1.3 million EU citizens calling for a ban. The NFU\u2019s deputy president, Guy Smith, who is also an active livestock and arable farmer, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in the same place as when they ruled it was safe to use. We don\u2019t think the opinion of a Californian jury should change that. \u201cIts most common use in UK farming is to kill weeds in the autumn before seeds are planted. On my land right now, I\u2019m spraying it today. Without glyphosate, I would have to plough and cultivate the land. That would use extra diesel, which is bad for the soil and the environment.\u201d A spokesperson for B&amp;Q said: \u201cWe continually aim to manage our garden products responsibly and have a record of acting ahead of legislation where appropriate; we led the way in removing three pesticides in 2013 and neonicotinoids from our flowering plants in 2018. We offer alternatives to glyphosates, and we are currently undertaking a broader review of all our garden products.\u201d A spokesperson for Wilko said it was not reviewing Roundup products, but added that it was \u201cwatching the situation carefully and will respond appropriately.\u201d The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for pesticide regulation, said: \u201cDecisions on the use of pesticides should be based on a careful scientific assessment of the risks.\u201d",

The ailing chain\u2019s 59 shops are partly a property play for Ashley, who will be renegotiating all the leases with landlords over the next year. Murray, 28, who was put in charge of Sports Direct\u2019s property in 2015, is likely to be at the forefront of making deals for the stores, which are expected to involve rent cuts, and setting up Sports Direct or Flannels outlets in the less salubrious locations. He may persuade landlords to co-operate in carving up sites to bring in gyms, office space or other users that will help drive footfall to ailing high streets. Short term, Sports Direct can make money just by selling stock that it has more or less got for free. Long term, it will be about getting the right brands in the right locations at the right rents. Originally from Doncaster, Murray began his career running festivals and student nights while still at Reading University after attending Sedbergh private school in Cumbria. He also bought two bars while still a student \u2013 no surprise, perhaps as property development is in his blood. His father, Mick, co-founded Lazarus Properties, Doncaster\u2019s biggest landlord, which also owns high-end London properties in Kensington and Holland Park. Arguably the biggest boost to Murray\u2019s career came when he met Anna on holiday in Majorca in 2011. A few years later he helped develop a house for her before moving on to bigger deals. The couple now reportedly live together in a \u00a310.7m home in Belgravia. Since being taken on by Sports Direct as a consultant he has driven a shift to more modern stores in better locations, helping the retailer win over the big sports brands such as Adidas and Nike, which had been reluctant to supply the chain with their best products. Murray was paid \u00a35m by the company for his work over the three years to March based on the value he had created through his deals, a payout set by the board based on his performance. Ashley may be hoping Murray can help him bring high-end fashion brands, many of which the company already stocks in Flannels, around at House of Fraser.

      "bodyText": "\u2018My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into the Harrods of the high street,\u201d trumpeted Mike Ashley, sportswear billionaire, as he added the stricken department store to his multibillion-pound retail empire. House of Fraser has been a target for years for the controversial owner of Sports Direct, and he finally seized control on Friday as the near-170-year-old business faced its darkest hour. The \u00a390m rescue deal, which saw the retailer bought swiftly out of administration, is the biggest gamble yet by the entrepreneur, who is well known for his love of roulette. On a day of high drama on the high street, retail experts were surprised to see Ashley take another chance on a bombed-out retailer. After all, last month Sports Direct had to write down the value of its 29.7% stake in struggling rival Debenhams by almost as much as it has just spent on House of Fraser. The big question now is what Ashley will do with the chain, a heretofore classy brand known for famous stores such as Frasers in Glasgow and Jenners in Edinburgh? Ashley made his fortune selling discounted tracksuits and trainers at Sports Direct stores rammed with stock from its own stable of sportswear brands, including Slazenger, Everlast and Lonsdale. But more recently he has been working hard to try to shed his \u201cMr Tracksuits\u201d reputation. He has been investing in more upmarket brands \u2013 Flannels, a designer fashion chain, and Four Holdings, the group which owns lingerie brand Agent Provocateur but also distributes desirable labels including Paul &amp; Shark, Orla Kiely and Stone Island. \u201cMike has secretly been trying to become respectable for years, so revitalising a lovely old store like Frasers in Glasgow really appeals to him,\u201d said someone who knows him. \u201cIt was now or never. If he didn\u2019t buy House of Fraser he would always be known as the man who clothed a generation of tracksuit-wearers. He wants to leave a legacy.\u201d But will it turn out that way? In its stock exchange statement, Sports Direct said it had acquired all 59 stores, the House of Fraser name and the stock. \u201cOur deal was conservative, consistent and simple,\u201d said Ashley. But it also included a half-promise that \u201cwe will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible\u201d. While the deal ostensibly looks to have saved 16,000 jobs, Ashley could still opt to close stores further down the line. That is because Sports Direct has only taken over the running of the stores under licence from the administrator and can hand back the keys to any of them if he is unable to secure the rent deals from landlords that he wants. One landlord said he thought the long-term future for House of Fraser was likely to be messy. \u201cAshley is backing multi-brand stores against the trend. Single-brand stores are doing better.\u201d However, the entrepreneur would only have to shift the stock still sitting in House of Fraser to make money on the deal, he suggested \u2013 a tactic Ashley had used on previous occasions. In what has been a grim year for the high street, department store chains in particular are struggling as the transfer of sales to the internet makes it harder to turn a profit from sprawling high-street sites, many of which incurred hefty increases in business rates as a result of last year\u2019s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers have reined in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes. But House of Fraser\u2019s story is one of a long, slow decline rather than a sudden death. The chain has suffered blows from rising costs and stagnating sales along with the rest of the high street. But it was also saddled with heavy debts and a hefty pension scheme thanks to bad management decisions taken in the past, such as selling the freeholds of its stores and acquiring the Beatties department store chain. The group\u2019s young and inexperienced boss, Alex Williamson, had no retail experience when he joined last year from Goodwood, the group behind the Goodwood Revival and Festival of Speed events. Last year\u2019s decision to take the redevelopment of its website inhouse was also a disaster, with sales plummeting after it disappeared from Google searches. One former staff member said that a revolving door for senior managers, many of whom were pushed out in order to save money, had not helped: \u201cWhen you take lots of people out then mistakes happen, because no one has experience of making those mistakes before.\u201d Much was promised four years ago when House of Fraser was sold to an offshoot of Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a \u00a3450m deal. But instead of helping House of Fraser recover from the lost years that followed the collapse of its previous owner \u2013 Baugur, the now defunct Icelandic investment fund \u2013 it only trickled funds into a business that desperately needed cash to deal with its ageing portfolio of stores and a \u00a3400m debt mountain. The collapse of a deal to sell a stake to C.banner, another Chinese company, at the start of this month was the final straw. In the end, it all culminated in an unceremonious and short-lived dunk into administration on Friday morning. The deal means House of Fraser\u2019s secured lenders, who are at the front of the queue to be paid in the event of administration, will recoup around 22p in the pound. The store chain\u2019s suppliers, who were due to be paid about \u00a360m next week, are expected to get only 3p in the pound. House of Fraser\u2019s pension scheme will now be assessed by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-backed \u201clifeboat\u201d \u2013 but as it is in surplus, it could be taken over by an insurance firm. However, any deal is still likely to fall short of previously promised pension benefits. Nigel Lugg, chairman of the UK Fashion and Textile Association, said: \u201cA lot of suppliers will be owed a lot of money. It will be like a tsunami after the administration. \u201cMike Ashley has bought the business and we want to wish him every success with keeping a department store going, a premium department store with premium brands. We will wait and see what he wants to do, but we want to support House of Fraser going forward.\u201d In winning control of House of Fraser, Ashley outflanked Philip Day, another entrepreneur who likes to buy retail brands that have fallen on hard times. Over the last two decades the Dubai-based businessman has been quietly buying up swaths of the high street \u2013 a haul that includes Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Peacocks, Jaeger and Austin Reed. One deal insider said Ashley winning control was a better outcome for the 16,000 people who work either directly for House of Fraser or are employed by the fashion brands it sells: \u201cMore people are going to end up employed.\u201d Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said Sports Direct\u2019s ownership of House of Fraser would be a two-act play: \u201cInitially, House of Fraser will appear to be trading as it has done for years because they have bought the stores and the stock. \u201cWhat happens after that stock has been sold is more difficult to fathom. Ashley has made no secret of his plans to add an upmarket business stream and has done well with some small brands, but the scale here is quite different. It\u2019s a huge challenge.\u201d",

But it was also saddled with heavy debts and a hefty pension scheme thanks to bad management decisions taken in the past, such as selling the freeholds of its stores and acquiring the Beatties department store chain.</p> \n<p>The group\u2019s young and inexperienced boss, Alex Williamson, had no retail experience when he joined last year from Goodwood, the group behind the Goodwood Revival and Festival of Speed events. Last year\u2019s decision to take the redevelopment of its website inhouse was also a disaster, with sales plummeting after it disappeared from Google searches.</p> \n<p>One former staff member said that a revolving door for senior managers, many of whom were pushed out in order to save money, had not helped: \u201cWhen you take lots of people out then mistakes happen, because no one has experience of making those mistakes before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Much was promised four years ago when House of Fraser was sold to an offshoot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/04/house-of-fraser-sold-to-sanpower-group\">Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a \u00a3450m deal</a>.</p> \n<p>But instead of helping House of Fraser recover from the lost years that followed the collapse of its previous owner \u2013 Baugur, the now defunct Icelandic investment fund \u2013 it only trickled funds into a business that desperately needed cash to deal with its ageing portfolio of stores and a \u00a3400m debt mountain.</p> \n<p>The collapse of a deal to sell a stake to C.banner, another Chinese company, at the start of this month was the final straw.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14382feed318027c74d3247e5ec7c0cef8b0f083\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14382feed318027c74d3247e5ec7c0cef8b0f083/254_309_4354_2612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lillywhites, one of Ashley\u2019s many sports brands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lillywhites, one of Ashley\u2019s many sports brands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the end, it all culminated in an unceremonious and short-lived dunk into administration on Friday morning. The deal means House of Fraser\u2019s secured lenders, who are at the front of the queue to be paid in the event of administration, will recoup around 22p in the pound. The store chain\u2019s suppliers, who were due to be paid about \u00a360m next week, are expected to get only 3p in the pound.</p> \n<p>House of Fraser\u2019s pension scheme will now be assessed by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-backed \u201clifeboat\u201d \u2013 but as it is in surplus, it could be taken over by an insurance firm. However, any deal is still likely to fall short of previously promised pension benefits.</p> \n<p>Nigel Lugg, chairman of the UK Fashion and Textile Association, said: \u201cA lot of suppliers will be owed a lot of money. It will be like a tsunami after the administration.</p> \n<p>\u201cMike Ashley has bought the business and we want to wish him every success with keeping a department store going, a premium department store with premium brands. We will wait and see what he wants to do, but we want to support House of Fraser going forward.\u201d</p> \n<p>In winning control of House of Fraser, Ashley outflanked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/23/can-this-man-save-our-high-streets\">Philip Day</a>, another entrepreneur who likes to buy retail brands that have fallen on hard times. Over the last two decades the Dubai-based businessman has been quietly buying up swaths of the high street \u2013 a haul that includes Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Peacocks, Jaeger and Austin Reed.</p> \n<p>One deal insider said Ashley winning control was a better outcome for the 16,000 people who work either directly for House of Fraser or are employed by the fashion brands it sells: \u201cMore people are going to end up employed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said Sports Direct\u2019s ownership of House of Fraser would be a two-act play: \u201cInitially, House of Fraser will appear to be trading as it has done for years because they have bought the stores and the stock.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happens after that stock has been sold is more difficult to fathom. Ashley has made no secret of his plans to add an upmarket business stream and has done well with some small brands, but the scale here is quite different. It\u2019s a huge challenge.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Monsanto suffered a major blow with a jury ruling that the company was liable for a terminally ill man\u2019s cancer, awarding him $289m in damages. Dewayne Johnson, a 46-year-old former groundskeeper, won a huge victory in the landmark case on Friday, with the jury determining that Monsanto\u2019s Roundup weedkiller caused his cancer and that the corporation failed to warn him of the health hazards from exposure. The jury further found that Monsanto \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d. Johnson\u2019s lawyers argued over the course of a month-long trial in San Francisco that Monsanto had \u201cfought science\u201d for years and targeted academics who spoke up about possible health risks of the herbicide product. Johnson was the first person to take the agrochemical corporation to trial over allegations that the chemical sold under the brand Roundup causes cancer. In the extraordinary verdict, which Monsanto said it intends to appeal, the jury ruled that the company was responsible for \u201cnegligent failure\u201d and knew or should have known that its product was \u201cdangerous\u201d. \u201cWe were finally able to show the jury the secret, internal Monsanto documents proving that Monsanto has known for decades that ... Roundup could cause cancer,\u201d Johnson\u2019s lawyer Brent Wisner said in a statement. The verdict, he added, sent a \u201cmessage to Monsanto that its years of deception regarding Roundup is over and that they should put consumer safety first over profits\u201d. Speaking in San Francisco on Friday, Johnson said that the jury\u2019s verdict is far bigger than his lawsuit. He said he hopes the case bolsters the thousands of similar lawsuits pending against the company and brings national attention to the issue. Johnson\u2019s case was particularly significant because a judge allowed his team to present scientific arguments. The dispute centered on glyphosate, which is the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide. The verdict came a month after a federal judge ruled that cancer survivors or relatives of the deceased could bring similar claims forward in another trial. During the lengthy trial, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys brought forward internal emails from Monsanto executives that they said demonstrated how the corporation repeatedly ignored experts\u2019 warnings, sought favorable scientific analyses and helped to \u201cghostwrite\u201d research that encouraged continued usage. Monsanto has long argued that Roundup is safe and not linked to cancer and presented studies during trial that countered the research and testimony submitted by Johnson\u2019s team. The herbicide is registered in 130 countries and approved for use on more than 100 crops, but in 2015, the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d, triggering a wave of legal and legislative challenges. After the trial, Scott Partridge, the vice-president of Monsanto, rejected any link between glyphosate and cancer, insisting the \u201cverdict doesn\u2019t change the four-plus decades of safe use and science behind the product\u201d. Partridge said the IARC, whose evidence was key in persuading the jury of the link between glyphosate and cancer, \u201chas been demonstrated as having been corrupted\u201d, asserting the organisation does \u201cno testing, they do no analysis, they have no laboratories, they simply render an opinion\u201d. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today show on Saturday, Partridge expressed sympathy for Johnson but continued to dispute the evidence used in the trial. He said the internal company emails, which were used by Johnson\u2019s attorney as evidence the agrochemical firm had rejected critical research and expert warnings about the weedkiller, had been \u201ctaken completely out of context\u201d. Johnson, 46, is a father of three who worked as a groundskeeper and pest manager for the school district in Benicia, a suburb just north of San Francisco. That position began in 2012, and he testified that it involved him spraying herbicide to control weeds on school grounds, sometimes for several hours a day. He argued that his exposure to the chemicals caused non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a blood cell cancer, and when he took the stand, he discussed his pain and suffering as skin lesions took over his body. \u201cI\u2019ve been going through a lot of pain,\u201d Johnson, who goes by the name Lee, testified weeks earlier. \u201cIt really takes everything out of you \u2026 I\u2019m not getting any better.\u201d He also testified that Monsanto should not have let him use the herbicide near schoolchildren, saying: \u201cI never would\u2019ve sprayed that product on school grounds or around people if I knew it would cause them harm.\u201d Johnson may have just months to live, according to his doctors. His wife testified that she has had to work two jobs, sometimes with 14-hour days, to help pay for the medical bills. The financial award included past and future economic losses and punitive damages. Another Roundup cancer trial is scheduled to begin in the fall in St Louis, Missouri. According to Johnson\u2019s lawyers, Monsanto is facing more than 4,000 similar cases across the US. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was a verdict heard around the world. In a stunning blow to one of the world\u2019s largest seed and chemical companies, jurors in San Francisco have told Monsanto it must pay $289m in damages to a man dying of cancer which he claims was caused by exposure to its herbicides. Monsanto, which became a unit of Bayer AG in June, has spent decades convincing consumers, farmers, politicians and regulators to ignore mounting evidence linking its glyphosate-based herbicides to cancer and other health problems. The company has employed a range of tactics \u2013 some drawn from the same playbook used by the tobacco industry in defending the safety of cigarettes \u2013 to suppress and manipulate scientific literature, harass journalists and scientists who did not parrot the company\u2019s propaganda, and arm-twist and collude with regulators. Indeed, one of Monsanto\u2019s lead defense attorneys in the San Francisco case was George Lombardi, whose resum\u00e9 boasts of his work defending big tobacco. Now, in this one case, through the suffering of one man, Monsanto\u2019s secretive strategies have been laid bare for the world to see. Monsanto was undone by the words of its own scientists, the damning truth illuminated through the company\u2019s emails, internal strategy reports and other communications. The jury\u2019s verdict found not only that Monsanto\u2019s Roundup and related glyphosate-based brands presented a substantial danger to people using them, but that there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that Monsanto\u2019s officials acted with \u201cmalice or oppression\u201d in failing to adequately warn of the risks. Testimony and evidence presented at trial showed that the warning signs seen in scientific research dated back to the early 1980s and have only increased over the decades. But with each new study showing harm, Monsanto worked not to warn users or redesign its products, but to create its own science to show they were safe. The company often pushed its version of science into the public realm through ghostwritten work that was designed to appear independent and thus more credible. Evidence was also presented to jurors showing how closely the company had worked with Environmental Protection Agency officials to promote the safety message and suppress evidence of harm. \u201cThe jury paid attention throughout this long trial and clearly understood the science and also understood Monsanto\u2019s role in trying to hide the truth,\u201d said Aimee Wagstaff, one of several attorneys around the US who are representing other plaintiffs making similar claims to Dewayne Johnson. This case and the verdict specifically concern the 46-year-old father who developed a severe and fatal form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma while working as a school groundskeeper, repeatedly spraying large quantities of Monsanto\u2019s Roundup and other glyphosate herbicide brands. Doctors have said he probably does not have long to live. The ramifications, however, are much broader and have global implications. Another trial is set to take place in October in St Louis and roughly 4,000 plaintiffs have claims pending with the potential outcomes resulting in many more hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in damage awards. They all allege not only that their cancers were caused by exposure to Monsanto\u2019s herbicides, but that Monsanto has long known about, and covered up, the dangers. The team of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys leading the litigation say they so far have brought to light only a fraction of evidence collected from Monsanto\u2019s internal files and plan to reveal much more in future trials. Monsanto maintains it has done nothing wrong, and that the evidence has been misrepresented. Its attorneys say they have the bulk of scientific research firmly on their side, and that they will appeal against the verdict, meaning it could be years before Johnson and his family see a dime of the damage award. In the meantime, his wife, Araceli, works two jobs to support the couple and their two young sons as Johnson prepares for another round of chemotherapy. But as this case and others drag on, one thing is clear: this is not just about one man dying of cancer. Glyphosate-based herbicides are so widely used around the globe (roughly 826 million kg a year) that residues are commonly found in food and water supplies, and in soil and air samples. US scientists have even recorded the weed killer residues in rainfall. Exposure is ubiquitous, virtually inescapable. Acknowledgement of risk is essential to public protection. Regulators, however, have failed to heed the warnings of independent scientists for too long, even shrugging off the findings of the World Health Organization\u2019s top cancer scientists who classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Now, well past time, long-held corporate secrets have been exposed. In his closing argument, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Brent Wisner, told the jury it was time for Monsanto to be held accountable. This trial, he said, was the company\u2019s \u201cday of reckoning\u201d.

The company has employed a range of tactics \u2013 some drawn from the same playbook used by the tobacco industry in defending the safety of cigarettes \u2013 to suppress and manipulate scientific literature, harass journalists and scientists who did not parrot the company\u2019s propaganda, and arm-twist and collude with regulators. Indeed, one of Monsanto\u2019s lead defense attorneys in the San Francisco case was <a href=\"https://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/attorneys/lombardi-george-c.html\">George Lombardi</a>, whose resum\u00e9 boasts of his work defending big tobacco.<br></p> <p>Now, in this one case, through the suffering of one man, Monsanto\u2019s secretive strategies have been laid bare for the world to see. Monsanto was undone by the words of its own scientists, the damning truth illuminated through the company\u2019s emails, internal strategy reports and other communications.<br></p> <p>The jury\u2019s verdict found not only that Monsanto\u2019s Roundup and related glyphosate-based brands presented a substantial danger to people using them, but that there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that Monsanto\u2019s officials acted with \u201cmalice or oppression\u201d in failing to adequately warn of the risks.<br></p> <p>Testimony and evidence presented at trial showed that the warning signs seen in scientific research dated back <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/of-mice-monsanto-and-a-mysterious-tumor_us_5939717fe4b014ae8c69de40\">to the early 1980s</a> and have only increased over the decades. But with each new study showing harm, Monsanto worked not to warn users or redesign its products, but to create its own science to show they were safe. The company often pushed its version of science into the public realm through <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/monsanto-was-its-own-ghostwriter-for-some-safety-reviews\">ghostwritten work</a> that was designed to appear independent and thus more credible. Evidence was also presented to jurors showing how closely the company had worked with Environmental Protection Agency officials to promote the safety message and suppress evidence of harm.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe jury paid attention throughout this long trial and clearly understood the science and also understood Monsanto\u2019s role in trying to hide the truth,\u201d said Aimee Wagstaff, one of several attorneys around the US who are representing other plaintiffs making similar claims to Dewayne Johnson.</p> <p>This case and the verdict specifically concern the 46-year-old father who developed a severe and fatal form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma while working as a school groundskeeper, repeatedly spraying large quantities of Monsanto\u2019s Roundup and other glyphosate herbicide brands. Doctors have said he probably does not have long to live.<br></p> <p>The ramifications, however, are much broader and have global implications. Another trial is set to take place in October in St Louis and <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/pesticides/mdl-monsanto-glyphosate-cancer-case-key-documents-analysis/\">roughly 4,000 </a><a href=\"https://usrtk.org/pesticides/mdl-monsanto-glyphosate-cancer-case-key-documents-analysis/\">plaintiffs</a> have claims pending with the potential outcomes resulting in many more hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in damage awards. They all allege not only that their cancers were caused by exposure to Monsanto\u2019s herbicides, but that Monsanto has long known about, and covered up, the dangers. The team of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys leading the litigation say they so far have brought to light only a fraction of evidence collected from Monsanto\u2019s internal files and plan to reveal much more in future trials.<br></p> <p>Monsanto <a href=\"https://monsanto.com/news-stories/statements/statement-scott-partridge-vice-president-monsanto/\">maintains it has done nothing wrong</a>, and that the evidence has been misrepresented. Its attorneys say they have the bulk of scientific research firmly on their side, and that they will appeal against the verdict, meaning it could be years before Johnson and his family see a dime of the damage award. In the meantime, his wife, Araceli, works two jobs to support the couple and their two young sons as Johnson prepares for another round of chemotherapy.<br></p> <p>But as this case and others drag on, one thing is clear: this is not just about one man dying of cancer. Glyphosate-based herbicides are so widely used around the globe (<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/567250/glyphosate-use-worldwide/\">roughly 826 million kg</a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/567250/glyphosate-use-worldwide/\"> a year)</a> that residues are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/30/fda-weedkiller-glyphosate-in-food-internal-emails\">commonly found in food</a> and water supplies, and in soil and air samples. US scientists have even recorded the <a href=\"https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp-ID=2909.html\">weed killer residues in rainfall</a>. Exposure is ubiquitous, virtually inescapable.<br></p> <p>Acknowledgement of risk is essential to public protection. Regulators, however, have failed to heed the warnings of independent scientists for too long, even shrugging off the findings of the <a href=\"https://monographs.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mono112-10.pdf\">World Health Organization\u2019s</a> top cancer scientists who classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen.<br></p> <p>Now, well past time, long-held corporate secrets have been exposed.</p> <p>In his closing argument, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Brent Wisner, told the jury it was time for Monsanto to be held accountable. This trial, he said, was the company\u2019s \u201cday of reckoning\u201d.<br></p> <p><em>Carey Gillam is a <a href=\"http://careygillam.com/\">journalist and author</a>, and a public interest researcher for <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/\">US Right to Know</a>, a not-for-profit food industry research group.

      "bodyText": "The House of Fraser department store on Guildford High Street was popular on Friday afternoon. As the summer rain beat down outside, customers streamed in through its doors to seek shelter, meet friends and family or kill time browsing the shelves and rails. Earlier in the day, it was announced that Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by Mike Ashley, had bought the struggling retailer in a \u00a390m rescue deal. For customers in Guildford who had heard the news, the biggest concerns were whether the retailer would retain its upmarket reputation as well as its 17,000 staff. A two-minute walk away in Debenhams, the only other department store on Guildford High Street in Surrey, Sports Direct has already taken over the top floor. It has built up a 29.7% stake in Debenhams over several years. \u201cIt could be interesting days, to see what happens with the man who buys it,\u201d said Cyril Clark, 66. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day to see House of Fraser in the state it\u2019s in, it\u2019s a good store to come to. It\u2019s a very different brand to Sports Direct, and my concern is Mike Ashley will bring Sports Direct into places like this.\u201d Clark\u2019s wife, Julia, 61, added: \u201cIt depends what he\u2019s going to do with the brand, whether he\u2019ll keep it as an upmarket store or changes it. \u201cYou need the right people working for you in order to create the right environment. If Ashley is not nice to his staff he won\u2019t attract the right staff. And if you have less discerning staff, with less experience, customers might be told incorrect information. You\u2019d expect a store in this place in the market to give a certain level of customer service.\u201d Jonathan Lee, 63, echoed this sentiment: \u201cMy immediate thoughts would be if there are redundancies and if people will be asked to take lower pay. \u201cBut maybe they can make the brand of House of Fraser continue, and I suppose this situation is the best you can hope for for any of this.\u201d The company\u2019s collapse represents a wider trend whereby high street retailers battle to survive in today\u2019s tough market, saturated by a combination of people shopping more online and wary consumers who have tightened their purse strings. Friends Sylvie Roberts, 75, and Linda Coleman, 72, who were having a catch-up in the store, said they were delighted that House of Fraser was being saved. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent all day feeling very sad about the business. I think they have to do whatever they need to do to keep people employed, there\u2019s no other choice. We\u2019ve been shopping here for the past 50 years, buying presents and whatever. They cover everything really and the staff are lovely.\u201d Another shopper, Julie, who declined to give her surname, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame because I can\u2019t remember it not being here. I would be slightly horrified if this place became a Sports Direct. Is Guildford the right place for this? I\u2019ve been a customer for 30 years, I meet friends here for coffee and have a browse. It has all your essentials.\u201d Meanwhile, social media users adopted a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the news. \u201cGet yourself down to House of Fraser, they\u2019re about to start doing Slazenger umbrellas and Donnay socks at half price,\u201d said @MrPaulRobinson on twitter. \u201cHouse of Fraser to be renamed House of Lonsdale as it is flooded with 90% off sweatshirts,\u201d said @vilage_idoit. \u201cJust wait for those glorious House of Fraser giant mugs with every purchase,\u201d said @NickJonHughes.",
