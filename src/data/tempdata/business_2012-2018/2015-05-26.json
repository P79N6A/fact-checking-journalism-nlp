    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK consumers are at their most upbeat for nine years on the back of improving job prospects and low inflation, according to the latest report to suggest spending power is recovering. Consumer confidence rose for the fifth successive quarter in the opening months of this year to hit its highest level since the pre-crisis days of 2006, according to market research company Nielsen. The proportion of people feeling now was a good time to spend was also up; at 45%, it was the highest since comparable records began in late 2006. \u201cConsumer confidence in the UK continues to rise. The UK is one of the fastest growing major economies, unemployment is falling and people are benefiting from zero inflation and lower prices in supermarkets and petrol stations,\u201d said Nielsen UK managing director Steve Smith. Against the backdrop of falling unemployment and a modest pick up in wage growth, the survey of more than 500 people in the UK found the proportion feeling positive about their job prospects increased for the eighth consecutive quarter to 45% \u2013 the highest level for more than seven years. Although the UK exited recession in 2009 and recorded the strongest economic growth among advanced economies last year, more than half of those surveyed believed the UK was still in a recession in the first quarter of 2015. But at 51%, the proportion was the lowest since the question first appeared in the survey, seven years ago. The generally upbeat tone of the survey echoes a separate report from business group CBI suggesting British retailers enjoyed a jump in sales this month and were at their most optimistic for 27 years about future trading. The CBI\u2019s snapshot of the high street in May signalled that sales volumes grew faster than City analysts and retailers themselves had been expecting in May. Its survey of 134 companies in retail, wholesale and motor trading showed a net balance of 51% said sales volumes were up on a year ago. That was the highest reading since December and up sharply from a balance of 12% in April and beat expectations for a reading of 17% in a Reuters poll of economists. Asked about their expectations for June, a net balance of 58% expected sales volumes to grow again, the strongest reading since September 1988 and well above 40% in last month\u2019s survey. The CBI\u2019s director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, highlighted the slowing pace of inflation, which fell below zero in April: Retailers will be encouraged to see growth in sales and orders on the high street bounding ahead. Low inflation, which we expect to remain below 1% for the rest of the year, has given household incomes a much-needed boost and greater spending power. Economists said it appeared for now that the UK was experiencing \u201cgood\u201d deflation that was boosting spending, rather than prompting people to put off purchases in the hope of lower prices in the future. The boost to household finances from low inflation is also flagged up on Wednesday by supermarket Asda, which found the average UK household had \u00a3187 for discretionary spending in April 2015, an extra \u00a317 a week compared with a year earlier. Its income tracker showed air fares were a big factor, down 5.3% on the year. and that the typical basket of food and non-alcoholic drink was 2.8% cheaper.",

      "bodyText": "A Queensland Indigenous group has escalated its battle to halt Australia\u2019s largest mine by launching a federal court case, while members of the group are travelling to the US and Europe to urge banks to not fund the project. The Wangan and Jagalingou people, which have a native title claim over 30,000 sq km of central Queensland, have lodged a legal bid to overturn a decision that clears the way for the $16.5bn Carmichael mine, overseen by Indian mining firm Adani. Court documents allege that Adani \u201cgrossly overestimated\u201d the economic benefits of the mine to the national native title tribunal, which decided the mine was in the public interest in June. Adani used the tribunal process after the Wangan and Jagalingou people rejected the mine last year. Representatives from the Wangan and Jagalingou families claim the tribunal did not consider their submissions, instead relying upon the word of Adani and two clan members, who are native title applicants and are in favour of the mine. The court documents allege Adani acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d by telling the tribunal that the Queensland economy would benefit by $4.17bn and gain 6,789 full time jobs through the Carmichael mine. The Wangan and Jagalingou claim states the true outcome would be a $1.87bn economic boost and 1,206 extra jobs. A separate court case against the mine saw a consultant employed by Adani give seemingly different figures from the company on the project\u2019s economic benefits. Adani denies any discrepancy. Separately, five representatives from the tribe will travel to the US and then Europe on Sunday to lobby banks not to fund the Carmichael project. A total of 11 international banks have ruled out funding the project and associated port infrastructure that sits beside the Great Barrier Reef. The Wangan and Jagalingou group will lobby banks including the Bank of America and Standard Chartered, which is advising Adani. The group will also meet with Indigenous people who oppose the tar sands developments in Canada. \u201cWe\u2019ll argue that the tribunal erred in making that decision and it should be overturned,\u201d said a spokesman for the Wangan and Jagalingou family council. \u201cThe native title system isn\u2019t what people think it is. There\u2019s inherent bias in the system where companies know if they get a \u201cno\u201d they can go to the tribunal and are virtually guaranteed to get their mining lease. Hopefully this case will ventilate the issues around free prior and informed consent and the native title system.\u201d The Wangan and Jagalingou family council, which represents 12 families that make up the claim group, fear the Carmichael mine would cause huge environmental damage to their ancestral lands. The vast mine complex, set to launch in 2017, would extract a maximum of 60m tonnes of coal a year and transport it via a new rail line to an expanded Abbot Point port for export. The mine will require 12.5 billion litres of water a year from local sources. Adani has maintained that the mine will deliver substantial economic benefits to Queensland and will be bound by a raft of rigorous federal environmental conditions. The company has said the Wangan and Jagalingou people will \u201cbenefit directly\u201d from the mine and that it will continue to deal with the two native title applicants. The third native title applicant, musician Adrian Burragubba, is staunchly opposed to the mine but was not considered representative of the group by the native title tribunal. The Wangan and Jagalingou family council, which Burragubba heads, will hold a vote in June over whether to replace the two pro-mine applicants with a new 12-member native title group. \u201cThe native title system isn\u2019t representing Aboriginal people as it should, it\u2019s designed for us to fail,\u201d said Murrawah Johnson, a 20-year-old member of the Wangan and Jagalingou group. \u201cWe decided to take other avenues to protect the land we have left and our sacred sites. Adani don\u2019t have the money to build the mine so our best chance is to talk to the banks. We want to fight Adani in every possible way. \u201cFor some reason there\u2019s this idea that Aboriginal people have to think and act in the same way, while other groups can have diverse views. We have to remember that the Wangan and Jagalingou people rejected a land use agreement, we don\u2019t want them destroying our country.\u201d Johnson said she was also concerned by the greenhouse gas emissions that would be emitted from the mine and from its coal once it is burned overseas. An Adani spokesman said the company is confident the national native tribunal (NNTT) decision would be upheld. \u201cThe NNTT variously held that authorised representatives of the W&amp;J are working with the company, the submissions of groups purporting to represent the whole group were not relevant, that the mine and other Adani projects would deliver substantial intergenerational economic benefits to the W&amp;J, and that there are sound and effective cultural heritage management plans for the site long since in place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that NGOs who have deductible gift recipient status narrowly with respect to their environmental activities have admitted to channeling funds to run a divisive campaign within the W&amp;J group.\u201d The Wangan and Jagalingou cause is being funded by donations from a selection of groups. Left-leaning activist group GetUp, anti-mining group the Sunrise Project and entrepreneur Graeme Wood have all provided support to the Indigenous clan.",

Representatives from the Wangan and Jagalingou families claim the tribunal did not consider their submissions, instead relying upon the word of Adani and two clan members, who are native title applicants and are in favour of the mine. </p> <p>The court documents allege Adani acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d by telling the tribunal that the Queensland economy would benefit by $4.17bn and gain 6,789 full time jobs through the Carmichael mine. </p> <p>The Wangan and Jagalingou claim states the true outcome would be a $1.87bn economic boost and 1,206 extra jobs. A separate court case against the mine saw a consultant employed by Adani give seemingly different figures from the company on the project\u2019s economic benefits. Adani <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/04/adani-denies-executive-admitted-exaggerating-mine-job-creation-figures\">denies any discrepancy</a>. </p> <p>Separately, five representatives from the tribe will travel to the US and then Europe on Sunday to lobby banks not to fund the Carmichael project.</p> <p>A total of 11 international banks have ruled out funding the project and associated port infrastructure that sits beside the Great Barrier Reef. The Wangan and Jagalingou group will lobby banks including the Bank of America and Standard Chartered, which is advising Adani. The group will also meet with Indigenous people <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/may/09/canadians-living-along-route-tar-longest-sands-pipeline-pictures\">who oppose the tar sands developments in Canada</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll argue that the tribunal erred in making that decision and it should be overturned,\u201d said a spokesman for the Wangan and Jagalingou family council.</p> <p>\u201cThe native title system isn\u2019t what people think it is. There\u2019s inherent bias in the system where companies know if they get a \u201cno\u201d they can go to the tribunal and are virtually guaranteed to get their mining lease. Hopefully this case will ventilate the issues around free prior and informed consent and the native title system.\u201d</p> <p>The Wangan and Jagalingou family council, which represents 12 families that make up the claim group, fear the Carmichael mine would cause huge environmental damage to their ancestral lands.</p> <p>The vast mine complex, set to launch in 2017, would extract a maximum of 60m tonnes of coal a year and transport it via a new rail line to an expanded Abbot Point port for export. The mine will require 12.5 billion litres of water a year from local sources.</p> <p>Adani has maintained that the mine will deliver substantial economic benefits to Queensland and will be bound by a raft of rigorous federal environmental conditions. The company has said the Wangan and Jagalingou people will \u201cbenefit directly\u201d from the mine and that it will continue to deal with the two native title applicants.</p> <p>The third native title applicant, musician Adrian Burragubba, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/may/15/carbon-bomb-australia-the-new-coal-frontier\">is staunchly opposed to the mine</a> but was not considered representative of the group by the native title tribunal. The Wangan and Jagalingou family council, which Burragubba heads, will hold a vote in June over whether to replace the two pro-mine applicants with a new 12-member native title group.</p> <p>\u201cThe native title system isn\u2019t representing Aboriginal people as it should, it\u2019s designed for us to fail,\u201d said Murrawah Johnson, a 20-year-old member of the Wangan and Jagalingou group. </p> <p>\u201cWe decided to take other avenues to protect the land we have left and our sacred sites. Adani don\u2019t have the money to build the mine so our best chance is to talk to the banks. We want to fight Adani in every possible way.</p> <p>\u201cFor some reason there\u2019s this idea that Aboriginal people have to think and act in the same way, while other groups can have diverse views. We have to remember that the Wangan and Jagalingou people rejected a land use agreement, we don\u2019t want them destroying our country.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson said she was also concerned by the greenhouse gas emissions that would be emitted from the mine and from its coal once it is burned overseas.</p> <p>An Adani spokesman said the company is confident the national native tribunal (NNTT) decision would be upheld.</p> <p>\u201cThe NNTT variously held that authorised representatives of the W&amp;J are working with the company, the submissions of groups purporting to represent the whole group were not relevant, that the mine and other Adani projects would deliver substantial intergenerational economic benefits to the W&amp;J, and that there are sound and effective cultural heritage management plans for the site long since in place,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unfortunate that NGOs who have deductible gift recipient status narrowly with respect to their environmental activities have admitted to channeling funds to run a divisive campaign within the W&amp;J group.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Wangan and Jagalingou cause is being funded by donations from a selection of groups. Left-leaning activist group GetUp, anti-mining group the <a href=\"http://www.sunriseproject.org.au\">Sunrise Project</a> and entrepreneur Graeme Wood have all provided support to the Indigenous clan.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of British Airways is set to take over Aer Lingus in a deal that values the Dublin-based flag carrier at \u20ac1.4bn after the Irish government agreed to sell its stake to International Airlines Group. Paschal Donohue, Ireland\u2019s transport minister, confirmed that the sale of the former Irish state carrier to IAG can now go ahead. The Dublin government owns 25% of the airline but its agreement, after six months of consideration, was critical for the deal to progress. Following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, Donohue said: \u201cIAG has provided additional information and certain commitments in relation to its proposal. Following detailed consideration of this and all of the issues surrounding a potential disposal of the state\u2019s shareholding in Aer Lingus, the government has decided that it will support IAG\u2019s proposal.\u201d IAG has further extended guarantees about routes to Ireland from Heathrow, from five to seven years, although they remain some way short of the decade-long commitment Dublin had sought. The guarantees also are dependent on airport charges being limited to inflation. Donohue added: \u201cThis proposed offer has been the subject of very detailed discussions and negotiations with IAG since the board of Aer Lingus indicated on 27 January that it was prepared to recommend the offer. The government has secured important guarantees in respect of Ireland\u2019s future connectivity, particularly to London Heathrow, and on the maintenance of Aer Lingus\u2019 iconic brand and of its head office in Ireland. \u201cIAG has set out ambitious growth plans for the company and the government is confident that supporting IAG\u2019s offer for Aer Lingus is the best way of securing Aer Lingus\u2019 future in an increasingly-competitive global airline market and of enhancing Ireland\u2019s connectivity with the rest of the world and our potential for growth and development into the future.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, Aer Lingus chief executive officer Stephen Kavanagh wrote to the minister with some assurances over protecting existing Irish jobs at the airline in the event of the takeover. Kavanagh and the Aer Lingus board had backed IAG\u2019s plans once it took control of the carrier. Kavanagh told the minister that \u201cthe airline\u2019s preference is to continue to use Irish crew bases \u2013 provided it continues to be as competitive and efficient as at present \u2013 and to only restructure its business when required.\u201d Later on Tuesday evening, an IAG spokesman confirmed that the takeover was going ahead. A spokesman for Ryanair, which owns 29% of the shares \u2013 but has been told by competition authorities that it must sell down its stake after its own takeover bids were blocked \u2013 said the its position remained unchanged. \u201cThe board of Ryanair has not received an offer and will consider any offer on its merits, if and when an offer is made.\u201d The sale of the Irish state\u2019s 25% share in Aer Lingus has been opposed by the two main opposition parties \u2013 Fianna F\u00e1il and Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 along with a host of leftwing deputies in the D\u00e1il. Reports in the Irish media earlier on Tuesday suggested that IAG gave the Fine Gael-Labour coalition commitments about routes, regional airports and jobs in its takeover bid. The commitments also include the continued use of Cork and Shannon airports for routes principally to the UK. There were further claims that IAG had promised to introduce four new transatlantic routes from Ireland creating a further 635 jobs by 2020. SIPTU, the largest trade union at Aer Lingus, had, alongside the Labour party, sought these concessions if it was going to accept the takeover deal. The 24 landing slots Aer Lingus controls at Heathrow are among the most lucrative for Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, to capture in the takeover with the Dublin-to-London route the busiest intercity air connection in Europe. The Dublin route is highly profitable, with a projected 28 million passengers expected to pass through Ireland\u2019s premier airport by 2022. The takeover would see Walsh again at the helm of the airline where he made his name as chief executive \u2013 and started his aviation career as a pilot. He has championed consolidation in the European airline market, and created IAG with the union of British Airways and Iberia in 2011 \u2013 with the latter finally turning a profit on the back of a savage cost-cutting and redundancy regime this year. Walsh has since added Vueling, a Spanish low-cost carrier, to the group.",

      "bodyText": "Greece could secure vital weeks to negotiate a rescue deal with its creditors if Athens is able to delay repayments worth \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as critical deadlines approach. The proposal to combine four IMF repayments due in June and delay payment until the end of the month would win more time for vital debt talks that resumed on Tuesday. Greece must repay \u20ac300m on 5 June, the first of four instalments due next month . The IMF, its biggest creditor after the European Union, often waits a month before receiving funds from debtor countries. A senior eurozone official close to the talks with Athens told Reuters: \u201cThere is the possibility of putting together several payments that Greece would need to make to the IMF in the course of June and then just make one payment.\u201d The news agency said a second official close to the talks also acknowledged that a payment delay was a possibility. The first official said: \u201cThat\u2019s basically a technical treasury exercise and they could tell the IMF that this is how they want to do it and the IMF would probably have to be OK with that.\u201d Shut out of international markets, Athens has conceded that it will miss the 5 June payment without new loans from the EU, which is demanding reforms that will make the country\u2019s debt sustainable. Last week, the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, a longstanding ally of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said the country needed to strike a deal with its European partners within the next couple of weeks or it would default on its IMF repayments. In remarks that heightened the possibility of a default, he said: \u201cThis money will not be given and is not there to be given.\u201d The finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, insisted again that a deal is imminent without giving details of the concessions which may form part of it. It is understood that Tsipras has taken full control of the negotiation process, sidelining Varoufakis and his ministry, which failed to reach an agreement with eurozone ministers in the past four months of talks over a new financing deal. Tsipras wants the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank to agree the release of a blocked final \u20ac7.2bn tranche of bailout funds without imposing tough reforms and spending cuts agreed with the previous right-of-centre administration. Under pressure from leftists in his party, the prime minister has also played down fears that Athens will be unable to find about \u20ac1bn to pay public sector wages and fund welfare payments in the first week of June. Some senior figures at the European commission and the IMF have urged greater flexibility from creditors, including a more lenient attitude to payment dates while talks are making progress. While a missed payment to the IMF would not constitute a default, it could trigger a negative market reaction, officials said. \u201cUnless there is some perspective how they would deal with this full payment, it would be a risky thing for the Greeks to do. And the consequences would be unpredictable,\u201d said the first official. Earlier this week, a Greek government spokesman dismissed the possibility of combining the IMF repayments.",

The IMF, its biggest creditor after the European Union, often waits a month before receiving funds from debtor countries.</p> <p>A senior eurozone official close to the talks with Athens told Reuters: \u201cThere is the possibility of putting together several payments that Greece would need to make to the IMF in the course of June and then just make one payment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The news agency said a second official close to the talks also acknowledged that a payment delay was a possibility.</p> <p>The first official said: \u201cThat\u2019s basically a technical treasury exercise and they could tell the IMF that this is how they want to do it and the IMF would probably have to be OK with that.\u201d</p> <p>Shut out of international markets, Athens has conceded that it will miss the 5 June payment without new loans from the EU, which is demanding reforms that will make the country\u2019s debt sustainable.</p> <p>Last week, the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, a longstanding ally of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said the country needed to strike a deal with its European partners within the next couple of weeks or it would default on its IMF repayments.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/24/greek-minister-athens-cannot-make-imf-debt-repayments\">In remarks that heightened the possibility of a default</a>, he said: \u201cThis money will not be given and is not there to be given.\u201d </p> <p>The finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, insisted again that a deal is imminent without giving details of the concessions which may form part of it.</p> <p>It is understood that Tsipras has taken full control of the negotiation process, sidelining Varoufakis and his ministry, which failed to reach an agreement with eurozone ministers in the past four months of talks over a new financing deal.</p> <p>Tsipras wants the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank to agree the release of a blocked final \u20ac7.2bn tranche of bailout funds without imposing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/25/what-if-greece-cant-pay-debts-to-eu-imf-eurozone-crisis\">tough reforms and spending cuts agreed with the previous right-of-centre administration</a>.</p> <p>Under pressure from leftists in his party, the prime minister has also played down fears that Athens will be unable to find about \u20ac1bn to pay public sector wages and fund welfare payments in the first week of June.</p> <p>Some senior figures at the European commission and the IMF have urged greater flexibility from creditors, including a more lenient attitude to payment dates while talks are making progress.</p> <p>While a missed payment to the IMF would not constitute a default, it could trigger a negative market reaction, officials said. </p> <p>\u201cUnless there is some perspective how they would deal with this full payment, it would be a risky thing for the Greeks to do. And the consequences would be unpredictable,\u201d said the first official. </p> <p>Earlier this week, a Greek government spokesman dismissed the possibility of combining the IMF repayments.</p>",

      "bodyText": "France\u2019s state-controlled energy giant EDF faces a showdown with trade unions in an attempt to tackle pay and privileges for senior staff, as the government gears up for a clash over the 35-hour week. The electricity company, which is also a major player in the UK energy market, is attempting to buy staff out of a deal, dating back to 1946, that allows some 30,000 executives and managers to work 32 hours a week or around 196 days a year. The move comes as health chiefs consider a controversial plan to reform the maximum 35-hour working week, one of the pillars of French socialism, in the country\u2019s hospitals. The proposal has brought thousands of medical workers on to the streets and follows an intervention last August by the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, who said companies should be given more flexibility over working time. The EDF talks follow a report by the state auditors, the Cour des Comptes, which declared that salaries at EDF had risen rapidly, above inflation and market rates, with little relation to actual performance, and there was an \u201caccumulation of advantages\u201d including low-cost electricity and cheap loans. EDF first mooted changing what the official auditors described as a \u201cvery generous\u201d and \u201cbadly controlled\u201d system enjoyed by more than 40% of its staff five years ago, but gave up on reforms after vehement union opposition. Under current rules, as well as their 27 days paid holiday, staff can enjoy an extra 27-31 days of extra time off, known as \u201crecuperation days\u201d (RTT) and generous bonuses. EDF staff also pay around 16 times less than ordinary customers for their electricity at a cost of \u20ac381m to the company in 2010. \u201cThe advantage is without limit no matter what electric equipment the employee has (including heated swimming pools, for example),\u201d reads the report. In 2011, when EDF tried to revise the cheap electricity tariff, unchanged since 1951, staff went on strike and the company backed down. Other benefits described as \u201cexorbitant for the public purse\u201d included free shares in the company, extra pay depending on the number of children, bonuses for marriages and births, subsidised house and financial assistance with school and university fees for children up to the age of 27 years. The Cour des Comptes found that \u201cdespite the crisis\u201d salaries at EDF had increased more rapidly between 2005 and 2011 than in the rest of the economy.",

During the quarter it opened two new Cinewords in the UK at Swindon and Broughton and one Picturehouse in East Dulwich. It expects to open another eight cinemas in the UK and eight in Europe and Israel.</p> <p>All in all, Cineword said it expected its full year would be in line with market expectations, helping to push its shares 11.5p higher to 512.5. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cineworld\u2019s first quarter statement revealed that it has enjoyed a great start to the year... The combination of a good film slate and soft comparatives bode well for the rest of the year.</p> <p>Second quarter comparatives are particularly soft due to the World Cup last year. As importantly, the new build programme is on track with four cinemas opened in the period with another 16 contracted for the remainder of the year. We leave our forecasts unchanged and retain our buy recommendation and 540p target price. </p> </blockquote> <p>Nick Batram at Peel Hunt was also positive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>2015 has had a strong start to the year, with the group making full use of the film slate flowing down from the box office through to retail and other income.

      "bodyText": "Avengers: Age of Ultron and Fifty Shades of Grey have boosted business at Cineworld so far this year, and the group has high hopes for the rest of 2015 with Jurassic World, the final Hunger Games outing and the James Bond film Spectre all due out. Cineword\u2019s first quarter update showed total revenues up 26.8%, including a contribution from Cinema City which was taken over in February 2014. UK box office revenues rose 7.9%, slightly lower than overall admissions because - analysts say - of its broader breadth of films rather than merely blockbusters. During the quarter it opened two new Cinewords in the UK at Swindon and Broughton and one Picturehouse in East Dulwich. It expects to open another eight cinemas in the UK and eight in Europe and Israel. All in all, Cineword said it expected its full year would be in line with market expectations, helping to push its shares 11.5p higher to 512.5. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said: Cineworld\u2019s first quarter statement revealed that it has enjoyed a great start to the year... The combination of a good film slate and soft comparatives bode well for the rest of the year. Second quarter comparatives are particularly soft due to the World Cup last year. As importantly, the new build programme is on track with four cinemas opened in the period with another 16 contracted for the remainder of the year. We leave our forecasts unchanged and retain our buy recommendation and 540p target price. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt was also positive: 2015 has had a strong start to the year, with the group making full use of the film slate flowing down from the box office through to retail and other income. The group is trading strongly, and while it may be too soon to change forecasts materially, we believe the business has a strong foundation from the integration of Cinema City and cost-cutting deliver full year numbers ahead of current expectations. At Numis, analyst Douglas Jack said: UK box office increased by 7.9% over the first 19 weeks of which almost all was like- for-like. We believe approximately one-third of this growth was admissions, with two-thirds price. Average spend was boosted by the mix benefit of stronger weekend and adult custom (driven by the adult-orientated Fifty Shades of Grey and the Avengers outperforming). As expected, Cineworld is now under-performing the market in relation to admissions, due to its broader film range acting as a disadvantage in a year with numerous potential blockbusters. We are holding our 2015 forecasts (pretax profit of \u00a390.0m; consensus \u00a390.5m) even though the company is trading ahead of our forecast of 7% growth in like for like box office for the UK and 3% for mainland Europe/Israel.

    "webTitle": "Ryanair profits soar 66% as charm offensive reaps rewards", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s annual profit jumped by two-thirds as low fuel prices drove down costs, with passenger numbers growing on the back of lower fares and a successful campaign to transform the Irish airline\u2019s brutal image of old. The low-cost carrier more than tripled its target for additional passengers as net profit for the year to the end of March increased 66% to \u20ac867m (\u00a3613m). The airline said it expected profits to near \u20ac1bn after tax next year. Passenger numbers rose 11% to 90.6 million, outstripping a targeted increase of 4%. Ryanair predicted it would this year become the first European airline to serve more than 100 million passengers in a year. Lower fuel costs played a big part in the profit increase. While costs remained stable, the impact of lower oil prices drove the airline\u2019s overall costs down by 5%. Ryanair has flown with ever fuller planes, with almost a third fewer empty seats last year. The Irish airline expects to fly its planes even nearer full capacity through 2015-16, despite an ongoing expansion with continued deliveries from a massive order of Boeing 737s. The airline added that it will be leasing extra planes in the summer to meet demand. Chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said fares would drop further, by an average 2-4%, next year as Ryanair pushed for passenger numbers. He said the airline\u2019s policy was to \u201calways hit the passenger target, whatever the fare\u201d. Sorahan said the airline expected to grow across Europe but particularly in Germany, where rivals had cut back some of their schedules. Ryanair launched its \u201calways getting better\u201d strategy in late 2013 to improve services after customers tired of its punitive charges and inflexible policies. Improvements have included reduced fees, more carry-on baggage and allocated seating. It has also sought to woo business passengers. The second year of a three-year programme will see Ryanair make further changes, including lower charges for transporting skis and bikes, and introducing a live price comparison feature showing if tickets are available cheaper on other airlines. The airline is set to axe its peculiar on-time arrival bugle from all services from September. The move to stop \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d, in the words of chief executive Michael O\u2019 Leary, coincided with two profit warnings in late 2013. Ryanair admitted it had failed to keep up with the expectations of consumers who turned to its more passenger-friendly rival, easyJet. O\u2019Leary, said: \u201cThis 66% increase in net profit demonstrates the enduring strength of Ryanair\u2019s lowest fare/lowest cost model which has been transformed by the success of our \u2018always getting better\u2019 (AGB) customer experience programme. AGB has attracted millions of new customers to Ryanair.\u201d Ryanair shares rose 5.4% to close at a fresh record high of \u20ac11.47. EasyJet\u2019s shares plunged earlier this month when it warned alongside first-half results that disruption at French airports and currency movements would dent full-year profits. Sorahan said that their outlook was \u201ccautious\u201d for 2016 but still forecast a further 10% leap in profits to up to \u20ac970m - as the impact of lower oil prices continues to keep costs down. Its forecast takes into account an expected fare war next winter when it says: \u201cIt would be foolish not to expect some irrational pricing response from competitors who cannot compete with our lowest costs\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Ryanair\u2019s annual profit jumped by two-thirds as low fuel prices drove down costs, with passenger numbers growing on the back of lower fares and a successful campaign to transform the Irish airline\u2019s brutal image of old.</p> <p>The low-cost carrier more than tripled its target for additional passengers as net profit for the year to the end of March increased 66% to \u20ac867m (\u00a3613m). The airline said it expected profits to near \u20ac1bn after tax next year. </p> <p>Passenger numbers rose 11% to 90.6 million, outstripping a targeted increase of 4%. Ryanair predicted it would this year become the first European airline to serve more than 100 million passengers in a year. <br></p> <p>Lower fuel costs played a big part in the profit increase. While costs remained stable, the impact of lower oil prices drove the airline\u2019s overall costs down by 5%. <br></p> <p>Ryanair has flown with ever fuller planes, with almost a third fewer empty seats last year. The Irish airline expects to fly its planes even nearer full capacity through 2015-16, despite an ongoing expansion with continued deliveries from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/08/ryanair-passenger-numbers-boeing-aircraft-deal\">massive order of Boeing 737s</a>. The airline added that it will be leasing extra planes in the summer to meet demand.<br></p> <p>Chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said fares would drop further, by an average 2-4%, next year as Ryanair pushed for passenger numbers. He said the airline\u2019s policy was to \u201calways hit the passenger target, whatever the fare\u201d.<br></p> <p>Sorahan said the airline expected to grow across Europe but particularly in Germany, where rivals had cut back some of their schedules. <br></p> <p>Ryanair launched its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/23/ryanair-richly-rewarded-transformation\">\u201calways getting better\u201d</a> strategy in late 2013 to improve services after customers tired of its punitive charges and inflexible policies. Improvements have included reduced fees, more carry-on baggage and allocated seating. It has also sought to woo business passengers.<br></p> <p>The second year of a three-year programme will see Ryanair make further changes, including lower charges for transporting skis and bikes, and introducing a live price comparison feature showing if tickets are available cheaper on other airlines. The airline is set to axe its peculiar on-time arrival bugle from all services from September. <br></p> <p>The move to stop \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d, in the words of chief executive Michael O\u2019 Leary, coincided <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/04/ryanair-profit-warning-pricing-takeoff\">with two profit warnings</a> in late 2013. Ryanair admitted it had failed to keep up with the expectations of consumers who turned to its more passenger-friendly rival, easyJet.<br></p> <p>O\u2019Leary, said: \u201cThis 66% increase in net profit demonstrates the enduring strength of Ryanair\u2019s lowest fare/lowest cost model which has been transformed by the success of our \u2018always getting better\u2019 (AGB) customer experience programme. AGB has attracted millions of new customers to Ryanair.\u201d</p> <p>Ryanair shares rose 5.4% to close at a fresh record high of \u20ac11.47. EasyJet\u2019s shares <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/12/easyjet-shares-fall-french-strike-profits\">plunged earlier this month</a> when it warned alongside first-half results that disruption at French airports and currency movements would dent full-year profits.</p> <p>Sorahan said that their outlook was \u201ccautious\u201d for 2016 but still forecast a further 10% leap in profits to up to \u20ac970m - as the impact of lower oil prices continues to keep costs down. Its forecast takes into account an expected fare war next winter when it says: \u201cIt would be foolish not to expect some irrational pricing response from competitors who cannot compete with our lowest costs\u201d.</p>",
