    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "WPP chief, who advised David Cameron, says coffee chain's tax structures are accepted practice for multinationals", 
      "body": "<p>One of David Cameron's favourite business leaders, WPP advertising group boss Sir Martin Sorrell, has intervened in the Starbucks tax controversy, suggesting the contributions made by multinational companies to the public purse are \"a question of judgment\".</p> <p>One of Britain's most successful and outspoken businessmen, Sorrell told the BBC that Starbucks \"did not do anything underhand at all.\" He said: \"Lets be quite clear, they did negotiate with HMRC [HM Revenue &amp; Customs] and agreed a royalty and it was perfectly transparent.\"</p> <p>One of the central criticisms levelled at the coffee chain is that taxable earnings were in effect drained from UK operations using a royalty payment made to other parts of the Starbucks group.</p> <p>Sorrell's remarks come three weeks after Google boss Eric Schmidt brushed aside criticisms of the internet company's elaborate corporate structures, which have seen it shift revenues of about $9.8bn (\u00a36bn) into a Bermuda shell company where they are sheltered from tax. \"It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic. I'm not confused about this.\"</p> <p>Sorrell, who until last month sat on the prime minister's business advisory group and, with his wife, has been a guest of the Camerons at Chequers, said the tax structures deployed by Starbucks, far from being exotic, were accepted practice for multinational firms.</p> <p>\"You can have a procurement department in an offshore base; you can have a brand operation in an offshore base. And the criticism of some companies \u2013 Google is an example, Starbucks and Amazon \u2013 have done just that. Companies even based in the UK can do that.\"</p> <p>Asked how the rules should be improved to ensure multinationals delivered a fair contribution to local exchequers, Sorrell said:</p> <p>\"I hate the term 'corporate social responsibility' but all of those contributions you make ... are a question of judgment. There are the rules, if then companies choose just as they chose ... to make a contribution to all the stakeholders on a long-term basis all credit to them.\"</p> <p>Starbucks UK recently hired WPP subsidiary RLM Finsbury, a public relations and political lobbying agency, to help repair the company's image after public outcry at its tax arrangements.</p> <p>The UK business has paid \u00a38.6m of corporation tax on sales of more than \u00a33bn since 1998.</p> <p>This is not the first time Sorrell has spoken out on sensitive tax issues. He was at the vanguard of protests from multinational corporations against previous prime minister's Gordon Brown's attempts to toughen up the rules governing the tax treatment of certain overseas subsidiaries.</p> <p>The clampdown prompted WPP, and a handful of other large groups, to shift its \"principal executive office\" to Dublin, Ireland for tax purposes.

      "bodyText": "One of David Cameron's favourite business leaders, WPP advertising group boss Sir Martin Sorrell, has intervened in the Starbucks tax controversy, suggesting the contributions made by multinational companies to the public purse are \"a question of judgment\". One of Britain's most successful and outspoken businessmen, Sorrell told the BBC that Starbucks \"did not do anything underhand at all.\" He said: \"Lets be quite clear, they did negotiate with HMRC [HM Revenue &amp; Customs] and agreed a royalty and it was perfectly transparent.\" One of the central criticisms levelled at the coffee chain is that taxable earnings were in effect drained from UK operations using a royalty payment made to other parts of the Starbucks group. Sorrell's remarks come three weeks after Google boss Eric Schmidt brushed aside criticisms of the internet company's elaborate corporate structures, which have seen it shift revenues of about $9.8bn (\u00a36bn) into a Bermuda shell company where they are sheltered from tax. \"It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic. I'm not confused about this.\" Sorrell, who until last month sat on the prime minister's business advisory group and, with his wife, has been a guest of the Camerons at Chequers, said the tax structures deployed by Starbucks, far from being exotic, were accepted practice for multinational firms. \"You can have a procurement department in an offshore base; you can have a brand operation in an offshore base. And the criticism of some companies \u2013 Google is an example, Starbucks and Amazon \u2013 have done just that. Companies even based in the UK can do that.\" Asked how the rules should be improved to ensure multinationals delivered a fair contribution to local exchequers, Sorrell said: \"I hate the term 'corporate social responsibility' but all of those contributions you make ... are a question of judgment. There are the rules, if then companies choose just as they chose ... to make a contribution to all the stakeholders on a long-term basis all credit to them.\" Starbucks UK recently hired WPP subsidiary RLM Finsbury, a public relations and political lobbying agency, to help repair the company's image after public outcry at its tax arrangements. The UK business has paid \u00a38.6m of corporation tax on sales of more than \u00a33bn since 1998. This is not the first time Sorrell has spoken out on sensitive tax issues. He was at the vanguard of protests from multinational corporations against previous prime minister's Gordon Brown's attempts to toughen up the rules governing the tax treatment of certain overseas subsidiaries. The clampdown prompted WPP, and a handful of other large groups, to shift its \"principal executive office\" to Dublin, Ireland for tax purposes. Last year, however, WPP announced it was returning this function to the UK after the coalition government abandoned the planned tax changes. One of the longest serving FTSE 100 chief executives, Sorrell has a reputation for speaking out on the most sensitive issues around big business. He regularly defends the widening pay gap between public company executives and the wider workforce in the UK and elsewhere. The WPP boss was at the centre of a pay row this summer when his own remuneration arrangements prompted almost 60% of investors to vote against the board.

      "bodyText": "The growing commercial value of car sharing operations was underlined on Wednesday when global hire giant Avis Budget, bought Zipcar for $500m (\u00a3307m) \u2013 a near 50% premium to its share value. Zipcar, which itself acquired Britain's Streetcar less than three years ago, has 767,000 members, or Zipsters, who pay an annual joining fee and are then charged by the hour to use its vehicles. The Zipcar business is seen by many as a \"greener\" alternative to traditional ownership models because it encourages less road use. But it is still struggling to turn in a full year of profits. Avis believes it can turn green to gold. \"We see car sharing as highly complementary to traditional car rental, with rapid growth potential and representing a scalable opportunity for us as a combined company,\" said Ronald Nelson, chairman and chief executive of Avis. The world's number three car hire firm, founded in 1946 with three cars at Willow Run airport in Detroit, has been trying to bulk up after being overtaken in overall scale by Hertz and already trailing well behind Enterprise. Avis recently lost out to Hertz, which bought Dollar Thrifty \u2013 the world's number four car hire company \u2013 for $2.6bn, and now says it want to speed up the growth of Zipcar by putting more cars in more locations. \"By combining Zipcar's expertise in on-demand mobility with Avis Budget Group's expertise in global fleet operations and vast global network, we will be able to accelerate the revolution we began in personal mobility,\" said Scott Griffith, chairman and chief executive of Zipcar. Car sharing originates in Europe and Zipcar was founded 12 years ago in Cambridge, Massachusetts, specifically to take the concept to the US. It has become popular in cities as individual cars are kept in residential streets, outside workplaces or on student campuses, and many believe it is cheaper than owning your own vehicle. Car sharing clubs give members a smartcard which they use to open the car, eliminating the need to go to an office to collect and return keys. Hertz and Enterprise have launched their own car sharing operations in the past few years, while Zipcar will become an Avis subsidiary and have headquarters in Boston. Avis anticipates that putting the two businesses together will enable it to extract between $50m to $70m in annual savings. The New Jersey-based firm also expects the acquisition will add to its adjusted earnings per share in the second year after it is complete. Avis said it expected certain members of Zipcar management, including Griffith and president and chief operating officer Mark Norman, to help run its day-to-day operations. If Zipcar shareholders approve the deal worth $12.25 per share it is expected to complete later this spring. The boards of both companies \u2013 holding 32% of the shares \u2013 have already agreed to support the takeover. In Zipcar's most recent quarter net income reached $4.3m while revenues were up to $78m \u2013 but much of the profit came from the sale of vehicle emission credits in the US. Griffith said in November that the business, which saw membership grow by 18% in the third quarter, was on track for 2012 to be Zipcar's \"first full year of profitability\". In recent weeks Zipcar has acquired or completed the integration of two of Europe's largest competitors, Austria's Carsharing and Barcelona-based Avancar, as well as launching the new Zipvan service in Los Angeles and Philadelphia. When Zipcar bought Streetcar in April 2010 it paid $50m, of which almost a third went to Andrew Valentine and Brett Akker, two university friends who had established the business. Avis said it was also on track with its expected financial results for the current year. The company has forecast earnings of $2.35 to $2.45 per share on revenue of $7.3bn. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $2.42 on the same revenue.",

      "body": "<p>Mining and banking shares helped leading shares to their best daily performance since November, as investors welcomed news of a late night agreement to avoid the US tumbling over the fiscal cliff.</p> <p>The deal on tax and spending was criticised by some for merely delaying any final decisions on the US budget problems for a couple of months, but it was enough to remove some of the uncertainty which has recently surrounded the markets.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 129.56 points higher at 6017.37p, a 2.2% rise which added some \u00a333bn to the value of Britain's top companies. It was the biggest daily percentage gain since 19 November last year. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG:</p> <blockquote> 6000 was a major hurdle for the FTSE 100 throughout 2012, but it has been swiftly bypassed on only the first trading day of the new year. A weight has been lifted from investors' minds, or at least it has been for now. There is the possibility that the whole dismal experience will be repeated in two months' time. <br> With the taboo level of 6000 now broken, the question is whether markets can hold on to their gains and push higher. The euphoria might fade somewhat in the coming days, but with non-farm payrolls on Friday investors might look to keep their powder dry for the rest of this shortened trading week. </blockquote> <p>Investors were also buoyed by a better than expected manufacturing survey for December from the UK and US, although the picture was rather more mixed in Europe.</p> <p>Reasonable data from China lifted commodity companies, with <strong>Evraz</strong>, the Russian steel producer controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, rising 18.7p to 277.6p.</p> <p>Eight of the FTSE 100's top risers were mining or commodities groups, with <strong>Xstrata</strong> adding 70.5p to 1129.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rising 179.5p to \u00a336.91.</p> <p>Among the banks, <strong>Barclays</strong> was 13.2p better at 275.6p, helped by a buy note from Investec analyst Ian Gordon, while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> was lifted 1.775p to 49.69p.</p> <p><strong>Weir</strong> rose 91p to \u00a319.70 after the pumps maker sold liquid gas specialist LGE Process to <strong>Babcock International</strong>, 30p better at 995.5p, for \u00a323m, and completed the acquisition of US group Mathena. Analysts at Charles Stanley issued a positive note on Weir, saying:</p> <blockquote> With meaningful capital expenditure in oil and gas expected to resume in 2013 and Weir trading on an undemanding multiple we have an accumulate recommendation. We also expect Weir to be a beneficiary of the Climate Change Secretary's recent lifting of the suspension on UK shale gas exploration (fracking was suspended in the UK after shale gas exploration triggered two small earthquakes). Keith Cochrane, Weir's chief executive, sees the UK's experience in the oil and gas sector making it \"the obvious choice as a hub for Europe's nascent shale gas industry\". </blockquote> <p>Outsourcing group <strong>Serco</strong> added 6.5p to 541.5p after a buy note from Liberum Capital.</p> <p>But <strong>J Sainsbury</strong>, down 9.1p at 336p, and <strong>Morrisons</strong>, 5.6p lower at 257.4p, were both hit by concerns they had lose out to rivals during the Christmas trading period.</p> <p>Jefferies cutting its target price on Morrisons from 330p to 310p on worries about the supermarket's Christmas performance. Analyst James Grzinic said:</p> <blockquote> Recent market share updates have highlighted soft trading momentum at Morrisons. We believe this likely reflects consumers trading down to discounters and continued online share shift. We now assume Christmas like for like sales (to be reported on 7 January) to have fallen by 2.8%, prompting a 3/4% cut to mid-term estimates and a reduction in our 2013 target ambition to 310p. </blockquote> <p>Apart from the two supermarkets the only other loser in the FTSE 100 was defensive stock <strong>British American Tobacco</strong>, down 30p at \u00a330.91.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Domino's Pizza</strong> added 27.6p to 525p after Numis raised its recommendation from add to buy.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Avesco</strong>, which specialises in corporate presentation services, shed 5% to 178.5p. The company had expected to benefit from a US court ruling in favour of its associate Celador, which was demerged in 2003, against American entertainment giant Disney. The dispute was over Celador's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and revolved around claims that Disney used creative accounting to hide the success of the show in the US.

The deal on tax and spending was criticised by some for merely delaying any final decisions on the US budget problems for a couple of months, but it was enough to remove some of the uncertainty which has recently surrounded the markets. So the FTSE 100 finished 129.56 points higher at 6017.37p, a 2.2% rise which added some \u00a333bn to the value of Britain's top companies. It was the biggest daily percentage gain since 19 November last year. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG: 6000 was a major hurdle for the FTSE 100 throughout 2012, but it has been swiftly bypassed on only the first trading day of the new year. A weight has been lifted from investors' minds, or at least it has been for now. There is the possibility that the whole dismal experience will be repeated in two months' time. With the taboo level of 6000 now broken, the question is whether markets can hold on to their gains and push higher. The euphoria might fade somewhat in the coming days, but with non-farm payrolls on Friday investors might look to keep their powder dry for the rest of this shortened trading week. Investors were also buoyed by a better than expected manufacturing survey for December from the UK and US, although the picture was rather more mixed in Europe. Reasonable data from China lifted commodity companies, with Evraz, the Russian steel producer controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, rising 18.7p to 277.6p. Eight of the FTSE 100's top risers were mining or commodities groups, with Xstrata adding 70.5p to 1129.5p and Rio Tinto rising 179.5p to \u00a336.91. Among the banks, Barclays was 13.2p better at 275.6p, helped by a buy note from Investec analyst Ian Gordon, while Lloyds Banking Group was lifted 1.775p to 49.69p. Weir rose 91p to \u00a319.70 after the pumps maker sold liquid gas specialist LGE Process to Babcock International, 30p better at 995.5p, for \u00a323m, and completed the acquisition of US group Mathena. Analysts at Charles Stanley issued a positive note on Weir, saying: With meaningful capital expenditure in oil and gas expected to resume in 2013 and Weir trading on an undemanding multiple we have an accumulate recommendation. We also expect Weir to be a beneficiary of the Climate Change Secretary's recent lifting of the suspension on UK shale gas exploration (fracking was suspended in the UK after shale gas exploration triggered two small earthquakes). Keith Cochrane, Weir's chief executive, sees the UK's experience in the oil and gas sector making it \"the obvious choice as a hub for Europe's nascent shale gas industry\". Outsourcing group Serco added 6.5p to 541.5p after a buy note from Liberum Capital. But J Sainsbury, down 9.1p at 336p, and Morrisons, 5.6p lower at 257.4p, were both hit by concerns they had lose out to rivals during the Christmas trading period. Jefferies cutting its target price on Morrisons from 330p to 310p on worries about the supermarket's Christmas performance. Analyst James Grzinic said: Recent market share updates have highlighted soft trading momentum at Morrisons. We believe this likely reflects consumers trading down to discounters and continued online share shift. We now assume Christmas like for like sales (to be reported on 7 January) to have fallen by 2.8%, prompting a 3/4% cut to mid-term estimates and a reduction in our 2013 target ambition to 310p. Apart from the two supermarkets the only other loser in the FTSE 100 was defensive stock British American Tobacco, down 30p at \u00a330.91. Elsewhere Domino's Pizza added 27.6p to 525p after Numis raised its recommendation from add to buy. Finally Avesco, which specialises in corporate presentation services, shed 5% to 178.5p. The company had expected to benefit from a US court ruling in favour of its associate Celador, which was demerged in 2003, against American entertainment giant Disney. The dispute was over Celador's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and revolved around claims that Disney used creative accounting to hide the success of the show in the US. A court awarded Celador $319m, of which around $60m would go to Avesco, and in early December issued a ruling denying an appeal by Disney. But on the last day of the year, Disney filed a petition seeking leave for a rehearing, which will now delay things further.",

Instead, we have another potentially very disruptive budget battle coming soon, so any upside risk to our forecast from pent-up demand may now have gone, for a few more quarters at least.</p> <p>With little prospect of any meaningful action to address the medium-term budget problems, we suspect that the US will suffer further credit rating downgrades this year. Of course, more downgrades wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean higher Treasury yields and a weaker dollar, any more than the loss of the AAA rating from S&amp;P did in August 2011. With equity and commodity markets reacting positively, the rise in long-term interest rates and fall in the US currency in response to the deal reached on Tuesday presumably reflects an increase in the appetite for risk rather than renewed fears over the sustainability of the US fiscal position. Nonetheless, these fears may still return to rattle the markets and keep spending subdued. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50e45147b579a9dd79231f2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-02T15:24:55.124Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some comment on the US manufacturing figures from Rob Carnell at ING, ahead of Friday's US non-farm payrolls report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Manufacturing ISM is in competition with the Markit PMI \u2013 which is released about an hour earlier. Both rose 1.2 points from the previous month. Both showed a decent bounce in the employment component. Both suggest a reasonable rise in the manufacturing part of the payrolls release on Friday. Though the breakdown of the ISM was less impressive, with new orders flat at a barely \u201cpositive \u201c 50.3, and production falling to 52.6 from 53.7.</p> <p> As an indicator for payrolls, this data is at best partial, and a bounce in the manufacturing part of the payrolls release from a 4000 rise last month to (say) 14,000 this month, is probably insufficient to have anyone rushing to upgrade their forecasts.</p> <p> Tomorrow\u2019s ADP survey will flesh out the details of the employment situation in December, which we continue to think may come in softer than the current consensus view. If there are any changes to forecasts to be made, they will need to wait until then.</p> <p> That said, there is nothing in this latest data to suggest a retreat from the optimism stemming from the minor advance made in solving the fiscal cliff. Politics may yet pour cold water on the market's confidence. But for now, optimism is up, as are stock markets, bond yields, and the dollar index.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50e4508395cb94a7be21b692\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-02T15:21:39.270Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Perhaps we shouldn't be taken aback by today's rally, if history is any guidance:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Josh_CityIndex/status/286474313140408321\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Todays gains not a surprise.

The rate of decline remained significant in France, Spain and particularly Greece, where the index fell from 41.8 to 41.4.

Indeed, manufacturing output looks highly likely to have contracted markedly in the fourth quarter of 2012, thereby contributing to an expected third successive modest drop in Eurozone GDP.</p> <p>A further drop in manufacturing output seems very much on the cards for the first quarter of 2013, and any significant recovery in manufacturing activity still looks some way off.

The problem is that the fix prevents a sharp near-term macroeconomic hit, but does little on long-term fiscal sustainability, so the long-term impact is likely to be negative on the USD as well.

      "bodyText": "Italy has announced a reduction in its state sector budget deficit last year. Mario Monti, the technocrat prime minister who stepped down at the end of last year, will take some comfort from news that the deficit fell from \u20ac63.8bn to \u20ac48.5bn. He is running in next month's elections as head of a centrist alliance. The falling deficit came as Monti's government implemented - widely unpopular - spending cuts and higher taxes. And with that, it's time to say goodnight and thanks for all the comments. For the latest developments in the US fiscal cliff situation, you can follow our live blog from the US. European markets have closed, and thanks to the US agreement averting an immediate plunge over the fiscal cliff, they have enjoyed a new year surge. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished up 129.56 points or 2% at 6027.37, adding \u00a333bn to the value of Britain's top companies. This marks the first time the UK's leading index has closed above 6000 since July 2011. It is also the biggest daily rise since 19 November last year when it rose by 2.36 \u2022 Germany's Dax had jumped 2.15% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 2.37% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has added 3.81% \u2022 The Athens market is up 3.67% \u2022 Spain's Ibex is 3.43% better \u2022 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 1.7% or 226 points higher Germany faces an uncertain year but is likely to avoid recession, according to economists as reported by Spiegel online. The cautious optimism comes as the country reported a rise in inflation from 1.9% year on year in November to 2.1% last month. But analysts say the increases was not unexpected, and headline inflation is likely to fall in the first quarter of 2013 thanks to weak demand and a correction to a spike in clothing and footwear prices. Many market participants believe the US could see further reductions in its credit rating this year, as the budget problem rumbles on despite the late night fiscal cliff agreement. Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics, commenting on the US deal, said: The good news is that the worst case scenario of an immediate slide back into recession has been avoided, and we do have a little more certainty about taxation. That said, we had hoped that a comprehensive agreement would prompt a wave of spending by households and businesses who are currently sitting on the sidelines due to uncertainty about fiscal policy. Instead, we have another potentially very disruptive budget battle coming soon, so any upside risk to our forecast from pent-up demand may now have gone, for a few more quarters at least. With little prospect of any meaningful action to address the medium-term budget problems, we suspect that the US will suffer further credit rating downgrades this year. Of course, more downgrades wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean higher Treasury yields and a weaker dollar, any more than the loss of the AAA rating from S&amp;P did in August 2011. With equity and commodity markets reacting positively, the rise in long-term interest rates and fall in the US currency in response to the deal reached on Tuesday presumably reflects an increase in the appetite for risk rather than renewed fears over the sustainability of the US fiscal position. Nonetheless, these fears may still return to rattle the markets and keep spending subdued. Here's some comment on the US manufacturing figures from Rob Carnell at ING, ahead of Friday's US non-farm payrolls report: The Manufacturing ISM is in competition with the Markit PMI \u2013 which is released about an hour earlier. Both rose 1.2 points from the previous month. Both showed a decent bounce in the employment component. Both suggest a reasonable rise in the manufacturing part of the payrolls release on Friday. Though the breakdown of the ISM was less impressive, with new orders flat at a barely \u201cpositive \u201c 50.3, and production falling to 52.6 from 53.7. As an indicator for payrolls, this data is at best partial, and a bounce in the manufacturing part of the payrolls release from a 4000 rise last month to (say) 14,000 this month, is probably insufficient to have anyone rushing to upgrade their forecasts. Tomorrow\u2019s ADP survey will flesh out the details of the employment situation in December, which we continue to think may come in softer than the current consensus view. If there are any changes to forecasts to be made, they will need to wait until then. That said, there is nothing in this latest data to suggest a retreat from the optimism stemming from the minor advance made in solving the fiscal cliff. Politics may yet pour cold water on the market's confidence. But for now, optimism is up, as are stock markets, bond yields, and the dollar index. Perhaps we shouldn't be taken aback by today's rally, if history is any guidance: After a mixed manufacturing picture from Europe and better than expected figures from the UK, the US index has followed the latter's example. The Institute of Supply Management's monthly index came in at 50.7 in December, up from 49.5 the previous month and higher than the forecast 50.3. Earlier, Markit's index showed US manufacturing at a seven month high in December. That has helped give another push to Wall Street, which hardly needed it in truth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 2% or 262 points. US stockmarkets have roared into action on the new year's first day of trading, with the Dow Jones index registering a 1.7% leap after the opening bell. The American blue chip index bounced 222 points to 13326, with Mastercard and Visa shares rising to all time highs, on relief that Washington had reached a fiscal deal, and its confidence was enough to add a further 10 points to the FTSE 100. The London index briefly reached 6040, a 2.4% rise on the previous close, before falling back to just over 6030 points, as US traders welcomed a settlement to avoid massive tax hikes and spending cuts that had threatened to send the world's largest economy into recession. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index followed suit, jumping 1.5% to 1,4478 in New York. Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst for Rockwell Global Capital in New York, told Reuters. There is a lot of euphoria out there and I expect, for the next day or two, the market will continue on the upside. We will see money re-entering the market. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Greece recorded a primary surplus in the first 11 months of the year, Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said Wednesday, showing the government\u0384s budget cutting efforts are starting to pay off. \"The general government primary balance, without interest spend, in the first 11 months of 2012 showed a surplus of 2.3 billion euros, against a deficit of 3.6 billion euros in the comparative period of 2011,\" a statement from the finance ministry said, according to a Dow Jones report. \"This development in the implementation of the budget indicates that the dedicated fiscal, adaptation and discipline efforts are paying off, setting the conditions for the gradual restart of the economy,\" it added. Greece is aiming for a primary budget surplus - before taking into account interest payments on the national debt - of 0.4% of annual economic output next year. It has to meet a primary-surplus target of 4.5% of economic output in 2016. However, as one reader points out, the Greek state still owes 4.4 billion euros in unpaid 'social security funds' such as hospital bills, pensions and prescriptions. London shares are consolidating the day's gains, with the FTSE 100 reaching 6032 points by 12:35, a massive 2.28% increase on the previous trading day. Predictions that the Greek unemployment rate will rise to 30% as austerity budget cuts imposed as part of the recession hit economy's bailout take effect at the end of this month. The Guardian's Helena Smith reports from Athens: On 31 January pensioners and civil servants will experience their first real wage cuts \u2013 on top of ever growing taxes and utility prices \u2013 in more than a year. \"A lot of people especially in the middle class are going to find they have no salaries at all as reductions, ranging from 15 to 20%, are applied retroactively,\" said Kyrtsos, an opponent of the growth through austerity policies that lenders have placed as the prize of further aid. \"All the measures we have been talking about for the past six months,\" he said referring to the budget reforms the governing coalition has been forced to draft since its election in June, \"will have to be implemented and that will create all kinds of side-effects. Unemployment will rise to 30%. No civilised society can function like that.\" Italian Premier Mario Monti said Italy had avoided a \"real risk of total collapse\" since his government of technocrats took over at the end of 2011. in a radio interview Wednesday he said economic disaster had been averted. \"The light at the end of the tunnel is closer now and I am optimistic that we managed to avoid the real risk of total collapse,\" Monti told Radio Anch'io. Monti tendered his resignation last week from his job as prime minister of Italy after 13 months in charge, announced on Friday that he would lead a coalition of political parties that backed his reform agenda in the upcoming February elections. He is promoting a political agenda of continued reforms in the current election campaign. Much of Italy's progress \"depends on the global economy and in EU policies for growth that can help make the tunnel shorter,\" Monti said. US markets are expected to rally today when traders return to their desks, with futures of the Dow Jones index of blue chip stocks already trading 1.2% higher. The New Year surge in European and Asian shares is expected to spread to New York, as markets welcome the temporary fix that has prevented the US economy falling off a \"fiscal cliff\". The Dow Jones index of 30 leading stocks closed up 166 points or 1.3% on its last business day at 13104, and is expected to consolidate those gains when markets open. The Standard and Poor's 500 index futures are trading 1.7%, according to Reuters, while Nasdaq futures are up 1.3%. A verdict from my colleague Nils Pratley, the Guardian's financial editor, on today's market somersaults: Is the fiscal fudge worth 100 points on the FTSE 100 index? Sort of. It\u2019s the difference from expectations that matters when you\u2019re looking at instant reactions and last week there was a real possibility that there would be no deal at all. So, yes, a 2% rise is not mad. But the deal itself is modest. Remember the goal - supposedly - was to reset the US\u2019 long-term tax and spending framework. That hasn\u2019t been achieved. Instead, there is only an agreement to defer the big decisions for another couple of months. What investors have really learned is that the US political process is as chaotic as feared. One of these days - probably quite soon - that worry will dominate. As with the parade of eurozone fixes in the past couple of years, don\u2019t assume the first day\u2019s reaction is the lasting one. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, says the footsie needs to go up a further 100 points to convince. The resolution of the fiscal cliff is clearly the big driver here, but critically we need to try and sustain this rally and it's going to be difficult to call the uptrend until we see a break above the big technical barrier around the 6100, last tested in February 2011. A breach of 6100 could see a significant move higher but with much left to be resolved not only in the US but also the euro zone, it is looking highly unlikely at the current juncture. Reuters Breakingviews columnist Edward Hadas writes: The unnecessary fight over the US budget ended with another messy and inadequate compromise. Other equally silly clashes loom. Investors may cheer, but their nail-biting was symptomatic of the world's excessive dependence on dysfunctional American politics. That hasn't changed. The New Year is off with a bang as London's blue chip index tops 6000 points for the first time since July 2011, on the back of the fiscal cliff deal and a return to growth for British factories. My colleague Nick Fletcher, the Guardian's markets columnist, says the rally may be overdone: There are still so many uncertainties. There are worries about Europe, with an Italian election coming up, and the fiscal cliff talks have only pushed decisions back a couple of months. Washington hasn't resolved the problems, it has just secured breathing space. Eurozone blogger Yannis Koutsomitis agrees. Good news for British factory owners: output returned to growth in December, increasing at its fastest pace since September 2011. Manufacturing jumped to 51.4 in December, from 49.2 in November, according to Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the UK. In stark contrast to the eurozone, where all but one of the 17 single currency nations suffered a fall in output, the UK made a convincing return to form. The FTSE 100 took heart, improving on its opening rally to climb to a 100 point or 1.75% lead on the previous trading day's close, reaching 6000 points. Markit's Rob Dobson commented: UK manufacturing exited 2012 on a positive note, with December's PMI data signalling a reassuringly solid return to growth for the sector. However, this does little to change the view that the sector contracted over the fourth quarter as a whole, following the temporary growth surge of 0.7% in the third quarter. The domestic market remained the main spur for growth of production and new orders in December, although there are also signs that global trade flows are stabilising as China the US strengthen and the downturn in the eurozone eases. If the recovery in overseas markets continues to build at the start of 2013, this would be of major benefit to UK exporters. the latest survey also showed that manufacturers remain on a cost-cautious footing, leading to lower levels of purchasing, the running-down of inventories and a reluctance to increase payroll numbers. However, there are increasing signs of firms starting to move out of this cost-cutting mode, though it is clear that the outlook remains far from certain. Business confidence among producers therefore remains fragile and could easily be derailed by setbacks in key export markets, notably any resurgence of the eurozone debt crisis. Ireland was the only member of the 17-nation single currency bloc to grow its manufacturing output in December, according to purchasing managers' surveys. Europe slipped further into recession in the last quarter of 2012, with new orders from factories continuing their slump. Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) crept down to 46.1 in December from 46.2 in November. The index has been below the 50 mark, which divides growth from contraction, since August 2011. factories cut their workforces at a faster pace than in the previous month and Germany, Europe's largest economy, saw output shrink for the 10th month in a row, and at a faster pace than in November. Ireland remained the only Eurozone country seeing manufacturing growth in December, while activity was close to stabilizing in the Netherlands. The rate of decline remained significant in France, Spain and particularly Greece, where the index fell from 41.8 to 41.4. Italy saw manufacturing contract at the slowest rate for nine months, but the drop was still marked. IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer thinks 2013 will bring more of the same: While Eurozone manufacturing activity may have suffered its worst contraction around October, the December purchasing managers\u2019 surveys indicate that the sector is still stranded well into recessionary territory and that conditions continue to be tough going into 2013. Indeed, manufacturing output looks highly likely to have contracted markedly in the fourth quarter of 2012, thereby contributing to an expected third successive modest drop in Eurozone GDP. A further drop in manufacturing output seems very much on the cards for the first quarter of 2013, and any significant recovery in manufacturing activity still looks some way off. In particular, domestic demand in the Eurozone is likely to remain constrained by tighter fiscal policy in many countries, high and rising unemployment, and limited consumer purchasing power. With Europe's fraught fiscal negotiation batton now firmly passed to Washington, Paul Murphy at the Financial Times labelled the agreement a \"fiscal fudge\" this morning: You just knew it was coming: chaotic brinkmanship, followed by a half-baked compromise that sees substantially all contentious issues kicked off to another day. Last minute Congressional agreement over tax rises, simply offers up spending cuts and the debt ceiling as the next two crisis points for US legislators. Steve Eglander at Citi had this to say: The process was so chaotic and the outcome so unsatisfactory that we are likely to see a further US downgrade at some point. The problem is that the fix prevents a sharp near-term macroeconomic hit, but does little on long-term fiscal sustainability, so the long-term impact is likely to be negative on the USD as well. A quick glance at CDS, ratings and government interest rates suggests that it would take at least two more notches before there is a significant risk premium added to borrowing costs, and with the Fed in a cooperative mood, it may take even more. Under these circumstances the loss of confidence may manifest itself more via the USD than other asset markets. SRN Broadcasting analyst Ralph Silva tweeted: My colleague Ewen MacAskill's report summarises the key points of last night's agreement to avoid recession in the world's largest economy, describing the deal as a \"short-term, messy compromise\". Tax rises are confined to the wealthiest 2% of the population: those individuals earning $400,000 or more a year and households earning $450,000 or more. Two month postponement of cuts in defence and welfare spending that had been due to start on 1 January Estate tax rises, to 40% from 35%, but inheritances below $5m are exempted from the increase. Benefits for the unemployed are extended for another year. Barack Obama, who broke off his family holiday in Hawaii to see the crisis resolved, returned to Honolulu minutes after making a statement to reporters at the White House. He claimed the deal as a victory for his party: The central premise of my campaign for president was to change the tax code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working, middle-class Americans. Tonight we have done that. He also called for a more bipartisan approach on issues such as spending cuts. The one thing I think hopefully in the new year we will focus on is seeing if whether we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little less brinkmanship, not scare the heck out of folks quite as much. London's rally came despite a complete absence of official company news. The Stock Exchange RNS news feed was apparently suffering from a New Year's hangover - it was due to resume service at 7am this morning but has only just kicked into action. Markets and analysts reaction to the fiscal cliff settlement 9:30am, Manufacturing PMI data for the UK, plus Italy, Germany and France 2:00pm, Manufacturing PMI data for the US 3:00pm, US ISM Manufacturing data for December, construction spending for November London shares surged by 90 points as European markets celebrated Tuesday night's Washington deal to prevent huge tax hikes and spending cuts that would have pushed the United States economy off a 'fiscal cliff' and into recession. Minutes after the opening bell, the FTSE 100 was up 1.5% as was Germany's DAX, while France CAC pushed shares up 1.7%. Relief in southern Europe was palpable, with Italy's excahnge up 2% and Spain's IBEX up 1.9%. The fiscal cliff settlement, passed by the House of Representatives by 257 votes to 167, raises taxes for the wealthy and delays spending cuts for two months. President Barack Obama, who campaigned for re-election by promising to raise taxes on the wealthy, claimed the deal as a manifesto victory, but cautioned it was \"just one step in the broader effort to strengthen the economy\". In Tuesday night's house vote, 172 Democrats and 85 Republicans voted in favour of the bill. A majority of Republicans, 151 in total, voted no, along with 16 Democrats. The bill had been passed in the Senate less than 24 hours earlier by 89 votes to eight after lengthy talks between Vice-President Joe Biden and Senate Republicans.",
