      "bodyText": "Deliveroo is planning to expand in the UK this year by signing up 5,000 eateries who use their own delivery fleets in a direct challenge to Just Eat. Until now, only restaurants that agreed to use Deliveroo\u2019s network of 15,000 couriers could be listed on the fast-growing takeaway app. The London-based food delivery company said it expected to take on thousands more couriers as a result of the change in policy, as it would offer restaurants with their own fleets the option of using Deliveroo\u2019s riders at busy times. Deliveroo faces two legal challenges over the employment status of its couriers with a high court ruling on one expected this week. However, the company\u2019s founder, Will Shu, said it would not have been able to quickly build such a large fleet of couriers if they were fully employed. He said that, according to the company\u2019s own figures, 90% of the group\u2019s riders around the world valued the flexibility, which enabled them to access Deliveroo\u2019s system whenever they wanted to work. \u201cWhatever we can do to preserve that flexibility is the most important thing to me. If we can work with the government, and governments around the world, to enable benefits alongside flexibility and end this alleged trade off between these two things; that is something I would strongly welcome,\u201d he said. Shu said Deliveroo\u2019s new service would enable users to choose from 50% more restaurants. The \u201clong-term 10-year goal\u201d, Shu said, was to become \u201cthe definitive food company\u201d, making the Deliveroo name synonymous with takeaway delivery in the same way Amazon has done for e-commerce or Google for web search. Deliveroo\u2019s step into territory dominated by Just Eat comes weeks after the FTSE 100-listed online takeaway firm said it was planning to launch its own delivery fleetin the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It also comes as Deliveroo struggles to meet ambitions for its \u201cdark kitchens\u201d, which enable restaurants to set up a delivery-only service from cheap rented kitchen \u201cpods\u201d. Shu said its Editions business remained \u201ca huge part of bringing more selection to customers\u201d. The company currently operates 74 dark kitchens from 14 sites in the UK, up from 66 at 11 sites in October last year \u2013 but well short of the 200-plus kitchens it had hoped to have opened by now.",

      "bodyText": "The senior PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who audited BHS\u2019s accounts ahead of its sale for \u00a31 just a year before the department store chain collapsed is facing a 15-year ban and six-figure fine from the industry watchdog. Steve Denison, who spent more than 30 years at PwC according to his LinkedIn profile, becoming a partner, is understood to have been facing a \u00a3500,000 fine from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), reduced to \u00a3325,000 after he agreed to cooperate. PwC is separately facing a record \u00a36.5m fine, reduced from \u00a310m after it agreed to settle. The accountancy firm has also been given a severe reprimand and been told to monitor and support its Leeds audit practice and provide detailed annual reports about that practice to the FRC for the next three years. PwC said: \u201cWe recognise and accept that there were serious shortcomings with this audit work and that it is important to learn the necessary lessons. We are sorry that our work fell well below the professional standards expected of us and that we demand of ourselves.\u201d The heavy sanctions against PwC come after the watchdog said it would double fines for poor audit work by the major accountancy firms to \u00a310m from this month. Until now, the largest fine issued by the FRC was \u00a35.1m, also to PwC, for its audit of RSM Tenon in 2011. Earlier this week the accountancy firm KPMG was fined more than \u00a33m by the FRC for misconduct relating to the scandal-hit insurance software firm Quindell, which changed its name to Watchstone in 2015. The penalty was reduced from \u00a34.5m as part of a settlement agreement. The conclusions of the FRC\u2019s investigation come two years after it launched an investigation into audit work at BHS after the department store collapsed into administration with the loss of 11,000 jobs. PwC stepped down as BHS\u2019s auditor after its sale by Sir Philip Green, the Topshop magnate, to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell in 2015. It gave the struggling retailer\u2019s finances for the year to 30 August 2014 a clean bill of health. It also advised Green\u2019s retail group on the BHS pension scheme between 2009 and 2013. Denison, who is also chairman of Yorkshire county cricket club, was among the witnesses asked to give evidence to an inquiry by MPs into BHS\u2019s collapse. There had been valid reasons for signing off BHS\u2019s accounts as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d before Chappell bought the retailer, he told a hearing in May 2016. Denison is understood to have left PwC this week and his personal contact page on the firm\u2019s website had already been removed on Tuesday. He has agreed to remove himself from the register of statutory auditors, which is overseen by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, until 2033, according to Sky News, which first reported the fines. The FRC declined to comment. Denison was unavailable for comment.",

      "bodyText": "WPP shareholders should prepare to feel frustrated. Wednesday\u2019s annual meeting will also be a convention of lawyers, on hand to ensure chairman Roberto Quarta doesn\u2019t utter a morsel of information about the findings of the board\u2019s investigation into allegations of personal misconduct against former chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. But let\u2019s hope Quarta, amid his \u201cno comment\u201d routine, can bring himself to admit that \u201cat will\u201d service contracts for founding directors of public companies are a terrible idea and that WPP\u2019s board made a bad error in granting one to Sorrell in 2008. For years, the loose arrangement was cited to placate investors during the annual rows over Sorrell\u2019s pay. Sorrell himself made the point in 2012 when he wrote in the FT that he made no apology for acting as an owner, declaring: \u201cI have no contract with the company, am \u201cat will\u201d and can be dismissed or leave instantly without compensation or restriction.\u201d That \u201cwithout restriction\u201d feature looks a bad oversight now that Sorrell is up and running with his attempt to create a new advertising and marketing company with backing from some big-name fund managers. At the outset, Sorrell\u2019s S4 Capital venture may offer little direct competition since he is still bound by commercial confidentiality restrictions, which may prelude him from poaching former colleagues or using information gleaned at WPP. But he\u2019s put \u00a340m of his money into S4, which suggests seriousness of ambition. His mere presence in the market is a distraction WPP could do without \u2013 and could have avoided for a while if the \u201cat will\u201d contract hadn\u2019t been so lopsided. The legal tangles that have ended up gagging WPP\u2019s board on the reasons for Sorrell\u2019s departure are different. Some, perhaps, could not have been avoided, which is why the rebellion against Quarta\u2019s reappointment will probably be limited to 20% or so. But the failure to insert a standard non-compete clause into Sorrell\u2019s contract is hard to excuse. Quarta, who inherited the problem when he became chairman in 2015 but didn\u2019t fix it, should apologise to investors. The Bank is fast running out of time to raise rates There\u2019s no rule that says the Bank of England can\u2019t raise interest rates when Brexit uncertainty is at full pitch, which is probably still the end of this year and the beginning of next. It\u2019s just that Threadneedle Street, keenly aware there\u2019s only so long it can tolerate inflation above 2%, would probably prefer to act ahead of time. If so, it is fast running out of opportunities \u2013 and the latest data on wage growth won\u2019t help the case for an increase from 0.5%. At the start of the year, May was assumed to be the moment the Bank would move. Then \u201cthe beast from the east\u201d intervened in the form a sluggish 0.1% growth in first quarter GDP. Never mind, the Bank expected two things to happen while it waited for August. First, the economy would rebound. Second, with unemployment levels at multi-decade lows, signs of growth in real wages would become more obvious. The second assumption already looks questionable. Tuesday\u2019s data showed earnings growth including bonuses dropped by 0.1 points to 2.5% in the three months to April, implying barely visible growth in real wages since inflation stands at 2.4%. The City \u2013 and the Bank \u2013 expected more. Attention thus turns to the second-quarter GDP figures, to be unveiled at the end of July. In its May inflation report, the Bank expected 0.4%, confident that its surveys were detecting a brighter mood. If that figure is missed, another chance to raise the cost of borrowing will surely have to be surrendered. Instead, we\u2019ll be talking about how \u2013 once again \u2013 the Bank led everybody up the garden path. If it wanted a round or two of tightening to prepare for Brexit, the Bank should have started before last November Get ready for the \u2018CVA clause\u2019 It\u2019s no wonder strong bricks\u2019n\u2019mortar retailers \u2013 there are still a few \u2013 are demanding \u201cCVA clauses\u201d on new leases so that they enjoy the same cheaper rents if landlords grant discounts to competitors. New Look, which secured rent reductions on 393 of its stores via its CVA in March, now says it won\u2019t immediately close 60 other shops it expected to shut this year. It seems many landlords don\u2019t want the expensive and hassle of managing empty shops and would rather have a tenant that pays no rent. That\u2019s good news for New Look and its staff, but you see why healthier rivals, who never clocked up the same enormous debt burdens, might see the process as basically unfair. It\u2019s hard to see how landlords are going to resist CVA clauses \u2013 the negotiating hand is weak and getting weaker.",

Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/12/wpp-board-questions-sir-martin-sorrell-shareholders\">annual meeting</a> will also be a convention of lawyers, on hand to ensure chairman Roberto Quarta doesn\u2019t utter a morsel of information about the findings of the board\u2019s investigation into allegations of personal misconduct against former chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. But let\u2019s hope Quarta, amid his \u201cno comment\u201d routine, can bring himself to admit that \u201cat will\u201d service contracts for founding directors of public companies are a terrible idea and that WPP\u2019s board made a bad error in granting one to Sorrell in 2008.</p> <p>For years, the loose arrangement was cited to placate investors during the annual rows over Sorrell\u2019s pay. Sorrell himself made the point in 2012 when <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea12c3e6-aeee-11e1-a8a7-00144feabdc0\">he wrote in the FT</a> that he made no apology for acting as an owner, declaring: \u201cI have no contract with the company, am \u201cat will\u201d and can be dismissed or leave instantly without compensation or restriction.\u201d</p> <p>That \u201cwithout restriction\u201d feature looks a bad oversight now that Sorrell is up and running with his attempt to create a new advertising and marketing company with backing from some big-name fund managers. At the outset, Sorrell\u2019s S4 Capital venture may offer little direct competition since he is still bound by commercial confidentiality restrictions, which may prelude him from poaching former colleagues or using information gleaned at WPP. But he\u2019s put \u00a340m of his money into S4, which suggests seriousness of ambition. His mere presence in the market is a distraction WPP could do without \u2013 and could have avoided for a while if the \u201cat will\u201d contract hadn\u2019t been so lopsided.</p> <p>The legal tangles that have ended up gagging WPP\u2019s board on the reasons for Sorrell\u2019s departure are different. Some, perhaps, could not have been avoided, which is why the rebellion against Quarta\u2019s reappointment will probably be limited to 20% or so. But the failure to insert a standard non-compete clause into Sorrell\u2019s contract is hard to excuse. Quarta, who inherited the problem when he became chairman in 2015 but didn\u2019t fix it, should apologise to investors.</p> <h2>The Bank is fast running out of time to raise rates</h2> <p>There\u2019s no rule that says the Bank of England can\u2019t raise interest rates when Brexit uncertainty is at full pitch, which is probably still the end of this year and the beginning of next. It\u2019s just that Threadneedle Street, keenly aware there\u2019s only so long it can tolerate inflation above 2%, would probably prefer to act ahead of time. If so, it is fast running out of opportunities \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/uk-wage-growth-interest-rate-rise-pay-unemployment\">the latest data on wage growth</a> won\u2019t help the case for an increase from 0.5%.</p> <p>At the start of the year, May was assumed to be the moment the Bank would move. Then \u201cthe beast from the east\u201d intervened in the form a sluggish 0.1% growth in first quarter GDP. Never mind, the Bank expected two things to happen while it waited for August. First, the economy would rebound. Second, with unemployment levels at multi-decade lows, signs of growth in real wages would become more obvious.</p> <p>The second assumption already looks questionable. Tuesday\u2019s data showed earnings growth including bonuses dropped by 0.1 points to 2.5% in the three months to April, implying barely visible growth in real wages since inflation stands at 2.4%. The City \u2013 and the Bank \u2013 expected more.</p> <p>Attention thus turns to the second-quarter GDP figures, to be unveiled at the end of July. In its May inflation report, the Bank expected 0.4%, confident that its surveys were detecting a brighter mood. If that figure is missed, another chance to raise the cost of borrowing will surely have to be surrendered. Instead, we\u2019ll be talking about how \u2013 once again \u2013 the Bank led everybody up the garden path. If it wanted a round or two of tightening to prepare for Brexit, the Bank should have started before last November</p> <h2>Get ready for the \u2018CVA clause\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s no wonder strong bricks\u2019n\u2019mortar retailers \u2013 there are still a few \u2013 are demanding \u201cCVA clauses\u201d on new leases so that they enjoy the same cheaper rents if landlords grant discounts to competitors. New Look, which secured rent reductions on 393 of its stores via its CVA in March, now says it won\u2019t immediately close 60 other shops it expected to shut this year. It seems many landlords don\u2019t want the expensive and hassle of managing empty shops and would rather have a tenant that pays no rent.</p> <p>That\u2019s good news for New Look and its staff, but you see why healthier rivals, who never clocked up the same enormous debt burdens, might see the process as basically unfair. It\u2019s hard to see how landlords are going to resist CVA clauses \u2013 the negotiating hand is weak and getting weaker.</p>",

Bartonville is one of four towns where the fast-food company has partnered with local administrations in order to help fix their broken roads. The project, called Paving for Pizza, is the first time Domino\u2019s have worked with local government to attempt an infrastructure project, although anyone who has experienced one of their thick, viscous cheese slices sinking to the bottom of their stomach might not be entirely surprised to learn that they\u2019re moving into the cement business.

So far, Domino\u2019s has made very little dent in that problem: across the four towns they\u2019ve worked in they\u2019ve fixed a couple of hundred potholes, but the majority of those were in Athens, Georgia.

      "bodyText": "For a cool $1m (\u00a3750,000) you can own your own ghost town. That figure will buy you an entire abandoned settlement, the former mining town of Cerro Gordo in the Inyo Mountains of California: 300 acres of land, an empty hotel, a saloon, a chapel and the homes of miners who once dug for silver and lead. In the 1870s, it was a violent place that averaged a murder a week. Nowadays, its private owners operate public tours at $10 a head for thrill-seekers. From video games to horror movies and dystopian film and fiction, the ghost town comes wreathed with decrepit appeal. Its abandoned state leaves it ready to be filled by our imagination. Time has stopped; nature has started to overtake. The result is both a memento mori and a salutary lesson in our overweening presumption that our world is always progressing. The ghost town shows us the opposite. In his book The Rings of Saturn, the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 WG Sebald \u2013 who was well aware of the terrible ghost towns created by the second world war and the Holocaust \u2013 writes of the way settlements develop to the west, moving on towards the sun, leaving behind the derelict and the dispossessed once resources \u2013 and people \u2013 have been used up. This is certainly true of the US, where land is expendable and exploitation is the founding economy, evoking scenes of tumbleweed and Hitchcockian gothic. Detroit\u2019s decayed status as Motown has left parts of the city vacated, as the car economy moved elsewhere, leaving entire districts prey to what has become known as \u201cruin porn\u201d. In western Europe, the ravages of the Black Death \u2013 which took the lives of more than one-third of the continent\u2019s medieval population \u2013 meant thousands of villages were abandoned and gave rise, eventually, to the darkness of the tales of the Brothers Grimm. In England, the Victorian visionary Richard Jefferies imagined a post apocalyptic metropolis in his book After London, in which the suburbs were quickly subsumed by nature. (In the alternative nightmare of another visionary, England Have My Bones by TH White, the opposite happens: London becomes so sprawling that the New Forest becomes a Tube stop). War and other military manoeuvres left British rural sites such as Tyneham in Dorset \u2013 evacuated for use as a training area in 1943 and never returned to its inhabitants \u2013 as skeletons of themselves, testaments to a forgotten mid-century and a kind of utopia. Patrick Wright, in his book The Village That Died For England, vividly describes Tyneham\u2019s stone ruins lying in a \u201cvalley of lost causes\u201d. He also notes that modern measures \u201ctaken to convert the village into a safe visitors\u2019 attraction have disenchanted the place\u201d. Health and safety have no place here. As the new owners of Cerro Gordo may learn, a tourist attraction is the antithesis of what such places symbolise: the defeat of our dominion and our attempts at civilisation, and the romantic allure of darkness, death and decay.",

That figure will buy you an entire abandoned settlement, the former mining town of Cerro Gordo in the Inyo Mountains of California: 300 acres of land, an empty hotel, a saloon, a chapel and the homes of miners who once dug for silver and lead. In the 1870s, it was a violent place that averaged a murder a week. Nowadays, its private owners <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/california/articles/mining-ghost-town-cerro-gordo-on-sale-in-california\" title=\"\">operate public tours at $10 a head for thrill-seekers</a>.</p> <p>From video games to horror movies and dystopian film and fiction, the ghost town comes wreathed with decrepit appeal.

      "bodyText": "Christian Louboutin has won a key legal case in a long-running battle to protect its signature red soles from copycats. On Tuesday, the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled vanHaren, a Dutch company, had infringed the brand\u2019s trademark by selling a range of red-soled shoes. Louboutin, whose shoes start at \u00a3500 for a classic black court, are staple footwear for the world\u2019s most famous women, with celebrities ranging from Kendall Jenner and Rihanna to Melania Trump seen wearing his skyscraper heels. The eponymous brand\u2019s scarlet soles date back to 1992, when the fashion designer painted a sole red with nail varnish borrowed from an assistant. The legal case centred on European trademark law that forbids the registration of shapes where they add substantial value to goods. In February, Louboutin appeared to suffer a setback when the ECJ advocate general Maciej Szpunar said the combination of a colour and shape could be refused trademark protection. But in the ruling on Tuesday, the court noted Louboutin was not seeking to protect the shape of a shoe, merely the application of a colour to a specific part of it. Elaine O\u2019Hare, an intellectual property specialist at the law firm Stevens &amp; Bolton, said: \u201cThe ECJ has not followed the recent recommendation of the advocate general and has instead ruled that Louboutin\u2019s red soles can in fact be protected as a trademark. \u201cThe case will now go back before the Dutch court, but it seems likely that Louboutin will be allowed to develop a monopoly for red-soled high-heeled shoes.\u201d In a statement, Louboutin said: \u201cFor 26 years, the red sole has enabled the public to attribute the origin of the shoe to its creator, Christian Louboutin. \u201cThis case will now be referred back to The Hague court, which is expected to confirm the validity of the red sole trademark.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of a summer increase in interest rates from the Bank of England has receded after the latest official figures showed a fall in wage inflation despite a fresh drop in unemployment. A near-stalling of the economy in the first quarter of 2018 failed to halt jobs growth but had an impact on earnings growth, which edged lower in the three months to the end of April, according to the Office for National Statistics. Esther McVey, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said: \u201cThe employment rate has never been higher \u2013 with over 3.3 million people moving into work since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s a Great British success story with businesses from Exeter to Edinburgh creating jobs \u2013 helping, on average 1,000 people find a job each and every day since 2010.\u201d Yet the ONS report on the state of the labour market showed no sign of mounting wage inflation and some signs of demand for workers slackening. There were 146,000 more people in work between February and April than in the previous three months, but the ONS said part-time work accounted for 103,000 of the increase. Average hours worked per employee fell slightly while the number of job vacancies held steady. Unemployment dropped by 38,000 in the three months to April, leaving the jobless total at 1.42 million. The unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2% was the lowest since 1975, while the proportion of the population of 16- to 64-year-olds in work (75.6%) was the highest since modern records began in 1971. Despite the fall in unemployment, however, earnings growth including bonuses dipped by 0.1 points to 2.5%, while earnings growth excluding bonuses dipped by a similar amount to 2.8%. The Bank\u2019s latest quarterly inflation report signalled that the fall in unemployment to its lowest level since the 1970s would lead to stronger earnings growth and necessitate a gradual increase in borrowing costs from 0.5%. The Bank said the economy would bounce back after virtually stalling in the first three months of 2018 and, as a result, financial markets have been gearing up for an August increase in interest rates to coincide with the publication of the next inflation report. Although earnings are rising slightly faster than prices, the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWage growth is stuck in the slow lane. At this rate pay packets won\u2019t recover to their pre-recession levels for years. \u201cWe need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create.\u201d Jeremy Thomson-Cook, the chief economist at WorldFirst, said: \u201cThe juxtaposition of today\u2019s increase in the employment rate to a record 75.6% and yesterday\u2019s news of lay-offs at both Poundworld and Jaguar Land Rover will be lost on nobody and we think that today\u2019s jobs report could soon be revealed as a high water mark for job creation.\u201d John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, an economic consultancy, said: \u201cThe increase in the number of people in work of 146,000 is smaller than in the previous quarter, as is the 38,000 fall in unemployment, though the cooling in market conditions is more noticeable in a fall of 0.3% in the total number of hours worked in the economy, driven by a sharp quarterly increase in the number of people working part-time.\u201d Philpott added: \u201cNonetheless, the slight weakening in labour market conditions is much milder than the slowdown in the economy as a whole indicating that the UK\u2019s now longstanding pattern of relatively job rich, low productivity, economic growth remains entrenched.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "US inflation hits six-year high; UK wage growth slows - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Wage growth in the UK has slowed, in the latest sign that British households is struggling. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the February-April period, down from 2.9% a month earlier. Total pay, including bonuses, only rose by 2.5% -- meaning inflation ate virtually all the increase. Unions warned that wage growth was too slow to help families recover from the financial crisis. Economists say the wage growth slowdown cuts the chance of interest rates rising in August. The government hailed the news that employment was at a record high. Unemployment remained at a 43-year low of 4.2%. American consumers are also being hit in the pocket, with CPI inflation hitting a six-year high last month. Energy costs were a key factor, as US citizens faced higher prices at the gasoline pumps Economists say the figures mean the Federal Reserve is certain to raise interest rates at the end of this month\u2019s meeting tomorrow (on Wednesday). The markets are subdued today, as investors digest the Trump-Kim summit. The FTSE 100 is down 16 points (0.2%), while the Dow Jones industrial average is down 21 points (-0.1%). Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says markets have \u201cmore pressing concerns\u201d. The long-term importance of the Korea-U.S. summit is obvious but the event itself was always going to be something of a sideshow. All eyes were on the topic of denuclearisation, and, just as importantly facilities to verify that, but whilst North Korea\u2019s Kim Jung Un reaffirmed \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to the aim, agreements appeared vague and their scope limited. Verification was discussed, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, in a lengthy post-summit presser, but he gave no indication of whether North Korea was inclined to move towards the kind of stringent corroboration needed. So, grounds for optimism on a new North-South Korea order remain, but talks have merely confirmed there\u2019s a long grind ahead to fulfil that promise. That may be all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Rating agency Moody\u2019s says America\u2019s central bank shouldn\u2019t panic at the sight of inflation jumping further above its target: Moody\u2019s says: U.S. inflationary pressures are gradually developing, not surprising given the rise in global commodity prices, the tightening in the domestic labor market, and above-trend GDP growth. The headline consumer price index increased 0.2% in May, matching the gain in April. Food prices were unchanged, while energy rose 0.9%. Excluding food and energy, the CPI was up a trend-like 0.2%. On a year-ago basis, the headline and core CPIs increased 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively. It\u2019s a slam dunk that the Fed will raise interest rates at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday, and odds favor that it signals a total of four rate hikes, rather than three, this year. Though policymakers sound hawkish, there is no immediate need to panic; the central bank should let inflation temporarily run above target. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam UK, reckons Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes are helping to push US inflation higher. \u201cUnderlying upward pressure from tariff discussions, tax cuts and low employment has helped stoke the inflationary fires. And while the Fed won\u2019t be too concerned about inflation ticking above its target, it does pave the way for an interest rate rise later this week. \u201cTrump\u2019s anti-trade policies have certainly added to this inflationary pressure. While the US president\u2019s negotiation style has often been more bluster than action, it looks like some tariffs will go live, and he doesn\u2019t seem too concerned about the short-term effects if it has a lasting impact in the longer term. However, [Federal Reserve chair Jerome] Powell will be keeping a watchful eye on the ongoing discussions and any further effects these may have on growth and inflation.\u201d Michael Pearce of Capital Economics points out that fuel and energy are getting more expensive: The increase in headline inflation to a six-year high of 2.8% in May is partly due to the rally in energy prices, but it is also reflects another solid monthly gain in core CPI, which will keep the Fed on course to raise interest rates tomorrow. We expect underlying inflation to trend gradually higher from here, which will prompt the Fed to hike rates twice in the second half of the year. A 1.7% m/m rise in gasoline prices last month pushed the energy index up by 0.9% m/m. Thanks also to the base effects caused by the 5.3% m/m drop in gasoline prices in May of last year, that rise in energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation up to 2.8%, from 2.5%. With crude oil prices stabilising in recent weeks, gasoline prices are likely to be more neutral for inflation over the rest of the year. Inflation is devouring most of America\u2019s pay rises, flags up economist Ulrik Bie: Greg Daco of Oxford Economics predicts America\u2019s central bankers will raise interest rates twice more this year, starting tomorrow. This chart from Bloomberg shows how US inflation has now running over the official 2% target for months, and is now at its highest level since 2012: BREAKING: Prices in America are rising at their fastest pace since 2012. The US consumer prices index rose to 2.8% per annum in May, up from 2.5% in April. That\u2019s a little higher than expected, and the highest inflation rate since February 2012. It surely means the Federal Reserve is certain to raise US interest rates on Wednesday. Prices rose by 0.2% during the month. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items) rose to 2.2%, another sign that inflationary pressure are building. European stock markets continue to be underwhelmed by the results of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un\u2019s historic summit in Singapore. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped into the red - down 20 points at 7718. The Frankfurt and Parisian markets are looking becalmed too. It\u2019s a lacklustre response to what Trump claimed was a \u201cvery important event in world history\u201d. However, it\u2019s not clear that the US president has achieved much, in return for granting Kim such as high-profile meeting. North Korea\u2019s commitment to \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d sounds good, but today\u2019s agreement doesn\u2019t include concrete targets. Of course, it will take more than one meeting to reach a truly momentous deal. Here\u2019s our analysis: There\u2019s also some surprise that Donald Trump has agreed to suspend \u201cWar Games\u201d in the region, on the grounds they are expensive, provocative and inappropriate. Dr Moritz Pieper, an expert in International Relations at the University of Salford, sees a long road ahead: \u201cThe historic meeting between Trump and Kim can be a first step in a longer-term process that might eventually see a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula and North Korean denuclearisation. \u201cBut both sides have different views of what denuclearisation means. The US line has always been that it wants to see complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme in return for aid and sanctions lifting \u2013 or relief. \u201cBut North Korea is unlikely to agree to give up its nuclear weapons. This is seen as North Korea\u2019s security guarantee \u2013 the nuclear deterrent is seen as key for regime survival. The president of ZEW, Achim Wambach, reckons German investors are being spooked by geopolitical perils: Explaining today\u2019s drop in sentiment, Wambach says: \u201cThe latest escalation in the trade dispute with the United States and fears about policies by the new Italian government that could destabilize the financial system are leaving their mark on the outlook for Germany. In another alarming development, optimism among German investors has sunk to its lowest in nearly six years. The ZEW institute\u2019s monthly index of morale has slumped to -16.1, down from the -8.2 recorded in May, and the lowest level since September 2012. The trade dispute between Europe and the US, and the election of a populist government in Italy, could be a nasty cocktail for German investors. They\u2019ve also seen exports and factory production fall this year, a sign that Europe\u2019s largest economy may be slowing down. Economists are concerned... The broader picture is that UK wages are still below their pre-financial crisis levels in real terms, and struggling to catch up: Public sector pay packets have lagged behind since 2015, \u2018thanks\u2019 to the government\u2019s pay cap on nurses, teachers et al. They suffered the brunt of the fall in real wages last year, as inflation ravaged pay packets. The slowdown in UK wage growth last month will concern the Bank of England, which has predicted that earnings will accelerate in 2018. Weak economic growth in the first quarter of this year prevented the BoE from raising interest rates in May. If wage growth remains weak, it could deter a rate hike this summer too. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects that UK interest rates may remain at 0.5% until 2019. The Bank views wage growth as a key indicator when considering whether to raise rates. Disappointing figures here, combined with confirmation that the economy grew by just 0.1% in Q1, should put paid to any talk of a summer rate rise. Policymakers had been thought to be considering raising rates in August, but I still think a rate rise this year looks unlikely. The Bank will almost certainly want confirmation that the Q1 growth figure was just a blip before raising borrowing costs. Women taking part-time jobs makes up the biggest proportion of job creation in the last year, followed by men taking full-time jobs. This helped to push the female employment rate to a record high of 71.3% (compared to 80% for men). Young Women\u2019s Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton OBE says more help is needed: \u201cThe record rate of women\u2019s employment is welcome, although the Office for National Statistics has pointed out that this is in part due to women retiring later. At the other end of the scale, young women are struggling to find work and make ends meet. \u201cYoung women tell us they want to work and be able to live independently but today\u2019s figures show that nearly half a million are still out of work and full-time education \u2013 11,000 more than this time last year. Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, says the steady job labour market is a \u201csuccess story\u201d: \u201cThe employment rate has never been higher \u2013 with over 3.3 million people moving into work since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s a Great British success story with businesses from Exeter to Edinburgh creating jobs \u2013 helping, on average 1,000 people find a job each and every day since 2010. \u201cAnd with the increase in the personal tax allowance, this Government has ensured that people are keeping more of their money before they begin paying tax \u2013 meaning more take-home pay, that\u2019s more money in your pocket for you and your family. At just 2.8%, UK pay growth is well below the 4.5% enjoyed in the run-up to the financial crisis. Conor D\u2019Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, says earnings growth remains disappointing: \u201cThe UK jobs market has continued to impress in 2018, with employment remaining at a record high and female unemployment falling to its lowest ever level. \u201cBut we\u2019re yet to see the good news on jobs feed into wage pressure, with nominal pay growth still below 3%. \u201cWhile the easing of inflationary pressures is helping pay packets to stretch that little bit further, there is still no sign of a long overdue pay rebound in Britain.\u201d Industrial unrest hit a record low in April, with fewer walkouts than ever before. The ONS reports that: there were 3,000 working days lost from five stoppages in April 2018, the lowest number of stoppages since monthly records began in January 1931 1,000 people took strike action, one of the lowest figures on record This highlights how union power has waned in Britain in recent years -- perhaps one reason that wage growth is now so mediocre. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is worried that UK wage growth is slowing: \u201cWhile pay is still outpacing price growth, the slowdown in earnings growth is a concern. Delivering sustained rises in real pay growth is likely to prove an uphill struggle amid weak productivity and a sluggish economy. As a consequence, household finances are likely to remain stretched, particularly given weak household savings and high debt levels. The slowdown in earnings growth, together with the recent weakness in a raft of other economic indicators, undermines the case for tightening monetary policy. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, fears that the UK labour market may have peaked. \u201cThe juxtaposition of today\u2019s increase in the employment rate to a record 75.6% and yesterday\u2019s news of lay-offs at both Poundworld and Jaguar Land Rover will be lost on nobody and we think that today\u2019s jobs report could soon be revealed as a high water mark for job creation.\u201d \u201cThe recent claimant count trend has been increasing \u2013 it sits at 3\u00bd year high currently - and employment readings within the PMI sentiment surveys have been deteriorating so an increase in joblessness soon would not come as surprise. This could also contribute to a slowing of wage gains, something that we have seen already this month.\u201d This wage slowdown means that real basic pay growth in the UK (basic earnings minus inflation) remains just 0.4%. And total real pay growth is zero -- with inflation eating up pay and bonuses. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has warned that wage growth is \u201cstuck in the slow lane\u201d. At this rate pay packets won\u2019t recover to their pre-recession levels for years. \u201cWe need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create. The number of unemployed people in the UK dropped by 38,000 in the last quarter, to 1.42 million. Today\u2019s jobs data is weaker than expected, says Reuters\u2019 Andy Bruce: Britain\u2019s employment rate has now been at a record high of 75.6% for two months running - a record dating back to at least 1971. At 4.2%, the unemployment rate hasn\u2019t been lower since March-May 1975: But this apparent strength is not reaching workers\u2019 pockets. Regular pay growth is now dropping, having hit its highest level since 2015 last month. Newsflash: Wage growth in the UK has slowed, even though the economy continues to create jobs. Basic pay growth slowed to 2.8% per year in the three months to April, the latest labour market report shows. That\u2019s down from 2.9% a month ago, suggesting that wage growth is faltering. Total pay growth (including bonuses) also slowed, to 2.5% from 2.6%. The unemployment rate, though, remains at just 4.2% - its lowest level in 43 years. And the economy continued to create jobs -- 146,000 new workers were taken on in the last quarter, down from 197,000 in the January-March quarter. The ONS says: There were 32.39 million people in work, 146,000 more than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 440,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.6%, higher than for a year earlier (74.8%) and the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.42 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 38,000 fewer than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 115,000 fewer than for a year earlier. More to follow! Economist Shaun Richards says we should watch out for total wage growth in today\u2019s jobs report (that\u2019s pay including bonuses). It dropped to 2.6% last month, down from 2.8%. Overnight, Larry Kudlow - the director of Donald Trump\u2019s National Economic Council - was hospitalised after suffering a heart attack. Trump broke the news on Twitter, shortly before his summit with Kim. Kudlow, a former TV personality and Wall Street economist, only joined the White House in March. He\u2019s an important advisor to Trump, and a supporter of free trade, and it\u2019s not clear who might cover his duties while he recuperates. Kudlow hit the headlines on Sunday after accusing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of \u201cessentially double-crossing President Trump\u201d. Paul Donovan of UBS thinks investors should focus on the crisis at the G7, rather than Trumps\u2019s meeting with Kim. He explains: The US president seems to have a better relationship with the North Korean leader than with the Canadian leader. Markets don\u2019t care too much about North Korea. Markets do care about US relations with Canada. Sue Trinh of RBC says investors shouldn\u2019t get too excited by Kim\u2019s pledge to work towards \u2018complete denuclearisation\u201d of the Korean peninsula. Both sides stand far, far apart on what denuclearisation means. To the US, it means NK must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. To Kim, it means NK suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the US stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region (basically dismantling its alliance with South Korea and ultimately the region as a whole). Kim has never announced the intention of abandoning his existing nuclear arsenal, which he calls a \u201ctreasured sword\u201d. Per previous peace deals, the main issue will be the pace of implementation, which includes agreement on a verification protocol. South Korean President Moon suggested it could be the start of a process lasting up to two years or longer. So let\u2019s get back to what really matters for markets for the time being \u2013 next up, US CPI, voting on the EU Withdrawal Bill and the FOMC and ECB meetings. European stock markets have opened higher as traders digest the historic US-North Korea summit in Singapore. After holding hours of talks, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down before the world\u2019s media and signed a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 agreement, pledging to work towards peace on the Korean peninsula. Photos of the document also show that North Korea has committed to \u201cwork towards\u201d complete denuclearisation. That\u2019s a welcome aspiration, but not a full-blooded commitment it will actually happen. Kim hasn\u2019t agreed to any explicit missile reductions, for example. But still, the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4% in early trading, on relief that the Singapore event has gone better than the G7 summit. Trump declared that the two leaders had enjoyed a \u201creally fantastic meeting\u201d, while Kim spoke about \u201ca big prelude to peace\u201d. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up a modest 6 points. We\u2019re tracking all the developments here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn how Britain\u2019s labour market is faring, as the warning lights flash on the UK economy. Overnight, recruitment firm ManpowerGroup has reported that company bosses are at their most pessimistic since 2012 -- due to worries over Brexit and the high street slowdown. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Watched by the Bank of England and the government for early warnings of hiring spurts or downturns, the quarterly poll of about 2,000 major employers from nine different industry sectors across the UK found a net balance of only 4% planning to hire more staff rather than cutting back. The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer. With manufacturing output hitting a six-year low yesterday, and construction output also disappointing, the economy appears to be at its weakest point since the eurozone crisis was raging six years ago. So, today\u2019s unemployment figures will be scrutinised for signs of weakness. Economists are expecting the jobless rate to remain at 4.2% in April, a 43-year low, with basic pay rises unchanged at 2.9%. But, the number of jobs created over the last quarter could drop to around 110,000, from 197,000 in the three months to March. That could signal that the labour market is cooling. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains: Even though there have been a number of large surprises to the upside in the employment data over the last six months, it will be very difficult for gains in employment to match last month\u2019s very strong +197k 3/3m. For the unemployment rate, we expect it to remain at 4.2% for a third consecutive month. As ever, average wages will be the more closely watched measure, but on this occasion we don\u2019t expect major changes and look for the excluding-bonus measure to remain 2.9% 3m/yr. Also coming up today It\u2019s a big day for Brexit, as parliament votes on an amendment to give MPs give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. This would put the House of Commons in charge if MPs were to reject the government\u2019s final divorce deal was rejected by MPs into the hands of the Commons. It aims to avoid MPs facing a choice between the government\u2019s deal or no deal, but Brexiters fear it could lead to a second referendum. Sterling could be volatile if Theresa May fails to block the amendment. We also get the latest American inflation figures. The annual US CPI is expected to rise to 2.7%, from 2.5% in May, as the cost of living accelerates. The US Federal Reserve is already expected to raise interest rates tomorrow, following a two-day meeting starting today.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP directors are braced for a chastening showdown with investors over their handling of the resignation of Sir Martin Sorrell, whose departure from the empire he ruled for 33 years has triggered lurid allegations of personal misconduct. The world\u2019s largest advertising company will face protest votes at Wednesday\u2019s annual meeting, the first since Sorrell\u2019s resignation in April. A group of shareholders will vote against WPP\u2019s pay policy, which is set to hand Sorrell future share awards worth up to \u00a320m, despite a lack of information about the reasons for his departure. Several investors will also oppose the re-election of chairman Roberto Quarta, amid concern about his management of the crisis and his capacity to assume a more hands-on role while the firm seeks a new chief executive. WPP has been embarrassed by a string of allegations \u2013 strenuously denied by Sorrell \u2013 that have leaked into the public domain about the advertising and marketing guru\u2019s behaviour. Claims have emerged that WPP staff said they witnessed the 73-year-old entering a premises used by sex workers, leading to concerns that the alleged visit was paid for with company money. The report, in the Financial Times, was accompanied by further allegations from inside WPP about his use of company resources and that he created a \u201cfear culture\u201d by bullying staff. He has vehemently denied the allegations but has refused to elaborate, citing a non-disclosure agreement signed with WPP when he left. Despite the secrecy, WPP\u2019s pay policy allows Sorrell to pick up future share awards worth up to \u00a320m because he is designated a \u201cgood leaver\u201d. Shareholder advisory groups including Glass Lewis, Pirc and Hermes EOS have recommended voting against the pay deal, saying opacity around his departure makes it hard for investors to assess whether he is entitled to it. City investment firm Royal London Asset Management said it would vote against the pay report but not due to Sorrell\u2019s exit package. Instead it cited \u201creally high levels of incentive pay on offer during 2017\u201d, when WPP handed Sorrell a pay deal worth \u00a348m, a year after investors protested against an even more generous package worth \u00a370m, one of the largest in UK corporate history. RLAM will also vote against the reappointment of company pay chief Sir John Hood over \u201clong-held concerns on pay\u201d and will abstain on the reappointment of Quarta. The investment firm has doubts over Quarta\u2019s ability to juggle the executive chairmanship of WPP with his chairman\u2019s role at FTSE100 medical supplies firm Smith &amp; Nephew. The two giant US pension funds Calstrs and Calpers have published their votes, with the former set to vote against Quarta but not WPP\u2019s pay report, while Calpers protests on pay but backs directors. As well as Quarta\u2019s multiple jobs, the Italian-American businessman is expected to face criticism over a lack of succession planning and the fact that Sorrell was not bound by a non-compete clause preventing him from setting up a rival. The industry veteran, who took over a wire shopping basket maker in 1985 and turned into the world\u2019s largest advertising empire comprising a network of 400 companies, has already set up a new venture called S4. He has put \u00a340m of his own money into the company, topped up by a \u00a311m from investors, and has said he wants to make acquisitions in \u201cdata, technology and content\u201d. Financial backers have made commitments to plough in a further \u00a3150m to fund buyouts. They are understood to include financier Lord Rothschild, Toscafund founder Martin Hughes, Saracens rugby club owner Nigel Wray, investment firm Schroders, private bank Lombard Odier and asset manager Miton. Mark Read, WPP\u2019s chief operating officer appeared to make a pitch to succeed Sorrell on Tuesday, sending an email to all staff promising a review of the company\u2019s rules around conduct. Read, chief executive of WPP\u2019s digital marketing agency Wunderman, reminded staff of the company\u2019s \u201cvalues\u201d following bullying allegations against Sorrell. \u201cWhen I come to work I expect to be treated with respect by my colleagues, and every one of you reading this has the right to expect the same,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will no doubt have read the press coverage this week about WPP and Martin Sorrell, including allegations about his behaviour towards people at the parent company. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t comment on specific allegations, I feel we should remind ourselves of and reinforce the kind of values we want and need to have within every part of our business: values of fairness, tolerance, kindness and \u2013 again \u2013 respect. \u201cIt should hardly need saying that all WPP working environments must be places where people feel safe and supported. They must also be places where people are able to raise concerns if they want to, and where those concerns are dealt with when they need to be.\u201d WPP could also face a class action lawsuit after US specialist law firm Pomerantz said it was investigating concerns raised by investors about potential securities fraud and \u201cunlawful business practices\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The struggling New Look fashion chain has plunged to a huge annual loss of nearly \u00a3235m after a tumultuous year, which included the return of its former boss Alistair McGeorge to attempt a second turnaround of the heavily indebted chain. \u201cThere was no way I could stop these numbers happening, it was preordained by the time I joined,\u201d McGeorge said. He blamed the dire performance \u2013 including a near 20% plunge in website sales \u2013 on the previous management team chasing a \u201cyoung and edgy\u201d audience. \u201cWe lost connection with our core customers and got our stock packages wrong,\u201d McGeorge said. The grim New Look results contrasted sharply with rocketing sales at its online rival Boohoo and provided new evidence of the gulf between the physical and digital high street. Overall sales at UK New Look stores open for more than a year slumped nearly 12% in the year to 24 March. Total turnover fell by \u00a3107m to \u00a31.3bn. The chain is owned by Brait, a private-equity firm whose biggest shareholder is the South African tycoon Christo Wiese. Brait paid \u00a3780m for a majority stake in New Look in 2015 and the retailer is now saddled with a \u00a31.2bn debt pile. In March New Look launched a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency used to jettison unwanted stores. Under the restructuring plan up to 60 of New Look\u2019s 593 stores were expected to close while the rent on nearly 400 other branches was cut, shaving \u00a340m off its annual rent bill. However McGeorge said he did not expect any stores to shut this year after all because, as a result of the wave of other CVAs from retailers including House of Fraser and Mothercare, landlords were increasingly reluctant to take back the keys and cover the running costs on empty units themselves. As a result, New Look may end up occupying stores rent free. \u201cWe are not in any rush to shut them if it is in our gift,\u201d McGeorge said. Many retailers with large estates are struggling to absorb big increases in business rates as well as as higher labour costs as a result of the national minimum wage and apprenticeship levy. At the same time, Britons are cutting back spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash. In the latest sign of the distress caused by this cocktail discount chain Poundworld crashed into administration on Monday, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk. Boohoo, owner of the fast-growing PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, is winning sales from traditional high street retailers by targeting a generation that shops via their mobiles and takes its style cues from Instagram. Group sales were up 52% to \u00a3183.6m in the three months to 31 May but the star performers were PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, where sales had more than doubled in the period. Boohoo shares were down 2% at 215p at lunchtime on Tuesday; two years ago they were changing hands at 58p. The House of Fraser CVA, which involves the proposed closure of 31 of its 59 stores, is proving controversial with landlords who are angry they being asked to take a hit while other creditors are unaffected. \u201cA CVA will not save a poor brand,\u201d said McGeorge. \u201cFor us it dealt with our over-rented position and stopped us running out of money. Landlords would have come out of an administration in a much worse position.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The fair work ombudsman has launched legal action against Foodora, alleging its food couriers should be classed as employees rather than independent contractors. In what could become a landmark case for the gig economy, the ombudsman is arguing that Foodora workers are entitled to the minimum award wage, and the company should be fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for underpayment, sham contracting and breaches of the Fair Work Act. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Foodora and other companies like UberEats and Deliveroo class their workers as independent contractors. This means they are not entitled to award wages, penalty rates, leave or other protections under the Fair Work Act that employees receive. Some food app riders say they end up earning as little as $6 an hour. Foodora riders are paid per delivery, and in May a spokeswoman said the current rate was between $7 and $9 per delivery. The claim, filed in the federal court on Tuesday, focuses on three Foodora couriers: two 19-year-olds from Melbourne and a 30-year-old from Sydney. The fair work ombudsman, Natalie James, said the level of control that Foodora exerted over the three workers meant that they were legally employees. \u201cCourts have found again and again that merely labelling the relationship to be one of independent contracting does not make it so,\u201d she said. \u201cThe activity of delivering food from restaurants and fast food outlets to customers is not new, and nor is the \u2018test\u2019 for what determines who is and is not an employee entitled to award rates.\u201d Foodora and other delivery companies argue that their workers are contractors because they provide their own bikes and vehicles, have the flexibility to choose when to work, and can refuse or delegate work. In 2001 a landmark high court case found that bicycle couriers who were forced to wear the uniform of their courier company were employees, not contractors. However, in the UK, a court found in November that Deliveroo riders were in fact contractors. Current Australian labour law holds that a mix of multiple factors of control will determine whether a worker is an independent contractor or employee. James said the ombudsman\u2019s investigation into the three Foodora workers showed a high level of control \u2013 including the fact that riders had to wear branded uniforms. She said Foodora exercised control over the workers\u2019 hours, location and manner of work; and the fact that Foodora riders could not negotiate pay, and could not develop their own customer base while working meant they were not independent contractors. The ombudsman claims the three workers were underpaid by $1,620.74 over four weeks, and also missed out on superannuation. If found to be in contravention of the Fair Work Act, Foodora could be penalised $54,000 for each contravention. The Transport Workers Union is also arguing for delivery riders to be considered employees, and has filed legal action against Foodora for unfair dismissal on behalf of several couriers. The union\u2019s national secretary, Tony Sheldon, said app-based food delivery needed to be regulated. \u201cThe sham-contracting comes as no surprise to the thousands of delivery riders,\u201d he said. \u201cBut action must go broader than just one company and just a few riders. This area is crying out for regulation.\u201d A Foodora spokeswoman said the company would not comment while the matter was before the courts. \u201cHowever, Foodora will be defending the claims and accusations that have been made against the business,\u201d she said. The ombudsman\u2019s case will proceed to a case management hearing in Sydney on 10 July.",
