      "bodyText": "House of Fraser had debts of close to \u00a31bn when it collapsed, with more than half owed to suppliers ranging from Polo Ralph Lauren and Mulberry to Liam Gallagher\u2019s Pretty Green fashion label. The department store hasclosed down its website, cancelled orders and reimbursed customers after a dispute with its warehouse operator, XPO, to whom it owed more than \u00a330m when it went into administration last Friday. More than 1,000 suppliers will not receive any money from the company\u2019s administrator, EY, which was called in ahead of the sale of the retailer to Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct for \u00a390m. Sports Direct is in discussions with suppliers about potential deals, but has so far only promised to cover money owed after Ashley bought the business. The purchase price went towards paying off House of Fraser\u2019s banks and bondholders, which together were owed about \u00a3400m. XPO is the biggest trade creditor followed by Ralph Lauren, which was owed \u00a39.4m, the footwear retailer Kurt Geiger, which was owed \u00a34.9m, and the women\u2019s fashion brand Phase Eight, which was owed \u00a33.4m. The details of the debts were revealed in a report from EY. The report showed a range of fashion and beauty brands were owed more than \u00a32m, including Tommy Hilfiger (owed \u00a33.3m), Barbour (\u00a33m), Mint Velvet (\u00a32.5m), Mulberry (\u00a32.4m) and L\u2019Or\u00e9al (\u00a32m). Pretty Green, the fashion label launched by Gallagher, the former Oasis frontman, was owed just over \u00a3500,000, while Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and Jacques Vert \u2013 who fought Ashley for ownership of House of Fraser as it collapsed \u2013 was owed nearly \u00a33m. Sports Direct has no legal obligation to pay suppliers money owed before its buyout as the debts were part of the administration. However, new owners often agree to settle at least some of the debts in the interest of good relations. Some fashion suppliers have taken action while negotiations over payments continue. Jigsaw has removed stock from 20 stores, and brands including Karen Millen and Mint Velvet are also understood to have withdrawn some stock. These brands run concessions in House of Fraser stores and therefore own unsold items. Ownership of that stock was not passed to administrators or included in Sports Direct\u2019s purchase. Pensioners are also likely to lose out under the deal. The House of Fraser pension fund has not been taken on by Ashley and will be assessed by the industry-funded lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund. It is likely to be sold to a specialist insurance fund, but the higher costs involved in that process mean the House of Fraser fund could be more than \u00a3160m in deficit, so members yet to draw a pension will not get their full benefits. More than 15 parties expressed an interest in buying House of Fraser, according to the administrator\u2019s report, but only six made formal offers. The report said Day put in a \u00a3100m offer for the business, but \u201cthis party communicated that they could not justify the transaction commercially and they were withdrawing their interest\u201d. It is understood that Day disputes this description of events, arguing his bid was only withdrawn because he did not agree with how money would be distributed to debtors. Ashley has said he wants to create the \u201cHarrods of the high street\u201d, with the aim of keeping 47 of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 stores open \u2013 nearly 20 more than had been planned by its previous owners. He has already begun negotiations with landlords, but at least 15 are understood to have approached Day with hopes of securing a better deal. Sports Direct is running House of Fraser\u2019s stores under licence from EY, so he is free to hand back the keys without penalty on any store he does not want. Ashley is understood to be close to signing an agreement to secure the flagship Oxford Street site, but no deal had been confirmed on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Insurers are bracing themselves for a spike in subsidence claims after this summer\u2019s heatwave led to cracks appearing in walls across south-east England. Several big-name insurers have reported that subsidence incidents are up 20% on this time last year. The fear is that that those returning from holidays will see fresh damage and in September there will be an influx of substantial claims. Homes built on clay are particularly susceptible to subsidence during long, dry summers because trees and shrubs suck all the available moisture from the soil, causing buildings to shift on their foundations. Virtually no rain fell over the south-east in June, the lowest amount recorded since 1925, triggering a spate of cracks. Heather Smith, the managing director of LV=\u2019s general insurance business, said: \u201cHomes across the UK have certainly been suffering as a result of the heatwave and in July alone reports of subsidence were up by 20% compared to the same time last year. \u201cHowever, in the last few days, parts of the country have received some much-needed rain, which has started to normalise the soil surrounding our homes and we\u2019ve already started to receive reports of subsidence claims reducing in some parts of the country.\u201d Insurers have identified the 226 postcodes that are most susceptible to subsidence claims, mostly where homes are built on clay. They all lie to the south-east of a line drawn across from the Humber down to the Severn. Subsidence has been a particular problem in London \u2013 especially south of the Thames. The most obvious sign that a householder has a problem is the appearance of large diagonal cracks in internal and external walls. Doors and windows can become impossible to open. Cracks caused by subsidence tend to be wider at the bottom. Home insurance premiums have risen in recent months, partly in expectation of an increase in subsidence claims, which have cost the industry as much as \u00a3540m in previous years. Britain\u2019s last serious heatwave in the summer of 2003 resulted in subsidence claims of \u00a3390m, according to the Association of British Insurers. In a normal year, it said insurers would expect to pay out \u00a375m to rectify the impact of subsidence on homes. Since their peak in 1991, when subsidence claims topped \u00a3540m, payouts have fallen steadily, in part because insurers have taken a tougher stance with claimants. The AA recently warned that \u201cshoparound\u201d home insurance premiums were rising at a rate of 5.3%, on the back of cold weather claims from frozen pipes in January and in expectation of more heatwave-related subsidence claims. Kevin Pratt, an insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket, said anyone forced to claim would face a battle to find affordable cover, with excesses of \u00a35,000 for subsidence claims increasingly common \u2013 if cover is offered at all.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has told the US securities regulator to consider abandoning quarterly reporting \u2013 a practice criticised as too short-term by some businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Trump said a leading company boss told him switching to twice-yearly disclosure of accounts would reduce costs and be good for business. If enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the change could allow more UK companies to join a trend away from quarterly reports. The US president tweeted: Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, has criticised the short-term thinking of analysts and investors. Explaining earlier this month why he was considering taking the electric carmaker private, he told employees: \u201cBeing public \u2026 subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter but not necessarily right for the long-term.\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s boss, Jamie Dimon, and Warren Buffett, the world\u2019s richest investor, argued earlier this year that companies should stop publishing quarterly earnings guidance that puts too much weight on hitting short-term targets. However, they said quarterly reporting should stay because it made companies accountable to the public. Quarterly reporting has been a fixture of US corporate life since the Great Depression. Trump cannot order the SEC to scrap the practice and a rethink could face fierce opposition from some of the regulator\u2019s commissioners. The Trump administration has been dismantling regulations \u2013 including relaxing post-crisis banking rules and limits on drilling for oil in Alaska \u2013 claiming less red tape will help business and create jobs. In the UK, half-yearly reporting was the norm until 2007, when companies were told to publish quarterly statements between their first half and annual results. Then, regulators believed more frequent reporting would hold companies to account but the financial crisis prompted a rethink. The UK removed the requirement to report quarterly in 2014, resulting in many companies abandoning the practice. In the year to August 2017, the number of FTSE 100 companies reporting quarterly fell from 70 to 57. For more UK-focused midsize companies in the FTSE 250 the number fell from 111 to 83. The Investment Association, which represents big UK fund managers, has been encouraging companies to ditch quarterly reports, arguing it is costly and distracting. Chris Cummings, the Investment Association\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAsking the SEC to study the effect of quarterly reporting, with a view to moving to a longer-term model, is a significant and positive intervention by the president. We look forward to working with the SEC on this important development in corporate governance.\u201d Unilever\u2019s chief executive, Paul Polman, scrapped quarterly reporting when he took over in 2009. He told investors that Unilever\u2019s plans were long term and that if they did not agree with his move they should put their money elsewhere. The 2012 Kay review of equity markets argued against the \u201ctyranny\u201d of short-term reporting that had arguably driven some banks close to collapse. When National Grid ditched quarterly reporting it said management would gain an extra month a year to think about subjects other than presenting figures to the City.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Turkish lira has taken another battering today, falling 5% to 6.1 to the dollar (it lost nearly 7% at one stage) and the Turkish stock market is down 1%. It has been a tumultuous week that saw the lira go into meltdown on Monday when it hit a record low of 7.2 against the dollar and the panic spread to other emerging markets. A pledge by Turkey\u2019s central bank to provide liquidity to banks and other measures, a pledge from Qatar to provide $15bn in loans to Turkey, and reassuring words from the finance minister yesterday helped calm nerves. But this afternoon, a Turkish court rejected a US pastor\u2019s appeal for release, a day after the United States warned of further sanctions unless Ankara hands over Andrew Brunson, who is under house arrest. Reuters reported that a court in the western province of Izmir rejected an appeal to release the paster, saying evidence was still being collected and he posed a potential flight risk, according to a copy of the court ruling seen by the news agency. The lira has lost nearly 40% of its value against the dollar this year. The currency crisis has deepened concerns about the Turkish economy, in particular its dependence on energy imports and its foreign-currency debt burden. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u2019s sovereign credit rating after the markets close today. Turkish markets will be closed from midday on Monday for the rest of the week for the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival. European stock markets are down \u2013 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.4% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.7% France\u2019s CAC down 0.5% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.9% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.3% On Wall Street, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq are flat. We are closing the blog for today. Have a great weekend. We\u2019ll be back next week. Even so, Schmieding reckons that the impact on the eurozone will be very limited. He says: Exports: The eurozone earns 0.57% of its GDP by selling goods to Turkey. Even a 20% fall in exports to Turkey would not subtract more than 0.1ppt from annual Eurozone GDP growth. As global demand remains healthy, eurozone firms could likely contain the damage further by switching to other markets for some of these affected goods with only modest reductions in their selling prices. Financial linkages: Spain, France and Italy are the most exposed eurozone countries to Turkey. According to BIS data, the exposure to Turkey of banks domiciled in these countries stands at $81bn for Spain, $35bn for France and $18bn for Italy. A major part of this consists of equity stakes in Turkish banks rather than in more dangerous intra-company loans or direct credit exposure. Turkish losses may well affect individual institutions in the Eurozone visibly. Still, eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were during the 2011-2012 euro crisis which had come right in the wake of the 2008/2009 mega-recession. The risk that the exposure of some banks to Turkey could turn into a systemic problem for the eurozone and/or cause a tightening of credit conditions in Spain, Italy or France remains remote. Confidence effect: The real risk stems from the level of noise. Confidence and hence the readiness to spend and invest often drives the business cycle. As confidence is currently fickle with no established trend, even small but highly visible problems can nourish the feeling that the world is a dangerous place rather than full of exciting opportunities. We therefore see a clear risk that any noisy crisis - such as the Turkish turmoil - could take some toll on the Eurozone and retard the upturn in markets and business sentiment for a while. Holger Schmieding, economist at Germany\u2019s Berenberg, says the bank has lowered its year-end forecasts for the euro to $1.17 from $1.21, due to the Turkey crisis. Turkey is no small fry. It contributes 1% to global GDP. Beyond the obvious geopolitical concerns, a major Turkish recession would pose a significant challenge for financial markets and for other economies. Remembering the tremors which Turkey\u2019s smaller neighbour Greece once sent through European and global markets, investors are understandably nervous. Adding to concerns about Italy\u2019s 2019 budget and Brexit uncertainty, the noise from Turkey could delay the rebound in eurozone business confidence and growth for a few more months despite the easing of US-EU trade tensions. Over in the US, Donald Trump has revealed that he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into whether American companies should report earnings on a half-year, rather than a quarterly basis. The Turkish lira is still down 5.4% on the day, with one dollar buying 6.14 lira. The Turkish stock market has turned positive, however, gaining 0.6%. Other emerging markets currencies are also under pressure, with the Mexian peso down 0.7% and the South African rand losing 0.9%. European stock markets have turned negative, after a Turkish court rejected the US pastor Andrew Brunson\u2019s appeal for release. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.46% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.58% France\u2019s CAC down 0.28% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1.2% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.4% Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has tweeted: He wrote earlier this morning: A $15bn rescue package from Qatar, and a limited package of exchange controls in limiting banks\u2019 ability to take out short positions has bought the Turkish lira some brief respite in the last few days, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves here, unless president Erdogan takes steps to restore confidence in his stewardship of the Turkish economy then we could well see the lira come under further pressure. The US doesn\u2019t appear in any mood to relieve the pressure on the Turkish government in securing the release of their pastor, if recent comments from vice President Mike Pence, and Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin are any guide. President Erdogan may be able to defray some of the risks to the Turkish economy by trying to improving his ties with Germany and Russia, but if the US really wanted to turn the screws it\u2019s unlikely that these countries would be able to do much about it. One currency trader told Reuters that the weakness of the lira was driven by the \u201cnew US sanctions threat and the S&amp;P decision, with position-closing in markets ahead of the public holiday\u201d. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u2019s sovereign credit rating after markets close today. Next week, the Turkish markets will be closed for Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, from Tuesday until Friday. The Turkish stock market has slid 1.3% today. William Jackson of Capital Economics said: There has been no sign that the central bank will be allowed to raise interest rates significantly and return rates to positive territory. Similarly, there has been no improvement in relations with the US, and additional sanctions may be on the horizon. The Turkish lira is under pressure again, falling nearly 7% against the dollar at one stage to 6.24. It is now trading at 6.04, down 4% on the day. The currency has lost almost 40% against the dollar this year, hit by a diplomatic row with the US and and investor concerns about the country\u2019s financial policies and its foreign-currency debts. The independence of the Turkish central bank and its finance minister have been called into question. The central bank is refusing to raise interest rates to curb inflation, with Turkish president Erdo\u011fan opposed to rate hikes. The appointment of his son-in-law Berat Albayrak as finance and treasury minister last month also alarmed investors, although Albayrak managed to calm nerves yesterday when he addressed thousands of investors and analysts on a conference call. After nearly nine years of financial crises and austerity, Greece is about to come out of its third bailout programme \u2013 on Monday, at midnight. Greece borrowed more than \u20ac288bn from international creditors in the biggest bailout in history. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said earlier this week that Turkey\u2019s woes would not affect Greece\u2019s exit from the bailout. He said: A clean exit is based on the following: the Eurogroup agreement on Greece\u2019s debt management, and the cash buffer the government has created which guarantees that the public sector\u2019s funding needs will be met in the next two or three years. Therefore, the Greek government\u2019s plans are not affected by short-term turmoil in the markets. On 21 August, Greece is turning the page, and this is final. You can read more here. According to the Deutsche Bank economist Oliver Harvey, the UK, Germany and the US have lent the most to Turkey, says Ed Conway, economics editor at the Times. We are trying to get hold of the note... Turkish president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s administration has been adamant that it won\u2019t have to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Qatar pledged about $15bn in loans on Wednesday but provided few details. Turkey and its companies face repayments of nearly $3.8bn on foreign currency bonds in October, according to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The country\u2019s currency woes has sparked worries about Turkey\u2019s external debts and the ability of its firms and banks to repay them. For companies, the cost of servicing their foreign borrowings has risen by a quarter in the past two months, due to the sharp fall in the lira. Jason Daw at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said: Turkey\u2019s external financing requirements are large (IMF estimates around $250bn per year). It has the highest foreign-exchange-denominated debt in emerging markets and short-term external debt of $180bn and total external debt of $460bn. According to his calculations, Turkish firms have $1.8bn of foreign-currency denominated bonds maturing by the end of the year while $1.25bn of government bonds also come due. There is $2.3bn in interest payments. The worst month for repayments is October, when $3bn in principal and $762m in interest are due. Daw said: Principal and interest payments should be close watched to year-end \u2013 it is 25% more costly for the corporate sector to repay their obligations compared to June given FX depreciation. How will Turkey roll over existing debt? Refinancing via the bond market could be challenging. An IMF support would be the logical place to seek financing. It is unlikely that Turkey would request, or be granted a package given current diplomatic tensions, Erdogan\u2019s rhetoric, and the restrictive fiscal and monetary policy conditions policymakers would need to abide by. Chinese banks have been lending to infrastructure projects and local banks in the last six months and this could increase. Inflation in the eurozone has been confirmed at 2.1% in July \u2013 above the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. The annual rate rose from 2% in June, pushed up by higher energy costs, according to the European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat. This means the ECB can push ahead with plans to end its bond purchasing programme by the end of the year, and possibly raise interest rates next year. Inflation was highest in Estonia (3.3%), Latvia and Belgium (both 2.7%), while Greece and Ireland posted the slowest inflation rates, of 0.8% and 1% respectively. Once all 28 EU countries are included, Romania had the highest inflation rate, of 4.3%. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, the parent of Pimco where he served as chief executive, and the former chairman of Barack Obama\u2019s Global Development Council, writes: Can Turkey rewrite the rulebook for crises in emerging markets? By rejecting the conventional approach, Erdo\u011fan risks greater trouble \u2013 and not just for Turkey. Whether by accident or design, Turkey is trying to rewrite the chapter on crisis management in the emerging-market playbook. Rather than opting for interest-rate hikes and an external funding anchor to support domestic policy adjustments, the government has adopted a mix of less direct and more partial measures \u2013 and this at a time when Turkey is in the midst of an escalating tariff tit-for-tat with the US, as well as operating in a more fluid global economy. How all this plays out is important not only for Turkey, but also for other emerging economies that already have had to cope with waves of financial contagion. The initial phases of Turkey\u2019s crisis were a replay of past emerging-market currency crises. A mix of domestic and external events \u2013 an over-stretched credit-led growth strategy; concerns about the central bank\u2019s policy autonomy and effectiveness; and a less hospitable global liquidity environment, owing in part to rising US interest rates \u2013 destabilised the foreign-exchange market. You can read the full article here. The euro is rising for a second day, heading towards $1.14, after coming under pressure on concerns over the exposure of major European banks to Turkey, after the lira went into meltdown. There is a sense of relief in financial markets today, following the news that Beijing will resume trade talks with Washington next week, although at a lower level than previously. It is the first round of trade talks since June and offers some hope to those worried about the impact of the tit-for-tat trade war on the world economy. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Although the chances of a breakthrough deal from lower-level talks are seen as unlikely, the meeting could be a positive step towards easing trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The Turkish lira has staged a remarkable recovery since Monday\u2019s meltdown when it hit a record low below 7.23 to the dollar. The currency is currently trading at 5.79, up 0.4% on the day. While the Turkish authorities have been criticised for adopting half-measures, the lira was thrown a lifeline on Wednesday when Qatar pledged to shore up Turkey\u2019s shaky finances with loans worth $15bn. Yesterday, finance minister Albayrak managed to calm nerves during a conference call with thousands of investors, although this was later marred by news from Washington that Turkey faces more sanctions if the US paster Andrew Brunson is not freed. It\u2019s pretty quiet on the corporate front as well. Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that its deputy chief financial officer Katie Murray will stand in as interim finance chief after Ewen Stevenson leaves on 30 September to go to HSBC on a \u00a310.6m deal. A search for a successor for Stevenson is under way, RBS said. The FTSE 100 index in London has opened flat, trading down 2.5 points at 7553.84. Germany\u2019s Dax is also flat, France\u2019s CAC is up 0.1%, Spain\u2019s Ibex has gained 0.2% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has slipped 0.1%. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING, expects the lira to \u201ctread water\u201d today \u2013 with US-Turkey relations on a knife-edge as the White House said it may increase sanctions. Next week\u2019s market holiday should offer some respite \u2013 the Istanbul stock exchange will be closed from Tuesday until Friday for Eid al-Adha. Patel adds: All the noise from Turkey\u2019s finance minister Albayrak appeared to be on the right lines in terms of reassuring global investors that Ankara remains credibly committed to addressing the country\u2019s inflation problem \u2013 and in the status quo free-market spirit. In effect, Turkish policymakers have bought themselves a bit of time \u2013 at least until early September, when markets will be expecting to see some sort of joint fiscal and monetary tightening in the Medium-Term Economic Plan. While we did see Turkey\u2019s sovereign CDS rally following the finance minister\u2019s investor call, the lira failed to push on much further beyond 5.75 \u2013 as markets had largely priced in a conciliatory outcome. S&amp;P are due to downgrade Turkey\u2019s sovereign credit rating today \u2013 but again this is in the price of the currency. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Turkish lira has become volatile again at the end of a tumultuous week, after the United States warned of more sanctions against Turkey. The embattled currency weakened in early London trading, with one dollar buying 5.86 lira, but has just recovered to 5.8, up 0.26%. On Monday the lira hit a record low of 7.2, dragging down other emerging markets currencies. Turkey\u2019s finance minister sparked a recovery in the lira yesterday after he addressed thousands of international investors on a conference call. Berat Albayrak, the son-in-law of president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, pledged to protect beleaguered local banks and cut public spending to prevent the country defaulting on its loans. But a few hours later US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin assured president Donald Trump at a cabinet meeting that sanctions were ready to be put in place if US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is on house arrest in Turkey over terrorism charges, is not released. Trump later tweeted that the US \u201cwill pay nothing\u201d for the release \u201cbut we are cutting back on Turkey!\u201d. Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u2019s sovereign credit rating later today. Asian stock markets rose overnight, heartened by news that Beijing and Washington agreed to hold their first trade talks since June next week. Japan\u2019s Nikkei advanced 0.35% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng the Australian stock market both rose 0.2%, although the Shanghai stock exchange lost 1.3%.

Turkish losses may well affect individual institutions in the Eurozone visibly. </p> <p>Still, eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were during the 2011-2012 euro crisis which had come right in the wake of the 2008/2009 mega-recession. The risk that the exposure of some banks to Turkey could turn into a systemic problem for the eurozone and/or cause a tightening of credit conditions in Spain, Italy or France remains remote.</p> <p><strong>Confidence effect:</strong> The real risk stems from the level of noise. Confidence and hence the readiness to spend and invest often drives the business cycle. As confidence is currently fickle with no established trend, even small but highly visible problems can nourish the feeling that the world is a dangerous place rather than full of exciting opportunities. We therefore see a clear risk that any noisy crisis - such as the Turkish turmoil - could take some toll on the Eurozone and retard the upturn in markets and business sentiment for a while.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b76c184e4b016cd4306bc62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-17T12:39:19.379Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Holger Schmieding, economist at Germany\u2019s Berenberg, says the bank has lowered its year-end forecasts for the euro to $1.17 from $1.21, due to the Turkey crisis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turkey is no small fry.

      "bodyText": "Monzo, a digital bank popular with millennials, is set to become one of the UK\u2019s technology \u201cunicorns\u201d after lining up new finance that would value the three-year-old company at more than $1bn (\u00a3787m). The London-based bank has organised $150m of funding from investors, including Silicon Valley\u2019s Accel Partners, which was an early investor in Wonga. Monzo\u2019s fundraising will value it at up to $1.5bn \u2013 about four times the \u00a3280m value placed on the bank when it last raised money in November 2017, the Financial Times reported. Monzo is a smartphone-only \u201cchallenger\u201d to the big high street banks and has almost 900,000 customers. In its first round of crowdfunding in 2016 it raised \u00a31m in 96 seconds. More recently the singer Tom Odell and the Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom became investors. The bank launched with a shocking-pink prepaid debit card and has started offering current accounts after gaining a banking licence last year. Monzo\u2019s initial appeal was fee-free foreign currency transactions but the founder and chief executive, Tom Blomfield, told the Guardian last year the bank\u2019s main selling point was letting people organise their money on a smartphone. \u201cIt gives you real-time visibility and control. It\u2019s one of those home-screen apps: you have five or six apps you use to live your life and Monzo is one of those things,\u201d Blomfield said. At the time, half of Monzo\u2019s customers were under 30 and a further quarter were under 40. The $1.5bn valuation would put Monzo alongside other so-called unicorn UK technology companies such as Deliveroo and Skyscanner valued at $1bn or more. Monzo, like Atom Bank and Starling, is one of a growing number of financial technology companies offering digital services to lure smartphone users from traditional banks. It will use the extra money to add new products, including short-term unsecured loans and high-interest savings accounts via another bank, the FT said. A Monzo spokeswoman declined to comment on the company\u2019s valuation or funding round, which is due to be announced by the end of 2018.",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s extended World Cup run and the summer sunshine gave an unexpected lift to retail sales in July as consumers spent heavily on supermarket food and drink. Heavy discounting by clothing stores also brought shoppers back to the high street to reverse a decline in sales in June. The rise in sales will cheer beleaguered shopkeepers, but the underlying weakness in sales on the high street and the switch to online purchases is unlikely to reverse the trend for shop closures and redundancies across the retail sector. Furniture and household goods sellers saw sales go into reverse as the trend for consumers to avoid buying expensive items for the home continued. Much of the blame for weak consumer spending has been directed at recent falls in wages growth, which is running at the same rate as inflation. With inflation-busting utility bill increases and mortgage interest starting to rise, households are likely to find they have less money to spend on the high street in the second half of the year. Retail sales volumes rose by 0.7% last month on the previous month, and were 3.5% higher than a year earlier, above economists\u2019 forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 0.2% monthly rise and a 3% annual gain. Online sales leapt to a new record with a 15.3% increase in July compared with the same month last year. Online sales by department stores also stood out with a 35% annual increase in sales. A surprise winner over the summer was Kingfisher, the owner of B&amp;Q and Screwfix, which increased sales by 6% at its UK division in the three months to the end of July, according to figures released on Thursday. Sales rose 3.6% at established B&amp;Q stores and 5.5% at Screwfix outlets open for more than a year as the company said sales of weather-related goods including hosepipes and fans soared. The company sold out of paddling pools as families made the most of the long hot summer. The strong figures come despite fears for the DIY sector as rival Homebase plans to close more than 40 stores and Travis Perkins considers the sale of its Wickes chain. The Office for National Statistics senior statistician Rhian Murphy said: \u201cMany consumers stayed away from some high street stores in July, but online sales were very strong, supported by several retailers launching promotions. Food sales remained robust as people continued to enjoy the World Cup and the sunshine.\u201d Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, was cautiously optimistic, saying that while consumers were under pressure from weak wage growth, the figures showed retail sales started the third quarter of the year in robust health. \u201cOf course, retail sales only account for about a third of total household spending, so the strength of spending on the high street could be offset by households reducing their outlay elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, annual growth in retail sales and household spending have a reasonable relationship, and retail sales growth of 3.5% year on year in the three months to July is well above growth in consumer spending of just 1.1% in the second quarter.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australians should expect \u201cfairly gradual\u201d wage growth and for interest rates to remain on hold for \u201ca while yet\u201d, according to the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe. On Friday Lowe said Australia\u2019s economy had continued to move in the right direction, with GDP growth of 3.1%, inflation at 2.1% and unemployment at 5.3%, which he labelled a \u201cpretty good set of numbers\u201d. Lowe told the House of Representatives standing committee on economics the global outlook remained positive, but listed risks including an escalation of global trade tensions and the risk of increased inflation in the US due to \u201chighly unusual\u201d fiscal stimulus at a time of high growth. Lowe said the Reserve Bank wanted to make further progress towards full employment and for inflation to be comfortably within the target range of 2%-3% \u201con a sustained basis\u201d. The bank would keep its current stance on interest rates until those benchmarks were \u201cmore clearly in sight\u201d and there was \u201cnot a strong case for a near-term adjustment\u201d in interest rates. The official cash rate has been 1.5% since August 2016 and has not risen since late 2010. Lowe reiterated his comments that an increase in wages would be a \u201cwelcome development\u201d because it would help reduce household debt, boost government coffers and help \u201cstrengthen the sense of shared productivity\u201d gains. Lowe admitted it was \u201ccontroversial\u201d for a Reserve Bank governor to barrack for higher wages, but said he did so to prevent wage expectations falling further. That and keeping interest rates low to tighten demand in the labour market were all the central bank \u201ccan and should do\u201d to boost wages, he said. Lowe noted that wages \u2013 as measured by the wage price index \u2013 were up 2.1% and when bonuses were included pay was up 2.5%. Unemployment of 5.3%, while volatile, was \u201cthe lowest for a number of years\u201d. Lowe predicted improved wage growth as the labour market continued to tighten, but said it was \u201cstill expected to be fairly gradual\u201d. Although indicators including business hiring intentions and the high number of vacancies as a share of the labour market pointed to wages growth, he said there was \u201cstill some spare capacity\u201d, with part-time workers wanting more hours. Asked whether the budget\u2019s forecast of 2.75% wage growth next year could be achieved, Lowe said it was \u201cpossible, even probable\u201d that aggregate earnings would reach that level, but only when extra pay including bonuses was considered. Lowe said the \u201cpullback\u201d in house prices in Sydney and Melbourne was a \u201cwelcome development\u201d, putting the market on a better footing after a period of unsustainable rising prices, debt and lower affordability. While banks were tightening lending standards in response to the banking royal commission, Lowe said reduced demand from investors had caused the price falls. Lowe said the banking royal commission had exposed how financial institutions had difficulty managing conflicts of interest, and remuneration structures had driven a sales culture that was not always in customers\u2019 best interests. But he warned against an \u201coverreaction\u201d, warning that despite \u201cterrible shortcomings\u201d regulation still needed to strike a balance between protecting customers and allowing financial innovation. \u201cI don\u2019t think the solution is more and more regulation,\u201d he said. Lowe noted trade tensions between the United States and China, and that the IMF had slightly downgraded its growth projections in response. He said an increase in tariffs of between 10% to 25% would be \u201cmanageable\u201d for Australia, slowing global growth but not halting economic expansion. But he warned of a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d if tariffs were combined with lower business investment, which would be a \u201cvery damaging cocktail\u201d. Lowe said he was \u201cless relaxed\u201d than global financial markets about US policies of enacting fiscal stimulus through increased spending and reduced taxes. He said it was \u201chighly unusual\u201d to do so at a time when the deficit was 4%-5% of GDP, while the US was growing at above its trend rate and had high public debt due to the \u201cinability to reform entitlements\u201d.",
