The number of R&amp;D tax credit claims increased by 26% to 15,930 in the 2012-13 tax year, according to the latest figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Tax credits on R&amp;D were introduced more than a decade ago to encourage research and innovation.

      "bodyText": "Most old-style hostile takeovers end up destroying value, or so the academics tell us. But at least the battles produced a clean fight, a full airing of arguments and a definitive vote by shareholders at the end. The fashion for bear-hugs, or enticements to combine, can be maddening \u2013 and the current dust-up in the building world between Carillion and Balfour Beatty is exactly that. The two companies have been squabbling over strategy and cost savings since friendly merger talks collapsed a fortnight ago. In this week's episode, Carillion chief executive Richard Howson has been trying to encourage Balfour investors to rise in rebellion against their board and tell chairman Steve Marshall to get back to the negotiating table. Look, says Carillion, there's \u00a3175m of annual cost savings waiting to be scooped up; Ernst &amp; Young has signed off the number and we've got a management team that kept its financial promises after consuming Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine. Those half-wits at Balfour, as Carillion doesn't quite put it, have been layering on profit warnings by the trowel for the past two years, almost as fast as they've been shedding chief executives. Hell, Marshall is now planning to sell his best business, US design consultancy Parsons Brinckerhoff. In reply, Balfour says the \u00a3175m figure is not all it seems. \"Cost savings driven by shrinking the business should not be confused with synergies,\" it says archly. And don't forget the \u00a3225m cost of achieving those annual gains. There is plenty that can done under our own steam, argues Balfour; and, remember, Carillion is the smaller company and has never attempted a deal of this size. As for Parsons, what's wrong with selling via a competitive auction if the sale price is greater the purchase price three years ago? Who's right? Carillion has the best jabs but the arguments feel too much like a dance around the real issue. Balfour investors should stick to first principles. This proposed deal, even if it started out as a merger, is now more like an all-share reverse takeover with only a skimpy premium for control. That is surely less than compelling for Balfour investors, who haven't even seen a rigorous assessment of the value in their company's PFI investment portfolio. Under a full 60-day bid timetable, shareholders might also have to time to learn what price somebody is willing to pay for Parsons. It's unfortunate for Carillion that it is too small to back its confidence with a hostile offer. But Balfour shareholders should decline the invitation to rebel. Whatever Carillion says about the solidity of the \u00a3175m of savings, there must be a risk that the prize shrinks amid the complexity of running a combined company that would start life with 80,000 employees. Instead, Balfour investors should tell Marshall to find his new chief executive, pronto, and give the company one last shot at self-improvement. If that doesn't work, there's always a chance a bidder willing to pay for control will turn up. Bank's rising interest could be devastating Here's an interesting statistic for Mark Carney and his Bank of England colleagues to chew over on their summer holidays: since the end of post-2008 recession, three central banks in the developed world have tried to take the road marked \"normalisation\" by raising interest rates and each has been obliged to reverse direction quickly. Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research pointed this out in a well-timed note this week. Sweden, like the UK, cut interest rates from 5% to almost zero in a hurry in 2008. Then, in 2010, the Riksbank started raising again but it only got as far as 2% because the impact on the Swedish economy was \"devastating\", as Joshi puts it. Outright deflation occurred. The central bank has had to take base rates all the way back down to 0.25%. It was a similar tale in Norway, where the economy couldn't stand a staggered one percentage point increase; loosening followed quickly. Even Australia, which, as Joshi says, is relatively immune to the eurozone's debt woes and hasn't had a recession for 25 years, didn't get very far before turning backwards. There was a hike from 3% to 4.75% in 2009-10, followed by a retreat in 2012; the policy rate is now 2.5%. Given those examples, you can understand why Carney &amp; co, in the face of lack of growth in wages, seem so hesitant again about the first rise. Once a central bank has taken that first step, it is saying, in effect, that more hikes will follow and that the economy can stand a higher cost of borrowing. The Bank will have to move at some point if the UK economy keeps up its current form. But, for a governor struggling to shift the \"unreliable boyfriend\" tag, it would be embarrassing to embark on a march towards, say, 2.5%, get halfway and then turn back. More waiting and seeing at base camp may continue to look the safe option \u2013 perhaps even until after the general election next May. Big firm wants to become minor player What's this, a big miner that wants to be smaller? After a decade and a bit of deal-making, BHP Billiton has decided it doesn't want to own some of its mines. Chief executive Andrew Mackenzie's game is \"portfolio simplification\". This is quite a turnaround from the days when BHP, with Marius Kloppers at the helm, was trying and failing to gobble Rio Tinto and then PotashCorp. A demerger of aluminium, nickel and manganese assets might be worth $15bn, think the analysts, which sounds colossal until you remember that BHP is worth $180bn. The company will still be big in iron ore, copper, coal and oil and gas, and hasn't given up on potash; it will remain the world's biggest miner. A straightforward demerger doesn't create any value as, on day one, the same assets will still be owned by the same shareholders. So why bother? It makes it easier to improve productivity and performance, says BHP. That sounds terribly vague, but anything that smells like greater financial discipline is rightly welcomed by mining investors these days. Rio's disastrous top-of-the-market $38bn cash takeover of Alcan in 2007 remains the textbook example of how one bad deal can ruin a decade of digging. 50p to stop hanging on the telephone Whose bright idea was this? Charging customers 50p for the privilege of jumping the queue when ringing up to complain, or just to ask for technical help, is surely a guaranteed way to infuriate people. The excuse offered by mobile phone company EE is that it's part of an improvement in service that has seen 1,000 jobs return to the UK from call centres overseas. What's that got to do with anything? It's the principle of queue-jumping that will enrage punters. We tolerate speedy boarding on budget airlines, of course, but EE's innovation will be seen as a sneaky attempt to prompt a large number of people into paying a small sum of money to get what they thought they were paying for anyway. It would be amazing if the policy weren't dropped quickly. EE should ask the energy companies where a reputation for underhand behaviour leads.",

    "webTitle": "London house price boom halted amid fears of interest rate rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The scramble for homes in London that helped push up prices in some areas by more than a third in 12 months has come to a juddering halt, according to estate agents around the capital. Buyers who had become accustomed to queueing for viewings before the outbreak of bidding wars have more recently seen asking prices falling as tighter mortgage lending, fears of an imminent interest rate rise and an increase in the number of homes for sale have put a brake on a market that many feared was turning into a bubble. This week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the estate agency chain Haart reported that the heat was starting to abate in the London market, with a fall in sales in July and the sharpest drop in new buyers since the onset of the financial crisis. The upmarket property company Hamptons International halved its growth forecast for Greater London next year to 3% after the 15% predicted for this year, saying the pace of growth had started to slacken. Estate agents around the capital have reported the market cooling in recent weeks, pinpointing as the turning point June's warning from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that interest rates could rise before the end of the year. \"Prices were rising really, really fast. People were paying well over the asking price and then all of a sudden we saw things stop \u2013 it was like a handbrake had been pulled up,\" said Charlie Perdios, managing director of agents Anthony Pepe in Haringey, north London, where prices rose by 22% in the year to June. \"We were doing open days and getting 60 viewings on a property over a weekend, then suddenly it dropped to 15.\" Steve Hatch, director and valuer at Castles, another north London agent, said the Bank's warning \"got the attention it was meant to get and made people think for a moment. We noticed that things got quieter; the craziness came out of the market.\" Previously, he said, each property attracted 20 to 30 buyers and bids came in above the asking price but \"now [they were] agreeing the asking price or just below\". Perdios said the uncertainty put off buyers for a while and convinced potential sellers that the top of the market had arrived, meaning more stock entered the market and prices started to ease. \"Before, you were almost speculating as to what people would pay \u2026 now we're exercising more caution with our valuations and asking prices have dropped slightly.\" In Kennington, south London, where the property website Zoopla puts the average asking price at \u00a3772,437, Tom Floyd, sales manager at the estate agents Winkworth, said the introduction of affordability checks on borrowers in April had made a difference. \"I would say that May was probably the top of the market,\" said Floyd. \"People probably realised that the market was topping out and started to put their homes up for sale \u2013 in January I had eight properties on my books; I've now got 60. In June alone we took on 34.\" He said that in the first half of the year \"value went out of the window\" \u2013 every day a couple of properties went to sale by sealed bids and homes fetched an average of 104% of the asking price. \"Now you've got to pick the phone up rather than getting calls before you get the chance. It's gone back to normal to be honest,\" Floyd said. The frenzy of the London property market was symbolised by open house events, where in some cases buyers queued around the block to take a whistlestop tour of a property on the market for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Agents said the drop in the number of buyers chasing each home meant that these were becoming a less familiar sight. Perdios said: \"We are slowly, slowly coming off open houses. I think they will soon be a thing of the past.\" Other experts said the rapid rise in prices meant that some buyers would not, or could not, enter the market. \"In well over 30 years I've seen this countless times, when competing agents force asking prices so high that buyers just say no thanks,\" said Ed Mead, director of Douglas &amp; Gordon. \"There always follows a three-month hiatus while sellers and buyers stand off. We're in the third month and sellers appear to be blinking as the fall off in asking prices shows.\" Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said buyers were becoming overstretched, with the ratio of house prices to earnings significantly higher than its previous peak. Pointon said the shift in the supply and demand balance would \"lead to a rapid deceleration in house price inflation in the capital\". He added: \"A strong economic backdrop, and the fact that buyers are likely to come back once the choice of properties on the market improves, will lead to further, although much more modest, price gains next year. But with prices already at a very high level, we expect other regions will at least match London next year, and are likely to overtake the capital in 2016.\" Russell Quirk from the online estate agent eMoov.co.uk suggested that the slowdown in the capital could be good news elsewhere. \"There is still plenty of demand within London, but a cooling period could see a benefit to the whole nation as this could mean we avoid a hike to interest rates.\"",

People were paying well over the asking price and then all of a sudden we saw things stop \u2013 it was like a handbrake had been pulled up,\" said Charlie Perdios, managing director of agents Anthony Pepe in Haringey, north London, where prices rose by 22% in the year to June. \"We were doing open days and getting 60 viewings on a property over a weekend, then suddenly it dropped to 15.\"</p> <p>Steve Hatch, director and valuer at Castles, another north London agent, said the Bank's warning \"got the attention it was meant to get and made people think for a moment. We noticed that things got quieter; the craziness came out of the market.\" Previously, he said, each property attracted 20 to 30 buyers and bids came in above the asking price but \"now [they were] agreeing the asking price or just below\".</p> <p>Perdios said the uncertainty put off buyers for a while and convinced potential sellers that the top of the market had arrived, meaning more stock entered the market and prices started to ease. \"Before, you were almost speculating as to what people would pay \u2026 now we're exercising more caution with our valuations and asking prices have dropped slightly.\"</p> <p>In Kennington, south London, where the property website Zoopla puts the average asking price at \u00a3772,437, Tom Floyd, sales manager at the estate agents Winkworth, said the introduction of affordability checks on borrowers in April had made a difference.</p> <p>\"I would say that May was probably the top of the market,\" said Floyd. \"People probably realised that the market was topping out and started to put their homes up for sale \u2013 in January I had eight properties on my books; I've now got 60. In June alone we took on 34.\"</p> <p>He said that in the first half of the year \"value went out of the window\" \u2013 every day a couple of properties went to sale by sealed bids and homes fetched an average of 104% of the asking price.</p> <p>\"Now you've got to pick the phone up rather than getting calls before you get the chance. It's gone back to normal to be honest,\" Floyd said.</p> <p>The frenzy of the London property market was symbolised by open house events, where in some cases buyers queued around the block to take a whistlestop tour of a property on the market for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Agents said the drop in the number of buyers chasing each home meant that these were becoming a less familiar sight. Perdios said: \"We are slowly, slowly coming off open houses. I think they will soon be a thing of the past.\"</p> <p>Other experts said the rapid rise in prices meant that some buyers would not, or could not, enter the market. \"In well over 30 years I've seen this countless times, when competing agents force asking prices so high that buyers just say no thanks,\" said Ed Mead, director of Douglas &amp; Gordon. \"There always follows a three-month hiatus while sellers and buyers stand off. We're in the third month and sellers appear to be blinking as the fall off in asking prices shows.\"</p> <p>Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said buyers were becoming overstretched, with the ratio of house prices to earnings significantly higher than its previous peak. Pointon said the shift in the supply and demand balance would \"lead to a rapid deceleration in house price inflation in the capital\".</p> <p>He added: \"A strong economic backdrop, and the fact that buyers are likely to come back once the choice of properties on the market improves, will lead to further, although much more modest, price gains next year. But with prices already at a very high level, we expect other regions will at least match London next year, and are likely to overtake the capital in 2016.\"</p> <p>Russell Quirk from the online estate agent eMoov.co.uk suggested that the slowdown in the capital could be good news elsewhere. \"There is still plenty of demand within London, but a cooling period could see a benefit to the whole nation as this could mean we avoid a hike to interest rates.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Balfour Beatty has reaffirmed its rejection of a second \u00a33bn merger proposal from rival construction firm Carillion, publishing the detail of its doubts over the cost savings that could be achieved from any combination. Balfour, which built the aquatics centre for London 2012 and is transforming the Olympic stadium, has rejected two proposals by Carillion to create a group that would be better placed to compete for large international contracts against the likes of Spain's Ferrovial. The two companies revealed they were in talks last month, but Balfour walked away only days later after Carillion insisted it cancel the planned sale of Balfour's US engineering and design business, Parsons Brinckerhoff. Since then the companies have been engaged in a battle of statements and counter-statements, with Balfour continuing to argue that Carillion's proposals will fail to deliver as much value to shareholders as it can as an independent company. Under takeover rules Carillion has until 21 August to make a final offer. Balfour Beatty said on Friday it had further considered Thursday's announcement from Carillion, and continued to reject its suitor's assessment of potential cost savings. \"The proposal remains unchanged to that rejected on August 11 2014. The board reaffirms its rejection of the proposal,\" Balfour said in its statement. Balfour said it believed the proposal involved reducing its British construction revenues by up to two-thirds, which would in turn reduce the potential synergies available. Carillion, whose contracts range from maintaining the London Overground system to operating site services for Shell in Qatar, has said it could save more than \u00a3175m a year by the end of 2016, more than some analysts expected, by streamlining offices, supply chains and IT. \"Cost savings driven by shrinking the business should not be confused with synergies,\" Balfour said. Balfour, which generates \u00a310bn in revenue from work in 80 countries, also said that any shrinking of its British construction business as part of a merged group would deny shareholders the benefits from a recovery in that sector, signs of which it was already seeing. Carillion has said it would refocus a combined group's business in the UK to make two-thirds of its profits on services and investments, with just one-third from construction. Balfour said it would pursue its own cost efficiencies by cutting management layers and streamlining supply chains. It expected to sell Parsons Brinckerhoff for between \u00a3580m and \u00a3650m. \"The board believes this is the right time to sell Parsons Brinckerhoff, but believes Carillion's approach for the entire group at this stage of the construction cycle is opportunistic,\" it said.

Thanks, as ever, for all your comments. Graeme Wearden\u2019s back in on Monday and will keep you up to date with all the developments in the eurozone and beyond. Rasmussen confirmed that a \u201cRussian incursion\u201d into Ukraine had occurred overnight, but stopped short of characterising is as an invasion. Reuters reports him saying: Last night we saw a Russian incursion, a crossing of the Ukrainian border. It just confirms the fact that we see a continuous flow of weapons and fighters from Russia into eastern Ukraine and it is a clear demonstration of continued Russian involvement in the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. NATO\u2019s secretary general Anders Rasmussen sees a \u201chigh probability\u201d that Russia could intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine, according to Reuters. He says he sees no sign of withdrawal of Russian troops from close to the Ukraine border. James Knightley at ING says the auto data seems \u201cimprobably large\u201d and suggests \u201cthere may be some seasonal issue relating to retooling of factories going on\u201d. All in all it is a decent outcome which is backed up by the strength seen in the ISM manufacturing report earlier in the month and the fact that the sector has added over 50,000 jobs in the last two months alone. The Empire manufacturing survey, released a little earlier, did fall quite a lot, but this shouldn\u2019t be too concerning given that it really spiked significantly in the past couple of months. The moves were much larger than seen in other regional surveys and even after today\u2019s fall it is still at very levels. US industrial output was driven by a 10.1% jump in auto production, driving the measure to its sixth month of gains. More data out of the US, where industrial output has risen faster than expected. Industrial output was up 0.4% in July, compared with forecasts of a 0.3% rise. June\u2019s output growth was revised up to 0.4%. Reuters is running a headline saying that Finnish president Sauli Niinisto says there is agreement on Russian humanitarian aid delivery between Russia, Ukraine and Red Cross. More on that as it comes... Over to the US, where price inflation remains low. Producer prices inched up 0.1% in July, easing from the 0.4% growth the previous month. The US Labor Department said the \u201ccore\u201d gauge of producer prices, excluding the volatile categories of food, energy and trade, rose 0.2% last month. Producer prices rose 1.7% in July from a year earlier, slipping from annual gains of 1.9% in June, 2% in May and 2.1% in April. The PPI report tends to be a signal of future inflation as companies pass their costs along to consumers. The rain in Spain isn\u2019t falling on the olive groves. A drought in the world\u2019s biggest producer of olive oil has prompted fears of widespread shortages. Neena Rai of the WSJ reports: This year\u2019s crop from some Spanish farms could be down 40% from 2013, according to oilseeds forecasting agency Oil World. Very dry weather in the key olive-producing region of Andalusia in May and June ravaged the olive trees during their flowering period, when they need moisture for the fruit to ripen correctly. \u201cThe drought in Spain and its impact on the olive market is potentially very significant,\u201d said Lamine Lahouasnia, head of packaged food at Euromonitor International. \u201cIf the drought does end up adversely affecting Spanish yields, it is very likely that we\u2019ll see rising consumer prices in 2014.\u201d Shares continue to rally, with markets up at lunchtime on hopes of central bank support. The FTSE is on track to record its biggest weekly gain in six months, up 0.7%, or 48 points at 6734. Germany\u2019s DAX up 0.9% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1% Spain\u2019s IBEX up up 1% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 0.3% There are always plenty of comments asking how far we can trust the stats. Well, now the Office for National Statistics appears to be questioning its own stats. Last year, the ONS upgraded an experimental measure of inflation, CPIH \u2013 which includes housing costs \u2013 to the status of a National Statistic. But this week it stripped it of its status, noting that it could be significantly understating inflation. Independent economist Shaun Richards says it is \u201crather embarrassing\u201d for the statistics authority, in a detailed post on his blog Mindful Money. He notes: The purpose of putting housing costs into an inflation measure is to teach us something that we would not otherwise know. After a credit crunch mostly caused by over-inflated asset prices turning to bust such a measure gives us an opportunity to do better next time around. But the methodology behind the statistic is faulty, as it fails to take proper account of rental prices and therefore tells us nothing at all. NATO has accused Russia of escalating the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reports. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu told Reuters that the alliance was checking the eyewitness reports in two British newspapers that a column of at least 23 Russian military vehicles had crossed into Ukraine overnight. She said: If confirmed they are further evidence that Russia is doing the very opposite of what it\u2019s saying. Russia has been escalating the conflict, even as it calls for de-escalation. It is high time that Russia did what it says it wants to do, which is to contribute to a peaceful solution. Russia needs to pull back its troops, stop the flow of arms and fighters over the border with Ukraine, stop supporting the separatists and engage in a genuine and sincere dialogue with Ukraine. The UK economy performed better than any other G7 nation in the year to June, notes the Telegraph. Peter Spence writes: Only Canada is yet to report growth for the second quarter, and it appears unlikely that it will knock the UK off the top when it does, on August 29. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker reported last night: The Guardian saw a column of 23 armoured personnel carriers, supported by fuel trucks and other logistics vehicles with official Russian military plates, travelling towards the border near the Russian town of Donetsk \u2013 about 200km away from Donetsk, Ukraine. After pausing by the side of the road until nightfall, the convoy crossed into Ukrainian territory, using a rough dirt track and clearly crossing through a gap in a barbed wire fence that demarcates the border. Armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into Ukraine. Kiev has lost control of its side of the border in this area. Philip Hammond, the UK\u2019s new foreign secretary told reporters at the meeting that he was \u201calarmed\u201d at reports of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine overnight, saying it could have \u201cvery serious consequences\u201d. I\u2019m very alarmed by reports that Russian military vehicles may have corssed the border this morning... If there are any Russian military personnel or vehicles in eastern Ukraine, they need to be withdrawn immediately or the consequences could be very serious. The EU foreign ministers have gathered in Brussels, and no-one appears to be too miserable about having to come back from their holidays. Main topics will be Russian sanctions and aid to Iraq. The Office for National Statistics has been having fun with the most popular baby names last year. Our favourite of the infographics... There were, apparently, 50 girls called Khaleesi and four called Daenerys, writes George Arnett. The debate over quantitative easing in the eurozone has emerged again after yesterday\u2019s data showing growth in the region\u2019s three largest economies had ground to a halt. It looks likely that the ECB will take action soon. Mario Draghi said last week that the ECB had hired a consultant to design an ABS purchase programme (or quantitative easing by any other name), with the expectation of using it but no final decision has been taken. The decision is fraught with difficulties, not least because of Draghi\u2019s previous insistence that monetary policy can only achieve so much and countries must engage in structural reform. Michael Hewson writes: The fact is while QE might be part of a solution, it is not the whole solution and the reluctance of the Germans to countenance it is simply because French and Italian politicians will carry on exactly as before, doing nothing to reform their sclerotic economies. EU authorities would also stand accused of hypocrisy having insisted on painful reforms in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, but then changing the rules for France and Italy. The UK\u2019s GDP data has failed to stop the pound\u2019s decline. Faster than expected economic growth should bring the prospect of a rate rise closer, but the GDP data only offered partial support to the pound, which looks set to decline against the dollar for the sixth week running. The pound has declined by as much as 1% over the past two days. Reuters reports: With the day\u2019s main focus a raft of US data that could add to the pciture of a solidifying recovery there, traders and analysts said the pound was at risk of another push higher for the dollar. In corporate news, banana firm Chiquita has rejected a takeover bid by Brazil\u2019s Cutrale and Safra groups, saying it is sticking to its plan to merge with European fruit seller Fyffes. The BBC reports: Chiquita said the offer from Brazil was \u201cinadequate\u201d and that it would not hold talks with the groups \u201cat this time\u201d. Fruit juice firm Cutrale and investment bank Safra made a $611m (\u00a3363m) bid for US-based Chiquita on Monday. In March Chiquita and Irish fruit group Fyffes agreed to merge. Monday\u2019s offer from the Brazilian businesses sent Chiquita shares 31% higher, while Fyffes fell 15%. Pretty chart from Berenberg Economics The FTSE\u2019s continuing to rise on the back of the buoyant GDP data, up 0.7% at last count, or 46 points at 6731. Paul Hollingsworth at Captial Economics notes that the tweaks to the initial estimates of GDP, show a slightly less balanced economy than first thought. Today\u2019s second GDP estimate confirmed that the economic recovery was strong, but became a little less balanced in the second quarter. Growth in industrial production was revised down from 0.4% to 0.3%, and construction output is now thought to have held steady, where it was previously estimated to have fallen by 0.5%. Meanwhile, output in the services sector is still thought to have risen by a robust 1% in Q2. The strength of the latest retail sales figures and surveys of firms\u2019 investment intentions alongside a still wide trade deficit in Q2 suggest that the economy is still struggling to rebalance towards the external sector. And with this week\u2019s euro-zone GDP figures highlighting the fragility of the recovery there, the UK\u2019s economic recovery seems likely to remain a distinctly domestic-led affair over the second half of this year. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: Today\u2019s figures confirm that our economy has recovered all of the output lost in the Great Recession, and is now bigger than its previous peak in the first quarter of 2008. The government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, with the economy growing at its fastest annual rate in six years. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the realistic assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future. A bit more detail on the UK GDP figures. Yearly growth of 3.2% is the fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2007. It beat analyst expectations that it would remain unchanged from the initial estimate of 3.1%. Services output was up a healthy 1% on the quarter, while industrial output was 0.3% higher. Construction was unchanged. Services has grown 3.6% in the year to June, its fastest growth since February 2008. The economy is now 0.2% bigger than it was at its pre-crisis peak. Britain\u2019s GDP grew at 3.2% in the year to June, the fastest rate of growth since before the financial crisis. The data is the first revision of second quarter GDP data. Growth over the quarter remained unchanged from the initial estimate of 0.8%. Interesting graph showing a troubling (from the EU\u2019s point of view) divergence in industrial production from Europe and the US. Overnight, Japan said it would consider cutting growth forecasts for the full year. Masahiro Hidaka at Bloomberg reports: The Bank of Japan may cut its growth forecast for this fiscal year for a fourth time, as exports fail to bolster an economy weakened by April\u2019s sales-tax increase, according to people familiar with the central bank\u2019s discussions. It said the bank is likely to cut forecasts from 1%, citing unnamed sources. Bloomberg forecasts are for 0.4% growth over the year. Markets have opened higher, as investors bet on more central bank support following miserable economic data. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.5% or 33 points at 6718 Germany\u2019s DAX up 0.4% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.4% Spain\u2019s IBEX up 0.05% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 0.3% EU foreign ministers have interrupted their summer break to meet in Brussels today, to discuss a response to Russia\u2019s food import ban, as well as aid for Iraq. Of the 28 EU foreign ministers, 20 are expected to attend. An EU official said ministers would assess the consequences of possible measures and decide whether to legally challenge Moscow. He also noted that filing a suit to the World Trade Organization is the prerogative of the European Commission, however, the ministers could send out a political signal backing such a move. Ria Novosti (a Russian news service) reports: The EU representative stressed that discussing new sanctions against Russia is not on the agenda. \u201cWith regard to a new round of economic sanctions, I think it is a little bit too early at this stage,\u201d he said. Also, the Foreign Affairs Council meeting is to clarify the future of contacts between Brussels and third countries which can potentially replace European states in food exports to Russia. The diplomat said the EU was not going to ask these countries to join the sanctions, but would explain them the reasons for anti-Moscow economic restrictions. The EU has pledged to support farmers hit by the Russian ban on food imports from the West. Euractiv reports: The European Commission, the EU executive, has already announced support for peach and nectarine growers which had already been suffering a price collapse that has since been exacerbated by the Russian ban. In all, EU farm exports to Russia are worth around \u20ac11 billion a year, roughly 10% of all EU agricultural sales. Some nations are more affected than others. Poland is suffering from the loss of its biggest apple buyer, and France, the bloc\u2019s leading agricultural economy, is nervous that their own produce will be driven down by the hundreds of thousands of Polish apples Russia does not import. Hungary is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia and this year signed a \u20ac10bn deal with Russian power company Rosatom to expand Hungary\u2019s only nuclear power plant. Prime minister Viktor Orban said today: The EU should not only compensate producers somehow, be they Polish, Slovak, Hungarian or Greek, who now have to suffer losses, but the entire sanctions policy should be reconsidered. His comments came a day after the Slovak prime minister said the sanctions were \u201cmeaningless\u201d. Robert Fico said in a news conference yesterday: Why should we jeopardize the EU economy that begins to grow? If there is a crisis situation, it should be solved by other means than meaningless sanctions. Who profits from [the] EU economy decreasing, Russia\u2019s economy having troubles and Ukraine economically on its knees? My colleague Jennifer Rankin would disagree. She argues that Russians will pay the heavier price. The west has banned Russian companies from taking its credit or buying its most advanced technology. Russia, in contrast, has stopped its own people from eating food they enjoy and made their grocery bills more expensive just as the economy teeters on the brink of recession. It is impossible to predict how long this economic war will drag on, but we already know who is paying the biggest price. The prime minister of Hungary Viktor Orban has called for a rethink of sanctions towards Russia. He said in a radio interview: The sanctions policy pursued by the West, that is, ourselves, a necessary consequence of which has been what the Russians are doing, causes more harm to us than to Russia. In politics, this is called shooting oneself in the foot. We\u2019ve got the latest UK GDP data coming out at 9.30am, which should show the Britain faring considerably better than its European counterparts. Second quarter GDP growth is expected to come in unchanged at 0.8% on the quarter, and 3.1% from the second quarter last year, contrasting sharply with this week\u2019s weak European numbers. European markets are expected to open higher, after a slew of poor economic data from the eurozone yesterday. The news got into the territory of \u2018so bad it\u2019s good\u2019, as investors started betting on more central bank support. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets writes: With prices falling sharply across the euro area, the siren calls for the European Central Bank to do more are starting to become deafening. With these calls for full blown QE getting louder and louder it would appear that markets are betting that Germany and the Bundesbank will ultimately bend to the will of the crowd, hence yesterday\u2019s drift higher. Shares in Asia closed the week up. The FTSE Asia Pacific Index has gained 2.7%, rebounding from last week\u2019s 2.4% tumble. The geopolitical tensions that got investors so worried last week have certainly not gone away, but the feeling is that poor economic data have overtaken those concerns. Patrick McGee at the FT writes: Evan Lucas, strategist at IG, suggested investors were refocusing their attention away from geopolitical risks and back to central bank policy, after weak US retail sales and downbeat gross domestic product reports across the eurozone highlighted that low interest rates would continue to support markets.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy powered on in the second quarter, recording its strongest growth since before the financial crisis, but economists warned the pressure was on UK consumers and businesses to sustain the recovery amid the threat of a triple-dip recession in the eurozone. Growth between April and June was confirmed at 0.8% by the Office for National Statistics in its second estimate, in line with expectations. The last time the economy grew by more than 0.8% was the third quarter of 2007, before the global financial crisis took hold. GDP is now 0.2% above its pre-recession peak in the first quarter of 2008. The annual growth rate was revised up from 3.1% to 3.2% \u2013 the strongest in more than six years. The Treasury said: \"Today's figures confirm that our economy has recovered all of the output lost in the 'Great Recession', and is now bigger than its previous peak in the first quarter of 2008. \"The government's long-term economic plan is working, with the economy growing at its fastest annual rate in six years. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the realistic assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future.\" Industrial production was slightly weaker than previously thought, with growth revised down to 0.3% from 0.4%. The construction sector fared better than expected, with output flat rather than down 0.5%. Growth in the services sector remained unchanged at 1%. Economists said that the second estimate confirmed that while the recovery became more established between April and June, it would become less balanced in the coming months. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, said that the economy was likely to be more dependent on domestic demand as weakness in the eurozone \u2013 Britain's largest trading partner \u2013 and tensions between Russia and the west affect exports. That would be a blow to George Osborne, who has repeatedly stated that an economy less reliant on consumer spending and more reliant on manufacturing and exports is the key to a sustainable future. Wood said: \"Widely spread expansion will get more lopsided over the next couple of quarters as events in Ukraine are weighing on the internationally exposed manufacturing sector, while UK domestic demand continues to expand rapidly. \"We may have to brace for continued weak economic data from Germany and Europe over the next month.\" Fears of a triple-dip recession in the eurozone were raised on Thursday after official figures showed the economy in the 18-member region ground to a halt in the second quarter. Worse still, markets were surprised by the news that Germany's economy shrank by 0.2%. Earlier in the week Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, made it clear that weakness in the eurozone and geopolitical tensions were threats to the UK recovery. The ONS second estimate of second-quarter GDP was less complete than it would usually be at this stage, because it delayed publishing details of the spending side of the economy until next month, when it will make wider revisions to past GDP to bring it in line with EU rules.",

David Hoare, the City turnaround expert who was recently appointed to chair the schools regulator Ofsted, is also expected to reap a substantial windfall from the sale of Moneybarn, which provides finance to 2.5 million people who would struggle to get credit from regular banks. Provident Financial, a doorstep lender that has been accused by consumer rights groups of irresponsible lending, has paid \u00a3120m to buy Moneybarn. Peter Crook, Provident's chief executive, said the acquisition of Moneybarn \u2013 \"the market leader in the non-standard car finance market\" \u2013 was an exciting opportunity to increase earnings. Hoare, whose Duncton Group is the parent company of Moneybarn, has been involved in the subprime car lender since it was founded in 1992. He and his wife own one-third of Moneybarn stock. Crosby, who relinquished his knighthood last year after a parliamentary commission named him as the architect of HBOS's downfall, was brought in to chair Moneybarn in 2011. He is set to reap \u00a3850,000 from the sale of Moneybarn, including profits running to several hundred thousand pounds, under terms of the deal first reported by Sky News. The sale of Moneybarn signals the end of Crosby's career in finance. In 2013, he was forced to stand down as an advisor to the private equity firm Bridgement after the parliamentary committee on banking standards slated him and two fellow HBOS board members for setting the bank on a disastrous course that would have led to ruin even without the financial crisis. Crosby's departure from Moneybarn come as the City regulator steps up scrutiny of consumer credit providers. The Financial Conduct Authority took over the regulation of 50,000 consumer finance firms in April and has introduced tighter rules on payday lenders. Other selling shareholders include James Lupton, a former Barings banker and co-treasurer of the Conservative party. Also cashing in is Peter Norris, a former chief executive of Barings, who presided over the merchant bank when it was destroyed by a \"rogue trader\" in 1995.",
