      "bodyText": "Living standards in the UK have finally made up the ground lost as a result of the financial crash following the boost to incomes provided by rising employment and falling inflation, according to the Resolution Foundation. The thinktank said that the longest squeeze on households in living memory had finally come to an end, with incomes surpassing their previous 2009 peak. But it warned that the pace of recovery was likely to slow during the course of the current parliament and that low-income families were particularly vulnerable to changes to the benefits system. \u201cThe financial crash led to one of the longest and deepest squeezes on household incomes in living memory. But the welcome recent backdrop of strong employment growth and ultra low inflation has meant that typical household incomes have finally surpassed their previous peak.\u201d Real incomes came under severe pressure during and after Britain\u2019s most severe post-war economic downturn, with weak growth, low-wage settlements and high inflation making individuals worse off. But the Resolution Foundation said that in recent years a broad-based recovery had led to the average income adjusted for inflation rising to \u00a324,300 \u2013 its highest ever level. The report \u2013 Living Standards 2016 \u2013 found that some regions had fared better than others during the period from 2008 to 2015 covering the recession and its aftermath. Typical household income growth had been strongest in Scotland (4%), while incomes in Northern Ireland (-2.4%), the West Midlands (-1.9 %) and Eastern England (-0.8%) were still below pre-crash levels. The thinktank said there had also been a contrast between pensioner and working-age households. Typical pensioner household incomes had risen steadily in the wake of the crash, while working-age household incomes fell. This continued a trend that predated the crash in which pensioner incomes had risen 10 times faster than working-age ones since 2002. It predicted that rising inflation, significant reductions in welfare and an uncertain outlook for pay could lead to a slowdown in household income growth, with living standards for typical households rising by an average of just 1% a year over the parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly encouraging to see that the recent recovery has been broadly shared, with low-income households receiving the strongest living standards boost of all,\u201d said Matthew Whittaker, the Resolution Foundation\u2019s chief economist. \u201cBut there are huge uncertainties surrounding the future path of living standards. The pace of recovery is likely to slow over the remainder of the parliament. Substantial benefit cuts will bear down most heavily on poorer households, with many seeing their incomes fall as a result.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Investors who borrow to invest in property and shares should have their deductions capped so the savings could be used to provide a new tax incentive for new affordable housing, says a budget submission by the Australian Council for Social Services. Acoss has proposed $12bn in savings in 2017-18 around changes to negative gearing, tax concessions and the use of private companies and trusts in order to use half the funds ($6bn) for affordable housing, community services, a rise in unemployment payments and rent assistance. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, urged the Coalition not to \u201crepeat the mistakes\u201d of the last two budgets by only focusing on spending cuts while ignoring revenue measures. \u201cGovernments cannot restore their budgets and fund services with one hand tied behind their back,\u201d she said. \u201cThe shortfall on the revenue side must be acknowledged and tackled. Structural reform of the way services such as health are funded and provided must also be undertaken.\u201d Acoss released its traditional budget proposal, joining other community, unions and business groups which lobby the government ahead of the May budget. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will lay out his budget framework on Wednesday at the National Press Club. Following Labor\u2019s new policy to cut negative gearing for all but new properties and slash the capital gains tax concessions by half, the government is also understood to be considering changes which could cap deductions for negative gearing. Morrison has yet to release any detailed policy. On Monday, Kate Carnell, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, urged the Coalition to reduce spending, including scrapping family tax benefit part B, a move which would raise $13.9bn over four years and means-tested the childcare benefit scheme, which would save $250m a year. Carnell warned if the government did not act, Australia risked becoming a crippled economy like Greece. \u201cIf Australia waits until the system breaks, we will consign the next generation to painful readjustments similar to those taking place in southern Europe,\u201d ACCI\u2019s submission says. Goldie said many of Acoss\u2019 proposals such as removing tax concessions \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d came from the 2015 National Reform Summit, attended by community groups, unions and business. \u201cThe impact of our revenue generating measures will grow in value and steadily erode the budget deficit over time. This is essential to adequately fund services, retain and build confidence and steadily reduce the deficit. Acoss proposed major savings including abolishing capital gains tax concessions for small business assets (saving $1bn in 2017-18), taxing superannuation fund earnings ($1.3bn in 2017-18), restricting the seniors and pensioners tax offset to pensioners ($400m in the next two years) and increasing the superannuation to align with the age pension. It would also curb the use of private trusts ($1bn) and private companies ($1bn) to avoid private income tax and reduce subsidies on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for medicines which are out of patent, (saving $2.2bn in 2017-18). \u201cGenuine tax reform is not about raising or lowering tax rates: it should begin by limiting unfair tax breaks and unintended loopholes that mainly benefit people who are on higher incomes and erode the tax base,\u201d Goldie said. \u201cThese are well known and include superannuation, investor housing tax concessions and the use of company and family trusts, which enable people to avoid paying their fair share of tax.\u201d But Acoss has urged the government to increase unemployment payments by $53 a week for single people (cost $1.6bn in 2017-18), index allowances to wages ($100m in 2017-18), establish an affordable housing growth fund ($1bn in 2017-18) and increase the maximum rate of rent assistance by 30% ($770m in 2017-18). Acoss would also increase investment in community services and extend deductible gift recipient status to a wider range of charities. \u201cOn the spending side, it\u2019s time to abandon an approach that simply shifts costs to service users, people living in poverty, and state governments,\u201d Goldie said. \u201cInstead, we should be focused on ensuring services are delivered cost effectively, for example by relying less on subsidies for private insurance in health. \u201cWe will not resile from advocating budget action to ease the worst income poverty and to address gaps in essential services, like dental health and affordable housing. \u201cThe single most important investment the government could make in this budget to reduce poverty is the long-overdue increase to the unemployment payment, which is currently $37 a day.\u201d Revenue and savings measures proposed by Acoss: \u2022 Abolish certain capital gains tax concessions for small business assets (saving $0 in 2016-17; $1bn in 2017-18) \u2022 Tax superannuation fund earnings more consistently (saving $0 in 2016-17; $1.3bn in 2017-18) \u2022 Restrict the seniors and pensioners tax offset (SAPTO) to pensioners (saving $200m in 2016-17; $200m in 2017-18) \u2022 Increase the superannuation preservation age to align it with the age pension age (savings beyond the forward estimates) \u2022 Remove grandfathering arrangements for concessions for non-superannuation termination payments and unused leave ($400m in 2016-17; $500m in 2017-18) \u2022 Curb the use of private trusts to avoid personal income tax (saving $0 in 2016-17; $1.5bn in 2017-18); \u2022 Curb the use of private companies to avoid personal income tax (saving $0 in 2016-17; $1bn in 2017-18) \u2022 Reduce subsidies for pharmaceutical benefits scheme-listed medicines which are out of patent ($2bn in 2016-17; $2.2bn in 2017-18). Proposed new spending: \u2022 Increase allowance payments, including the unemployment payment, by $53 a week for single people (costing $1.4bn in 2016-17; $1.6bn in 2017-18) \u2022 Index allowance payments annually to wages (costing $60m in 2016-17; $100m in 2017-18) \u2022 Establish an affordable housing growth fund (costing $750m in 2016-17; $1bn in 2017-18) \u2022 Increase the maximum rate of rent assistance by 30% (costing $750m in 2016-17; $770m in 2017-18 \u2022 Increase investment in community services to previous funding levels and index community services funding to wage movements ($1.87bn in 2016-17; $2.2bn in 2017-18) \u2022 Extend deductible gift recipient status to a wider range of charities to support funding diversification ($700m in 2016-17; $800m in 2017-18).",

Stock markets across Europe, which were already rallying after a turbulent start to 2016, ended the day sharply higher in the belief Draghi would deliver on his pledge at the ECB meeting next month. Financial markets believe Draghi will respond to fears of deflation and volatile share prices by pushing interest rates into negative territory and expanding the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme. Draghi dropped the broadest of hints in testimony to the European parliament that further stimulus was imminent. \u201cThe ECB is ready to do its part,\u201d he said, adding that the bank was looking at the low level of inflation and whether enough money was getting through from the banks to the eurozone economy. \u201cIf either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act,\u201d Draghi said. He was speaking after the Chinese stock market opened for the first time in five days, during which global financial markets were rocked by fears of a rerun of the 2008 banking crisis. It held steady, helped by a 7% increased in Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, which posted its second-biggest one-day gain in three years. The rally in Japan was prompted by weaker than expected growth figures, which led to speculation that the Bank of Japan would also step in to shore up the economy. The rally had already helped set a positive tone for European markets, which rose further after Draghi spoke. The FTSE 100 closed 2% higher at 5,824.28 with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 2.7% to 9,206.84, and France\u2019s CAC 40 rising 3% to close at 4,115.25. In the UK, Ian McCafferty, who sits on the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting body, the monetary policy committee, was also indicating that Threadneedle Street could act. Despite the environment of low interest rates, which might hamper policymakers\u2019 ability to inject stimulus, McCafferty said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t believe we are out of ammunition.\u201d There was scope to cut interest rates and revive its bond-buying programme if the economy lurches downward, or even impose negative interest rates. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, McCafferty, who had been voting for a rate rise until this month, said: \u201cI think an immediate rate rise isn\u2019t as necessary as I had felt last autumn.\u201d Next month is the seventh anniversary of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to lower official interest rates to 0.5%. Until recently, Threadneedle Street has been wary of pushing borrowing costs any lower for fear of the impact it might have on building societies, a concern that has now receded. Amid fears for the health of the banking sector, particularly in Italy, Draghi tried to allay concerns. \u201cIn the euro area, the situation in the banking sector now is very different from what it was in 2012,\u201d he said. Draghi made his comments as some financial institutions responded to the poor start for 2016 by revising down their growth forecasts. At Axa, the forecasts for global GDP for 2016 were cut to 2.7%, down from 3.1%, while analysts at Berenberg said the slower start to the year had forced it to reduce its 2016 forecast for the US to 2.1%, from 2.3%. The Berenberg economists cut their predictions for eurozone GDP from 1.6% to 1.3%, citing market turmoil that was hitting sentiment.",

      "bodyText": "Almost 1,400 retail jobs have been saved after the private equity firm that put the discount shoe chain Brantano into administration bought it back. Alteri has bought 81 shops and 59 small concessions, which between them employ 1,372 people. However, the future of 58 stores remains at risk after Alteri chose not to purchase them, meaning 600 people face losing their job. Brantano went into administration last month after suffering a difficult Christmas. The retailer was founded in Belgium in 1953 and expanded into the UK by buying 47 Shoe City shops in 1998. The Alteri deal could prove controversial because the private equity firm owned Brantano before it collapsed. Alteri is thought to have paid less than \u00a310m to buy back Brantano, although the financial details were not disclosed. Gavin George, chief executive of Alteri, defended the deal and insisted he had \u201cwanted to find a solvent solution\u201d. George said that Alteri had tried to strike an agreement with Brantano\u2019s landlords about reducing its rent bill before calling in administrators and also played down the threat of suppliers missing out on millions of pounds of overdue payments. \u201cIt is unlikely that many are going to lose out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried really, really hard to undertake the restructuring solvently, but we were unable to do so. This is the only way we could restructure the business to give it a good go-forward position.\u201d George said there is still a place for a \u201cfamily footwear out-of-town specialist\u201d in the retail industry. Brantano has been the biggest victim of the difficult festive period for retailers. Consumers shopped online instead of on the high street and warmer than average weather dampened demand for winter fashion. PwC, the administrators, said they will continue to run the remaining Brantano stores and try to find a buyer. However, they warned redundancies will be \u201cinevitable\u201d if a deal is not agreed soon. Robert Moran, deals partner at PwC, said the Alteri offer was the \u201cbest outcome for creditors and employees\u201d. He said: \u201cFrom discussions held over the last few weeks, there was interest from a number of parties, both trade and private equity, for the Brantano business. \u201cOf this interest, the offer from Alteri represents the best outcome for creditors and employees. We are delighted that 1,372 jobs have been preserved through the transaction and thank the Brantano team for working closely and collaboratively with us throughout what has been a difficult period for the business.\u201d",

This was one of those days when bad news was good news. The thinking goes as follows. If the Japanese economy shrank by 0.4% in the final three months of 2015 and Chinese exports fell by more than 11%, policymakers will sit up and take notice. Central banks will stimulate activity by cutting interest rates, even when they are already negative, and by expanding their quantitative easing (QE) programmes. Right on cue, Mario Draghi popped up before the European parliament to administer a bit of his own soothing balm. Yes, of course, the European Central Bank (ECB) is abreast of what has been going on in the markets, and \u201cwill not hesitate to act\u201d if necessary. Markets took this as a promise from the ECB president that he will come up with more stimulus next month. More stimulus equals more growth equals higher corporate profits equals higher share prices. A moment\u2019s thought suggests this is a far from watertight thesis. For a start, financial markets should wait and see what Draghi does rather than get too excited about what he says. The ECB disappointed in December by not delivering as much extra stimulus as expected, in large part because Draghi ran into resistance from Germany. Even if the ECB does come up with the goods and this is accompanied by more action from the Bank of Japan and the People\u2019s Bank of China, there is no guarantee that it will have any material effect.

Andrew Lapthorne, analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, notes that one of the ploys being used by central banks \u2013 negative interest rates\u2013 is subject to the law of unintended consequences. Negative interest rates make holding government bonds attractive even when they are yielding next to nothing.

    "webTitle": "ECB ready to act, says Draghi, as shares move higher on stimulus hopes -as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With no guidance from Wall Street, one way or the other, European markets continue to perform strongly. Investors had feared there would be a collapse in the Chinese market which wouild cause more turmoil elsewhere, but this failed to happen. Instead a 7.% rise in Japan is one of the driving factors behind broad based gain elsewhere. The FTSE 100 is currently more than 2% higher while Germany\u2019s Dax has jumped 3%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 3.1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets said: Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at the European Parliament is essentially an exercise in reassurance, because no one \u2013 not even the central banks - knows what\u2019s going on at the moment. The market simply doesn\u2019t stay in one place long enough to be prescribed the right treatment. So we must wait until March for genuine talk about specifics, and things could well be very different by then. Of course, they could also be exactly the same as they are now! Question: Inflation expectations over 10 years are well below ECB targets. Which indicator would you use. What would be success or failure of monetary policy? What is the appropriate fiscal stance. Draghi: We are far away, we do not use one set of indicators [five years, ten years]. But we are far away, so we will reconsider stance in March. Our objective is rate below but close to 2%. Our horizon to reach the target has been lengthened... due to developments out of our control: emerging markets, oil prices, etc. The same situation is in the US, Japan. Appropriate fiscal stance for eurozone. At the moment, lightly expansionary. Ideally should be expansionary while in line with stability and growth pact. Draghi\u2019s comments about being ready to act seem to be sending the euro lower. The single currency is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar at $1.1141. Question: Your policies have been criticised for not working, including savers with low interest rates. Also I read the ECB is in talks with Italian government about buying bundles of bad loans. My question is, why? How is it in the interests of rest of euro area? Draghi: Don\u2019t agree QE and monetary policy not working. It has been the only one stimulative policy. We now face a situation different to two years ago. We have a gradual recovery, which continues. We have to get inflation back to our objective, below or close to 2%. On that front the situation is less satisfactory. The council will review and reconsider monetary policy stance in March. This policy produces low interest rates. But we have low interest rates everywhere. The problems savers etc in eurozone are the same as in US and Japan. The solutions are slightly different. We are very conscious of this, and wish rates could go up again. It would mean recovery is proceeding successfully. On Italian talks - not that I know. The story that ECB would buy non-performing loand in Italy. We are not talking about buying anything. The question is could they be accepted as collatoral. [But] collatoral is different from purchasing. He added that having NPLs in asset backed securities would not disqualify using ABS\u2019s as collatoral. But I am not aware of talks, and I would say we have no losses on our collatoral at the moment. Question on the current negotiations between the EU and Britain. Draghi: The ECB is not a party to these negotations. We can say two things. There are two aspects we should protect [in any negotiations]. One is single market, second is our monetary union. Further integration of our monetary union is essential. The EU and Britain have to work together, both drawing benefits from it, he says, adding: The objective of the talks is to anchor the UK in the EU. Question about abolition of \u20ac500 note [as it is linked increasingly with crime] Draghi: We are considering action on that front. We have to do it very carefully. The council and board reflecting on how to do it in best way. But nothing to do with reducing cash [in the system]. Draghi has also addressed the meltdown in the banking sector in recent days, which has been partly caused by concern about the effect of negative interest rates on banks\u2019 margins. He said: Since early December, a general deterioration in market sentiment has taken root and has gathered pace over the last week. This initially appeared closely linked to concerns regarding weakening economic activity around the globe \u2013 notably in emerging markets \u2013 and to potential adverse signals from falling commodity prices. Over time however, market sentiment has become more volatile and susceptible to rapid change. In this environment, stock prices significantly declined and bank equity prices were particularly hit, both globally and in Europe. The sharp fall in bank equity prices reflected the sector\u2019s higher sensitivity to a weaker-than-expected economic outlook; it also reflected fears that some parts of the banking sector were exposed to the higher risks in commodity-producing sectors. The bulk of euro area listed banks, although they have relatively limited exposure to emerging markets and commodity producing countries, are currently trading well below their book values. The fall in bank equity prices was amplified by perceptions that banks may have to do more to adjust their business models to the lower growth/lower interest rate environment and to the strengthened international regulatory framework that has been put in place since the crisis. He also tried to calm concerns about the state of European banks, in particular in relation to non-performing loans: In the euro area, the situation in the banking sector now is very different from what it was in 2012. Perhaps most importantly, euro area banks have significantly strengthened their capital positions over the past few years... Clearly, some parts of the banking sector in the euro area still face a number of challenges. These range from uncertainty about litigation and restructuring costs in a number of banks to working through a stock of legacy assets, particularly in the countries most affected by the financial crisis. There is a subset of banks with elevated levels of non-performing loans (NPLs). However, these NPLs were identified during the Comprehensive Assessment, using for the first time a common definition, and have since been adequately provisioned for. Therefore, we are in a good position to bring down NPLs in an orderly manner over the next few years. For this purpose, the ECB\u2019s supervisory arm is working closely with the relevant national authorities to ensure that our NPL policies are complemented by the necessary national measures. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has said the bank will not hesitate to act in the light of the recent economic and market turmoil. At its last meeting the ECB said it would review its monetary policy stance at its next meeting in March, but in a speech to the European Parliament, Draghi suggested the turbulence in the markets last week has given it extra urgency: In order to make the euro area more resilient, contributions from all policy areas are needed. The ECB is ready to do its part. As we announced at the end of our last monetary policy meeting in January, the Governing Council will review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance in early March. The focus of our deliberations will be twofold. First, we will examine the strength of the pass-through of low imported inflation to domestic wage and price formation and to inflation expectations. This will depend on the size and the persistence of the fall in oil and commodity prices and the incidence of second-round effects on domestic wages and prices. Second, in the light of the recent financial turmoil, we will analyse the state of transmission of our monetary impulses by the financial system and in particular by banks. If either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act. And he repeated his calls for fiscal policies to help the economy recover: In parallel, other policies should help to put the euro area economy on firmer grounds. It is becoming clearer and clearer that fiscal policies should support the economic recovery through public investment and lower taxation. In addition, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creations and raise productivity. Compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact remains essential to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. It is doubtful that HSBC ever intended to leave the UK and highly likely chancellor George Osborne paid too high a price to ensure it stayed, says economics editor Larry Elliott. His full analysis is here: Is the European Central Bank\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions policy - president Mario Draghi\u2019s promise in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro - legal? The European Court of Justice has ruled it is, but on Tuesday a German court will look at the issue (although no judgement is expected until the summer. UniCredit\u2019s Andreas Rees says: Tomorrow, a public hearing on the OMT before the German Constitutional Court (GCC) will take place. Besides the complainants, Bundesbank President Weidmann and ECB Executive Board Member Mersch will also attend. The ruling is expected by summer. In June 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) already stated that the OMT is legal under EU law. However, the GCC made the controversial claim of having the right to deliver a final judgment as far as German institutions (the Bundesbank) are concerned. In general, we expect the GCC to accept the verdict of the ECJ. In order not to lose its face, the GCC could stress the responsibility of the German government and the Bundestag in case of the OMT being activated. One possibility is the making of provisions for the federal budget in the theoretical case of losses for the Bundesbank. Even if the GCC was heading for an outright confrontation with the ECJ there would not be any legal obstacles (for the Bundesbank) to participate further in QE. Over in Greece and the country\u2019s budget primary surplus came in at \u20ac1.19bn in January, up from \u20ac443m last year and well above the target of \u20ac307m. The figures were helped by better than expected revenues and lower than forecast outlays. The Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann may find himself in a tricky spot: More signs that the European Central Bank may act next month to provide further stimulus to the economy, including rate cuts, following news that Germany\u2019s central bank has cut its inflation forecasts for this year and next. The Bundesbank has slashed its forecast for inflation in 2016 from 1.1% to just 0.25% and in 2017 from 2% to 1.75%. The move comes amid the slump in oil prices, and the bank said: \u201cFluctuations in the price of oil typically have a very fast and noticeable effect on the price of energy for consumers.\u201d The ECB will be looking at its own forecasts for its March meeting, and if it also cuts them, further action is likely. Thousands of steelworkers are starting to arrive in Brussels to protest against what they call unfair trading practices by Chinese firms. The eurozone trade figures showed a rise in the trade balance to \u20ac24.3bn in December from \u20ac23.6bn a year earlier. Exports slipped 0.3% month on month as the benefits of a weaker euro were outweighed by a slowdown in global growth. Imports rose 0.8% in December compared to the previous month. Economist Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: Weakened December traded goods data reinforce suspicion that net trade was of little help to Eurozone GDP growth in the fourth quarter.... While eurozone exporters have had appreciable help from a very competitive euro, the upside for exports has been constrained by muted global growth. Looking ahead, Eurozone exporters manufacturers will be worried by the current heightened concerns over global growth and they will also not be happy with the euro\u2019s recent overall firmer tone \u2013 although it is still at a competitive level. With US markets closed and the half term school holiday underway in the UK, it is hard to know how sustainable the market rally is, but continuing strength in the oil price could help. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The new week on the London market is barely two hours old, but already the FTSE 100 has notched up triple-digit gains, having risen nearly 6% from the lows seen last Thursday. As with other bounces in recent months, the move has many scratching their heads and wondering why investors have suddenly become so ebullient, when not even a week ago all was doom and gloom. However, the rally comes within the context of a broader downtrend that is a reflection of ongoing concerns about the global economy. For the moment therefore, this upward move gets filed as a brief flowering of bullish sentiment, rather than the start of something much more long-term. European markets are also strongly higher, but with the US out of the picture due to a national holiday it is too early to know whether these gains are going to last into the rest of the week. Oil prices, which are still the main determinant of whether stock markets go up or down, are higher on the day; if the commodity can keep rallying into coming sessions we will see fresh buying momentum develop in stock markets. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: Equity markets making a bullish start to the week, adding to the gains of Friday and Thursday\u2019s bounce from lows helped by breaks of the February downtrends. And it would appear to be a case of bad news is good news again. This after poor data from China (Exports, Imports) and Japan (GDP, Industrial Production) added to hopes of more central bank intervention and stimulus which buoyed commodities prices. Add to this a continued waning of worries over the banking sector (despite many a headwind remaining) thanks to talk of the ECB buying bundles of bad loans from Italian banks and many are asking if we have found a bottom. After HSBC announced it planned to keep its headquarters in the UK, it has also warned it could move 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris if the UK leaves the European Union. Jill Treanor reports: HSBC chairman Douglas Flint told the BBC that while the \u201cbest answer\u201d was to remain in a reformed Europe, the bank had the ability, in the event of a \u201cno\u201d vote, to \u201cmove people between London and Paris\u201d. Flint was referring to the bank\u2019s non-ringfenced operations. The ringfenced bank includes HSBC\u2019s high street operations, which are to be headquartered in Birmingham to comply with the new rules that protect taxpayers from having to bail out banks. The referendum on Europe, which could be held in June, would have less of an impact on the \u201cholding company\u201d but could impact the operational activities of the wholesale bank, he said. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, later told Sky News: \u201cWe have 5,000 people in global banking and markets [HSBC\u2019s investment bank] in London and I could imagine that around 20% of those would move to Paris.\u201d Our full report is here: As the market rally continues, the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 is consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser. The company, whose products range from Nurofen tablets to Durex condoms, reported a 6% rise in like-for-like full year sales, better than the 5.3% forecast from analysts. The results have helped lift its shares more than 6%. With investors taking a more optimistic view of equity markets, the traditional haven in stormy times - gold - is losing its lustre at the moment. Gold is down from $1237 to $1210 an ounce, while silver is also on the slide, down from $15.71 to $15.29 an ounce. The European Central Bank is talking to the Italian government about using its asset purchase programme to buy bad loans packages from banks and accepting them as collateral in return for cash, according to Reuters: The move could give a big boost to a recently approved Italian scheme aimed at helping banks offload some of their 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of soured credit and free up resources for new loans. Nonetheless, it would likely fuel a debate in other countries about whether the ECB is taking on too much risk by buying asset-backed securities (ABS) based on loans that have not been repaid for roughly three months. Italian Treasury officials told reporters the ECB may buy these securities as part of its 1.5 trillion euros asset-purchase program or accept them as collateral from banks in return for cash, in so called repurchase agreements. The ECB declined to comment. Whether the current market rally has any staying power could depend on the central banks, notably the Federal Reserve, says Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe at stockbroker Interactive Investor: Stocks have soared in Asia, rebounding aggressively after last week\u2019s falls and providing further impetus for European markets. Recent moves have seen markets lurching from anticipation to despair, sometimes on the same day - so the hope is that this sharp move higher will set a more positive tone for investors, rather than just be seen as an opportunity to sell the rally. Global central banks are yet again in the spotlight, with the People\u2019s Bank of China intervening to boost the renminbi and Mario Draghi widely expected to discuss further support during his testimony this afternoon. Janet Yellen spent much of last week trying to deflect blame for the market turmoil from the Federal Reserve, but with the ECB, BoJ, and now also the PBoC all actively supporting investors it does rather appear as though the US Fed represents the principal downside risk for global equity markets. Katherine Garrett-Cox is to leave Alliance Trust, the investment company where she became chief executive in 2008, in the latest stage of a shake-up of the business. She stepped down from the board last year but remained chief executive of the company\u2019s fund management arm. Now Alliance said she will leave on 11March by mutual agreement. The business was targeted last year by hedge fund Elliott Advisors who criticised its performance and cost base, leading to a change of chairman. Lord Smith of Kelvin, the new chairman said: Alliance Trust is undergoing significant change to improve both its operating performance and investment returns...it is clear to us that the role of chief executive of Alliance Trust Investments has changed significantly. Garrett-Cox - known in the City as \u201cKatherine the Great\u2019 - earned \u00a31.4m last year, and the company said compensation for her loss of office would be paid \u201cin line with Alliance Trust\u2019s remuneration policy and the terms of Katherine\u2019s contract.\u201d More on what to expect from ECB president Mario Draghi at the European parliament later. Analyst at UniCredit said: Given the latest market developments and with inflation expectations at record lows, we expect confirmation that more easing is in the pipeline. However, testimonies to the EU parliament do not usually send new policy messages, so hints at specific measures are unlikely. On Thursday, the account of the monetary policy meeting held on 21 January will be released. After that meeting - which kept rates on hold - Draghi said the ECB would review its policy measures in March, sooner than many investors had been expecting. As expected European markets have followed Asia higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up 97 points or 1.7% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 2.1%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.2%, Spain\u2019s Ibex 2.65% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB 1.7% at the open. The FTSE Eurofirst300 is ahead 1.6%. Banks, hard hit last week on fears that negative interest rates would squeeze their margins at a time when their balance sheets were already under pressure, are among the leading risers. Commerzbank is up 9.4%, Deutsche Bank 4.8% and Credit Suisse 7.3%. In the FTSE 100 Barclays is 2.5% better while HSBC, which has confirmed it will keep its headquarters in the UK, is up 1.1%. Oil has stabilised after its recent volatility, with Brent crude down just 0.18% at $33.3 a barrel. Despite predictions of a crash in Chinese markets when they re-opened after the Lunar New Year holiday, the worst fears were not realised. Both the CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite have ended down around 0.6%, helped by the positive mood in other Asian markets, notably Japan where the yen weakened amid promises of more intervention if necessary. On the corporate front, BAE Systems has appointed oil executive Charles Woodburn to the newly created role of chief operating officer. The move puts Woodburn in line to replace chief executive Ian King in 12 to 18 months time. It\u2019s a quiet day for data, apart from eurozone trade data and a speech from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi at the European parliament. And with US markets closed for Presidents Day - the country\u2019s tribute to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln - it is Asia which is likely to dominate sentiment for the day. Commenting on the action so far, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A strong fix for the yuan has eased devaluation concerns leading to relatively small losses in China, a rebound across the rest of Asia and a higher open expected for Europe. Ordinarily, US markets closed for Presidents Day would leave European trading are a little on the quiet side but recent volatility could mean otherwise. There had been some expectation that Chinese markets could wreak havoc as the country plays catch-up with sharp declines in global stock markets after returning from Lunar New Year celebrations. A bigger than expected decline in Chinese trade data was offset by soothing word over the weekend from PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan who played down forex fears. Later in the week comes a range of UK data, including inflation, unemployment and retail sales. And the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting will also be released, although they are somewhat out of date given Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress last week when she raised the prospect of negative US interest rates. Meanwhile the ECB\u2019s attempts to lower the euro have been under pressure so Draghi\u2019s speech will be widely watched. Lawler said: The euro has been a beneficiary of risk-off in financial markets, trading at its highest since October against the dollar. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s last attempt to talk up the prospect of further easing at the ECB\u2019s March meeting had the unusual effect of sending the euro higher so he may look to reassert his influence in his speech. I\u2019m handing over to Nick Fletcher, my colleague in London, who bring you all the day\u2019s developments from the UK, European and US markets. Have a good day and thanks for joining me. The FTSE100 and Germany\u2019s DAX is set for a strong opening today according to IG. The puzzle that is the financial markets is engaging brains all over the world. Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays in New York, told Reuters that market volatility could feed back into the real economy and pose a risk to stability which the authorities are ill-placed to do anything about. He pointed to three sources of volatility that had potential negative feedback loops: lower oil prices, capital outflows and economic weakness in China, and pressure on European banks. Rajadhyaksha said: Of these, we consider China the biggest medium-term risk, but the least immediate issue. Strong day in Australia where the ASX/S&amp;P200 has finished 1.64% or 78 points to the good at 4,843 points. It\u2019s all over for the day in Tokyo where the Nikkei has finished up a whopping 7.16%. Treble sakes all round!!! Here\u2019s where we are so far today. No post-new year fireworks in China but lots of action: The Nikkei average in Tokyo has bounced up 7% after losing 11% last week, shrugging off dreadful GDP figures showing Japan\u2019s economy shrank 1.4% in 2015 A weaker yen has helped, plus the promise of more easing after Shinzo Abe said Tokyo would intervene \u201cwhere necessary\u201d to influence the forex market Other Asia Pacific indices followed suit with Australia up 1.64%, Korea up 1.39% and Hong Kong 2.91%. European markets set to open up In China CSI300 was down 0.67% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.81% after reopening from the long new year break. Chinese trade plunged sharply in January. Exports down 11% in dollar terms and imports down 16.6%. The yuan strengthened against the dollar after the central bank ruled out further devaluation. Oil dipped slightly with Brent crude falling 17c to $33.19. Japan\u2019s economic revitalisation minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, has all but ruled out emergency government measures to stimulate the economy. Instead, Ishihara called for the quick implementation of a 3.32 trillion yen supplementary budget passed by parliament last month that provides support for child-rearing and nursing care, as well as a handout \u2013 intended to boost spending \u2013 for pensioners. Ishihara said Japan\u2019s economic fundamentals were \u201csound\u201d, adding that it was moving towards a recovery in employment and corporate profits, despite the disappointing GDP figures. Thailand grew by 2.8% in 2015, compared with 0.8% the previous year, according to official data today. But despite the extra growth, the country\u2019s recovery from the turmoil of the military coup in 2014 remains fragile. The state planning agency cut its forecast for 2016 growth to 2.8-3.8% from the 3.0-4.0% range it saw in November. One of the factors in China\u2019s currency fluctuation (see below) is the amount of money wealthy citizens are removing from the country. Some estimates say up to a trillion US dollars has been taken out in the past year, further weakening confidence in China\u2019s slowing economy and undermining the yuan, which the Beijing leadership wants to be become a fully-fledged international unit. So, very interesting piece in the New York Times about the outflow and the practice of Smurfing, whereby people remove the annual maximum $50,000 from the country in cash. China\u2019s trade data has thrown new light on the oil market, where the slump in prices has been a key downward driver of stock markets in recent weeks. China\u2019s crude imports dropped 20% in January from record high volumes the previous month, Reuters reports. Crude imports to the world\u2019s second biggest economy in January were also down 4.6% on a year-on-year basis at 26.69m tonnes, or 6.29m barrels per day. But the data was distorted by China taking advantage of low global oil prices last year to add up to 185m barrels to its reserves, Reuters calculated. So that has taken the edge off crude\u2019s price spike on Friday. London Brent crude was down 17c at $33.19 a barrel at 0430am GMT. The markets are loving the idea of more intervention. The Nikkei is now up more than 6%. Another 5% and it will have regained all the losses of last week in one session. (Funny that, given how we normally associate finance operatives with conservative, anti-government views, isn\u2019t it? ) Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe has given some encouragement to investors who think he could authorise more government intervention to boost the economy. He told parliament today that \u201cexcessive currency volatility is undesirable\u201d, a reference to the sharp rise in the yen last week that sent stocks plunging. He added that Tokyo would take appropriate action in the exchange rate market as needed and he hoped the Group of 20 finance leaders will take appropriate measures to address global economic problems when they meet in Shanghai next week. The US dollar rose further hitting a session high of 113.87 yen compared with last week\u2019s 15-month trough of 110.985. In Australia the banks have made a decent comeback after being hurt by last week\u2019s sell-off. The financials sector on the ASX/S&amp;P200 \u2013 the big four banks have been as much as one-third of the index\u2019s overall value \u2013 climbed 1.4% on Monday. ANZ is up 2.43% while the Commonwealth is up nearly 1%. It will be a relief for investors after a sell-off in Europe invoked the spectre of the 2008-09 banking crisis. But they may not be completely out of the woods. A leading UK economist, Sir John Vickers, has warned that the country\u2019s banks face a serious threat from any global economic shock despite the measures taken since the GFC to make them safer. Calling for banks to hold more capital, Sir John, who led the UK\u2019s inquiry into the banking collapse, said: A good way to think about it is as an insurance policy. You have to pay a premium to insure your house and you hope nothing bad will happen. But if it does, you are much better off in paying that premium, and for full coverage. If banks run out of capital, all sorts of havoc could ensue. We want to be in a position where there\u2019s enough of a buffer to take any losses that might occur. Today\u2019s figures from China and Japan are likely to increase the clamour for more action from the central banks. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, identified the key \u201cbad news is good news\u201d formula: Asia has found its mojo. There is nothing like poor data to get the equity bulls excited. Japanese Q4 GDP fell 1.4% quarter-on-quarter annualised, 60 basis points worse than forecasts, with nominal faring slightly better. Consumption remains poor, although if you break down the facts, the shining light is that Capex gained for a second quarter. For those looking at the demand story, China\u2019s January trade data would be particular worrying with exports (in USD terms) falling 11.2% in January and imports falling 18.8% in January. It\u2019s been a lively day so far. Despite shocking data from Japan and China, stock markets are up across Asia Pacific. Although the indices in mainland China are down, last week\u2019s closure will have distorted today\u2019s trading and a better, more up-to-date picture surely comes from Japan where the Nikkei has soared more than 5%. This is presumably on the basis of more intervention by the Bank of Japan to bolster shrinking output. Junko Nishioka, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, quoted by Reuters, sums up the mood and predicted more monetary easing could come as early as next month: Private consumption is especially weak. The economy is at a standstill. It\u2019s a matter of time before the BOJ and the government will take additional stimulus measures. Anyway, here are the main points: Chinese imports and exports plummeted by 11.2% and 16.6% respectively in January compared with the previous year. The Japanese economy shrank 1.4% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis. Stocks are up. Nikkei up 5.12% at the lunch break while the ASX200 in Australia is up 0.98% and the Kospi in Korea is 1.38% to the good. Not so good in China where the two main indices \u2013 the CSI300 and the SHanghai Composite \u2013 are down 1.16% and 1.2%. But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong is up 2.39%. Nikkei probably helped by a 0.34% drop in the yen to 113 to the US dollar. Brent crude is down 45c at $32.91 a barrel. There\u2019s no doubt where some commentators stand on the Chinese trade data with these tweets from zerohedge making the point that the poor figures come despite the yuan drifitng lower in recent months. The China trade figures look even worse in dollar terms which put exports down 11.2% in January compared with the same month in 2015, while imports were down a thumping 16.6%, the General Customs Administration said today. However, officials said they expected the downward pressure on exports would begin to ease by the second quarter of this year. Ouch. China has released its trade figures for January and they\u2019re not good. Exports down 6.6% (year-on-year in yuan terms) compared with forecasts of +3.6% Imports down 14.4% compared with 1.8% Trade surplus up to 406bn yuan against a forecast of 389bn. Still on the yuan, it\u2019s clear from market commentary this morning that remarks by the PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan at the weekend about the currency have helped calm jitters. In an interview with the financial magazine Caixin, Zhou said that there was no basis for the yuan to keep depreciating and that China did not need to force the yuan lower in order to make exports more competitive. ,The PBOC would keep the yuan stable versus a basket of currencies, he said. That\u2019s good news for markets for a couple of reasons: First, pessimistic observers think a devaluation of the yuan - forced or otherwise \u2013 would be extremely bad new for the global economy. Albert Edwards at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, for example, thinks China will be forced to devalue, sending a wave of deflation around the world. So, a strong statement from Zhou will soothe concerns about a big move in the yuan triggering a currency war. Second, markets hate uncertainty and have been frustrated by China\u2019s opaque decision-making on financial maters. Any statement out of Beijing \u2013 no matter what the policy \u2013 will help. For more background, here\u2019s an explainer from our economics correspondent Phillip Inman about China\u2019s surprise devaluation in August. The yuan, subject of much hand-wringing in trading rooms and world chancelleries alike, has nudged up today. The People\u2019s Bank of China set its official midpoint trading rate at 6.5118 per dollar, up sharply from 6.5314 before the holiday. That reflects a slightly calmer and more optimistic outlook for the Chinese economy compared with 10 days ago. Quite big potatoes given the pressure the currency has been under and the reports of huge intervention to keep it stable. According to Reuters, the midpoint\u2019s 0.3% rise on Monday was the biggest jump on the previous fix since 2 November last year when it gained 0.5%. Trading is underway in China again after the new year break and it looks like they are playing a bit of catch-up with last week\u2019s sell-off. CSI300 index down 2.5% to 2,888.79 points Shanghai Composite index down 2.8% to 2,685.77 points. But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, where there was a shorter break last week, is more in line with other markets in Asia and is up 2%. Our man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, has just filed a story on the latest evidence that Shinzo Abe\u2019s plan to kickstart the moribund Japanese economy is failing badly. The economy shrank 1.4% on an annualised basis in the fourth quarter, figures released earlier today showed. Justin writes: In what some have described the death-knell for \u201cAbenomics\u201d \u2013 his three-arrow policy of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reform \u2013 recent currency and market turmoil have wiped out the gains made soon after he became prime minister in late 2012. \u201c(The plan) actually worked, but now it is moving in reverse,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, director of Japan Macro Advisors in Tokyo. Here\u2019s the full story: Welcome to the Guardian business live blog from Sydney. They say a week can be a long time in politics (I think it was Harold Wilson the former British prime minister, who coined the phrase), and the same could also be said for the markets. During last week\u2019s ferocious selling, it looked like China\u2019s markets had dodged a bullet by being closed for the long new year break. Japan had its worst week since 2008 and oil hit a new low. But today things look rosier. Despite a dismal set of GDP figures, markets around the region have soared on the back of a strong session on Wall Street on Friday and higher oil prices. But the big factor could prove to be comments from China\u2019s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, who at the weekend ruled out any depreciation of the yuan for the foreseeable future. Main points so far: The Nikkei has shot back up by 4% after last week\u2019s horror show That\u2019s despite the Japan\u2019s GDP shrinking 1.4% in the fourth quarter The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up 0.77% and Korea is up 0.96% Crude prices are down slightly after Friday\u2019s huge double-digit jump Evan Lucas from IG in Melbourne sets the scene: China may be positively influenced by the rally on Friday and the fact Japan looks to have turned a corner. The likelihood of a sharp one-off interventionist devaluation in the [yuan] is remote, bordering on never. [Zhou] did leave the option to allow a gradual depreciation in the [yuan] but, in short, the fear around a Chinese intervention should dissipate. But then again .... The bigger question is: Will it last? Chinese trade figures will get the ball rolling any minute now ....",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since early December, a general deterioration in market sentiment has taken root and has gathered pace over the last week. This initially appeared closely linked to concerns regarding weakening economic activity around the globe \u2013 notably in emerging markets \u2013 and to potential adverse signals from falling commodity prices. Over time however, market sentiment has become more volatile and susceptible to rapid change. In this environment, stock prices significantly declined and bank equity prices were particularly hit, both globally and in Europe. The sharp fall in bank equity prices reflected the sector\u2019s higher sensitivity to a weaker-than-expected economic outlook; it also reflected fears that some parts of the banking sector were exposed to the higher risks in commodity-producing sectors. The bulk of euro area listed banks, although they have relatively limited exposure to emerging markets and commodity producing countries, are currently trading well below their book values. </p> <p>The fall in bank equity prices was amplified by perceptions that banks may have to do more to adjust their business models to the lower growth/lower interest rate environment and to the strengthened international regulatory framework that has been put in place since the crisis.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"695e667211d8c3a6024acdb26d6fa4ebdf796b2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/695e667211d8c3a6024acdb26d6fa4ebdf796b2f/0_0_598_336/500.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi at the European Parliament.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the European Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: European Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also tried to calm concerns about the state of European banks, in particular in relation to non-performing loans:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the euro area, the situation in the banking sector now is very different from what it was in 2012. Perhaps most importantly, euro area banks have significantly strengthened their capital positions over the past few years...</p> <p>Clearly, some parts of the banking sector in the euro area still face a number of challenges. These range from uncertainty about litigation and restructuring costs in a number of banks to working through a stock of legacy assets, particularly in the countries most affected by the financial crisis. There is a subset of banks with elevated levels of non-performing loans (NPLs). However, these NPLs were identified during the Comprehensive Assessment, using for the first time a common definition, and have since been adequately provisioned for. Therefore, we are in a good position to bring down NPLs in an orderly manner over the next few years. For this purpose, the ECB\u2019s supervisory arm is working closely with the relevant national authorities to ensure that our NPL policies are complemented by the necessary national measures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T14:29:22.575Z\">at 2.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56c1dac7e4b0eba06ed5ff12\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T14:07:32.075Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB will not hesitate to act - Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has said the bank will not hesitate to act in the light of the recent economic and market turmoil.</p> <p>At its last meeting the ECB said it would review its monetary policy stance at its next meeting in March, but<strong><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp160215.en.html\"> in a speech to the European Parliament</a></strong>, Draghi suggested the turbulence in the markets last week has given it extra urgency:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In order to make the euro area more resilient, contributions from all policy areas are needed. The ECB is ready to do its part. As we announced at the end of our last monetary policy meeting in January, the Governing Council will review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance in early March. The focus of our deliberations will be twofold.</p> <p>First, we will examine the strength of the pass-through of low imported inflation to domestic wage and price formation and to inflation expectations. This will depend on the size and the persistence of the fall in oil and commodity prices and the incidence of second-round effects on domestic wages and prices.</p> <p>Second, in the light of the recent financial turmoil, we will analyse the state of transmission of our monetary impulses by the financial system and in particular by banks. If either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he repeated his calls for fiscal policies to help the economy recover:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In parallel, other policies should help to put the euro area economy on firmer grounds. It is becoming clearer and clearer that fiscal policies should support the economic recovery through public investment and lower taxation. In addition, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creations and raise productivity. Compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact remains essential to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T14:23:13.235Z\">at 2.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56c1ce9ae4b0eba06ed5ff04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T13:13:10.919Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It is doubtful that HSBC ever intended to leave the UK and highly likely chancellor George Osborne paid too high a price to ensure it stayed,</strong> says economics editor Larry Elliott.<br></p> <p>His full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2016/feb/15/hsbcs-gunboat-diplomacy-london-george-osborne\">HSBC's gunboat diplomacy worked well.

For the moment therefore, this upward move gets filed as a brief flowering of bullish sentiment, rather than the start of something much more long-term. European markets are also strongly higher, but with the US out of the picture due to a national holiday it is too early to know whether these gains are going to last into the rest of the week.</p> <p>Oil prices, which are still the main determinant of whether stock markets go up or down, are higher on the day; if the commodity can keep rallying into coming sessions we will see fresh buying momentum develop in stock markets.</p> </blockquote> <p> Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity markets making a bullish start to the week<strong>, </strong>adding to the gains of Friday and Thursday\u2019s bounce from lows helped by breaks of the February downtrends.

      "bodyText": "Spring 2015 HSBC announces during the general election campaign that it is thinking about moving its global HQ from London to Kong Kong, citing unhappiness about City regulation in general and George Osborne\u2019s bank levy in particular. Summer 2015 Newly reappointed chancellor in a majority Conservative government, Osborne announces he is going to reform the bank levy in a way that makes it less onerous for HSBC. The chancellor says it is time for a new settlement with the City, and demonstrates what that means by getting rid of Martin Wheatley as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Wheatley\u2019s crime? Being too tough on the banks. February 2016 HSBC announces that, following an exhaustive, bottom-up review, it has decided to remain domiciled in London. The bank\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, insists there was no deal with the government; no arm-twisting from an institution that is one of the biggest companies quoted on the FTSE 100; certainly not a gigantic game of bluff. Three big questions arise from the HSBC decision. The first is whether the bank ever really intended to leave the UK. As Andre Spicer of the Cass Business School notes, the assumption that multinational corporations are footloose and fancy free doesn\u2019t really square with the facts. Between 1996 and 2006, a decade that could be argued was the high point of globalisation, only 6% of multinationals moved their HQ. London is a good place for an international bank to be domiciled. The time zone is right, a dense network of support services is available, and executives feel at home. It would probably have taken more than a gripe about the bank levy and unhappiness about Wheatley\u2019s \u201cshoot first, ask questions later\u201d approach to have prompted HSBC to uproot. The second question is whether, in the light of that, Osborne paid too high a price to keep HSBC here. The answer to that is that he did. The changes have resulted in the tax burden being shifted to the new challenger banks which are meant to be providing much-needed competition to the high street big four, leaving weaker oversight of the financial system. Osborne may live to regret this if the gyrations in the markets really do portend a re-run of 2008. Finally, what does this episode say about the power of the banks? Quite a lot. HSBC was founded in 1865, a year that coincided with the death of Lord Palmerston, famed as foreign secretary for his gunboat diplomacy. Flint sailed his gunboat up the Thames from Canary Wharf and moored it within sight of the Palace of Westminster. There didn\u2019t need to be any negotiation. Osborne got the message.",

The bank\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, insists there was no deal with the government; no arm-twisting from an institution that is one of the biggest companies quoted on the FTSE 100; certainly not a gigantic game of bluff.</p> <p>Three big questions arise from the HSBC decision. The first is whether the bank ever really intended to leave the UK. As Andre Spicer of the Cass Business School notes, the assumption that multinational corporations are footloose and fancy free doesn\u2019t really square with the facts. Between 1996 and 2006, a decade that could be argued was the high point of globalisation, only 6% of multinationals moved their HQ.</p> <p>London is a good place for an international bank to be domiciled. The time zone is right, a dense network of support services is available, and executives feel at home. It would probably have taken more than a gripe about the bank levy and unhappiness about Wheatley\u2019s \u201cshoot first, ask questions later\u201d approach to have prompted HSBC to uproot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/14/hsbc-to-keep-its-headquarters-in-the-uk\">HSBC to keep its headquarters in London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second question is whether, in the light of that, Osborne paid too high a price to keep HSBC here. The answer to that is that he did. The changes have resulted in the tax burden being shifted to the new challenger banks which are meant to be providing much-needed competition to the high street big four, leaving weaker oversight of the financial system. Osborne may live to regret this if the gyrations in the markets really do portend a re-run of 2008.</p> <p>Finally, what does this episode say about the power of the banks? Quite a lot. HSBC was founded in 1865, a year that coincided with the death of Lord Palmerston, famed as foreign secretary for his gunboat diplomacy. Flint sailed his gunboat up the Thames from Canary Wharf and moored it within sight of the Palace of Westminster. There didn\u2019t need to be any negotiation. Osborne got the message.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s exit from the European Union could leave weak member countries exposed to a rise in migrants and reduce the influence of the remaining 27 states on the global stage, according to a leading economist. Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe EU is in a precarious state already, with GDP in most countries still below its 2008 level, refugee inflows adding to pressure on resources and policymakers struggling to respond. \u201cThe loss of an important member would damage confidence within the region and reduce the EU\u2019s influence in global negotiations, giving it less scope to negotiate in favour of its economies. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, Brexit would confirm that the union is not irrevocable and, if the country did well, others might be tempted to follow. So it would deal a damaging blow to sentiment within the region and perceptions from outside and may even present an existential threat,\u201d she said. Much of the focus on the UK\u2019s referendum, which could be called for June if this week\u2019s European Council meeting produces a deal, concerns the implications for the UK economy. However, McKeown said there could be significant damage to the economies that stayed in the EU. \u201cWe have argued that both the potential costs and benefits to the UK of leaving the EU would be small over the medium term. But this is not a zero-sum game and while we doubt that Brexit would have any significant benefits for the rest of the EU, the damage to those economies could be significant,\u201d she said. There were some positives: the financial sector might benefit from some brass plate subsidiaries being established in EU countries. HSBC has said it could move 1,000 jobs to Paris from London in the event of a Brexit. Among the negatives McKeown lists are the impact on immigration. The UK, she said, receives the second largest number of migrants \u2013 Germany receives the most. \u201cIf it left, it would probably limit immigration, particularly from emerging Europe, implying bigger flows into other rich EU countries. This might boost activity in those economies. But, as the UK would be likely to cherry pick the immigrants that it accepts, those that moved to other EU countries could be less productive,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd immigration could be a problem for eurozone economies where unemployment is high and wage pressures are weak.\u201d McKeown said there could also be negative implications for the EU budget because the UK is the second largest contributor after Germany, and also for foreign direct investment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BAE Systems, the maker of the Eurofighter Typhoon and Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines, has named a veteran of the oil industry as heir apparent to its outgoing chief executive, Ian King. Charles Woodburn has worked in the oil and gas industry for more than 20 years and joins BAE as chief operating officer from Expro Group, which surveys and manages oil and gas wells around the world. Woodburn is British, meaning his appointment is likely to be welcomed by the government, which is keen for BAE to name a holder of a UK passport as King\u2019s successor. Before working for Expro, where he is chief executive, Woodburn spent 15 years at oil services company Schlumberger, overseeing major projects in Thailand, Australia and the US. This means he is well placed to run multibillion-pound engineering projects at BAE, potentially including a new generation of submarines to carry the Trident nuclear deterrent. Woodburn\u2019s experience of large projects will be vital, with the government pushing BAE to deliver orders on time and within budget after a string of defence programmes failed to do either. Another key task for Woodburn will be to complete a delayed deal with Saudi Arabia to sell a new batch of Typhoon fighter jets Christophe Menard, analyst at stockbroker Kepler Cheuvreux, said: \u201cSeeking an outsider could bring a fresh vision to BAE, which needs to reinvent and re-position part of its business, after years of difficulty budgetary environments.\u201d BAE is the third-biggest defence manufacturer in the world, with key markets in the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia. The position of chief operating officer is a new role at BAE, with King saying that Woodburn will \u201cstrengthen and broaden\u201d the management team. King is expected to retire within the next 18 months, although no date has been announced. He has been chief executive of BAE since 2008, steering the company through spending cuts by governments in Europe and the US. He also tried to merge the company with EADS, the owner or Airbus, but the deal foundered amid opposition from European governments and shareholders. King said: \u201cAs a highly qualified engineer with considerable international business experience, Charles will strengthen and broaden the strategic and operational capabilities of the business as a welcome and valuable addition to the leadership team.\u201d Woodburn said he was looking forward to \u201ccontributing to the company\u2019s continued growth and development\u201d. He will be paid a base salary of \u00a3750,000 a year and be given more than \u00a31.6m by BAE to buy him out of incentive schemes at Expro. Woodburn graduated from St John\u2019s College at the University of Cambridge in 1992 with a degree in electrical engineering. He then became a doctor of philosophy in engineering after three more years at Cambridge, before joining Schlumberger in 1995. The new BAE executive became boss of Expro in 2010. Expro is owned by a consortium including Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Arle Capital. Woodburn will join BAE during the second quarter of the year. Sir Roger Carr, the BAE chairman, said: \u201cI am delighted that we have secured an individual of considerable talent and proven industrial experience as part of our succession planning programme. \u201cCharles will bring fresh perspective to the company\u2019s operations and board, while building a detailed knowledge of the defence industry under the guidance of Ian King.\u201d Shares in BAE rose 3% to 82.18p on Monday as investors welcomed the appointment. BAE would follow in the footsteps of Rolls-Royce by naming an industry outsider as its new chief executive if it ultimately elevates Woodburn to the top job. Last summer Rolls-Royce named Warren East as its new chief executive after he transformed chip designer Arm Holdings into one of the world\u2019s leading technology companies and a key supplier to Apple. Rolls-Royce has issued five profit warnings in two years as it grapples with the pressure on the defence and aerospace industry. The company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price, which has meant Rolls\u2019 customers in the energy industry are investing less. In response, East is trying to cut up to \u00a3200m of costs a year and has removed 25% of the company\u2019s 200 senior managers Rolls works with BAE on producing the Typhoon, Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines, and the Type 45 destroyers.",

      "bodyText": "Katherine Garrett-Cox, one of the City\u2019s most high-profile women, will leave Alliance Trust after nine years at the investment firm, which settled a long dispute with its activist investor last year. Garrett-Cox will step down as chief executive of its fund management arm, Alliance Trust Investments, on 11 March. She quit the company\u2019s main board in October after losing out in a dispute with Elliott Advisors, Alliance Trust\u2019s largest shareholder. The US hedge fund pushed for change at the top of Alliance Trust, one of Britain\u2019s oldest investment firms. Elliott accused the Dundee-based company of paying executives too much for poor performance under Garrett-Cox\u2019s leadership. After rejecting Elliott as an opportunist agitator, Alliance Trust crumbled under shareholder pressure in April and appointed two of Elliott\u2019s nominees to the board last April. Alliance Trust spent \u00a33m trying to repel Elliott but later agreed to cut costs, split fund management from its wealth management operation and buy back shares to increase shareholder returns. Karin Forseke, who led the fight against Elliott, stepped down as chairwoman at the start of this year. Garrett-Cox, 48, is leaving by mutual agreement after her job became obsolete under the restructuring plan, the company said. She joined Alliance Trust in 2007 and became chief executive in 2008. Alliance Trust said Garrett-Cox, nicknamed Katherine the Great for her prominence in financial circles, was paid \u00a31.4m for 2015, up from \u00a31.3m the year before. She will be paid her salary of \u00a3450,000 for this year. She will also hold on to about 800,000 shares in the company\u2019s long-term incentive plan. Those shares will pay out, depending on financial performance, over the next three years. Lord Smith of Kelvin, Alliance Trust\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cAlliance Trust is now moving swiftly to implement the changes announced last year which are designed to enhance shareholder returns. This process is well under way and it is clear to us all that the role of chief executive of Alliance Trust Investments has changed significantly. I and the rest of the board wish Katherine every success in the future.\u201d The company said Garrett-Cox\u2019s responsibilities would be shared out between other senior employees. Alliance Trust Investment manages about \u00a35.3bn, including \u00a32bn of third-party funds brought in by Garrett-Cox. Garrett-Cox said she had represented and protected the long-term interests of Alliance Trust\u2019s shareholders. \u201cI am very proud of the significant achievements that my team has delivered over the past nine years at Alliance Trust. I leave Alliance Trust Investments with a strong team who are already delivering improved investment returns and driving down costs,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC has warned that it could shift 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris if the UK leaves the EU. As the bank announced it was keeping its headquarters in London after a 10-month review, Douglas Flint, the chairman, told the BBC that while the \u201cbest answer\u201d was to remain in a reformed Europe, the bank had the abilityto \u201cmove people between London and Paris\u201d. Flint chaired a board meeting on Sunday night at which the decision was taken not to relocate to Hong Kong \u2013 where the bank was based until 1992 when it moved to London to take over Midland Bank. He said the decision was \u201cbased on what will hopefully be a generational view\u201d as he also revealed for the first time how HSBC might respond to a vote to leave in the referendum that could be held in June. The jobs that could move are outside the high street operations and largely in investment banking. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC chief executive, later told Sky News: \u201cWe have 5,000 people in global banking and markets [HSBC\u2019s investment bank] in London and I could imagine that around 20% of those would move to Paris.\u201d Flint denied suggestions HSBC had lobbied the government to soften the regulatory regime so that it would remain headquartered in London. The bank, which employs 260,000 around the world, 45,000 of them in the UK, is one of the five biggest companies listed on the London stock exchange and the biggest bank in the country. As well as changes to the tax regime, rules intended to hold individual bankers to account have been eased since HSBC announced the review of its headquarters last April. In his summer budget, George Osborne scaled back the bank levy which, calculated on the size of balance sheets, hit HSBC hardest. Analysts have calculated HSBC will pay \u00a3300m to the exchequer \u2013 down from \u00a31bn under the previous system. \u201cWe had no negotiations with the government,\u201d Flint said. \u201cThe government was very well aware of our view, indeed of the view of many other people who commented upon it, but there certainly was no pressure put, or negotiation.\u201d Even so, analysts said these changes played a part in the decision by the bank\u2019s board to remain in the UK. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at investment advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe bank has responded to a big carrot dangled by the chancellor in the form of changes to the bank levy, which will in time make the tax less onerous for HSBC.\u201d Among the locations considered by HSBC were the US, Canada and EU countries. But it came down to a choice between the UK or returning to Hong Kong. Andre Spicer, of Cass Business School, said: \u201cThe focus on regulation and the current state of the Chinese market has blinded us to other reasons why HSBC chose to stay put \u2013 it is likely the collective interests of the UK corporate elite played a role.\u201d One City analyst did not welcome the decision to stay put. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at the stockbroker Investec, said it was a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d and left HSBC burdened by the UK regulatory regime. HSBC is one of the first banks to set out how it will respond to the regulatory changes set out by Sir John Vickers\u2019 Independent Commission on Banking to protect taxpayers from another taxpayer bailout by ringfencing its high street arm from the investment bank. Vickers, who had warned on Sunday that the Bank of England had watered down the rules on the capital cushion banks must hold to protect against collapse, said HSBC\u2019s decision to stay supported his view for high capital levels. \u201cStrong capital buffers for ringfenced banks and HSBC\u2019s decision to stay UK-based go hand in hand. You get the benefits of global banks in London without heightened risk to high street banking,\u201d said Vickers. A Bank of England spokesperson defended the mix of capital it was demanding banks hold as a cushion. \u201cOn a comparable basis, globally systemic banks in the UK will be required to have ten times more capital than before the crisis,\u201d the spokesperson said. HSBC\u2019s decision was welcomed by the Treasury: \u201cIt\u2019s a vote of confidence in the government\u2019s economic plan and a boost to our goal of making the UK a great place to do more business with China and the rest of Asia.\u201d The employers body, the CBI, said it was a welcome move but that it also \u201cemphasises the need for the UK to continuously stay competitive on regulation, tax and talent\u201d. A number of bankers have started to speak out on the upcoming EU referendum. Last week, Ross McEwan, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, said that the uncertainty caused by the referendum could \u201cslow down banking\u201d.",

The jobs that could move are outside the high street operations and largely in investment banking.</p> <p>Stuart Gulliver, HSBC chief executive, later told Sky News: \u201cWe have 5,000 people in global banking and markets [HSBC\u2019s investment bank] in London and I could imagine that around 20% of those would move to Paris.\u201d</p> <p>Flint denied suggestions HSBC had lobbied the government to soften the regulatory regime so that it would remain headquartered in London. The bank, which employs 260,000 around the world, 45,000 of them in the UK, is one of the five biggest companies listed on the London stock exchange and the biggest bank in the country.</p> <p>As well as changes to the tax regime, rules intended to hold individual bankers to account have been eased since HSBC announced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/24/hsbc-warns-it-could-leave-uk-over-eu-referendum-uncertainty\">review of its headquarters </a>last April. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/biggest-banks-welcome-budget-reduction-in-bank-levy\">In his summer budget, George Osborne </a>scaled back the bank levy which, calculated on the size of balance sheets, hit HSBC hardest. Analysts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/budget-means-hsbc-and-standard-chartered-banks-will-pay-1bn-less-in-tax\">have calculated</a> HSBC will pay \u00a3300m to the exchequer \u2013 down from \u00a31bn under the previous system. </p> <p>\u201cWe had no negotiations with the government,\u201d Flint said. \u201cThe government was very well aware of our view, indeed of the view of many other people who commented upon it, but there certainly was no pressure put, or negotiation.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, analysts said these changes played a part in the decision by the bank\u2019s board to remain in the UK. </p> <p>Laith Khalaf, an analyst at investment advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe bank has responded to a big carrot dangled by the chancellor in the form of changes to the bank levy, which will in time make the tax less onerous for HSBC.\u201d</p> <p>Among the locations considered by HSBC were the US, Canada and EU countries. But it came down to a choice between the UK or returning to Hong Kong.</p> <p>Andre Spicer, of Cass Business School, said: \u201cThe focus on regulation and the current state of the Chinese market has blinded us to other reasons why HSBC chose to stay put \u2013 it is likely the collective interests of the UK corporate elite played a role.\u201d</p> <p>One City analyst did not welcome the decision to stay put. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at the stockbroker Investec, said it was a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d and left HSBC burdened by the UK regulatory regime. </p> <p>HSBC is one of the first banks to set out how it will respond to the regulatory changes set out by Sir John Vickers\u2019 Independent Commission on Banking to protect taxpayers from another taxpayer bailout by ringfencing its high street arm from the investment bank.</p> <p>Vickers, who had warned on Sunday that the Bank of England had watered down the rules on the capital cushion banks must hold to protect against collapse, said HSBC\u2019s decision to stay supported his view for high capital levels. <br></p> <p> \u201cStrong capital buffers for ringfenced banks and HSBC\u2019s decision to stay UK-based go hand in hand.

      "bodyText": "Hornby\u2019s chief executive, Richard Ames, has quit less than a week after the model railway maker issued a third profit warning in five months and said it risked breaching a lending agreement with its bank. Ames will leave with immediate effect after less than two years in the job. Roger Canham, the chairman, will run the company for the foreseeable future, Hornby said. Last week Hornby said it expected to lose as much as \u00a36m this year, far more than expected after three profit warnings since September. It also said it was in danger of breaching a banking covenant with Barclays, potentially prompting the bank to call in the debt and threaten Hornby with collapse. The company, which also makes Airfix kits, Corgi cars and Scalextric, was hit by a series of setbacks as Ames tried to overhaul its operations. UK sales fell last summer because of disruption caused by new computer systems while business in Europe was also affected by the revamp and the non-arrival of products from China. Sales in Britain recovered in December but then plunged after Christmas as retailers decided not to order new stocks. Hornby was forced to write off \u00a31m of items at its new warehouse and European sales remained below expectations. Shares fell more than 60% after last week\u2019s announcement, the company\u2019s worst day of trading since it listed on the stock exchange in 1986. Shares rose 10% to 27p after Ames\u2019s departure was announced on Monday but are still worth less than a quarter of their value in late August. Ames said last week Hornby had a supportive relationship with Barclays, to which it owes \u00a39m, and that it was in talks with the bank. Hornby\u2019s woes prompted the former Top Gear presenter James May to encourage his followers to buy a Hornby train set to save the company. Ames, 45, joined in April 2014 from Ladbrokes and was given the job of turning around Hornby, which had been bedevilled for years by problems with its Chinese supplier. Hornby extricated itself from the contract shortly before he joined but then hit trouble with the new manufacturer as products failed to make it on to shelves in Italy and other European markets. As part of his attempted overhaul, Ames moved the company\u2019s warehouse and head office from its historic location near Margate, Kent, to a site near Canterbury and decided to relocate the popular visitor centre to nearby Ramsgate. Canham will be executive chairman for the second time after running Hornby for a spell before Ames joined. Hornby posted a \u00a34.5m loss for the first half of its financial year in December and forecast an annual loss of about \u00a32m. The company said in January its new products, including wooden toy Hornby trains and Corgi models based on the original Thunderbirds TV series, had gone down well at trade shows.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC is to keep its headquarters in the UK after a 10-month review during which time the government has made a series of changes regarded as favourable to the bank. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cHaving our headquarters in the UK and our significant business in Asia Pacific delivers the best of both worlds to our stakeholders.\u201d The much-anticipated decision was announced after a board meeting in London, where the bank has been based since moving its headquarters in 1992 at the time of the takeover of Midland Bank. It comes just as China\u2019s stock market was due to begin trading for the first time after a week\u2019s holiday during which markets elsewhere in the world have been buffeted by fears about the banking sector. Britain\u2019s biggest bank said it would abandon its usual practice of reviewing its headquarters every three years after what it described as an exhaustive process. It did not list all the alternative locations that had been considered but said: \u201cIn the later stages of the review, the analysis was narrowed down to the group\u2019s home markets, the UK and Hong Kong, both of which are considered by the board to be world-class financial centres with high quality regulatory regimes capable of hosting a global systemically important bank such as HSBC.\u201d Shares in HSBC, one of the UK\u2019s biggest banks and one of the biggest companies on the FTSE 100, have been trading at levels last seen in 2009, around the time the UK was mired in recession. Last week, Gulliver admitted there was a \u201cvery challenging operating environment\u201d for the bank, even as he was forced to embark on an embarrassing U-turn to reverse a staff pay freeze announced only two weeks earlier. The detailed review was announced in April when the bank also warned about the economic risk of the UK leaving the EU. The review, and the warning about Europe, provoked a political debate during campaigning for the general election which led to a majority Conservative government being created in May. Since then the chancellor, George Osborne, has backed away from creating rules intended to toughen up the regime for holding senior bankers to account. He had said he would reverse the burden of proof but has reverted to the more usual system of bankers guilt having to be proven. He also changed the system for taxing banks. A bank levy on balance sheets, which hit HSBC hardest of all the banks, is being scaled back and an eight percentage point corporation tax surcharge on profits is regarded as hitting its smaller rivals harder. Analysts have calculated that the changes mean HSBC will pay \u00a3300m to the exchequer \u2013 down from \u00a31bn under the previous bank levy system. The headquarters review also took place when the bank was facing scrutiny about tax practices inside its Swiss arm following an investigation by the Guardian and other publications. HSBC said: \u201cThe UK is an important and globally connected economy. It has an internationally respected regulatory framework and legal system, and immense experience in handling complex international affairs. London is one of the world\u2019s leading international financial centres and home to a large pool of highly skilled international talent. It remains therefore ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC.\u201d The bank also said the UK was aiming to help the renminbi, China\u2019s currency, gain more international recognition. HSBC, with its presence in China, is keen to develop in this market. The Treasury said: \u201c[HSBC\u2019s decision to keep the HQ in the UK is] a vote of confidence in the government\u2019s economic plan, and a boost to our goal of making the UK a great place to do more business with China and the rest of Asia.\u201d",

It did not list all the alternative locations that had been considered but said: \u201cIn the later stages of the review, the analysis was narrowed down to the group\u2019s home markets, the UK and Hong Kong, both of which are considered by the board to be world-class financial centres with high quality regulatory regimes capable of hosting a global systemically important bank such as HSBC.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in HSBC, one of the UK\u2019s biggest banks and one of the biggest companies on the FTSE 100, have been trading at levels last seen in 2009, around the time the UK was mired in recession. Last week, Gulliver <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/11/hsbc-axes-2016-pay-freeze-after-staff-protests\">admitted there was a \u201cvery challenging operating environment\u201d for the bank</a>, even as he was forced to embark on an embarrassing U-turn to reverse a staff pay freeze announced only two weeks earlier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/15/hsbc-uk-banks-bankers-prosecution\">Why on earth would HSBC leave a country that gives banks an easy ride? | Prem Sikka</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The detailed review <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/24/hsbc-warns-it-could-leave-uk-over-eu-referendum-uncertainty\">was announced in April</a> when the bank also warned about the economic risk of the UK leaving the EU. The review, and the warning about Europe, provoked a political debate during campaigning for the general election which led to a majority Conservative government being created in May. </p> <p>Since then the chancellor, George Osborne, has backed away from creating rules intended to toughen up the regime for holding senior bankers to account. He had said he would reverse the burden of proof but has reverted to the more usual system of bankers guilt having to be proven.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/biggest-banks-welcome-budget-reduction-in-bank-levy\">He also changed the system for taxing banks</a>. A bank levy on balance sheets, which hit HSBC hardest of all the banks, is being scaled back and an eight percentage point corporation tax surcharge on profits is regarded as hitting its smaller rivals harder. Analysts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/budget-means-hsbc-and-standard-chartered-banks-will-pay-1bn-less-in-tax\">have calculated</a> that the changes mean HSBC will pay \u00a3300m to the exchequer \u2013 down from \u00a31bn under the previous bank levy system.</p> <p>The headquarters review also took place when the bank was facing scrutiny about tax practices inside its Swiss arm following an investigation by the Guardian and other publications.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/11/hsbc-axes-2016-pay-freeze-after-staff-protests\">HSBC axes 2016 pay freeze after staff protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>HSBC said: \u201cThe UK is an important and globally connected economy. It has an internationally respected regulatory framework and legal system, and immense experience in handling complex international affairs. London is one of the world\u2019s leading international financial centres and home to a large pool of highly skilled international talent. It remains therefore ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC.\u201d</p> <p>The bank also said the UK was aiming to help the renminbi, China\u2019s currency, gain more international recognition. HSBC, with its presence in China, is keen to develop in this market.</p> <p>The Treasury said: \u201c[HSBC\u2019s decision to keep the HQ in the UK is] a vote of confidence in the government\u2019s economic plan, and a boost to our goal of making the UK a great place to do more business with China and the rest of Asia.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

In a statement released on Sunday evening, Virgin Atlantic said the flight was turned around \u201cas a precautionary measure due to a laser beam incident\u201d.
