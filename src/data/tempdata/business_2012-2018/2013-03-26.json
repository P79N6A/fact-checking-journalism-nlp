      "bodyText": "That's quite a comeback by Dame Clara Furse. She was a non-executive director of Fortis when the Belgian bank, in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland, did the disastrous top-of-the-market purchase of ABN Amro in 2008; now she has been hired to serve as an external member of the financial policy committee of the Bank of England, the body tasked with ensuring financial stability in the UK. Of course, Furse is best known for her eight years as chief executive of London Stock Exchange. All the same, you might have assumed that Fortis's need for a bailout in 2008 would disqualify any of its directors of the 2006-09 vintage from a job on the FPC. The world has moved on, it seems. It is easier to understand the appointment to the FPC of Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays in the 1990s and a member of the Vickers commission: he's a top-drawer signing, an independent thinker who speaks his mind, clearly. Richard Sharp, the other new hire, arrives after a 23-year stint at Goldman Sachs. Some may say the Goldman perspective is already well represented at the Bank in the form of the incoming governor, Mark Carney, who did 10 years at the investment bank. But let's see how Sharp speaks. He will do well to match Robert Jenkins, a member of the interim FPC, in the free-thinking stakes. Jenkins made several blistering speeches that demolished big banks' objections to holding more capital. Better, he was able to make the dry subject of \"macro-prudential\" regulation intelligible to ordinary mortals. In fact, it is a mystery why the government failed to select Jenkins for service on the FPC in its full form. The Treasury announcement did not explain. Then again, in its summary of Furse's CV, it neglected to mention her stint at Fortis.",

Now even the wife of the incoming governor of the Bank of England, who has a near-\u00a35,000 a week housing allowance, has been fretting about finding a home in the capital's overvalued market. Diana Carney, married to Mark Carney, who will take up the reins at the Bank of England in July, sparked a flurry of criticism about her search for a home in the capital. Passing on a news story about France scaling back wealth taxes, which are believed to have triggered an exodus of well-heeled Parisians to London, Diana Carney indicated that it might take the heat off the housing market. The British-born Oxford University graduate quipped: \"Maybe I'll be able to find a place to live in London after all.\" Mark Carney, currently governor of the Bank of Canada, will get an annual housing allowance of \u00a3250,000 a year, taking his total pay close to \u00a31m, part of a generous package blessed by the chancellor, George Osborne, to lure the Canadian banker to London. Carney defended his bumper pay deal last month, saying his package was equivalent to the pay and pension of the outgoing governor, Mervyn King. \"The housing allowance relates to the fact that I am moving from one of the cheapest capitals to one of the most expensive capitals,\" he told MPs on the Treasury select committee. The former Goldman Sachs banker will be leaving the affluent neighbourhood of Rockcliffe Park, Ottawa, where he has lived since 2003. In this upscale village, a stately mock Georgian townhouse with five bedrooms, landscaped garden, sauna and fitness rooms is going for $3m (\u00a31.8m). In London's overheated property market, this would get you a five-bedroom house in Acton, with easy access to the central line \u2013 handy for anyone going to Bank. The Carney family's weekly budget, about \u00a34,800, would stretch to a two-bedroom flat in Mayfair with views over Green Park, but this is hardly suitable for their household of six. More appropriate might be a four-bedroom house in leafy St John's Wood going for \u00a319,500 a month. Labour politicians in London condemned the remarks, which come just as the government is about to cut housing benefit for people deemed to have a spare room, the so-called bedroom tax. \"Even if she is being ironic, the fact is she and her husband are being paid a \u00a35,000 a week subsidy when the very poorest are having \u00a317 a week of public support taken away,\" said Paul Dimoldenberg, leader of the Labour group on Westminster council, in the Evening Standard. \"Presumably this public subsidy reflects the fact that housing costs in central London are very high. But if it is acceptable to subsidise the governor of the Bank of England how come the very poorest people who already live in central London are being demonised and run out of town?\" Diana Carney is an outspoken development economist, who is vice-president of research at left-leaning thinktank Canada 2020. Under her maiden name, Diana Fox, she runs an eco-products website, where she describes herself as \"a multi-tasking mother of four\". Having described herself as \"British by birth and Canadian by choice\", Diana Carney has made it clear she does not intend the move to the UK to be permanent. \"Canada is certainly a hard country to leave. But we will be back in 5,\" she tweeted in November. Both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada declined to comment.",

The major banks swallowed half the former building societies in the late 1990s; Royal Bank of Scotland consumed NatWest at the turn of the century; and Halifax and Bank of Scotland combined in 2001 and then gave Lloyds TSB indigestion in 2008. It is welcome news, therefore, that the Financial Services Authority thinks life should be made easier for anyone brave enough to launch a new bank. The soon-to-be-disbanded regulator says its successor will crack the whip internally to reduce to six months the time it takes to gain authorisation. More strikingly, new banks will be allowed to operate with lower capital thresholds than their bigger rivals. The second reform is a U-turn, an acknowledgement that there is little point being in favour of greater competition if you then ask new entrants to clear higher obstacles. The change of tack by the FSA is sensible: the regulator has to show some willing if it wants to encourage more startups follow the lead of Metro Bank. As its report says, \"a balance \u2026 has to be struck between the risk that new entrant banks will fail, and the benefits of easy entry\". So how would failure be handled? In the age of living wills and so on, the rules are clear: critical functions have to be protected so that disruption is contained. Then comes the important clause \"even if in some cases losses may be incurred by unprotected depositors\". Post-Cyprus, those words have to be taken seriously. Protected depositors are those in a single account holding up to \u00a385,000. That cap on insurance will, one must guess, make it very hard for new entrants to make a splash in the business banking market, where the need for greater competition is keenest. Of course, the insurance cap also applies to the big boys. But a business audience may hear the message that big banks have to hold more capital and conclude that they are \"safer.\" Tough for the new boys and there's no obvious way around the conundrum. The real mistake was allowing all those big mergers and acquisitions in the first place. Lloyds and RBS, under orders from the EU, are now being forced to shed a few branches. But a truly radical attempt to boost competition might mean enforced liberation of Halifax and NatWest. There is, however, no political will for that.

      "bodyText": "And finally..... our Europe editor Ian Traynor has the full story on how top European politicians and policymakers are at odds on how failing banks should be handled. As I've mentioned through the day, the question of whether large, uninsured deposits should be readily tapped is splitting opinion across the eurozone. Ian writes: Policymakers in the single currency area were at loggerheads on Tuesday over the long-term implications of the Cyprus bailout and whether savers across Europe will be exposed to raids on their bank accounts in future rescues. The European commission and influential MEPs involved in drafting new laws on resolving bank failures confirmed that the proposed rules would include \"bail-ins\", which are favoured by Germany and would see investors and savers taking the hit instead of taxpayers. But eurozone central bankers contradicted the signals from Brussels, insisting that the formula agreed for Cyprus on Sunday would not be applied uniformly in banking crises in other countries. Slovenia may be the first to find out as anxiety mounts that the country faces a worsening bank crisis that may necessitate eurozone intervention within months. The full story is here: Cyprus bailout: eurozone policymakers at loggerheads over implications And with that, I'm off. Goodnight all, and thanks for reading (and commenting!). GW And finally, British company G4S (who failed to win many gold medals at the last Olympics) is helping with the operation to get Cyprus's banking system back on its feet. The company - whose vans have been photographic restocking cash machines across the island since the banks were locked - says it is making a great effort: From the Daily Telegraph tonight: John Arghyrou, managing director of the Cyprus business for G4S, said its 750 employees have been working through the night, going out to replenish cash machines with police. Licensing rules prevented the firm from bringing in extra staff to handle the unprecedented workload. \"Demand is greater than we can provide... We haven't closed since the crisis started,\" he told Reuters. \"I've never seen anything like it in terms of what is going on from a security perspective. I would say the workload has quadrupled because the whole system has changed.\" We may know by tomorrow night if they've all succeeded. Experts working in the financial sector in Cyprus say they are being increasingly approached by officials and people in the corporate services sector in Malta, Luxembourg and Lichtenstein. Helena Smith reports that the contacts are an attempt to persuade wealthy depositors to move their assets out of Cyprus. Christos Neophytou, a lawyer who specializes in registering foreign companies on the island told Helena: I\u2019ve received three emails today and that\u2019s just from Malta. They\u2019re even offering financial incentives to try and convince clients to move out of Cyprus. Breaking: Bank of Cyprus has refused to accept its chairman's resignation, and that of four directors who also tried to quit. The bank is giving them a week to change their mind - but if they don't, they walk. From the Reuters terminal: Cyprus' largest commercial lender Bank of Cyprus did not accept the resignations of its chairman and four other directors who tried to leave the board on Tuesday after a special administrator was appointed to run the bank. In a statement, Bank of Cyprus said the resignations of chairman Andreas Artemis and the others had not been accepted and \"will only apply if not withdrawn within one week\". This gives the directors breathing space to reconsider their decisions, but they can not be compelled to stay on. A special administrator was appointed to run the bank on Monday night, after it was saved from collapse by a bailout deal that will see it take on the small deposits of competitor Cyprus Popular Bank. Cyprus has been put on rating watch negative by Fitch, whose crack team of top analysts reckon that the ongoing meltdown of its financial system is a big threat to its economy. Here's the key paragraph -- essential reading to any Cypriot bondholders who haven't been paying attention this month. The rating watch negative reflects Fitch's opinion that the shock resulting from the systemic failure of Cyprus's banking system will have profound negative implications for the domestic economy, which heightens the risk to public finances. This is notwithstanding the fact the Cyprus has agreed an outline programme with its official creditors. This programme improves the sovereign's near-term position from both a liquidity perspective (official funding amounts to EUR10bn, or 55% of GDP) and a solvency perspective. The decision to bail-in depositors rather than government bondholders represents a significant upfront saving for the sovereign. It also underscores the de facto seniority of claims on the sovereign relative to other claims on the country and consequently acts as a support factor for sovereign creditworthiness. Cue some electronic ribbing: Back in Cyprus.... finance minister Michalis Sarris and central bank governor Panicos Demetriades have given a joint press conference on the crisis. Demetriades told reporters that capital controls will be imposed on every bank in Cyprus, but claimed they would be 'loose' and 'temporary', saying: We aim for some restrictions which, in the words of the president, will be loose Demetriades claimed that merging Laiki's smaller savers into Bank of Cyprus would create one \"very strong bank\" (!), adding that authorities were doing \"all they could\" to get banks open on Thursday. That's doesn't give one full confidence that they'll get there. Sarris meanwhile, was adamant that the bailout deal has saved Cyprus from disaster (hours after anger students marched in protest). It was an attempt to dampen talk that Cyprus's best option would be to exit the eurozone and devalue its way back to growth. The exit of Cyprus from the euro zone, which could mean the exit from the EU, would be disastrous, politically and economically. We do not even want to contemplate it. George Osborne also revealed the Treasury has sent millions of euros of additional cash to Britain's armed forces in Cyprus as the crisis has escalated. We have flown out over this last weekend additional cash in euros, to help pay the people who work on the base and to have a contingency fund there. So 13 million euros sent out to Cyprus this weekend to help with our military presence there...and to provide a hardship fund if we need it. A week ago, Britain revealed it had flown \u20ac1m to Cyprus to cover wages and expenses. Quite a jump to \u20ac13m.... Osborne added that Britain has been working with UK pensioners who have moved to Cyprus to help them switch to UK bank accounts. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the UK Treasury Committee, was scathing about the Cyprus crisis, and suggested George Osborne should be giving Nicosia both barrels (the chancellor has been pretty polite about the crisis) Tyrie said: By general agreement this is a god-awful mess, really atrocious. About as appalling mismanagement as it's possible to imagine. Can you at least give us the reassurance that you are conveying in less diplomatic language privately what you, I hope, think about this terrible farrago\". Osborne replied that Britain has \"made clear\" where mistakes have been by various authorities, but of course it is trying to \"help people in a difficult position\". He then confirmed that that senior civil servant Tom Scholar has been dispatched to Cyprus to help with the bank restructuring (as my colleague Jill Treanor first reported on Friday night) Important news from parliament: Chancellor George Osborne has told MPs that the Trerasury is working with the Cypriot authorities to protect customers at UK branches of Laiki (or Popular) bank. Appearing at the Treasury Committee Osborne, explained that a deal was being hammered out right now. There are two banks involved in the restructuring. The Bank of Cyprus has a subsidiary here. It is covered by the UK deposit protection scheme. It is FSA-regulated, and so like all entities that are regulated by the FSA and given a bill of health by the FSA, we can be relatively confident in our own regulatory system. The Popular Bank of Cyprus has a branch here, and of course depositors in branches in this country are covered by the deposit protection scheme of the parent country, in this case Cyprus. Part of the Cypriot deal is to make clear that insured depositors are protected But I can say the Treasury is working with the Cypriot authorities on a British solution to the branch of the Cyprus Popular Bank. Those discussions are taking place at the moment, I can't say a great deal more about them, but we are engaged in negotiations to try to avoid the branch of Cyprus Popular Bank in the UK, or branches, becoming sucked into the Cypriot resolution process. Laiki runs three branches in London, including one in Mayfair, and one in Birmingham. There has been confusion over the situation. Customers have been told it's \"business as usual\", despite the bank being slated to be wound up as part of the bailout deal. See here: UK Laiki Bank customers told 'it is business as usual' \u2022 Osborne said the UK did not have prior notice of the original decision, taken by the Cypriots, to include insured depositors. We made strong representations to the various bodies involved that we didn't think it was a sensible step, and we are pleased to see it is not a part of the final agreement. \u2022 On the damage to the reputation of deposit protection insurance, Osborne played a straight bat: If they'd proceeded with the proposal, very considerable damage would have been done to the principle [of deposit insurance]. Central bank governor Panicos Demetriades to make a statement in Nicosia at 5pm today, or 3pm local time. CNBC field producer Katie Slaman is also reporting from outside the Cyprus central bank. She's taken pictures of the protests (afraid I can't embed them, so just click on the yfrog links) Bank of Cyprus staff have holding their own protests today in a show of anger over the Cypriot bailout deal. The demonstration began at its headquarters (where chairman Andreas Artemi was rumoured to have resigned) before turning to the country's central bank offices. There was clear anger about the way the crisis has been handled, with staff carrying signs attacking central bank governor Panicos Demetriades. Staff were protesting against the appointment of a special administrator to run Bank of Cyprus, according to Channel 4's Faisal Islam (who's been doing an outstanding job covering today's demonstrations). The BBC's Paul Mason is also there, and reports that BoC staff held a sit-down protest outside the central bank HQ. Another photo of Cypriot students shouting slogans during a protest against the bailout package outside the presidential palace in capital Nicosia this morning. Cypriot businesses are warning it is becoming harder to keep operating without a fully functional banking sector. Via AP: \"This is destructive for us,\" said an official with Cyprus-based shipping company EDT Offshore, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his company did not authorize him to speak to the media. \"We have to pay our crews' salaries and that's $500,000, while we have to pay as much for our office staff by March 28 and we don't have access to our bank accounts,\" the official said. \"These are people who need to pay their bills, have obligations to meet.\" The official explained that authorities in the Greek port of Piraeus have prevented one of three EDT ships to leave until the company pays it port dues. That means the ship can't fulfill its contract with clients, meaning possible losses for the company which has a fleet of 18 vessels. And Nicosia pharmacist Lucy Santourian reported that suppliers are insisting on being paid in cash. We normally pay 90 percent of our suppliers on credit, once a month at the end of the month. Now most are asking for cash only. Remarkable comments from Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, this morning -- he's compared criticism of the tough German approach to the negotiations to classroom envy. Here's the quotes (via Kathimerini) \"It always works out like that,\u201d he told ZDF television. \u201cThis also happens in classrooms. Sometimes when you have better results, others have difficulties with this, sometimes they are even a little jealous.\" Ironic timing, as children in Nicosia left the classroom to protest against the bailout terms. His Cyprus counterpart, Michalis Sarris, looked like a man still reeling from a nasty encounter with an exam paper* this morning. He told Bloomberg that there's been little Esprit de corps during Sunday's negotiations. Europe Union should be about showing support to fellow members, but... We did get some support from some participants, but there was a definite hard line by others. * - happens to us all The German state of Brandenburg has admitted that around \u20ac2m of its civil servants' pension fund is in Cypriot bonds. From Berlin, Kate Connolly reports: Much of the rest of the fund is in other crisis countries such as Ireland, Spain, Portugal as well as the Cayman Islands. Its finance minister Helmuth Markov from the far-left Linke party says he's confident their value will bounce back. (well, he has to say that, doesn't he?) Will perhaps trigger a bit of much-needed Schadenfreude in Cyprus? More details here (in German). Jeroen Dijsselbloem has written to the Dutch parliament. The eurogroup president (and Dutch finance minister) told MPs that there are no signs of a surge in savings withdrawals from euro-area banks, or out of the periphery. Dijsselbloem said: Currently there are no apparent signs of a higher-than-normal withdrawal of savings or of transfer of savings from peripheral to core countries. Fingers crossed that yesterday's interview doesn't change this happy picture... The plot thickens...The European Commission has told reporters in Brussels that large uninsured depositors could to be \"bailed-in\" to help rescue a bank, under a new draft EU law on bank resolutions. The comments came as the EC fielded questions on Jeroen Dijsselbloem's comments yesterday that Cyprus showing the way ahead for handling financial crisis. Spokeswoman Chantal Hughes said: In the Commission's proposal, which is under discussion, it is not excluded that deposits over 100,000 euros could be instruments eligible for bail-in. It is a possibility. Hughes insisted though that smaller savers were protected and (wait for it, folks) always would be: At no point is it possible to bail in depositors under 100,000 euros, either now nor in the future Are we supposed to forget about the first bailout plan for Cyprus, and its plan for a 6.75% haircut on all deposits under \u20ac100k? Rumours have been swirling this morning that Andreas Artemis, chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, has resigned in protest at the bailout deal. Reuters reckons it's true: \u201cHe sent a resignation letter this morning which will be examined by the Board of Directors convening this afternoon,\u201d the bank source said, requesting anonymity. Two senior members of the European Central Bank have slapped down suggestions that Cyprus could serve as a model for future bank rescues. ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, had blundered yesterday by suggesting future rescue packages would follow the Cypriot process of shifting the burden of the rescue deal onto investors, not taxpayers. (see our story here). Benoit Coeure told Europe 1 radio: Dijsselbloem was wrong to say what he said. The experience of Cyprus isn\u2019t a model for the rest of the euro zone because the situation there reached a level that doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere. All countries have different problems -- economic problems, problems of unemployment -- but no country has the same concentration of problems as Cyprus. And speaking to reporters in Prague, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny said: Cyprus is a special case. It is no model for other instances. That echoes the short statement issued by the Eurogroup last night, after Dijsselbloem's original interview with the FT and Reuters sparked alarm in the markets. Dijsselbloem himself is expected to testify to the Dutch parliament later today (possibly 4pm GMT). From Cyprus, Helena Smith reports that Angela Merkel is the target for many of the protesting students in Nicosia: It is not uncommon for high school attendees to be dragged on protest marches by unionist teachers - in past such protests have focused on the \"terrible Turk.\" Now that such opprobrium is reserved for the Troika, with a growing numbers are telling me that German chancellor Angela Merkel is worse than the Turks! In the hierarchy of hate figures Merkel has exceeded even Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan whose government has openly - in a volte face - criticised the Troika's rescue plans for Cyprus. A crowd of hundreds of students gathered outside the presidential parliament in Nicosia. Latest photos from the scene show that it was a calm, orderly protest: Another photo of the student protests taking place in Nicosia. via Sky News's Tom Parmenter A large group of students have marched on the Cypriot parliament, carrying a banner reading \"Troika go home\". It's the biggest protest I've seen by young people in Cyprus so far. Faisal Islam has the details: Many of the Cypriots we've interviewed since the crisis began have spoken of their fears for their children. How will they find a first job during the economic downturn, when many firms will be forced to cut costs to survive? How will parents support a child through a college course if they've lost their own job (Laiki alone employs thousands of people)? Europe has heard warnings of a lost generation for years -- Cypriot children now face being part of it. Schoolchildren in Nicosia have spilled onto the streets this morning in a protest against the Cyprus bailout deal, according to Channel 4's Faisal Islam who tweets a picture: Cyprus's stock market is also closed until Thursday, in line with the decision to leave the country's banks shut for another two days. In Greece, trading in Bank of Cyprus shares is also suspended. But the Greek market is now open, and shares have slid by 3%. Fitch has caught up with last weekend's bailout deal and downgraded Cyprus's two biggest banks -- Laiki (which is being wound down) is now Default, while Bank of Cyprus is now Restricted Default. Hellenic Bank, Cyprus's third largest bank, remains on Negative Watch. From Nicosia, Sky News's Ed Conway reports that there is still calm at the cash machines this morning.. He also questions whether it will be possible to get Bank of Cyprus into a position to open its doors again in under two days Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial crisis in Cyprus. Finance minister Michalis Sarris has warned that the country faces an \"unprecedented experience\", as he outlines new restrictions on the country's banking sector. Speaking on Radio 4 in the last few minutes, Sarris confirmed that capital controls will being imposed on Cyprus \"for several weeks\", restricting the flow of money around the system: Sarris said: Generally they [capital controls] are not a good idea but we are facing an emergency. This is an unprecedented experience. Sarris also suggested that depositors with over \u20ac100,000 who are being bailed-in through the Cypriot aid package could lose around 40% of their assets. This is the clearest signal yet of the impact of the country's rescue package &lt;- under which Laiki Bank is being wound down and Bank of Cyprus will be restructured. Cypriots had already woken up to a grimly familiar scene of shuttered branches this morning, have learned last night that the country's banks will be shut down for at least another two days. The news (see Monday's night's liveblog), came as an unwelcome surprise to a country that has already been traumatised by the events of the last 10 days. Cyprus's central bank said the decision would ensure the \"smooth functioning of the whole banking system\", suggesting that the country isn't yet braced for the risk of a bank run when the system reopens. Asked this morning whether Cyprus's banks will open on Thursday, Sarris replied Yes, I think they will. Many personal and business account holders across Cyprus are already restricted to just withdrawing \u20ac100 a day, meaning the economy remains in post-bailout limbo. We'll be tracking all the latest developments through the day.",

Whilst the vertically integrated supply chain has undoubtedly helped the group through the horse-meat scandal, Morrisons has also certainly increased the 'noise' levels since the start of the new financial year. The payday bonus (launched in early February and offering \u00a310 off at the end of the month, with a shopper having to spend at least \u00a335 in each of the three consecutive weeks) and the new TV advertisements (focusing on the group's fresh food credentials) appear to be gradually moving the brand back onto the front foot. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Citigroup raised its recommendation on the supermarket group from neutral to buy. Citi said:</p> <blockquote> Morrisons has the strongest economic model of the three listed UK operators with higher combination of asset turn and margin. Over the long-term we think Morrisons is well positioned to extend [this model] to southern England where it remains under-represented. </blockquote> <p>Morrisons ended 9.3p higher at 276p. Elsewhere <strong>Kingfisher</strong> fell 0.3p to 283p after profits dropped 11.4% to \u00a3715m, hit by a dearth of DIY buying by cash-strapped consumers.</p> <p><strong>Wolseley</strong> also faced similar problems. The building materials group lost 38p to \u00a331.73 after it reported a 20% fall in half year profits to \u00a3199m, with strong growth in the US outweighed by problems in Europe and the UK. These conditions have persisted into the third quarter, and analysts reckoned the difficulties probably dampened hopes of a special dividend payout.</p> <p>It has already cut 990 jobs across Europe since August and has announced a restructuring of its French business Reseau Pro which involves the closure of 24 loss making branches and the disposal of 88 others.</p> <p><strong>Compass</strong> closed 11p lower at 824p despite an in line trading update. The catering group was buoyed by good performances in the US and Australia but, again, faced tough conditions in Europe.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 20.99 points higher at 6399.37, with continuing worries about Cyprus outweighed by positive US figures for manufactured goods.</p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> continued its good run following its latest figures, up another 16.6p to 428.4p.</p> <p>But <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 38.3p lower at 405.3p after it reported full year profits had fallen by a third to $1.91bn. It took a $2.22bn impairment charge on its stake in fellow Kazakh miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, down 8.1p to 260p.</p> <p><strong>Whitbread </strong>slipped 8p to \u00a325.24.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons shares have underpeformed its sector and the market for some time, not least because investors were concerned the supermarket group had missed the boat on the fast growing online and convenience store markets. But following recent moves to address these issues - including buying HMV stores and linking up with Ocado for its online plans - it has now benefited from more positive news. The latest market share figures from Kantar showed an improvement in sales, with analysts at Jefferies saying: Sales return to positive territory at 0.8%, continuing the improvement following the 3.3% fall seen in the post Christmas reading. Whilst the vertically integrated supply chain has undoubtedly helped the group through the horse-meat scandal, Morrisons has also certainly increased the 'noise' levels since the start of the new financial year. The payday bonus (launched in early February and offering \u00a310 off at the end of the month, with a shopper having to spend at least \u00a335 in each of the three consecutive weeks) and the new TV advertisements (focusing on the group's fresh food credentials) appear to be gradually moving the brand back onto the front foot. Meanwhile Citigroup raised its recommendation on the supermarket group from neutral to buy. Citi said: Morrisons has the strongest economic model of the three listed UK operators with higher combination of asset turn and margin. Over the long-term we think Morrisons is well positioned to extend [this model] to southern England where it remains under-represented. Morrisons ended 9.3p higher at 276p. Elsewhere Kingfisher fell 0.3p to 283p after profits dropped 11.4% to \u00a3715m, hit by a dearth of DIY buying by cash-strapped consumers. Wolseley also faced similar problems. The building materials group lost 38p to \u00a331.73 after it reported a 20% fall in half year profits to \u00a3199m, with strong growth in the US outweighed by problems in Europe and the UK. These conditions have persisted into the third quarter, and analysts reckoned the difficulties probably dampened hopes of a special dividend payout. It has already cut 990 jobs across Europe since August and has announced a restructuring of its French business Reseau Pro which involves the closure of 24 loss making branches and the disposal of 88 others. Compass closed 11p lower at 824p despite an in line trading update. The catering group was buoyed by good performances in the US and Australia but, again, faced tough conditions in Europe. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 20.99 points higher at 6399.37, with continuing worries about Cyprus outweighed by positive US figures for manufactured goods. Aberdeen Asset Management continued its good run following its latest figures, up another 16.6p to 428.4p. But Kazakhmys closed 38.3p lower at 405.3p after it reported full year profits had fallen by a third to $1.91bn. It took a $2.22bn impairment charge on its stake in fellow Kazakh miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, down 8.1p to 260p. Whitbread slipped 8p to \u00a325.24. The leisure group was reportedly setting up a cheap alternative brand to its Premier Inn hotels. Engineering group Morgan Crucible Company dipped 1.5p to 287p. That did not stop speculative talk of possible interest from a US rival or private equity group. A price of 450p a share was mentioned. Finally Savills, the upmarket estate agency, slid 41.5p to 543.5p on talk of a stake sale. Traders said Credit Suisse was placing up to 7.8m shares - around 5.8% of the business - at up to 545p each.

      "bodyText": "Britain is trying to orchestrate a rescue of the UK branches of a troubled Cypriot bank, the chancellor revealed on Tuesday, as he criticised the handling of the bailout for the tiny island at the forefront of the eurozone's debt problems. With Cyprus battling to open its banks on Thursday for the first time in 12 days, George Osborne revealed that a further \u20ac13m (\u00a311m) in cash had been flown in for use by troops stationed there. The Cypriot finance minister, Michalis Sarris, warned of a \"significant\" haircut on savings accounts holding more than \u20ac100,000 \u2013 which could see at least 40% wiped off deposits. \"The exact percentage is not yet decided but it is going to be significant,\" said Sarris, who had hoped to get Russia to contribute to the \u20ac10bn bailout, given the large number of its citizens expected to lose billions of euros on deposit in the island's banks.

However, it is still unclear whether Laiki UK accounts holding more than that amount could be exposed to the bailout haircut. Laiki runs three branches in London, including one in Mayfair, and one in Birmingham \u2013 it has been stressing to customers that it is \"business as usual\". Osborne said that the bailout \"has not been well handled over the last 10 days\" while Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the committee, described it as \"appalling mismanagement as there could have been, a terrible farrago\".

      "bodyText": "Any company with exposure to the construction industry in Europe's struggling economies is bound to be having a tough time, and Wolseley is proving the point. The building materials group has reported a 20% fall in half year profits to \u00a3199m, with strong growth in the US outweighed by problems in Europe and the UK. These conditions have persisted into the third quarter, and analysts reckoned the difficulties probably dampened hopes of a special dividend payout. It has already cut 990 jobs across Europe since August and has announced a restructuring of its French business Reseau Pro which involves the closure of 24 loss making branches and the disposal of 88 others. Chief executive Ian Meakins said: We faced sustantial headwinds in Europe, and are taking appropriate actions to protect profitability.

      "bodyText": "Overpaid chief executives and all-male boardrooms will be challenged by a new grouping of influential shareholders controlled by the TUC, Unison and Unite unions. The Trade Union Share Owners group, which controls \u00a31bn worth of staff pension funds, will join forces to take action at the annual meetings of FTSE-listed companies, a year after the so-called shareholder spring saw a wave of meetings where investors voiced their anger at excessive pay. The group will take common voting positions on directors' pay and bonuses, the membership of boards and the advertising of new director posts. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"The UK's families might be struggling to cope with the biggest squeeze on their incomes in living memory, but that hasn't discouraged top directors from awarding themselves austerity-busting pay and bonus packages worth millions. \"It's time to inject a long-overdue dose of reality into British boardrooms and we are going to use the power of our pension funds to make a difference and to encourage a new and more responsible corporate Britain.\" A report last year by corporate governance expert Manifest and pay consultants MM&amp;K revealed that FTSE 100 chief executives saw their take-home pay increase by 12%, while employees' pay rose by just 1%. Angry shareholders voted down various pay packets for some of the most highly paid executives in the country and triggered the resignation of Andrew Moss, chief executive of Aviva, Sly Bailey at Trinity Mirror and Astrazeneca boss David Brennan. However, yesterday, the pharmaceutical giant revealed that it paid Brennan \u00a3120,000 in relocation costs after he stepped down and moved back to the US. Aviva said it will pay new chief executive Mark Wilson up to \u00a3200,000 in relocation costs to move from his previous base in Hong Kong to the UK. All-male boardrooms have also caused politicians and campaigners to call for all FTSE companies to have at least 30% women on their boards. The business secretary, Vince Cable, recently wrote to the seven FTSE 100 companies that still have all-male boards and the business select committee has been hearing evidence on how more women can enter the boardroom. The general secretary of Unite, Len McCluskey, said: \"Trade union values of decency and fairness ought to be present in the boardroom, but if we cannot trust that they will be, then we need to use our share ownership to influence corporations.\"",
