      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn will seek to exploit the anti-austerity mood in the new House of Commons and put pressure on Conservative MPs by tabling an amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech calling for the public sector pay cap to be scrapped. Many public sector workers have seen their real living standards fall as a result of the 1% a year ceiling imposed by George Osborne in 2012 after two years of freezes, and rolled over for another four years in 2015. Theresa May was confronted about the issue by an angry nurse during the BBC\u2019s election debate, underlining public frustration about the ongoing squeeze, almost a decade after the financial crash. Labour will table an amendment on Wednesday evening calling for cuts to emergency services, including the police and the fire service, to be reversed, and calling for an end to the 1% cap. Conservative MPs are unlikely to back an amendment tabled by Corbyn. But Labour hopes the move will leave Tory backbenchers in marginal seats exposed to the argument that they back austerity if another election is called in the coming months. Corbyn said: \u201cYou can\u2019t have safety and security on the cheap. It is plain to see that seven years of cuts to our emergency services has made us less safe. It\u2019s time to make a change.\u201d Corbyn has chosen not to focus on Brexit in his amendment and will not make it the central thrust of a second amendment to be tabled on Thursday, before MPs are given the opportunity to vote on the Queens speech \u2013 the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s first chance to deliver on the confidence and supply deal. A Conservative party spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019ve protected the police budget since 2015 while Labour wanted to cut it by 10% \u2013 and the number of fire incidents has halved in the last decade. \u201cWe have also given the police and intelligence agencies the powers they need to respond to increased threats and keep people safe.\u201d A separate cross-party backbench amendment, tabled by Labour MPs including Stephen Doughty and Chuka Umunna, urges the government to seek to remain inside the single market after Brexit. It has received the support of more than 50 MPs, leading its backers to hope that the Speaker will select it for the House to vote on Thursday and that some Tory MPs could lend it their support. But Labour frontbenchers are sceptical of the wisdom of reopening the bitter debate that raged in the party earlier this year over how to handle the issue of Brexit. Corbyn imposed a three-line whip on his MPs to support the government\u2019s article 50 bill, prompting several shadow ministers to resign. Doughty, the MP for Cardiff South, said he was not expecting to win the vote but wanted to put the government on notice for the tough parliamentary battles ahead, with eight Brexit bills due during this two-year parliamentary session. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting a flag in the ground \u2013 things have changed. People are prepared to act cross-party,\u201d he said. Conservative MPs who have expressed concerns about the impact of spending cuts in key policy areas have returned to Westminster emboldened by the tight election result, which saw intense public debate about a lack of funding for public services. The \u00a31bn price tag for Theresa May\u2019s confidence and supply deal with the DUP has also raised fresh questions about the government\u2019s argument that there was \u201cno magic money tree\u201d. Heidi Allen, the South Cambridgeshire MP who has campaigned in the past against benefits cuts, tweeted that she hoped other areas of public investment would be reviewed in the light of the extra cash found for Northern Ireland. Dan Poulter, the MP for Central Suffolk, said he did not see the DUP deal and the need for more investment in public services as being linked, but he added: \u201cI have long advocated the need to invest more in our public services, and also to end the public sector pay cap.\u201d Several Conservative MPs used the debate on the education aspects of the Queen\u2019s speech on Tuesday to demand that the government urgently address the issue of school funding. The education secretary, Justine Greening, reaffirmed the party\u2019s manifesto pledge that no school would be left worse off in cash terms as a result of the new schools funding formula currently being consulted on. But it is unclear where the \u00a34bn in extra funding that the Conservatives pledged will come from, since the Tory manifesto aimed to find most of it from scrapping free school lunches \u2013 a policy now jettisoned. Tory MP Tim Loughton, who represents East Worthing and Shoreham, said even that would not be enough. \u201cI welcome the additional \u00a34bn that the government has offered, but there will still be a shortfall given the cost pressures coming along the line from pay increases, national insurance and the apprenticeship levy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cumulative effect of being underfunded for so many years in West Sussex is that many of our schools do not have any further slack that they can take up \u2013 they are running on empty. That has to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.\u201d Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, pointed out that the extra \u00a350m for schools included in the DUP funding package amounted to \u00a3150 for every pupil in Northern Ireland. \u201cFortunately for them, they seem to have located the magic money tree about which we heard so much during the election,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I welcome the government\u2019s acknowledgement that they were not properly funding schools in Northern Ireland, and the money is to address that; but can the secretary of state explain why, as schools face billions of pounds in cuts, the government are doing nothing to address the immediate pressures on schools in England?\u201d The DUP deal continued to arouse anger in Scotland and Wales. Labour\u2019s Vaughan Gething, health secretary in the Welsh assembly, said: \u201cYesterday, the UK government found more than \u00a31bn to effectively end austerity in Northern Ireland. \u201cI fully expect them to make money available so that we can give our hardworking health service staff the pay rise they deserve. They deserve nothing less.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A shopkeeper has dealt with the threat of legal action from Sainsbury\u2019s over his similarly named store by changing its name from Singhsbury\u2019s to Morrisinghs. Jel Singh Nagra, 42, has changed the name of his convenience store in West Allotment, North Tyneside, after Sainsbury\u2019s said its original name, Singhsbury\u2019s, was too similar to its own branding. In 2012 Nagra received a letter from Sainsbury\u2019s complaining about the design and font of the shop\u2019s logo as well as the name, he said. Nagra admitted he was egged on by his customers to riff on one of Sainsbury\u2019s most bitter supermarket rivals when coming up with the new name: \u201cPeople up here love banter. Some of the locals just come in the shop for the banter.\u201d He said the new name was \u201cjust a laugh\u201d and he hoped it would \u201cput West Allotment on the map\u201d. Nagra\u2019s family took the original sign down when he was away on his honeymoon. Replacing one potentially copyright infringing branding with another one could be a risk for Nagra. But a spokesperson for Morrison\u2019s suggested it was flattered by Nagra\u2019s name choice, saying: \u201cMr Nagra and his customers obviously have good taste so we wish him well.\u201d A picture of the new-look shop has been shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times since it was posted on Monday night. Nagra had the press at his shop all day on Tuesday and his friends called him when they spotted him on Sky News. Nagra said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe the attention\u201d. There are a number of Singhbury\u2019s stores throughout the UK from Edinburgh to the Black Country, and there are several in London. The owner of Singhbury\u2019s supermarket in Seven Sisters, north London, who did not want to be named, said he has never received a letter from Sainsbury\u2019s regarding the name. Singhsbury\u2019s Superstore in Paddington, west London, is a few hundred yards from a Sainsbury\u2019s store on the same road. Its owners also say they have never received any legal correspondence from the supermarket. Sainsbury\u2019s told the Guardian: \u201cWe were grateful to Mr Nagra for removing the sign.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes could face an investigation from the gambling regulator over an incident in which confidential information about betting addicts, including photos, names and addresses, was found in a bin bag on the street. The Gambling Commission said it was looking into the bookmaker\u2019s compliance with data protection laws after a passer-by found the sensitive documents outside a branch of Ladbrokes in Glasgow. The data included personal details of customers who signed up for the betting industry\u2019s multi-operator self-exclusion scheme (Moses), which allows problem gamblers to ban themselves from placing bets voluntarily. Bookmakers carry information about customers who have signed up to the Moses system to help shop staff identify customers who should not be allowed to bet. The information includes their names, addresses, photographs and information about why they have chosen to exclude themselves but does not include bank account numbers or detailed information about their betting history. The Gambling Commission said it was looking into why such sensitive data was not disposed of in a way that ensured customer\u2019s personal information was protected. \u201cCustomers trust that their personal data will be collected carefully and then protected properly,\u201d said the Gambling Commission executive director, Tim Miller. \u201cWe expect gambling operators to adhere to all data protection laws or regulations, which are enforced by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO). \u201cIn an instance where personal data has been breached, we would expect operators to do whatever they can to mitigate any harm caused.\u201d Ladbrokes usually collects such data from its stores and disposes of it securely through a company-wide procedure. A statement on the Moses website reads: \u201cYour personal details are kept confidential and only shared with the participating bookmakers their group companies\u2019 and the central team administrators.\u201d Ladbrokes did not say how the information ended up in a bin bag on the street. But a spokesperson said: \u201cWe are taking this extremely seriously and [are] undertaking a full investigation.\u201d Ladbrokes is understood to have written to all of its shops reminding them of the need to dispose of sensitive information in the right way. It has also begun an internal investigation to be sure that its procedures are as watertight as possible, according to the Scottish Sun. Marc Etches, chief executive of leading charity GambleAware, said: \u201cWe really hope this situation does not put anyone off using self-exclusion, as research we published in March found that 83% of those who have used it found the scheme to be effective, although we would always recommend professional treatment alongside such measures. \u201cSelf-exclusion is often a last resort for those already suffering from a gambling addiction and it\u2019s important we identify those who are at risk as early as possible and prevent problems developing.\u201d Individual bookmakers have their own self-exclusion scheme but also use the industry-wide scheme Moses, managed by a responsible-gambling body called the Senet Group, founded by four major bookmakers in 2014. Gamblers can voluntarily self-exclude for a year, a binding decision that cannot be reversed during the period. At the end of the year, the self-exclusion will remain in place automatically for six months, unless the customer requests otherwise.",

    "webTitle": "UK banks ordered to hold more capital as consumer debt surges", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is to force banks to strengthen their financial position in the face of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. The intervention by Threadneedle Street means banks will need to set aside as much as \u00a311.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months and is intended to protect the financial system from the 10% rise in consumer lending over the year. The Bank is also bringing forward the part of the annual stress tests on banks that scrutinises their exposure to consumer credit by two months to September. The Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, will also publish next month how they expect lenders to treat borrowers in the consumer credit market. The Bank\u2019s half-yearly assessment of risk to financial markets also set out measures to rein in the riskiest mortgage lending, highlighted the risks associated with the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union and said commercial property prices were \u201cat the top end of sustainable valuations\u201d. While the Bank found risks to financial stability were neither \u201cparticularly elevated nor subdued\u201d it warned that there \u201cpockets of risk that warrant vigilance\u201d. \u201cConsumer credit has increased rapidly. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier. And lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions,\u201d said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. Carney said the decision to call on banks to hold more capital \u2013 which is largely a rejig of their current resources rather than raising new funds \u2013 was taken after domestic risks returned to \u201cstandard\u201d levels. A year ago, after the Brexit vote, the Bank had relaxed regulatory requirements on banks \u2013 using new tools it was given after the financial crisis \u2013 and is now reversing that decision. Carney distinguished between interest rates \u2013 cut to a record low of 0.25% after Brexit \u2013 and financial policy instruments. \u201cMonetary policy is the last line of defence to address financial stability issues,\u201d he said, with monetary policy focused on keeping inflation at its target rate of 2% rather than controlling lending. He said earlier this month that rates should stay on hold. Debt charities warned of the consequences for the 8.8 million individuals using credit for essential household bills if the Bank\u2019s measures led to lenders increasing rates. \u201cAny increase in borrowing costs could tip households, many of which are already on a financial knife-edge, into serious financial hardship,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Connor, the chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity. Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said there had been an 8% rise in the number of people using its national debtline this year and that the Bank was right to act. The fastest- growing component of consumer credit is car finance, which has been rising at 15% a year, while credit card lending is rising at 9% and personal lending at 7%. The Bank calculates there is \u00a358bn of car dealership finance, including \u00a324bn from banks; \u00a367bn in credit cards, including \u00a352bn from banks; and \u00a372bn in loans and overdrafts, of which \u00a362bn originates from the banking sector. The UK consumer credit market is valued at about \u00a3200bn \u2013 a seventh of the size of the \u00a31.4tn mortgage market but with write-offs several times larger than mortgages. Threadneedle Street is also monitoring mortgage lending, which has risen by a more moderate 2.8% but where there are signs of an increase in riskier lending, measured by the size of the loan to an individual\u2019s income. Affordability tests are being tweaked so lenders must test that borrowers can afford a three percentage point increase in their standard variable rate (SVR) \u2013 a rise to about 7%. This is tighter than the current requirement for a three percentage point rise in the base rate, which allows lenders some discretion by assuming they will not pass on the full rate rise in their SVR. The Bank also said it would keep in place measures introduced in 2014 that limit high-risk lending to 15% of a lender\u2019s overall lending. The additional capital requirements come in two phases; an 0.5% rise in a special pot of capital known as a the countercyclical capital buffer in June 2018 and another 0.5% the year after that. Each 0.5% increase amounts to about \u00a35.7bn of extra capital in the system and does not necessarily mean banks would have to raise fresh amounts of cash but rather reallocate existing capital. Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics said: \u201cThe policy change is unlikely to make much difference to overall lending given that the majority of banks are already better capitalised than required.\u201d On Brexit, the Bank said it was continuing to \u201cidentify and monitor UK financial stability risks so that preparations can be made and action taken to mitigate them\u201d. Carney said risks, including those from a hard Brexit, were being assessed, and he warned of the costs of fragmenting Europe\u2019s financial markets.",

He said earlier this month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/bank-of-england-mark-carney-interest-rates-hold-brexit-eu\">rates should stay on hold</a>. </p> <p>Debt charities warned of the consequences for the 8.8 million individuals using credit for essential household bills if the Bank\u2019s measures led to lenders increasing rates. </p> <p>\u201cAny increase in borrowing costs could tip households, many of which are already on a financial knife-edge, into serious financial hardship,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Connor, the chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity.</p> <p>Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said there had been an 8% rise in the number of people using its national debtline this year and that the Bank was right to act.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/25/booming-stock-markets-distract-from-threat-of-excessive-lending\">Central banks raise alarm over new crash after steep rise in lending</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fastest- growing component of consumer credit is car finance, which has been rising at 15% a year, while credit card lending is rising at 9% and personal lending at 7%.</p> <p>The Bank calculates there is \u00a358bn of car dealership finance, including \u00a324bn from banks; \u00a367bn in credit cards, including \u00a352bn from banks; and \u00a372bn in loans and overdrafts, of which \u00a362bn originates from the banking sector. </p> <p>The UK consumer credit market is valued at about \u00a3200bn \u2013 a seventh of the size of the \u00a31.4tn mortgage market but with write-offs several times larger than mortgages.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street is also monitoring mortgage lending, which has risen by a more moderate 2.8% but where there are signs of an increase in riskier lending, measured by the size of the loan to an individual\u2019s income. </p> <p>Affordability tests are being tweaked so lenders must test that borrowers can afford a three percentage point increase in their standard variable rate (SVR) \u2013 a rise to about 7%. This is tighter than the current requirement for a three percentage point rise in the base rate, which allows lenders some discretion by assuming they will not pass on the full rate rise in their SVR.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/26/bank-of-england-limit-large-loans-housebuyers-mortgage-lenders\">The Bank also said it would keep in place measures introduced in 2014</a> that limit high-risk lending to 15% of a lender\u2019s overall lending.</p> <p>The additional capital requirements come in two phases; an 0.5% rise in a special pot of capital known as a the countercyclical capital buffer in June 2018 and another 0.5% the year after that. Each 0.5% increase amounts to about \u00a35.7bn of extra capital in the system and does not necessarily mean banks would have to raise fresh amounts of cash but rather reallocate existing capital.</p> <p>Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics said: \u201cThe policy change is unlikely to make much difference to overall lending given that the majority of banks are already better capitalised than required.\u201d</p> <p>On Brexit, the Bank said it was continuing to \u201cidentify and monitor UK financial stability risks so that preparations can be made and action taken to mitigate them\u201d. Carney said risks, including those from a hard Brexit, were being assessed, and he warned of the costs of fragmenting Europe\u2019s financial markets.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "The deal to spend an extra \u00a31bn over two years in Northern Ireland will do little to disturb the public finances. Of the funds, about \u00a3400m will be directed at new physical infrastructure, \u00a3150m on better broadband, and \u00a340m will tackle deprivation. Another \u00a3350m will be spent on health and education services. Treasury forecasts show the government will spend \u00a3802bn this financial year and \u00a3817bn in the next. In this context, pumping an extra \u00a3500m a year into Northern Ireland\u2019s public services and the local economy is small beer. As Carl Emmerson, deputy head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: \u201cThe size of the UK\u2019s public finances means you can give away \u00a31bn a year and it\u2019s not much more than a rounding error.\u201d But the demand by the Democratic Unionist party that Theresa May rescue the triple lock on pensions and the winter fuel allowance from Philip Hammond\u2019s chopping board gives the chancellor a bigger headache. At the moment, qualifying pensioner households automatically receive a single winter fuel payment, ranging from \u00a3100 to \u00a3300. About 12.3 million people received the tax-free allowance in 2015-16, at a total cost of just over \u00a32bn. The Tory manifesto failed to say how much of this \u00a32bn the incoming government planned to save, but the IFS was not alone in guesstimating that the manifesto writers were targeting at least half. A \u00a31bn saving, if that is what was planned, was not priced into the Treasury\u2019s forecasts and therefore its loss is academic. And yet the money would have come in handy this year, when Hammond has conceded that the budget deficit will increase for the first time since 2010. The triple lock guarantees pensioners a rise in the basic state pension of at least 2.5%, the rate of inflation or earnings, whichever is the higher. Hammond wanted to switch to a double lock that dispensed with the 2.5% minimum. Projections for the next five years showed either inflation or earnings would rise at more than 2.5%, so the government stood to gain little or nothing from the move over the life of the parliament. But in the longer term, the double lock was due to pay dividends. The \u00a31bn DUP deal itself, while small in relation to the Treasury\u2019s overall spending, could spark a round of special pleading that wrecks Hammond\u2019s forecasts. Nicola Sturgeon was first out of the blocks with a claim that Scotland is due about \u00a32.9bn based on the way the Barnett formula works for UK government spending. Downing Street said the formula does not apply to the new money, as it is being provided as an addition to the Northern Ireland executive\u2019s block grant. In a similar way, the formula did not apply to city deals in Wales and Scotland \u2013 the latter of which has seen \u00a3500m spent on Glasgow and \u00a3125m in Aberdeen \u2013 or previous packages of support for Northern Ireland, a No 10 source said. About 1.8 million people live in Northern Ireland and they will receive the equivalent of approximately \u00a3537 each. Based on population size, this is the equivalent of an extra \u00a31.6bn in Wales, an extra \u00a32.8bn in Scotland, or an extra \u00a328.5bn in England. When London was given the Olympics at a cost of \u00a39bn, the UK version of pork barrel politics resulted in very little for the nations and regions of the UK. Emmerson said the main threat to the public finances, apart from a Brexit-induced economic slowdown, comes from the demands for extra spending on health and education and other big Whitehall budgets. The government has already pumped more money into prisons and social care after cuts were considered to have gone too far. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like the Osborne/Cameron financial settlement has held firm,\u201d said Emmerson. \u201cIf there is pressure to increase spending on health and education in other parts of the UK, that is where you are talking about big money.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "IMF cuts US growth forecast, as Bank of England tells banks to boost capital - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally (probably), European stock markets have ended the day in the red. In London the FTSE100 lost 12 points to 7434, despite mining shares rallying, and there were deeper losses in Europe. Currency moves are to blame; the euro strengthened after ECB president Mario Draghi spoke about reflation returning to the Eurozone as its recovery picked up. The pound gained against the US dollar after the IMF cut its growth forecasts. Political developments in Scotland also nudged sterling up, as Josh Mahony of IG explains: News that the SNP have formally abandoned their plan for a second referendum before the completion of Brexit has helped the pound\u2019s ascent, with GBPUSD hitting the highest level in a week. The IMF cut their outlook for the US economy today, which when considering the negative path of core PCE inflation, makes a September rate hike increasingly unlikely. Newsflash: American consumer morale has jumped this month, despite the IMF\u2019s concerns about the US economy. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index rose in June to 118.9, defying expectations that it would fall to 116.0 this month. Optimism is close to a 16-year high, says Lynn Franco of the The Conference Board: \u201cExpectations for the short-term have eased somewhat, but are still upbeat. Overall, consumers anticipate the economy will continue expanding in the months ahead, but they do not foresee the pace of growth accelerating.\u201d Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is struck by the Bank of England\u2019s decision to bring forwards its consumer credit stress tests by a couple of months: \u201cThe risk to financial stability coming from the recent rapid growth in consumer credit would undoubtedly be magnified if there is a near-term interest rate hike. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given their high borrowing levels. \u201cIt is notable that the Bank of England is bringing forward its testing of banks\u2019 ability to cope with major losses on consumer loans to September from November. Additionally, regulators will in July publish their expectations for lenders in the consumer credit market.\u201d Wall Street has opened lower, with the IMF\u2019s downgraded growth forecasts dampening the mood in New York. The main indices are all in the red, with shares in Alphabet (Google) shedding more than 1.2% after it was slapped with a \u20ac2.4bn fine by Brussels today. The news that the IMF has downgraded its US growth forecasts and criticised Trump\u2019s budget plans, has sent a ripple through the financial markets. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: Here\u2019s more reaction to the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report, from Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk: \u201cThe Bank of England is right to flag our debt binge as a big concern. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u2019ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. Many are just about managing now and have little in savings to fall back on. Banks need to be prepared for this worst case scenario so they aren\u2019t on shaky ground if rates go up.\u201d Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has cut its US growth forecasts, and concluded that Donald Trump won\u2019t boost economic activity after all. The IMF now expects US GDP to rise by 2.1% in 2017, down from 2.3% back in April. For 2018, it also sees growth of 2.1%, down from 2.5% three months ago. The IMF had hoped that Trump\u2019s pledge to boost fiscal spending, and cut taxes, would deliver a economic boost. But having seen the president in action, the Fund has had a rethink. Importantly, it criticises Trump\u2019s recent budget proposals, warning that they benefit the richest Americans more than the rest. Reuters explains: The IMF said the Trump administration\u2019s latest budget plans would place a disproportionate share of spending cuts onto low-and middle-income households, adding \u201cthis would appear counter to the budget\u2019s goals of promoting safety and prosperity for all Americans.\u201d Instead, the Fund suggested a tax policy that would improve the federal revenue-to-GDP ratio, more balanced cuts that strengthen the social safety net\u2019s efficiency, and efforts to contain healthcare cost inflation. It\u2019s been an eventful couple of days in Greece, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has held emergency talks with striking municipal rubbish collectors over demands for expiring short-term contracts to be replaced with permanent jobs. With the sweltering heat fuelling mounting concerns that mounds of uncollected rubbish could soon become a public health risk, Tsipras invited unionists representing the workers to his office for talks last night. In a statement his office said the invitation was addressed to unionists \u201cto find a solution to the claims of the refuge workers and to avoid the dangers to public heath\u201d posed by the prolonged strike\u201d and very high temperatures that are expected in the coming days.\u201d Earlier today, scuffles broke out between unionists and security guards outside the building housing the prime minister\u2019s quarters when attempts were made to unfold banners emblazoned with slogans and demands. The meeting is being described as critical by insiders who say given the heat wave now gripping Greece - and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of tourists in the capital alone - the strike has become a major political issue. How Tsipras will be able to negotiate his way out of the crisis - and keep labour reform demanding international creditors on board - is anyone\u2019s guess. Alex Buttle, director of car buying website Motorway.co.uk, argues that Mark Carney is right to worry about the boom in car loans. Here\u2019s why: \u201cThe growth of Personal Contract Plans over the past few years has been astronomical, and the level of consumer debt this is causing is getting out of hand. \u201cDespite the many hidden costs, it\u2019s hard to resist the temptation of owning a new luxury car without having to find tens of thousands of pounds upfront to pay for it. \u201cThe problem is that household finances are starting to get stretched and many people are probably living beyond their means because of readily available credit, including car loans. \u201cIf people really do start to struggle financially, then the priority will be keeping a roof over their heads, and they are far more likely to default on a car loan than a mortgage. \u201cWe could well see a spike in people defaulting on their car loans in favour of losing their home if the economic climate takes a turn for the worst.\u201d The pound has inched higher against the US dollar through the day, and is currently 0.3% higher at $1.2764. However, it is still down 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1314, after ECB chief Mario Draghi gave an optimistic view of the eurozone economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that the \u201cbarrage of information\u201d in the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability review didn\u2019t actually move the markets that much. He says: The FTSE maintained its 15 point drop, the gains in the commodity and banking sectors \u2013 the former benefiting from a Brent Crude bounce, the latter from yesterday\u2019s Italian bank bailout \u2013 failing to counteract the effects of the drop in consumer confidence revealed by YouGov. As for the pound, while it suffered some serious losses against the euro, it still managed to climb 0.2% against the dollar. That wasn\u2019t the most illuminating press conference with Mark Carney, but here\u2019s what we learned. The Bank of England is pushing the UK financial sector to prepare for a downturn, by making them hold an extra \u00a311bn of capital. But.... Carney says this won\u2019t be a problem, as banks already hold more capital than required, since the rule were relaxed after the Brexit vote. As Carney puts it: We want to move the levels of capital back up to the level they should be -- any time you move into more benign credit conditions there have been fewer defaults. The BoE is concerned that some lenders are becoming too reckless, saying that: \u201cConsumer credit has increased rapidly. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier. Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions.\u201d The Bank\u2019s key target appears to be complacency, as it scrambles to bring its consumer credit stress tests forward by three months to September. It is particularly interested in the car market, following the boom in \u201cPersonal Contract Purchase\u201d deals. These allow customers to pay a monthly fee for a new car, and then either pay a hefty \u2018balloon payment\u2019 to actually own it, or switch to a new deal with a new vehicle. The fear is that customers could be left high and dry if financial conditions tighten. However (and this is where the confusion starts) the Bank doesn\u2019t want consumers to cut up their credit cards and stop trying to shimmy up the housing ladder. Instead, it wants them to be sensible when borrowing, and trust that the Bank is keeping the financial system strong. Those families who are most over-extended, and wouldn\u2019t cope with higher borrowing costs, are a concern, though: On Brexit, Carney repeatedly said the Bank\u2019s contingency planning is focusing on the most disruptive scenario, in which Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. But that doesn\u2019t mean the BoE expects such a cliff-edge exit..... If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story about the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report: Final question: Q: You say you expect to raise the counter-cyclical buffer to 1% in November, but could Brexit force a cut back from 0.5% to 0% (reversing today\u2019s move) Mark Carney says the BoE thinks the buffer should be around 1% in stable times. The BoE had started the process of raising the buffer last year, before the Brexit vote, which led it to be cut back to 0% to take worries about lending \u2018off the table\u2019. So.... we could have decided to hike the buffer to 1% today, but it was more sensible to allow a \u2018gradual build\u2019 (to 0.5% today, and 1% in November) On Brexit, we want the system to be as resilient as possible to prepare for any outcome in 640 days time, he concludes. I think that means the BoE want the banking sector to be well capitalised, in case of any Brexit shock in March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU. Q: You say that West End asset prices are \u2018unsustainable\u2019; when might they return to reality, and what impact would that happen? Carney reiterates his earlier point that Britain currently have \u201cVery low risk-free rates, and high valuation levels\u201d. So either those rates should rise, or asset prices should fall. It would be foolish to put a timescale on it - prices can stay unsustainable for a long time, and then correct quickly, he warns. Q: The report talks about the need for \u2018consistent implementation\u2019 of international standards; are you particularly worried about the Trump administration? Carney says it is important to have open global standards, and even more important that they are implemented, to avoid another financial crisis. You also need supervisory co-operation between regulators...and we want to reinforce that where possible. On the US, we have had \u201cvery productive discussions\u201d with regulators about it. Carney explains how many countries have some unique rules (such as America\u2019s Volcker rule, or bank ring-fencing in the UK), which they can change without affecting other nations. But there needs to be more co-ordination when it comes to global standards, if there are areas of \u2018inconsistency\u2019 that need to be addressed. [Explainer: Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulations in the financial sector, such as the Volcker rule which is meant to prevent banks taking dangerous trading risks. Trump is also keen to repeal Dodd-Frank, which was brought in after the financial crisis. ] Q: You point out that commercial real estate assets are overvalued, and could unwind if people try to sell them in a rush. That happened after the Brexit vote - has anything changed since? [explainer: several property funds froze redemptions after the EU referendum, to stop investors cashing out, exposing the dangers of investing in \u2018illiquid assets\u2019 such as shopping centres] Carney says there is a disconnect between the market expectations for future growth, and the value of commercial buildings. So either those expectations will rise, or commercial asset values will fall. Q: Isn\u2019t the boom in consumer credit due to you keeping interest rates so low? Carney insists he\u2019s not to blame, and points to the broader context of a UK economy that has grown solidly over the last 12 months (despite slowing in the first quarter of 2017). Here\u2019s a chart showing how consumer debt has grown: Carney says the boom in car loans is a major factor behind the pick-up in consumer debt recently, but he remains \u201csanguine\u201d about the banking sector\u2019s overall exposure to it. Q: Your charts show that consumer finance has been growing faster than household income since 2014, so shouldn\u2019t you have issued today\u2019s warning sooner? Deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe says consumer borrowing actually picked up in 2013, but overall household lending actually grew slower than the UK economy. Consumer borrowing is \u00a3200bn, compared to \u00a31.4 trillion in mortgage lending, he explains - so the BoE has to decide when it\u2019s a serious worry. We\u2019ve been watching consumer credit for a while, and now is the time to look at whether underwriting standards are starting to slip, and bring forwards our stress test (by three months, to September) Q: Are banks misbehaving and gaming the system, and is there a cultural problem? They\u2019re not gaming the system, but they\u2019re not learning the lessons of the past, Carney says. Q: Which consumer borrowing are you most worried about? Carney cites the sharp build up in car financing \u2013 both in volume, and the move towards \u2018personal contract purchasing\u2019 deals (where buyers pay monthly repayments, and then face a large balloon payment to actually own their car) Q: How confident are you that banks can raise the extra capital you are demanding? They all have this capital on their books at present, Carney replies. It\u2019s a question of reallocating capital from other areas (and perhaps choosing to raise more capital) The extra capital buffer will mean UK banks must meet a 4% leverage ratio, Carney explains, but the current leverage ratio is actually 5.25%. In other words, Banks shouldn\u2019t face a massive challenge meeting the BoE\u2019s demands. Q: Has the general election changed your view of how the Brexit talks will evolve, and raised the risks from political instability? The short answer is no, governor Carney replies. Our job is to work out what might go wrong and prepare for it, rather than assessing quite how likely various scenarios are. So June\u2019s general election hasn\u2019t changed the Bank\u2019s contingency planning for Brexit. Q: How worried are you about the British banking sector\u2019s exposure to China? Risks from China are at the top end of global risks, Carney replies. That\u2019s due to the build-up of debt, structural issues in the financial system, and the challenge of growing the economy while also maintaining stability. Q: What role are interest rates playing in exaggerating or reining in financial stability risks? Monetary policy is the \u2018last line of defence\u2019, says Carney, and we don\u2019t need monetary policy to do our job of ensuring financial stability, Carney continues. If the Financial Policy Committee does its job properly, then the MPC can focus on its job of getting inflation back to target. Q: And what would you say to those who think that being responsible for financial stability is distracting you from the job of setting interest rates and controlling inflation? Carney (who chairs both the FPC and the Monetary Policy Committee which sets borrowing costs) denies that he\u2019s got too much on his plate. It takes as long to decide to raise rates as to cut then as to leave them on hold, he replies. I\u2019ve been doing this job for many years at two central banks (the BoE and the Bank of Canada). And he\u2019s not biting.... Q: You\u2019re telling banks that times are changing, and they should set aside more capital, but shouldn\u2019t consumers also recognise that times are changing and rein in our borrowings? I\u2019m not going to give individual financial advice, says Mark Carney (you\u2019re on your own, folks, sorry). He then explains that the Bank is trying to strengthen the resilience of the core of the system, in case a crisis strike. The message for the public is that if things become bumpy, in the Brexit transition or because of problems in the global economy, then the financial system will be there for them, says the governor, adding: Individuals must take the judgement whether it\u2019s the right time to buy a property, or invest in a business, and we\u2019re trying to ensure that the financial system is there to help them with that. Q: You seem to be blaming lenders, rather than consumers, for the rise in consumer credit - but shouldn\u2019t people be more cautious about how much debt they take on? Carney says that UK households have deleveraged a lot since the financial crisis, and only releveraged recently. He wouldn\u2019t say that households as a whole are taking elevated risks. The first line of defence is that lenders themselves are responsible; the second line of defence is banks set aside enough capital incase of a downturn. Q: How concerned are you that UK consumers are borrowing too much, and will find themselves in difficulties when interest rates rise? Mark Carney replies that the BoE\u2019s message, in good times or bad ones, is that anyone who takes out a loan should consider that they could face adverse conditions in the future, such as weaker growth and higher interest rates. This \u201cstating the obvious, which is often what you get from a central banker\u201d, is particularly appropriate today, the governor adds smilingly. On cybercrime, Carney says the Bank is setting out the framework that will be needed to protect the UK financial system from computer attacks. On Brexit, Carney says the Bank is making contingency plans for all possible outcomes, and concentrating on those would have the greatest impact on the economy. That includes the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal (this is the \u2018cliff-edge Brexit\u2019 that many firms fear). Carney says that forcing banks to hold more capital (by raising the counter-cyclical buffer to 0.5% today, and probably to 1% in November) will more protection to losses. Mark Carney begins his press conference by saying that financial stability has been strengthened since the 2008 crisis. But the job of tackling financial dangers is \u201cnever done, and risks are evolving.\u201d The financial policy committee thinks that the overall risks from the domestic environment are at a \u201cstandard level\u201d, with most indicators neither \u201cparticularly elevated nor subdued\u201d. But there are some risks that require particular vigilance, he continues One is consumer credit \u2013 growth has \u201cfar outpaced\u201d household income in the last year, including credit cards and loans to buy new homes. And with the market competitive, lenders are vulnerable to a downturn. The second worry is Brexit \u2013 the range of possible outcomes as Britian leaves the EU, and the paths to them. Mark Carney is facing financial reporters at the Bank of England now, to explain the thinking behind today\u2019s financial stability report. You can watch it live here: Google has been handed a record \u20ac2.42bn fine by Brussels over alleged abuse of its market dominance. It was a much bigger than expected fine, with most predicting a penalty in the region of \u20ac1bn. EU antitrust officials have accused the search engine giant of illegally favouring its shopping service. It is the biggest fine for a single company in an EU antitrust case, and follows a seven-year investigation. European commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing. But Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation. More soon... And here is the background: City experts are trawling through the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group has spotted a chart showing how consumer credit losses rise when unemployment increases. No wonder the Bank is forcing lenders to stash more capital in their vaults now, in case an economic downturn forces more consumers to default on their loans. Alistair McQueen of Aviva points to another chart, showing how a drop in house prices can ripple through the system, triggering \u2018fire sales\u2019 and further losses. Steve Hawkes of The Sun has a pithy summary: The BoE\u2019s financial stability report is online here. Here\u2019s an infographic form the Bank, setting the scene: The Bank of England is also boosting its work on cybercrime and continuing its work on Brexit\u2019s impact. That\u2019s on top of ordering UK banks to set aside more capital, and rushing forwards its consumer stress tests. Here are the five key points from the financial stability report. The Bank of England is.... \u2022 Increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5%, from 0%. Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting. \u2022 Bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank\u2019s 2017 annual stress test. This will inform the FPC\u2019s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending. The FPC further supports the intentions of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market. \u2022 Clarifying its existing insurance measures in the mortgage market, designed to prevent excessive growth in the number of highly indebted households. This will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments. \u2022 Consistent with its previous commitment, restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard to the level it delivered in July 2016 before the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure. The FPC intends to set the minimum leverage requirement at 3.25% of non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation. \u2022 Overseeing contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union. \u2022 Building on the programme of cyber resilience testing it instigated in 2013, by setting out the essential elements of the regulatory framework for maintaining cyber resilience. It will now monitor that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant UK authorities. Another important point: the Bank of England is also bringing forwards its planned stress test on consumer credit lending to September, from November. That test will assess whether UK banks can handle a jump in consumer credit losses. Today\u2019s change means that UK banks will have to set aside more than \u00a311bn of extra capital to cover potential losses if the economy weakens: From the BoE, my colleague Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to force banks to hold more capital in the face of rapid growth in lending on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. The intervention by Threadneedle Street, which could amount to banks needing \u00a311.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months, is one of a number of measures intended to protect the financial system from the growth in consumer finance. Here we go! The Bank of England has told Britain\u2019s banks to start setting aside more capital to protect themselves from a financial downturn. That\u2019s one of the key lines from the Financial Stability Report. As predicted, the BoE is raising the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB), so that banks must set aside 0.5% of their assets as capital in case of a rainy day. That means it is reversing one of measures taken after the Brexit vote, a year ago. Interestingly, the BoE says it expecs to raise CCyB again, in November, to 1%. More to follow.... Tension is building in the City as traders wait for the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report to hit the wires, in just five minutes. The rise in the euro has pushed Europe\u2019s stock markets down. Ever index is now in the red, with the Stoxx 600 losing 0.6%. A stronger euro isn\u2019t great news for eurozone exporters, of course. But the key point is that Draghi is being optimistic -- that\u2019s no reason to dump shares. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says traders shouldn\u2019t be too skittish: Draghi suggested inflation is becoming more sustainable and deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary forces. Importantly he suggests deflationary forces are external, temporary shocks and the ECB can overlook. That\u2019s what happens when you open the taps on a massive stimulus programme. The question is whether the Eurozone would survive without the QE support. Draghi sounded more circumspect on that front, arguing that he is confident that monetary policy is working but still needs to remain very loose. Again it\u2019s a stretch to describe it as hawkish \u2013 Draghi is simply affirming that loose monetary policy is working without significant adverse consequences and therefore should be maintained. He\u2019s not advocating tightening any time soon. The European commission just dropped a loud hint that the Google antitrust fine is coming this morning.... This tweet is from EC press officer Yizhou Ren: Mario Draghi\u2019s bullish talk has also sent the pound down against the euro, shedding 0.4% to \u20ac1.133. That means one euro buys 88.2p, up from 87.9p on Monday. Good news for eurozone holidaymakers heading to the UK this summer, but a blow to Britons planning a continental jaunt. Here\u2019s Reuters take on Draghi\u2019s speech: The euro zone still needs \u201cconsiderable\u201d monetary support from the European CentralBank even as its economy recovers steadily and inflation picks up, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday. \u201cAll the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area. Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones,\u201d Draghi said at the ECB\u2019s annual policy forum in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cHowever, a considerable degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation dynamics to become durable and self-sustaining.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart showing how the euro spiked as Draghi spoke in Portugal: Oooh. The euro is rallying as Mario Draghi tells the ECB Forum that reflationary pressures in the eurozone are building, as the economy recovers. The single currency has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.1235, with Draghi sounding more upbeat and hawkish than expected. Draghi has also told his audience that \u201ca considerable degree\u201d of stimulus is still needed in the eurozone, and that the ECB must be \u2018prudent\u2019 in how it unwinds it. Draghi has previously talked about a \u2018substantial degree\u2019 of help being needed, and Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group in the Netherlands, thinks this wording is significant. Not for the first (or last) time, Mario Draghi\u2019s message is that his policies are delivering the goods.... Over in Sintra, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving the keynote speech at the ECB\u2019s Forum now. It\u2019s being streamed here. Draghi says there are clear signs of a \u201cstrengthening and broadening\u201d recovery underway in the eurozone area. There have been 16 straight quarters of growth in the euro area, he says. But this nascent growth needs to become sustainable, and that means higher productivity growth. Central bankers face an unusual challenge today, Draghi continues \u2013 they face growth that is \u201cabove trend and well distributed across the euro area\u201d. But at the same time, inflation is more muted than you\u2019d expect. To decide the right approach (ie, when to cut the ECB\u2019s stimulus package), you need to understand the causes, Draghi cautions. And Draghi\u2019s assessment is that monetary policy is working to build up reflationary pressures. But it\u2019s being slowed by external price shocks, slack in the labour market, and a change in how the labour market and inflation interact, he concludes. The FT\u2019s Chris Giles has pulled together a list of key issues to watch for today, when the Bank of England releases its twice-yearly report on financial stability. Here\u2019s a flavour: Will the BoE remove its emergency support for banks? It could raise its \u201ccounter-cyclical capital buffer\u201d, to force banks to hold more capital. A year ago, after the EU referendum, the BoE reduced this buffer to zero, but it may now conclude that this emergency help is no longer needed. Will it try to curb consumer borrowing? The FPC may tell banks to cut back on \u201cteaser\u201d interest rates, to prevent a surge in defaults. Is car finance out of control? UK car sales have been strong for many months, thanks to cheap credit and new \u201cpersonal contract payment\u201d deals that make it easier to buy a new vehicle. Is the mortgage market a worry? A housing crash would have very serious consequences for the economy, so investors will want to hear Carney\u2019s views Brexit blues? With negotiations with Brussels finally underway, will the Bank say anything about the risks of a drop in confidence in UK assets? More here. UK consumer confidence has plunged since June\u2019s general election, as the shock of a hung parliament hits households. It gives the Bank of England a fresh headache as it considers the health of the UK economy, ahead of today\u2019s Financial Stability Report. Pollsters at YouGov found that UK citizens are fretting about political uncertainty, rising inflation, falling real wages, and the state of the housing market. YouGov found there was a \u201cpronounced collapse in consumer confidence following the election\u201d. The sight of Theresa May losing her majority sent its consumer morale index sliding to 105.2 from 109.1. For June as a whole, consumer confidence dropped to 106.9, its second-lowest level since the summer of 2013. Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov, says that the UK housing slowdown is causing particular alarm (Nationwide says prices have fallen for the last three months) \u201cThe hung parliament seems to have further dampened consumers\u2019 spirits, which were already sinking following the continued squeeze on household finances. \u201cBut the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re facing central bank overload today, with monetary policy chiefs speaking in London, and the Portuguese town of Sintra. All eyes will be on the Bank of England, as its powerful Financial Policy Committee releases its latest report followed by a press conference with Governor Mark Carney. The FPC, which is charged with maintaining financial stability, could order banks to rein in their riskier lending, following growing fears that consumer borrowing is getting out of hand. The Bank could also tell City banks to start restocking their capital buffers, having previously told banks to lend more after the Brexit vote. Meanwhile in sunny (ish) Sintra, the European Central Bank is holding its annual forum. We\u2019ll be hearing from Mario Draghi, ECB president, who last night told students in Portugal that his massive stimulus scheme was creating employment. Challenged over the Bank\u2019s huge money-printing programme, Draghi declared that: \u201cThe millennials that found a job because of our policy, I\u2019m pretty sure they are okay\u201d [with the ECB\u2019s policies] . And he also denied that savers had been unfairly treated, arguing that they\u2019re also benefitting from the recovery, as: \u201cRecessions are not good for anybody, savers or non-savers, It could be a busy morning, as there\u2019s a strong chance that Google will be hit with a whopping fine this morning, of over \u20ac1bn, for breaching Europe\u2019s competition rules. That would end a long inquiry into whether Google used its dominant search engine to unfairly promote its Google Shopping service, but could spark an angry response from America. And then tonight, the world\u2019s most powerful central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking at London\u2019s Royal Academy. We\u2019re promised a \u201cwide-ranging discussion about global economic issues.\u201d On the corporate front, retail group Debenhams and car hire chain Northgate are reporting results, plus there are retail sales figures in the UK and consumer confidence stats from America to keep us on our toes. The agenda 9am BST: Mario Draghi gives keynote speech at the ECB Forum in Sintra 10.30am BST: Bank of England releases financial stability report 11am BST: BoE governor Mark Carney\u2019s press conference 11am BST: CBI\u2019s UK retail sales figures 3pm: US consumer confidence report 6pm: Janet Yellen gives the British Academy \u2018President\u2019s Lecture\u2019",

      "bodyText": "Ocado has sent a self-driving truck trundling through the backstreets of Woolwich, south-east London, as part of the UK\u2019s first trial of autonomous grocery deliveries. The small vehicle, developed by Oxford-based Oxbotica, is spending 10 days delivering food and snacks to Ocado customers who live in the area, to test Ocado\u2019s plans for its \u201cSmart Platform\u201d \u2013 a plug-and-play online shopping business that it wants to sell to grocery retailers around the world who hope to compete with the likes of Amazon and Walmart. The trial is the latest evolution of Greenwich\u2019s GATEway project, which initially involved Oxbotica\u2019s autonomous driving technology being tested with small passenger vehicles on the borough\u2019s waterfront near the former Millennium Dome. Unlike Ocado\u2019s current vans, which can store 80 grocery boxes \u2013 enough for 20 or more deliveries \u2013 and are staffed by a driver who delivers the groceries to customers\u2019 doors and kitchens, the \u201cCargoPod\u201d only holds eight boxes, and requires recipients to leave the house to pick up their shopping themselves. But it is designed for a different market, according to David Sharp, who is in charge of the company\u2019s advanced research projects department. He likens it to the difference between self-checkouts and staffed tills at a supermarket: it may not be quite as convenient, but it\u2019s quicker, cheaper, and possible to scale up much more quickly. While the van navigated flawlessly through the wide, largely car-free streets of Woolwich Arsenal, it still had to be accompanied by two human supervisors, who sat in its front two seats: one, from Oxbotica, to take charge if the automation systems made a mistake; and a second, from Ocado, to guide customers through the process of picking up their delivery. The customer is notified when the CargoPod is loaded up, from a \u201cmobile warehouse\u201d located around a mile from their home, and then again once it has reached their front door. They then press a button to unlock their box and collect their shopping bag. Both Ocado and Oxbotica hope the system will be ready for commercial launch by 2019. If successful, the Ocado Smart Platform could prove crucial for the company, which was founded in April 2000 and has grown to a valuation of almost \u00a32bn. It faces competition not only from established supermarkets in the UK, but also from US retail titan Amazon, which launched its own grocery delivery service in the UK in June 2016. This month, Amazon expanded its grocery portfolio by buying organic foods chain Whole Foods for $13.7bn (\u00a310.7bn). Ocado hopes that its Smart Platform offering, which lets other retailers outsource their online sales, will be key to beating the Seattle-based firm. For partnering retailers, it offers an end-to-end integrated service, starting with a white-label app, and placing Ocado technology in their warehouses, shops and delivery vehicles. This month, the company announced its first customer for the platform, a European retailer that requested anonymity \u201cto retain competitive advantage\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s first floating windfarm has taken to the seas in a sign that a technology once confined to research and development drawing boards is finally ready to unlock expanses of ocean for generating renewable power. After two turbines were floated this week, five now bob gently in the deep waters of a fjord on the western coast of Norway ready to be tugged across the North Sea to their final destination off north-east Scotland. The \u00a3200m Hywind project is unusual not just because of the pioneering technology involved, which uses a 78-metre-tall underwater ballast and three mooring lines that will be attached to the seabed to keep the turbines upright. It is also notable because the developer is not a renewable energy firm but Norway\u2019s Statoil, which is looking to diversify away from carbon-based fuels. Irene Rummelhoff, head of the oil firm\u2019s low-carbon division, said the technology opened up an enormous new resource of wind power. \u201cIt\u2019s almost unlimited. Currently we are saying [floating windfarms will work in] water depths of between 100 and 700 metres, but I think we can go deeper than that. It opens up ocean that was unavailable,\u201d she said. Offshore windfarms are springing up across the North Sea for a reason \u2013 its waters are uniquely shallow enough to allow turbines to be mounted atop steel poles fixed to the seabed. However, such fixed-bottom turbines can only be installed at water depths down to 40 metres, making them little use for the steeply shelved coastlines of the US west coast or Japan. \u201cIf you look at coastlines around the world, there\u2019s few that have sufficient area at depths down to 40 metres so if they want to deploy offshore wind, they need to introduce floating wind,\u201d said Rummelhoff. As well as opening up new frontiers such as the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, floating windfarms could be placed farther out to sea to avoid the sort of aesthetic objections that scuppered a \u00a33.5b windfarm off the Dorset coast. While Hywind is a minnow among modern offshore wind projects \u2013 it will power just 20,000 homes compared with the 800,000 by one being built off the Yorkshire coast \u2013 proponents say floating turbines could eclipse fixed-bottom ones in the long run. \u201cLooking to the next decades, there might be a point where floating is bigger than fixed based,\u201d said Stephan Barth of IEA Wind, an intergovernmental wind power body covering 21 countries. Bruno Geschier, chief marketing officer at Ideol, a French company hoping to build floating windfarms in Japan, France and elsewhere, said he expected floating farms to begin to take off in the next decade, \u201creaching cruising altitude in the mid-2020s and a big boom in 2030-35\u201d. The commercialisation also means a chance for new countries to emerge as renewable energy leaders. The UK has the most offshore wind capacity in the world, with Germany not far behind, but France, which has none, wants to become a market leader. \u201cFloating wind is an opportunity for France to step on to the podium,\u201d said Geschier. For Statoil, the ambitions go well beyond Peterhead in Scotland, where Hywind will be moored and providing power from October at the latest. Rummelhoff said floating windfarms will come of age in the areas where conventional ones have been established, as countries such as the UK run out of suitable sites in shallower waters. But it is also talking with state governments in Hawaii and California about projects, and eyeing Japan and the new, pro-renewables government in Seoul. Like many new technologies, the biggest challenge will be cost. Behind the turbines at the deepwater port of Stord in Norway sits a huge lifting vessel usually used in the oil and gas industry. It is the second biggest of its kind, very expensive to hire \u2013 and, for now, essential in the process of lifting the turbines off the quayside and floating them. The first-of-a-kind nature means supply chain complexity, too. \u201cWe have 15 main contractors. For the future we cannot have 15, we can have between 5 and 10,\u201d said Leif Delp, project manager for Hywind. Statoil said floating wind would be the same cost as conventional offshore windfarms by 2030, while IEA said the cost today was the same as fixed-bottom ones a decade ago. Experts have said a conventional offshore windfarm with the capacity of Hywind would be less than half the cost. A generous subsidy deal from the Scottish government made the project viable. \u201cTechnically, everything is possible. It\u2019s just the price tag that comes with it,\u201d said Barth.",

    "webTitle": "Google fined record \u20ac2.4bn by EU over search engine results", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Union has handed Google a record-breaking \u20ac2.42bn (\u00a32.14bn) fine for abusing its dominance of the search engine market in building its online shopping service, in a dramatic decision that has far-reaching implications for the company. By artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches, Google denied both its consumers real choice and rival firms the ability to compete on a level playing field, European regulators said. The Silicon Valley giant has 90 days to stop its illegal activities and explain how it will reform its ways or face fines of up to \u20ac10.6m a day, which equates to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of its parent company Alphabet. On the back of the finding that Google is the dominant player in the European search engine market, the EU regulator is further investigating how else the company may have abused its position, specifically in its provision of maps, images and information on local services. The commission\u2019s decision, following a seven-year probe into Google\u2019s dominance in searches and smartphones, suggests the company may need to fundamentally rethink the way it operates. It is also now liable to face civil actions for damages by any person or business affected by its anti-competitive behaviour. As the EU official in charge of competition policy, commissioner Margrethe Vestager, spelled out the case against Google, she denied accusations that Brussels had a bias against US firms, claiming the tech giant had been guilty of an \u201cold school\u201d form of illegality. \u201cGoogle has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Vestager told reporters, as she announced the fine, the largest ever made in an antitrust case. \u201cBut Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. \u201cInstead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d In the wake of the announcement, shares in Alphabet fell 1.5% in pre-market trading in New York. Vestager brushed off suggestions that the move could harm transatlantic relations, adding that the EU was not willing to give Google a \u201cfree pass\u201d. She confirmed, however, that the EU regulator had stopped cooperating with the US Federal Trade Commission when it decided not to pursue charges in 2013. Google immediately rejected the commission\u2019s findings, and signalled its intention to appeal, in an indication of the gruelling legal battle to come between the two sides. A company spokesman said: \u201cWhen you shop online, you want to find the products you\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. \u201cThat\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\u201d Vestager told reporters that Google had entered the shopping comparison market in 2004 with a service called Froogle which allowed its users to compare products and prices online. Within two years the company knew it was struggling, she said. One internal document from 2006 discovered during the investigation stated: \u201cFroogle simply doesn\u2019t work.\u201d From 2008, Vestager said, Google began to implement, initially in the UK and Germany, and then further afield, a fundamental change in strategy to push its comparison shopping service, and break EU law. According to an analysis of around 1.7bn search queries, Google\u2019s search algorithm systematically was consistently giving prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service to the detriment of rival services. The placement of Google\u2019s product well ahead of its rivals was pivotal to the shopping service\u2019s success as, even on a desktop, the 10 highest-ranking generic search results on page one generally receive approximately 95% of all clicks on generic search results. The top result receives about 35% of all the clicks and the trend is exaggerated further for searches on mobile phones. The commission found that Google was dominant in general internet search markets in all 31 countries in the European Economic Area, with a market share of about 90%. As a result of Google\u2019s illegal practices, traffic to Google\u2019s comparison shopping service increased significantly \u2013 45-fold in the UK, for example \u2013 while rivals suffered very substantial losses of traffic on a lasting basis, Vestager said. The commission found specific evidence of sudden drops of traffic to certain rival websites of 85% in the UK, up to 92% in Germany and 80% in France. Some competitors have adapted and managed to recover some traffic but never in full, Vestager said. The commission\u2019s fine of \u20ac2,424,495,000 was said to take into account the \u201cduration and gravity of the infringement\u201d, and was based on Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 countries where the illegality occured. If Google fails to comply with the commission\u2019s decision, it would be liable for non-compliance payments of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, which boasted of a turnover of \u20ac80bn last year. Any payment would be backdated to when the non-compliance started, Vestager said. The commission has already come to the preliminary conclusion that Google has abused a dominant position in two other cases, which are still being investigated. The first cases involve the Android operating system, where the commission is concerned that Google has \u201cstifled choice and innovation\u201d in a range of mobile apps and services by \u201cpursuing an overall strategy on mobile devices to protect and expand its dominant position in general internet search\u201d. In a second investigation into AdSense, a Google service that allows websites to run targeted ads, the commission is concerned that Google has reduced choice by preventing sites from sourcing search ads from competitors. European Commission fines: a history Apple, \u20ac13bn (2016): The tech company behind the iPhone was ordered to pay a huge sum in back taxes to Ireland after the commission ruled that the company\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid. MAN, Volvo/Renault, Daimler, Iveco, and DAF, \u20ac2.9bn (2016): A group of truckmakers were handed a record fine for colluding to fix prices over a 14-year period. Microsoft, \u20ac1.2bn (2004, 2006, 2008): Microsoft was found guilty of failing to provide code to allow rivals to hook into its Windows server software at a reasonable price. The company\u2019s failure to comply with the commission\u2019s findings led to two additional fines in 2006 and 2008 on top of the initial 2004 order to pay \u20ac497m. Intel, \u20ac1.1bn (2009): The US chipmaker was ordered to pay a fine of more than \u20ac1bn for anticompetitive practices after being found to have given price discounts to computer manufacturers Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC if they bought its chips. Facebook, \u20ac110m (2017): The social media giant was fined for providing incorrect or misleading information during the commission\u2019s 2014 investigation into Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp.",

It is also now liable to face civil actions for damages by any person or business affected by its anti-competitive behaviour.</p> <p>As<strong> </strong>the EU official in charge of competition policy, commissioner Margrethe Vestager<strong>, </strong>spelled out the case against Google, she denied accusations that Brussels had a bias against US firms, claiming the tech giant had been guilty of an \u201cold school\u201d form of illegality.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Vestager told reporters, as she announced the fine, the largest ever made in an antitrust case. \u201cBut Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the announcement, shares in Alphabet fell 1.5% in pre-market trading in New York. Vestager brushed off suggestions that the move could harm transatlantic relations, adding that the EU was not willing to give Google a \u201cfree pass\u201d. </p> <p>She confirmed, however, that the EU regulator had stopped cooperating with the US Federal Trade Commission when it decided not to pursue charges in 2013.</p> <p>Google immediately rejected the commission\u2019s findings, and signalled its intention to appeal, in an indication of the gruelling legal battle to come between the two sides. A company spokesman said: \u201cWhen you shop online, you want to find the products you\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both. </p> <p>\u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today.

      "bodyText": "The owner of the Net-a-Porter luxury fashion website is to hire at least 100 more IT experts over the next two years as it shrugs off the impact of the Brexit vote to open a tech hub in the UK. Designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, the architect behind the Eden Project domes in Cornwall, the hub, in west London\u2019s White City, can house up to 650 IT experts. That is an increase from the 500 employed in the UK at present. The new building brings together the British teams from Yoox, the Italian luxury sales site, and Net-a-Porter, the group founded by Natalie Massenet with which it merged in 2015. Yoox Net-a-Porter, the Milan-listed parent group, plans to invest more than \u20ac500m (\u00a3440m) in technology, warehouses and delivery systems in London and elsewhere to double the size of the business by 2020. With a turnover of nearly \u20ac2bn, about half from orders made via mobile phones, YNAP is the world\u2019s biggest online luxury fashion retailer. Shares in the group jumped more than 8% on Monday amid rumours that Alibaba, the giant Chinese internet marketplace, was considering buying a stake. China has been an important source of growth for luxury retailers, and a tie-up with Alibaba would help YNAP compete against rival Farfetch, which recently teamed up with another big Chinese online group, JD.com. YNAP faces competition from Farfetch, Germany\u2019s Mytheresa and luxury brands wanting to sell directly, but it is also riding on a wave of changing shopping habits. Online luxury sales are expected to double as a proportion of the market to 14% within five years. Federico Marchetti, founder and chief executive of YNAP, told the Guardian he was disappointed that he did not have a chance to work with Massenet \u2013 now non-executive co-chair at Farfetch \u2013 and had been \u201ccaught by surprise\u201d when she left the business just before the merger. But he was proud that Net-a-Porter had been able to bring in new brands including Prada and Cartier, despite having to cope without Massenet\u2019s legendary contacts book. He said the two companies had merged their different cultures well and had shown they were able to sell $130,000 (\u00a3100,000)-plus watches via Whatsapp or a \u00a335,000 Valentino dress via a mobile phone. \u201cThis is the first example of the luxury industry making such a big investment in tech. We have 1,000 engineers in London and Bologna. That\u2019s something that no luxury brand in the world can have. We are the perfect merger of luxury and tech, that\u2019s why we are serving the brands so well.\u201d He said it was not clear how Brexit would affect the business but the group was able to offset risk by having two centres, in Bologna and London. \u201cWe have got two strong legs \u2013 in continental Europe and London. Better to have two legs than one, that puts us at a competitive advantage.\u201d He said groups without a London base might find it harder to enter the UK market post-Brexit. YNAP\u2019s new tech hub try to develop artificial intelligence that can help Net-a-Porter\u2019s personal shoppers provide more tempting ideas for its high-spending clients and develop the next wave of tech for shoppers using their smartphones. They are also dabbling with an augmented reality service that allows shoppers to \u201ctry on\u201d handbags, sunglasses or jewellery. But he said the team was not prioritising finding ways for shoppers to try on outfits virtually. Marchetti believes his shoppers prefer services that allow them to physically try on and return items easily \u2013 such as the \u201cYou Try, We Wait\u201d service it trialled in London and China that is due for a full launch in the UK capital in September. The special service for Net-a-Porter\u2019s highest spending shoppers involves uniformed \u201cbutlers\u201d delivering a selection of clothes and waiting for a customer to try them on before returning any unwanted items. A service in which personal shoppers provide advice at the home of top shoppers, referred to as EIPs \u2013 \u201cextremely important persons\u201d \u2013 will also launch in London this year. Such shoppers make up just 2% of Net-a-Porter and its menswear offshoot Mr Porter\u2019s clientele but 40% of sales and so serving them well can generate big returns. He is also on a mission to hire female IT experts. At present 61% of YNAP\u2019s staff are women but that proportion slips to 28% in its tech team. After experiencing difficulties in recruiting more female IT professionals, YNAP has teamed up with Imperial College London to boost digital skills among local children, particularly girls. More than 700 children will have the opportunity to attend the free weekly classes taught by students from Imperial\u2019s department of computing. Marchetti hopes the scheme will be an investment in the future of technology. \u201cOver the past 17 years we have expanded by always thinking about our customers. The easiest way to do it is if employees of the company mirror the customers. More than 60% of our customers are women and I think it is important that employees are women as they understand better the needs of other women.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Consumer confidence slumped in the 12 days after the general election to its lowest level since the aftermath of last year\u2019s Brexit vote, as households were unnerved by the impact of a hung parliament. A poll by YouGov found that consumers feared the unstable political situation would hit house prices and dent their living standards, which have already come under pressure in recent months from high inflation and sluggish wages growth. The consumer confidence index showed a \u201cpronounced collapse in consumer confidence following the election\u201d after it fell from 109.1 in the week before the vote to 105.2 in the period immediately after it. For June as a whole, consumer confidence dropped to 106.9, its second-lowest level since the summer of 2013. YouGov said the steep fall was almost as severe as the dive in consumer confidence that followed the Brexit vote, when it plummeted from 111.9 in the weeks before the referendum to 104.3 in the days after it. Soon afterwards the Bank of England to cut the base interest rate to its lowest ever level of 0.25% and the government signalled a relaxation of its plans for further cuts to public spending. Since last August, when confidence surveys recovered some lost ground, the index, which was carried out for the economic consultancy CEBR, has tracked lower, largely in response to uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations. Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov, said: \u201cConsumer confidence has been generally ticking downward since last autumn but the events of the past month have placed it under greater pressure. \u201cThe hung parliament seems to have further dampened consumers\u2019 spirits, which were already sinking following the continued squeeze on household finances. \u201cBut the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years,\u201d he added. Inflation hit its highest level for nearly four years in May at 2.9%, tightening the squeeze on consumers already struggling due to low wage growth, which is averaging 2% to 2.5%. YouGov said that although a score over 100 shows more consumers are confident than not, the index has yet to get back to its level before last June\u2019s referendum. Douglas McWilliams, the deputy chairman at the CEBR, said: \u201cIt looks as though the indecisive result of the election has seriously affected economic prospects already dampened by Brexit uncertainty. \u201cThe data shows a sharp drop in consumers\u2019 confidence about their own financial situation and even more so about house prices. This will affect spending in the high street, in shopping centres and online.\u201d McWilliams added that business confidence is also likely to have dropped, with the country to be spared a recession by strong international trade. However, YouGov said the data suggested that the job security and business activity measures, both for the last 30 days and the next 12 months, were proving relatively resilient. A report by the British Bankers\u2019 Association showed consumer spending using loans and credit cards eased back last month as shoppers to rein in their spending. Consumer credit growth was 5.1% in May, compared with 6.4% in the previous month. Mortgage approvals also fell 3.3% in May as the housing market suffered the effects of the election uncertainty and Brexit negotiations. At 40,347 in May, mortgage approvals were 9% below January\u2019s peak level of 44,327. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cStuttering housing market activity has recently been weighing down on house prices. May data from the Halifax showed annual house price inflation at a four-year low of 3.3% in the three months to May, while it was at a 35-month low of 2.1% on the Nationwide measure. \u201cThe fundamentals for house buyers could deteriorate further over the coming months with consumers\u2019 purchasing power squeezed even more by a combination of higher inflation and muted earnings growth. \u201cIt is also possible that the labour market will increasingly falter despite its current resilience. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by soft consumer confidence and reduced willingness to engage in major transactions,\u201d he added.",
