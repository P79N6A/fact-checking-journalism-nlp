      "bodyText": "Europe's sovereign debt crisis exploded back into life on Tuesday, with markets across the continent rocked by a wave of panic selling amid renewed fears about the impact of savage austerity measures in Spain and Italy. The mood of uneasy calm seen across Europe since the Greek bailout in February was shattered as financial markets took fright at evidence of a double-dip recession and growing popular opposition to welfare cuts and tax increases. Italy and Spain, the eurozone's third and fourth biggest economies, were at the centre of the market turmoil, with investors demanding an increasingly high premium for holding their bonds. \"Spain is right in the centre of a European storm,\" admitted finance minister Luis de Guindos, who declined to rule out an eventual bailout but insisted it could be avoided. In Italy, Mario Monti's coalition government is facing growing hostility to reforms of its labour market, while the sheer size of the country's public debt made it an obvious target for nervous traders. The prospect of Greek voters rejecting austerity and the French electorate denying Nicolas Sarkozy a second term as president was also weighing on the markets. The Greek government said it would hold a general election on 6 May, with opinion polls showing support for the mainstream pro-austerity parties is too weak to allow them to form a government. \"Spain is a big focus right now and even Greece will be coming back into the picture as it looks for another tranche of aid, so this eurozone debt tragedy is not going away, but seems to be getting worse,\" said Daniel Hwang, senior currency strategist at Forex.com in New York. Interest rates on 10-year Spanish bonds hit 6% for the first time since January, when Europe's leaders were battling to agree a bailout deal for Greece and secure the future of the eurozone. Shares in Madrid dropped by almost 3% to hit their lowest level since March 2009. In Italy, share prices slumped by 5% on rumours that the government was preparing to downgrade its growth forecasts, and trading in the shares of several of its banks was suspended after they fell sharply. Shares were also much lower on Wall Street, where the fallout from Europe exacerbated fears that the US recovery is petering out. Disappointment at last week's unemployment figures had already been weighing heavily on investor confidence. The markets closed in New York with Wall Street completing a fifth successive day of decline, with the Dow Jones having lost 213 points. In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 128 points, at 5,595.55. Oil prices also fell sharply amid concerns about the prospects for growth on both sides of the Atlantic and in Asia, with the price of a barrel of crude falling by more than $2. In contrast, safe haven assets such as gold, the US dollar and bonds in the US, Germany and Britain were all in demand. \"The market went up on a wave of liquidity-induced euphoria, and as usual overshot. Now the clever boys have decided to get out,\" said Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research. Europe's politicians had hoped that Greece's second bailout, and a battery of emergency measures unleashed by the European Central Bank, including its long-term \"repo\" operation, which offered cheap money to troubled banks, would draw a line under months of economic chaos. But Erik Britton, of City consultancy Fathom, said: \"The LTRO [long term refinancing operation] and all those things, all it's done is bought a bit of time, but it hasn't addressed the structural problems, even slightly, even for Greece.\" He predicted that the ECB could be forced to take fresh rescue measures in the next few weeks to prevent strains in Europe's banking sector from turning into a credit crunch, while in the longer term several more countries \u2013 including Spain and Italy \u2013 would eventually be forced to write off a proportion of their debts before the crisis is over. The euro came under pressure on the foreign exchange markets as the mood darkened on Tuesday, losing 0.2% against the dollar, to $1.3080, and more than 1% against the yen. David Song, Currency Analyst at DailyFX, said: \"The single currency is likely to face additional headwinds over the near term as the region continues to face a risk for a prolonged recession.\" Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, speaking in the country's senate, warned that his government must stick with its austerity plans, saying: \"There's no doubt that much of Spain's future is at stake and also economic growth and the creation of jobs over the coming years.\" But the central bank governor, Miguel \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, added to the mood of anxiety by warning that unless the economy improves, the country's struggling banks will need a new government bailout. Successive waves of austerity measures have already driven Spanish unemployment to 23%. Some 50% of young people are out of work. Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank, said: \"The Spanish government appears to be losing the battle to restore budgetary credibility while each additional austerity measure serves to feed the recessionary backdrop.\" In London, Barclays shares fell by 6% to 206p and were the second-biggest faller in the FTSE100 amid fears about its troubled Spanish operation. In February Barclays borrowed \u20ac6bn from the ECB's cheap loans scheme to pour into its Spanish operations. The fresh bout of turbulence comes as the world's finance ministers and central bank governors prepare to fly to Washington next week for the half-yearly meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Following the measures taken by the ECB, the fund had been hopeful that the talks would be less fraught than those last autumn, when Europe's leaders were told to get to grips with their problems. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, will almost certainly use the renewed crisis in the single currency zone to seek support for an increase in the fund's resources. But several countries, including the UK, have signalled that they would be reluctant to contribute significant new funds to the IMF unless they can be convinced eurozone leaders have done everything possible to tackle sovereign debt.",

      "bodyText": "Controversy surrounding the pay of the chief executive of Barclays, Bob Diamond \u2013 and his \u00a35.7m tax bill \u2013 intensified on Tuesday night when a leading group of shareholders were warned about problems with his remuneration package. The Association of British Insurers, whose members control around 15% of the stock market, issued an \"amber top\" warning over possible breaches of corporate governance codes. The move by the influential ABI follows a call by investor advisory body Pirc that Diamond should not receive a bonus on top of his \u00a31.3m salary, because of the underperformance of the bank. Some shareholders, such as Standard Life, Aviva and Scottish Widows, are already believed to be considering voting against the remuneration report. The ABI is understood to be highlighting two issues with Diamond's pay, which reached \u00a317m in 2011 when deals from previous years were cashed in. First, it points out that Diamond himself described the bank's performance in 2011 as \"unacceptable\" when it failed to reach targets for returns to shareholders. Second, the ABI highlights the bank's decision to pay \u00a35.7m to the exchequer on behalf of Diamond. The bank paid the tax bill as it was incurred when Diamond relocated from New York to London after his promotion to chief executive in January 2011. While the ABI's guidelines on pay state that companies \"should not seek to make changes to any element of executive remuneration to compensate participants for changes in their personal status\", the payment on behalf of Diamond is not thought to be in direct breach of this guideline, which was written amid fears that companies would try to compensate directors for any change in tax rates within the UK. Even so, shareholders admit to being surprised at the size of the tax bill. Guy Jubb, head of corporate governance at Standard Life, has said: \"I don't believe anyone had an inkling that this payment, which is almost the largest figure in the remuneration report, was going to surface.\" Diamond's contract, which was rewritten when he took the helm after more than 10 years running the Barclays Capital investment bank, states that the bank would pay his tax if he was being taxed twice \u2013 in the UK and in the US. The contract states: \"Barclays will consult with you in good faith and give consideration as to whether and in which ways Barclays can hold you harmless against any incremental tax liability incurred as a result of your return to the UK to perform your assignment.\" Diamond is not employed directly by Barclays, but via a subsidiary known as Gracechurch Services Corporation, which is incorporated in the US state of Delaware. The ABI also issued an amber alert on Barclays last year when one in 10 investors failed to support the remuneration report at an annual meeting, when private shareholders hit out against the pay deals. It is not yet clear what scale of protest will take place at this year's annual meeting on 27 April, although a protest on at least the same scale is expected. The scene has been set for a row since February, when the bank reported a 3% fall in profits to \u00a35.9bn, but conceded that the proportion of revenue used to pay investment bankers was unchanged on a year earlier. Barclays made clear it had been holding meetings with its shareholders over the pay deals and described the ABI report as \"carefully considered\". Barclays said: \"We note the concerns and questions that they have raised in their report\u2026 and look forward to continuing to work with them on those.\" A vote against the chair of the remuneration committee, Alison Carnwath, is also possible as Pirc has recommended voting against her re-election to the board. Pirc pointed to the fact that Barclays shares are trading below their net asset value, and also states that the bank should consider clawing back bonuses from executives because of the \u00a31bn provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling. Barclays shares were hit hard on Tuesday, falling 6% amid concerns about its exposure to Spain, while it also admitted that it might need to increase its provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling because of a surge in applications from customers seeking compensation.",

It alleges that \"certain contracts between [Rusal] and Glencore were entered into (or are to be entered into) in breach of the shareholder arrangements\".

      "bodyText": "A London court is to hear yet another case of feuding Russian oligarchs, with billionaires Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg heading to the UK to settle a disputed $47bn (\u00a329.6bn) aluminium supply deal involving the FTSE 100 trading group Glencore. UC Rusal, the world's biggest aluminium maker, confirmed on Tuesday that a dispute between Vekselberg, who quit as the company's chairman last month, and Deripaska, the main Rusal shareholder, is to go to arbitration in London. The case has been filed by Sual Partners, the investment firm of Vekselberg and his partner, Len Blavatnik, which owns 15.8% of Rusal. It alleges that \"certain contracts between [Rusal] and Glencore were entered into (or are to be entered into) in breach of the shareholder arrangements\". Sual's case names Rusal, Glencore, and Deripaska and his holding company, En+. The supply deal between Rusal and Glencore runs for six years and is believed to allow Glencore to market 50% of Rusal's output. Vekselberg claims he should have had a veto over the deal. Glencore holds an 8.75% stake in Rusal, while its chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, is a personal friend of Deripaska and sits on the Rusal board. The UK-listed company also confirmed the suit on Tuesday. The Rusal filing added: \"Sual seeks \u2026 injunctive relief against \u2026 [Rusal] preventing it from performing the contracts, rescission of the contracts, and damages against \u2026 the company.\" The clash over the supply deal is to be heard by the London court of international arbitration (LCIA), a dispute resolution forum provided for in the Rusal shareholders' agreement. Rusal added that it had \"engaged counsel to advise the company in the arbitration and will vigorously defend its position\" while stressing that it \"does not expect its involvement in the arbitration [to] have any material adverse impact on its operations\". Glencore made no comment on the case's possible impact. The case is the latest in a line of legal spats between Russian oligarchs that have headed to London, following last year's hearing of Boris Berezovsky's claims against Roman Abramovich, Arkady Gaydamak suing his former business partner Lev Leviev, and a further Deripaska dispute with another former business partner, Michael Cherney. Meanwhile, minority Rusal investors led by Vekselberg are already in dispute with Deripaska for his refusal to sell the company's stake in Arctic miner Norilsk Nickel, which has since tumbled in value. While not directly related to the feud over Norilsk Nickel, the latest legal action marks an escalation in Vekselberg's campaign against Deripaska, who is best known in the UK for his friendships with Lord Mandelson and financier Nat Rothschild. Meanwhile, the timing of the dispute is another unwelcome distraction for Glencore, which is about to start a roadshow to persuade Xstrata shareholders to sign up to its proposed \u00a323bn merger.",

      "body": "<p>Governments should step in to help struggling households write off part of their mortgages in the wake of a financial crisis to avoid the risk of a prolonged economic slump, according to new research by the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/index.htm\" title=\"\">chapter of the spring edition of its World Economic Outlook</a>, the rest of which will be published next week, the IMF's economists find that a rapid buildup of household debt during a boom leads to a deeper downturn when the bubble bursts.</p> <p>\"Housing busts preceded by larger run-ups in gross household debt are associated with deeper slumps, weaker recoveries, and more pronounced household deleveraging,\" they find.</p> <p>From Iceland to the US, Spain to the UK, a rapid increase in debt was a common characteristic across many economies in the years before 2007, as homeowners took advantage of low interest rates to borrow against the rocketing value of their properties.</p> <p>When house prices crashed, many borrowers inevitably found themselves in trouble and were forced to cut back sharply, contributing to the deep recessions that followed the financial crisis.</p> <p>But when they examined scores of historical property crashes, the IMF found that where consumers were battling with a heavy debt burden spending fell on average four times as fast as could be explained by the decline in house prices alone.</p> <p>\"The decline in economic activity is too large to be simply a reflection of a greater fall in house prices. And it is not driven by the occurrence of banking crises alone,\" they say. \"Rather, it is the combination of the house price decline and the pre-bust leverage that seems to explain the severity of the contraction.\"</p> <p>Because of this strong relationship between the debt burden before a crisis and consumer behaviour in the years afterwards, the IMF says governments should consider intervening to help households write off or restructure their mortgages.</p> <p>It details the case of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which was introduced by the Roosevelt government during the Great Depression.

      "bodyText": "Governments should step in to help struggling households write off part of their mortgages in the wake of a financial crisis to avoid the risk of a prolonged economic slump, according to new research by the International Monetary Fund. In a chapter of the spring edition of its World Economic Outlook, the rest of which will be published next week, the IMF's economists find that a rapid buildup of household debt during a boom leads to a deeper downturn when the bubble bursts. \"Housing busts preceded by larger run-ups in gross household debt are associated with deeper slumps, weaker recoveries, and more pronounced household deleveraging,\" they find. From Iceland to the US, Spain to the UK, a rapid increase in debt was a common characteristic across many economies in the years before 2007, as homeowners took advantage of low interest rates to borrow against the rocketing value of their properties. When house prices crashed, many borrowers inevitably found themselves in trouble and were forced to cut back sharply, contributing to the deep recessions that followed the financial crisis. But when they examined scores of historical property crashes, the IMF found that where consumers were battling with a heavy debt burden spending fell on average four times as fast as could be explained by the decline in house prices alone. \"The decline in economic activity is too large to be simply a reflection of a greater fall in house prices. And it is not driven by the occurrence of banking crises alone,\" they say. \"Rather, it is the combination of the house price decline and the pre-bust leverage that seems to explain the severity of the contraction.\" Because of this strong relationship between the debt burden before a crisis and consumer behaviour in the years afterwards, the IMF says governments should consider intervening to help households write off or restructure their mortgages. It details the case of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which was introduced by the Roosevelt government during the Great Depression. The HOLC bought 1m distressed mortgages from troubled banks and used the government's firepower to bring down the costs for homeowners \u2013 for example by extending the term of the loan. Just a fifth of the mortgages eventually ended in default \u2013 800,000 were paid back. The IMF suggests recent efforts by the White House to reduce foreclosures have been disappointing by comparison. The report also praises Iceland's recent efforts to deal with the impossible household debts run up during the housing boom, which included a temporary moratorium on repossessions and a government-backed scheme to allow struggling borrowers to reschedule their payments. \"Bold and well-designed household debt restructuring programmes, such as those implemented in the United States in the 1930s and in Iceland today, can significantly reduce the number of household defaults and disclosures. In so doing, these programmes help prevent self-reinforcing cycles of declining house prices and lower aggregate demand.\" The IMF's findings offer fresh support to a warning issued recently by consultancy McKinsey, which suggested that the UK faces a tough struggle to restore growth, because the total debt burden has barely budged since before the crisis. McKinsey said total debt, including borrowing by companies and the government, as well as households, now exceeds 500% of GDP, barely below the level in Japan, and suggested it would take until 2020 for these legacy debts to be dealt with. However, other analysts, including Ben Broadbent of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, have argued that the legacy of debt left over from the boom years should not hold back economic recovery, because it was largely backed by increases in the value of assets such as property. House prices have so far fallen less sharply in the UK than in many other countries.",

      "bodyText": "Has George Osborne turned into Claude Rains? I only ask because the notion that the chancellor is shocked by the tax avoidance of the rich is about as convincing as Captain Renault's explanation for shutting down Rick's American bar in Casablanca. In one of the best scenes from the film, Rains says he is \"shocked, shocked\" to find gambling going on in the establishment, only to be handed his winnings by a member of Humphrey Bogart's staff. It comes as a revelation to Osborne, apparently, that wealthy people in the UK are exploiting loopholes so that they pay little or no tax at all. Some are using especially aggressive avoidance mechanisms that mean they are paying only 10% of their income in tax, half that paid by the average Briton. Incredible. Who would have imagined that people got up to such things? Osborne is not short of a few bob himself. He has plenty of prosperous friends and is supposed to know a thing or two about the UK economy. If he is genuinely surprised by the tax arrangements of the well-heeled in the UK, he has either been living in a cave for the past 20 years or is unfit for his current post. In truth, though, it beggars belief that the scales have fallen from his eyes since arriving at the Treasury. One of Britain's (few) areas of comparative advantage in the global economy is the ingenuity of the big accountancy firms in finding ways round the tax system. A few years back the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (NESTA) even identified aggressive tax planning as one of five examples of striking innovation. Tax avoidance is big business in the UK. We do a lot of it. We market our expertise abroad. When Francis Maude, Osborne's cabinet colleague, said at the weekend that the coalition wanted to turn the UK into a tax haven it was a political gaffe but an accurate assessment of the state of the nation. So stunned is Osborne by the horror stories uncovered by HM Revenue and Customs that he is now pledging action. We will see whether he really is prepared to take on the massed ranks of the UK accountancy industry, to target offshore tax havens and to arouse the ire of the donors who bankroll the Conservative party. Perhaps this is going to be the start of a beautiful friendship between a Conservative government and the taxpayer. But don't bank on a happy ending. This is not Hollywood.",

Some are using especially aggressive avoidance mechanisms that mean they are paying only 10% of their income in tax, half that paid by the average Briton. Incredible. Who would have imagined that people got up to such things?</p> <p>Osborne is not short of a few bob himself. He has plenty of prosperous friends and is supposed to know a thing or two about the UK economy. If he is genuinely surprised by the tax arrangements of the well-heeled in the UK, he has either been living in a cave for the past 20 years or is unfit for his current post.</p> <p>In truth, though, it beggars belief that the scales have fallen from his eyes since arriving at the Treasury. One of Britain's (few) areas of comparative advantage in the global economy is the ingenuity of the big accountancy firms in finding ways round the tax system. A few years back the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (NESTA) even identified aggressive tax planning as one of five examples of striking innovation. Tax avoidance is big business in the UK. We do a lot of it. We market our expertise abroad. When Francis Maude, Osborne's cabinet colleague, said at the weekend that the coalition wanted to turn the UK into a tax haven it was a political gaffe but an accurate assessment of the state of the nation.</p> <p>So stunned is Osborne by the horror stories uncovered by HM Revenue and Customs that he is now pledging action. We will see whether he really is prepared to take on the massed ranks of the UK accountancy industry, to target offshore tax havens and to arouse the ire of the donors who bankroll the Conservative party.</p> <p>Perhaps this is going to be the start of a beautiful friendship between a Conservative government and the taxpayer. But don't bank on a happy ending. This is not Hollywood.</p>",
