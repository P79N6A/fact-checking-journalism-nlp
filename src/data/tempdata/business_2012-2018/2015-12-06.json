      "bodyText": "The Grattan Institute has released a paper that argues an increase in the GST can be done in a way that ends up with the tax and welfare system more progressive than it currently is, while also raising an extra $7bn to $11bn a year even after compensation measures have been paid. But the report also highlights the fact that if the government wants to raise more revenue via the GST it won\u2019t be able to compensate everyone. One of the problems with the current GST debate is that the man most likely to introduce any changes \u2013 treasurer Scott Morrison \u2013 refuses to suggest the government has a revenue problem. The problem for those who realise such a problem exists is that better economic growth won\u2019t be enough to fill the revenue hole. If there is a revenue problem the only way to solve it is to raise more revenue \u2013 by increasing tax rates or reducing tax exemptions. The Grattan Institute\u2019s latest paper, A GST Reform Package, examines the impact of either raising the GST or broadening it. It finds that raising the GST to 15% would raise an extra $27bn a year, whereas keeping the rate at 10% but broadening it to include things such as food, education, health and child care would raise and extra $17bn a year. There are some good reasons for raising or broadening the GST. Firstly, as I noted recently, the GST is a pretty efficient tax \u2013 it doesn\u2019t hold back economic growth as much as other taxes. But as I also noted, we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the efficiency aspect \u2013 it\u2019s not that much more efficient than an income tax but it is one thing in the GST\u2019s favour. The other is that, unlike other OECD nations we do not raise much tax via the GST. Our rate of 10% is among the lowest, and as John Daley and Danielle Wood note in their paper, it applies to just \u201c47% of consumption, below the OECD average of 55%\u201d: The problem with it applying to less than half of what we spend our money on is that Australian\u2019s consumption habits have changed in the time the GST was introduced, and the change has been away from things that are charged GST: That means that over time the base of the GST is narrowing \u2013 meaning much like the old Wholesale Sales Tax which the GST replaced, a lot of consumption is being untaxed. The exemptions also reduce the efficiency of the tax. The GST is not as bad as the WST, which not only had many exemptions but it also had bizarrely set different rates \u2013 for example CDs were taxed at 22% but books were exempt from tax; wedding rings were exempt but engagement rings were taxed at 32%. The exemption of fresh food on the GST is not quite so odd, but it still does involve some oddities and complexities. The Grattan Institute estimates including GST-exempt food would add another $6.3bn to annual revenue, health-related expenditure would bring in $5.4bn , financial services another $4.5bn and educations costs another $3.6bn: Sounds great \u2013 more revenue for the government to spend on services, what\u2019s not to like? Well, as ever, the issue with a GST is that poorer people spend more of their incomes on items such as food than do wealthier people. The report\u2019s authors John Daley and Danielle Wood estimate households in the bottom 20% of incomes spend around 11% of their income on GST-exempt food, compared to 8.5% for median income households and just 6.8% for the wealthiest 20%: But the spending is not so weighted towards poorer households on education, child care, nor even health. The Grattan Institute estimates the share of household consumption going towards all GST-exempt food, health, education and child care is about 19% for the poorest households, but then around 16%-17% for the rest. But even still, either increasing the GST or broadening it will make households worse off. And because overall the tax burden would have increased more on the poorer households, it\u2019s clear that shifting the tax mix to the GST makes the overall system more regressive unless there is compensation. The problem, as Daley and Wood note, is that you can\u2019t just cut income tax rates because many of the poorest don\u2019t earn a wage, but instead get most of their income via welfare payments: Daley and Wood propose spending around $9bn \u2013 or about 30% of what would be raised from increasing the GST to 15% \u2013 on increased welfare payments. They note that this would unavoidably involve giving money to higher income households as well due to the way welfare payments are tapered, but they suggest it would see the benefits overwhelmingly go to the poorest. They acknowledge the risk that such compensation will be eroded over time \u2013 especially in a political environment where welfare always seems to be under attack. To counter this they propose, for example, a substantial real increase in Newstart. They argue that \u201ceven if it were eroded over time, a large increase would leave most of those on Newstart substantially better off for some time\u201d. The package proposed would actually be more like the compensation package for the introduction of the carbon price rather than the original compensation given to households when the GST was introduced. Daley and Wood note that back in 2001 when the GST was introduced households in total were over-compensated to the order of $12bn, and the middle class benefitted the most, such that \u201cthe compensation package overall increased inequality\u201d. Crucially, under the compensation proposed by the Grattan Institute, not everyone would be better off \u2013 even among the lowest income households. Under their proposal, 67% of households in the poorest 20% would be fully compensated, and 45% in the second poorest 20%. All up, only 25% of all households would be fully compensated. That is a tough political sell. Daley and Wood thus also propose cutting income tax rates at the cost of $8bn for the second and third tax brackets. While the top two tax rates are proposed to remain the same, overall people in those brackets would pay less tax: The increase in welfare spending and the income tax cuts would see a greater number of households, if not fully compensated, at least compensated for three quarters of the GST increase: Under their proposal, 43% of households would be fully compensated and over half of those in the bottom 60% would be no worse off. That remains a tricky sell but it would leave the government with around $7bn (were the GST to be broadened) or $14bn if it were raised to 15%. Daley and Wood estimate that fully compensating everyone would cost over $30bn \u2013 ie more than the $27bn that would be raised by increasing the GST to 15%. Daley and Wood note that more may be required than just raising the GST and cutting taxes. They suggest more progressive measures \u201csuch as better targeting of superannuation tax concessions\u201d \u2013 which \u201cwould share the burden of tax reform more equally across the income distribution\u201d might help \u201cpublic faith in the fairness of the reforms\u201d. The paper shows the difficulties and perhaps opportunities of raising the GST. They propose a system that would see little to no reduction in the progressive nature of our tax and transfer system, but which will inevitably see many households paying more tax overall. Such is the nature of fixing a revenue hole \u2013 you can\u2019t increase tax, only to give it all away in compensation.",

      "bodyText": "Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, is facing controversy over its tax arrangements after it was reported that it had not paid UK corporation tax last year. An investigation by the Sunday Times found the company was wiping out Cadbury\u2019s bills using interest payments on an unsecured debt, which is listed as a bond on the Channel Islands\u2019 stock exchange. The interest paid on the loan can be offset as a loss against gains made elsewhere in the company. The arrangement, which is legal, meant Mondelez was able to pay no UK corporation tax despite accounts showing that Cadbury UK, its subsidiary, made profits of \u00a396.5m in 2014 and \u00a383.6m in 2013. Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Commons all-party group on responsible tax, told the Sunday Times: \u201cMultinationals like this are deliberately exporting their profits with artificial company structures to avoid tax. The founders of Cadbury who set it up as an ethical company will be turning in their graves.\u201d Mondelez was born out of Kraft Foods which bought Cadbury five years ago in a deal worth more than \u00a311bn. An FT report after the purchase claimed Cadbury had tax avoidance schemes in place when it was bought by the multinational, saying the chocolate-maker had a system of loans in place that allowed it to reduce its UK tax bill to just \u00a36.4m a year on a profit of \u00a3100m. A Mondelez spokesperson said: \u201cIn common with all global businesses, we pay corporation tax based on the laws of the countries in which we operate. \u201cWe comply with all applicable tax legislation in the UK, and on a global basis we pay hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate income tax annually. Since 2010 we are proud to have invested over \u00a3200m into both UK-based manufacturing and R&amp;D supporting our 4,500 employees in the UK. \u201cImportantly, independent academic research has also shown that as a business we are worth over \u00a31bn to the wider UK economy, illustrating our impact reaches far beyond the factory gates.\u201d A spokesperson for Mondelez said it had recently invested \u00a375m in four new lines at its Bournville site and that research showed that for every \u00a31 it spent in the UK, a further \u00a31.42 was generated in the UK economy. \u201cThis makes Mondelez worth over \u00a31bn to the UK economy and in the 2013-14 financial year our total contribution was \u00a31.86bn,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs a contributor to the UK economy, we are committed to investing in the UK as a strategic hub for our people and our business for the future.\u201d Soon after the takeover of Cadbury, Kraft announced it would close a plant in Bristol with the loss of 400 jobs, despite pledging before the deal that it would keep it open, and in January it announced that 250 jobs would be lost at its Bournville plant. Consumers have also been upset by changes in Cadbury\u2019s products since the deal went through. At the beginning of the year the company changed the chocolate in its Creme Eggs, which is no longer Dairy Milk, and reduced pack sizes from six to five. More recently it announced a switch from raisins to sultanas in some of its Fruit &amp; Nut bars.",

The founders of Cadbury who set it up as an ethical company will be turning in their graves.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/kraft-new-company-mondelez-international\">Mondelez was born out of Kraft Foods</a> which bought Cadbury five years ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/19/cadbury-board-agrees-kraft-sale\">in a deal worth more than \u00a311bn</a>. An <a href=\"http:// http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90b042b4-d4ff-11e2-b4d7-00144feab7de.html#axzz3tXokELE5\">FT report after the purchase claimed Cadbury had tax avoidance schemes</a> in place when it was bought by the multinational, saying the chocolate-maker had a system of loans in place that allowed it to reduce its UK tax bill to just \u00a36.4m a year on a profit of \u00a3100m.</p> <p>A Mondelez spokesperson said: \u201cIn common with all global businesses, we pay corporation tax based on the laws of the countries in which we operate. </p> <p>\u201cWe comply with all applicable tax legislation in the UK, and on a global basis we pay hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate income tax annually. Since 2010 we are proud to have invested over \u00a3200m into both UK-based manufacturing and R&amp;D supporting our 4,500 employees in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cImportantly, independent academic research has also shown that as a business we are worth over \u00a31bn to the wider UK economy, illustrating our impact reaches far beyond the factory gates.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Mondelez said it had recently invested \u00a375m in four new lines at its Bournville site and that research showed that for every \u00a31 it spent in the UK, a further \u00a31.42 was generated in the UK economy. </p> <p>\u201cThis makes Mondelez worth over \u00a31bn to the UK economy and in the 2013-14 financial year our total contribution was \u00a31.86bn,\u201d the spokesperson said. </p> <p>\u201cAs a contributor to the UK economy, we are committed to investing in the UK as a strategic hub for our people and our business for the future.\u201d<br></p> <p>Soon after the takeover of Cadbury, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/09/kraft-cadburys-takeover-mps\">Kraft announced it would close a plant in Bristol</a> with the loss of 400 jobs, despite pledging before the deal that it would keep it open, and in January it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/15/cadbury-cuts-250-jobs-birmingham\">announced that 250 jobs would be lost at its Bournville plant</a>. </p> <p>Consumers have also been upset by changes in Cadbury\u2019s products since the deal went through. At the beginning of the year the company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jan/12/-sp-the-cadburys-creme-egg-scandal-how-to-stage-a-chocolate-revolution\">changed the chocolate in its Creme Eggs</a>, which is no longer Dairy Milk, and reduced pack sizes from six to five.

      "bodyText": "More than half of the \u00a324bn expected to be spent on the first British nuclear reactors for two decades could go abroad to foreign suppliers, a leading UK academic and government adviser has warned. The issue is of extreme political sensitivity because George Osborne has already faced criticism for providing huge subsidies to Hinkley, which is being developed by EDF Energy of France. \u201cIt will be seriously tough for British manufacturers to meet the needs of EDF in line with the commitment that 60% of the value of the project will remain in this country,\u201d said Sir Keith Burnett, who is a member of the Council of Science and Technology reporting to the prime minister, David Cameron. Burnett, the vice-chancellor of Sheffield University, said that 40% of the total value of the work at Hinkley Point atomic plant would largely go to French firms. At least \u00a34bn worth of spending on items such as pipes and pumps \u2013 around 15% of the project by value \u2013 will be up for grabs for the UK but only if local companies can provide the higher specification supplies required by EDF. Burnett thinks that will be difficult to achieve. \u201cThe British government needs to continue with the help it is giving through the Innovate UK and other publicly funded organisations which help support supply companies. Without concentrated effort there are still going to be difficulties [for suppliers],\u201d he added. Burnett\u2019s concerns were echoed by Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. She said there was a potential shortage of skilled personnel and a lack of clarity over the exact timing of Hinkley and other energy infrastructure projects. \u201cThere is definitely a nervousness in the industry about whether companies coming into these jobs have the quality standards necessary. We do have the basic engineering skills but can we grow the specialist knowledge quick enough to meet the procurement process and timetable?\u201d Part of the problem is that small and medium-sized British firms have not had the opportunity to supply equipment to a new nuclear power station since Sizewell C in Suffolk was completed in 1995. The Hinkley Point C facility in Somerset is still awaiting the final investment decision from the largely state-owned EDF and its Chinese partners, although ground preparation is already under way. The basic earth moving, road construction and erection of buildings will be carried out by British contractors such as Balfour Beatty and Laing O\u2019Rourke but the high-end pressure vessels and turbines will be provided by the likes of Areva of France. It is the middle-end work which Burnett is worried about, with the added possibility that UK companies cannot take advantage of other planned UK nuclear projects by companies such as Hitachi of Japan. EDF insisted it was still confident that Britain would win more than \u00a314bn worth of contracts in line with its target, indicating particular confidence in those areas such as pumps and pipes highlighted by Burnett as a worry. \u201cWork to enable the British supply chain to compete for contracts means that more than 60% of the project by value will be spent in the UK. The project will strengthen British industry, jobs and skills with 25,000 job opportunities during its construction. \u201cNational, local and international supply chain events over the last six years have helped UK businesses understand the requirements necessary to join the project which will restart new nuclear construction in Britain after a 20-year pause. \u201cThis has resulted in the creation of joint ventures which could lead to further opportunities for participation in successive nuclear projects in the UK and globally.\u201d",

According to market analysts at NPD Group, sales of traditional British desserts are falling while those of chocolate brownies, muffins and croissants are rising. Sales of cakes, however, outstrip them all. \u201cWe have developed very American tastes when it comes to sweet items,\u201d said Muriel Illig, food service account manager at NPD. The trend, she said, had been driven by the rising popularity of coffee shops such as Starbucks and Costa, which serve American-style cookies, cakes and muffins alongside their hot drinks. The stores are benefiting from an increasing number of Britons buying their breakfast on the way to work, and eating at their desk at lunchtime. Traditional bakeries are losing out while supermarkets are taking steps to win back sales of sweet treats. The data shows sales of traditional desserts including puddings, scones and tea cakes sank by just over a quarter to 150m servings in the year to September, while chocolate brownie sales soared by 72% to 149m servings. Sales of American-style muffins have risen 27% to 143m servings, cookies are up 18% to 151m and croissants are up 21% to 155m. But by far the biggest seller is cake, sales of which have risen by nearly 10% to 406m servings, according to NPD. The analyst measures sales in restaurants, cafes and pubs as well as supermarkets, department stores and even forms of transport such as trains that sell \u201cfood to go\u201d. Mark Davies, food and commercial director at coffee shop chain Le Pain Quotidien, said: \u201cOur sales reflect these statistics, as there has been an increase of sales in our pastries, croissants and pain au chocolat in the last year. I believe this is true across the premium market, as more people look to purchase high quality food. \u201cI believe sales have increased because breakfast has become a real event \u2013 more and more people choose our continental pastries with their coffee for breakfast, whether it\u2019s to sit down and relax or to go.\u201d But the biggest sellers are supermarkets, which are trying to fight back against competition from fast food outlets and the fashion for home baking prompted by The Great British Bake Off by selling their own versions of the sweet snacks. \u201cIt is fair to say that they probably have taken inspiration from one another and they definitely have been influenced by the general baking trend in developing a more appetising sweet offering,\u201d Illig said. The rapid growth of discount chains Aldi and Lidl, for example, has been partly fuelled by installing in-store bakeries. Sainsbury\u2019s is testing out moving its bakery section right to the front of the store in its latest attempt to improve its fortunes. Traditional bakeries have not managed to get a fair slice of rising demand, however, according to NPD. While the total market grew 9.2% over the past five years, in terms of servings, business in bakery shops only increased by 2.5% over the same period. In the year to September, bakeries\u2019 sales of sweet desserts fell 3% while they rose nearly 9% in coffee shops. Clive Schlee, chief executive of the Pret a Manger chain, said coffee shops were benefiting from people using cafes and coffee shops more often throughout the day. But he said he had not noticed a big uptick in sales of cakes alongside coffees: \u201cThere is not a massive drive for a sugar rush,\u201d he said.",

A report by the chartered surveyors and forestry agents John Clegg &amp; Co said the current level of activity was 13 times the size of the market at the beginning of the millennium. There has been a smooth rise in the market since 2010 with a dip in 2014 caused by the uncertainty from the referendum on Scottish independence. The vote led to delays in the conclusion of a number of significant deals, many of which slipped into 2015, boosting the most recent figure. Scotland accounts for 77% of all UK commercial forestry transactions, with 2015 characterised by the number of high valudeals, with as many in the \u00a32m-\u00a35m range as in \u00a3100,001-\u00a3250,000. At the top end there were five transactions of more than \u00a35m and two of more than \u00a310m. There are several demand drivers for forest land, the report said, aside from the current timber price where there have been signs of weakness due to the strength of sterling. The value of logs is expected to rise considerably in the medium to long term and there is the potential for woodland as an investment. \u201cAs we seem to be in an era of low interest rates, possibly for some time to come, forestry looks to be a promising option for investment,\u201d said Fenning Welstead, a partner at John Clegg. \u201cWith physical growth in a tangible asset forestry has much to commend it.\u201d Jason Sinden, head of investment and and property at Tilhill Forestry, a forest management company, said the UK market was beginning to interest institutional investors , with timber seen as a versatile renewable material and a convenient source of energy. The world\u2019s largest timber consumer is the UK\u2019s Drax power station. Sinden said: \u201cIf you want a long-term, green investment, then UK forestry is hard to beat.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We are fixing the roof while the sun is shining. It\u2019s a soundbite that has served George Osborne well down the years and he\u2019s still using it as the rationale for the government\u2019s deficit reduction plan. The chancellor says he is taking advantage of the good times, putting the public finances in the sort of shape that would make the UK more resilient to recession than it was back in 2008. This proved to be a powerful message during the election campaign because Labour\u2019s lack of economic credibility with voters stemmed from the idea that Gordon Brown spent and borrowed too much, leaving the economy vulnerable when the financial crisis broke. The reality is that Britain would have suffered a stonking downturn in 2008 whatever the state of the public finances. The sheer size of the City in relation to the rest of the economy meant Britain was going to feel the full effects of the financial meltdown. A more valid criticism of the last Labour government was that at the end of a long upturn that started under the previous Major administration the economy was so unbalanced and heavily reliant on an unsustainable build up of private debt. It is worth recalling that when Osborne became chancellor five and a half years ago that he had two big objectives. The first was to repair the hole in the public finances, which is still very much a work in progress. The other was to shift the centre of gravity of the economy back towards making things for export. This remains a pipedream. Hang on a bit, Osborne and his supporters would say \u2013 the economy is growing. Britain makes more cars than it ever did, and the plants making them are some of the most productive in the world. Business investment is growing. Exports are bound to take time to pick up given the travails of the eurozone. All the above is true, but provides only a partial picture. The latest growth figures showed that the economy expanded by 0.5% in the third quarter, but both manufacturing and construction contracted. Net trade \u2013 imports growing faster than exports \u2013 subtracted a record 1.5 percentage points from growth between July and September. Despite the welcome pickup in business investment, the main driver of growth has been consumer spending, which has been boosted by low interest rates, the fall in inflation caused by lower oil prices, and a modest acceleration in earnings. The consultancy Capital Economics notes that this is \u201cnot the ideal shape for the recovery\u201d and it can say that again. The current recovery looks like all the previous recoveries. Again, the chancellor would have an answer. Household debt is lower than it was back in 2008 and shows no sign of getting out of control. The Bank of England has been given new powers to monitor the financial system to make sure bubbles don\u2019t appear. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility is forecasting steady non-inflationary growth until the end of the decade. Concerns about the shape of the recovery simply reflect the gloomy disposition of economists and economic commentators. The history of the past 40 years suggests that the Cassandras of the dismal science have been right to issue their warnings. What have often looked like solid and sustainable periods of growth have, with startling rapidity, turned into raging booms. That was true of the mid-1980s and the mid-2000s when the line from first Nigel Lawson and then Gordon Brown was that everything was under control. There is, of course, always the chance it will be different this time. It is possible, if not entirely plausible, that a new golden age of manufacturing is about to dawn and that the UK\u2019s current account is about to go into the black after 33 consecutive years in the red. But it would be unwise to bank on it. Indeed, as a fascinating new paper from the Centre for Business Research in Cambridge shows, it would only require relatively minor deviations from the OBR forecasts for the UK economy to be in serious trouble early in the next decade. The argument goes as follows. Recent rapid jobs growth will come to an end due to a combination of rising wages, higher interest rates and public sector cuts. Real government spending will be reduced by higher than expected inflation. Businesses will be put off investing due to a lack of effective demand. Trade will continue to be a drag on growth. All this has three consequences. The first is that growth is lower than the OBR is forecasting, making it impossible for the chancellor to complete his repair job on the public finances. Instead of a small surplus by the end of the parliament, there is a deficit of 2% of GDP. The second is that there is a growing gap between the UK\u2019s actual level of output and the level that would have been achieved had the pre-recession trend continued. The third is that the only thing that prevents the economy from diving back into recession in 2018 and 2019 is the high level of household borrowing. As per usual, in other words, there will be a choice between extremely low growth and debt-fuelled growth. In the Lawson boom of the 1980s, the ratio of house prices to disposable income per head peaked at 12; in the Brown boom it peaked at 14. The CBR forecasts it hitting 17 by 2020, a third above where it was before the crisis and double its level in 1996, when house prices troughed at the end of the property crash that followed the Lawson boom. The paper argues that two alternatives would be reflation at either the global or the domestic level, with governments borrowing for investment. Neither option looks likely since they would require governments to tolerate higher levels of debt and inflation. There has been no real global economic cooperation since 2010 and the prospect of the UK \u201cgoing it alone\u201d is remote in the extreme. \u201cThere is a dilemma for UK macroeconomic policy,\u201d the CBR paper notes. \u201cFast-rising household debt is needed to maintain a reasonable rate of growth in consumers\u2019 spending and GDP in a world of government debt reduction and in a context of slow growth in world trade, itself caused by debt-reduction policies especially within the eurozone. The problem is that financial ratios and house prices eventually become stretched well beyond historic experience and probably beyond sustainability.\u201d No \u201cprobably\u201d about it. If the economy pans out in accordance with the CBR forecasts, there will be a colossal housing crash that will rip through the banks and threaten a repeat of 2008. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says he is sick of hearing Osborne say the roof is being fixed while the sun is shining. There is an obvious riposte. Know any other good gags, chancellor?",

      "bodyText": "A spider\u2019s silk has long been admired by scientists for being incredibly robust \u2013 five times stronger than steel \u2013 as well as flexible, elastic, soft and stable at high temperatures. They are properties that could be put to use in a wide range of consumer products. But attempts to produce the silk in large amounts have proved tricky, not least because spiders are cannibalistic and territorial so collecting the material is not economically viable. The thread itself is so fine that it would take millions of spiders to produce a kilogram of silk. Materials scientists have been trying to a crack the problem and, in northern California, a solution appears to have been found by Bolt Threads, which will unveil next year the first products which use fibres developed to replicate the unique benefits of spider silk. The goal is to make clothes which are softer, stronger, lighter and more durable. After six years working in labs behind closed doors, the scientists who lead Bolt Threads have recently unveiled the details of their system allowing them to effectively replicate spider\u2019s silk on a large scale, producing fine fibres made up of sugar, water, salts and yeast. In Emeryville, a city close to San Francisco, the researchers studied the proteins which make up the spider silk. They then developed their own proteins \u201cinspired\u201d by the natural silk. The process starts with genes being put into yeast, in a similar way to making beer. The yeast produces silk protein in a liquid form during the fermentation. This liquid silk can then be turned into a fibre through a process called wet-spinning, where it is squeezed through small holes into a bath, creating the solid substance. Dan Widmaier, chief executive and co-founder, says it was a major breakthrough. \u201cYou have the ability of a very sophisticated modern technology to reimagine an industry which has been around for a very long time, one of the cornerstone industries in the world which has not seen a lot of innovation and disruption since the 1930s when petroleum polymers came around with nylons and [when] polyesters in the 1950s came along. \u201cThat is a really exciting concept because you are seeing this steady march of science, engineering and technology finding newer and better things to help improve our society as we get more people on the planet, [with] limited resources and trying to always push the envelope of what we are trying to do in a sustainable way.\u201d The fibres will come to market in two ways. Companies will use them in their own products as an added ingredient. Bolt Threads \u2013 which now has more than 50 staff in its Californian headquarters and has raised $40m worth of financing \u2013 is also launching its own brand to unveil the product, although the exact details remain a secret. \u201cAll the things that make the earliest sense are the things that nature gives us the template for. Stronger, softer, lighter, stretchier, anti-microbial,\u201d Widmaier says. The cost of the new fibres will be high. \u201cIt will definitely be a premium product at launch.\u201d It is not the first time that a spider\u2019s web has proved an influence for manmade products. Orthox, an Oxford-based company has developed small implants for the knee, using silk proteins to make a strong, curved rubber-like material. Widmaier says Bolt Threads technology could be used as part of medical devices inside the body, in the future. Just as all spiders\u2019 silk is not the same \u2013 the arthropods spin different types of silk depending on what it will be used for \u2013 the Bolt Threads silk can also be adaptable. \u201cWhen we talk about spider silk, most of us are thinking the one that is the basis for the Spiderman franchise \u2013 stretchy and stronger than steel and tougher than Kevlar. That is really only one silk. Each spider you find \u2026 have seven different kinds of silk they are making with different mechanical properties with different protein sequences for different niches that they need to fill.

They are properties that could be put to use in a wide range of consumer products.</p> <p>But attempts to produce the silk in large amounts have proved tricky, not least because spiders are cannibalistic and territorial so collecting the material is not economically viable. The thread itself is so fine that it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/nov/30/technology\">take millions of spiders to produce a kilogram of silk</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/25/the-innovators-invisible-buttons-ultrahaptics\">The Innovators - invisible buttons loom into view</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Materials scientists have been trying to a crack the problem and, in northern California, a solution appears to have been found by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://boltthreads.com/\">Bolt Threads</a>, which will unveil next year the first products which use fibres developed to replicate the unique benefits of spider silk. The goal is to make clothes which are softer, stronger, lighter and more durable.</p> <p>After six years working in labs behind closed doors, the scientists who lead Bolt Threads have recently unveiled the details of their system allowing them to effectively replicate spider\u2019s silk on a large scale, producing fine fibres made up of sugar, water, salts and yeast.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In Emeryville, a city close to San Francisco, the researchers studied the proteins which make up the spider silk. They then developed their own proteins \u201cinspired\u201d by the natural silk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"10cb12ba2d0bbc258cc422e9c3993e54db8a4a43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10cb12ba2d0bbc258cc422e9c3993e54db8a4a43/0_111_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Widemair of Bolt Threads\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Widmaier of Bolt Threads</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none/Bolt Threads</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The process starts with genes being put into yeast, in a similar way to making beer. The yeast produces silk protein in a liquid form during the fermentation. This liquid silk can then be turned into a fibre through a process called wet-spinning, where it is squeezed through small holes into a bath, creating the solid substance.</p> <p>Dan Widmaier, chief executive and co-founder, says it was a major breakthrough.</p> <p>\u201cYou have the ability of a very sophisticated modern technology to reimagine an industry which has been around for a very long time, one of the cornerstone industries in the world which has not seen a lot of innovation and disruption since the 1930s when petroleum polymers came around with nylons and [when] polyesters in the 1950s came along.</p> <p>\u201cThat is a really exciting concept because you are seeing this steady march of science, engineering and technology finding newer and better things to help improve our society as we get more people on the planet, [with] limited resources and trying to always push the envelope of what we are trying to do in a sustainable way.\u201d</p> <p>The fibres will come to market in two ways. Companies will use them in their own products as an added ingredient. Bolt Threads \u2013 which now has more than 50 staff in its Californian headquarters and has raised $40m worth of financing \u2013 is also launching its own brand to unveil the product, although the exact details remain a secret. </p> <p>\u201cAll the things that make the earliest sense are the things that nature gives us the template for. Stronger, softer, lighter, stretchier, anti-microbial,\u201d Widmaier says. The cost of the new fibres will be high. \u201cIt will definitely be a premium product at launch.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83440d974bb6410cc2710c478ab6d3fd12007c94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83440d974bb6410cc2710c478ab6d3fd12007c94/0_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Spider silk fermented at Bolt Threads .\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spider silk fermented at Bolt Threads .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.boltthreads.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not the first time that a spider\u2019s web has proved an influence for manmade products. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/10/the-innovators-the-silk-road-to-reducing-knee-operations\">Orthox</a>, an Oxford-based company has developed small implants for the knee, using silk proteins to make a strong, curved rubber-like material. Widmaier says Bolt Threads technology could be used as part of medical devices inside the body, in the future.</p> <p> Just as all spiders\u2019 silk is not the same \u2013 the arthropods spin different types of silk depending on what it will be used for \u2013 the Bolt Threads silk can also be adaptable.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we talk about spider silk, most of us are thinking the one that is the basis for the Spiderman franchise \u2013 stretchy and stronger than steel and tougher than Kevlar. That is really only one silk. Each spider you find \u2026 have seven different kinds of silk they are making with different mechanical properties with different protein sequences for different niches that they need to fill. The idea there is that nature has already given us a template for different performance properties which match or exceed what we can do with petroleum or hydrocarbon chemistry today,\u201d Widmaier says. </p> <h2><strong>The glories of silk</strong></h2> <p>Stronger than steel, flexible, more elastic than other fibres and stable at high temperatures \u2013 just a few of the benefits of spider silk which have fascinated scientists.

The billionaire founder of Sports Direct, which reports half-year results on Thursday, is fighting battles on multiple fronts. His football club, Newcastle United, is in yet another relegation scrap in the Premier League and Ashley is taking the Scottish Football Association to court over his dispute with Rangers, in which he owns a stake. Other problems include the charging of Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, David Forsey, with a criminal offence over the collapse of its fashion chain, USC, and unions continuing to target Sports Direct\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts. In the latest in a series of interventions in other companies, Ashley is trying to force football-strip retailer Findel to accept one of his nominees on its board. Most shareholders have put up with Ashley\u2019s freewheeling because they believe he is a superlative retailer and that enough of his bets pay off. His purchase of a stake in Debenhams seems to have persuaded the store group to stock Sports Direct goods, moving its customer base upmarket. When it comes to selling trainers and the like Sports Direct is doing well, as people spend more time in casual clobber. Its upmarket rival JD Sports published an upbeat trading statement last week, which seems to bode well \u2013 but then JD steers clear of deals and rows, and sticks to boring old retail. Ocado left on the shelf? It must have felt like a good idea early this year when Ocado assured people that it would sign a second distribution deal with a big retailer by the end of 2015. There was lots of interest, so chief executive Tim Steiner said, and plenty of time. Now there\u2019s only three weeks or so to go and the lack of an announcement has weighed on Ocado\u2019s shares, which are down about 20% since July, according to Numis analyst Andrew Wade. Thursday\u2019s trading statement would be a logical time for Ocado to unveil a tie-up but Wade says an announcement isn\u2019t likely before 2016. Ocado launched as an online grocer selling Waitrose products in 2000 and has fallen in and out of favour over the years. Its fortunes seemed to be transformed in 2013 when Morrisons agreed to pay Ocado to distribute goods ordered from it online. Suddenly, Ocado was a technology and logistics company rather than an internet grocer facing intensifying competition. The shares\u2019 recent fall may mean there will be no big reaction if there is no deal \u2013 it will have been \u201cpriced in\u201d. Ocado\u2019s sales should be OK but if there\u2019s no new contract, the old fears about its viability will return. Hornby hopes for model results Hornby, which reports half-year results on Tuesday, has had a rocky old year. The maker of train sets, Airfix kits and other hobbyist products started 2015 on the up, making its first profit for three years as sales improved. It also moved its head office down the road to Sandwich, Kent, from its outdated building in Margate and is planning to shift its popular visitor centre to nearby Ramsgate. All very forward-thinking and encouraging after years of profit warnings caused by an unreliable supplier in China. Then, in September, Hornby said it was struggling to get products from its new Chinese supplier into European shops. Things got worse two months later with a warning predicting a \u00a32m annual loss. Hornby moved its manufacturing to China in the late 1990s to cut costs, but it repatriated production of some Airfix kits in 2013. It may do better to bring back the whole lot, so that managers can keep an eye on things, reduce delivery times and get products on to shelves. Hornby is a small company but it gets a lot of attention because of the folklore surrounding its products, which also include Corgi cars and Scalextric, and its tie-in contracts for films such as the latest James Bond, Spectre. Despite recent setbacks, the shares are up this year.",

      "bodyText": "Economists are split between those who see the world economy coming together and those who believe its major trading blocs are heading in opposite directions. It might only be a couple of weeks before we find out who is right. On 16 December Janet Yellen, the head of the US central bank, is expected to push up interest rates for the first time since 2006. The nudge upwards from 0.25% to 0.5% may not seem like the Federal Reserve\u2019s most momentous financial intervention, but 18 months ago even the thought of such a move caused panic across the world. Back then, the eurozone was still a long way from cobbling together a deal to end the Greek crisis, Japan was struggling and China was beginning to feel the after-effects of its post-crisis borrowing binge. A rise in the cost of borrowing US dollars was the last thing these countries needed. The optimists argue that, today, the situation is transformed. The US can boast an even longer track record of growth; Japan is pushing ahead with Abenomics, the mix of government spending, monetary stimulus and business reform named after prime minister Shinzo Abe; and China\u2019s slowdown has bottomed out. Europe can look back on 2015 as a solid if unspectacular year that saw most eurozone countries continue their modest recoveries. A rise in US interest rates will be met with equanimity across the world, argue the optimists, because everyone else is in better shape, if not growing quite as strongly. It a view with some high-profile backers in the investment business. The executive who wields $500bn of stocks and bonds for US fund manager Wells Fargo Asset Management was in London last week explaining how the global recovery would send oil prices back to $75 after tumbling to $43 last week. How, then, to explain the fuss over last week\u2019s decision by the European Central Bank to increase its efforts to stimulate the eurozone economy, and the reaction from markets when ECB boss Mario Draghi failed to match his tough words with action? It would be easy, not to say comforting, to believe Wells Fargo\u2019s all-encompassing growth story, if the signals of a third phase to the financial crisis could be easily dismissed. They can\u2019t. The US is most certainly galloping along and the UK appears to be keeping pace. On this aspect of the optimists\u2019 theory, analysts can agree. The question mark hangs over the eurozone, Japan, China and the recession-hit Bric countries of Brazil and Russia. Far from bottoming out, the China slowdown may continue for some time to come. Almost as importantly, the only lever Beijing can pull to keep GDP chugging along at something near the 7% it needs is a devaluation of its currency, the yuan. If the devaluation continues, it will destroy the European Central Bank\u2019s strategy, which also rests on a prolonged devaluation against all its major trading partners. At the moment the euro is low against the dollar and pound, but the Japanese have pushed down the yen by a third in the last couple of years. Unsurprisingly, Tokyo has no intention of undermining Japan\u2019s uncompetitive businesses with a higher-value currency. If the Chinese follow the same path and devalue the yuan, many of Europe\u2019s struggling economies \u2013 Italy, Portugal and France, not to mention Greece \u2013 will see their exports become more expensive, pricing them out of important markets. In these circumstances, euroland will need another boost, and in the absence of extra public spending by Brussels, Draghi must sign a bigger cheque, possibly early next year. It\u2019s possible central banks can strike a balance that keeps all the major economies growing. Wages might rise and petrol prices stay low at the same time, boosting consumer spending and business confidence. However, the odds must be against it. No ding dong merrily on the high street The spending figures for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the Saturday and Sunday in between are quite something. Online sales over the four days reached \u00a33.3bn, including \u00a31.1bn on Black Friday and \u00a3968m on Cyber Monday. This equates to \u00a3763,000 being spent every minute on Black Friday, up roughly a third on last year. But unfortunately for high street stores, this spending spree did not translate to \u201cphysical\u201d shops. Although retail bosses have not yet admitted it publicly, they are privately expressing surprise at the shape of spending over that weekend. Rather than flocking to the sales on Black Friday, consumers spread their spending over a week, and focused on grabbing deals online from the comfort of their sofa. We\u2019ll see the consequences of this over the next few weeks and in January when most of Britain\u2019s retailers publish their results for the festive season. Last weekend\u2019s events raise a series of key questions. Are high street shops left with unsold goods they now need to shift before Christmas? How much did the Black Friday sales cost, and has this damaged profits? Can retailers deliver customers\u2019 orders on time? Who were the winners and losers? We have already been given a glimpse of the answers, with Argos customers complaining of delayed deliveries and John Lewis publishing results that suggest some high street chains might have had a difficult day. John Lewis enjoyed a record week, with sales in store and online rising 12% year-on-year on Black Friday itself. However, this is way behind the wider online growth reported, suggesting that John Lewis may have seen its share of overall spending fall. When you consider that John Lewis is likely to emerge as one of the winners of Christmas \u2013 as it has for the past few years \u2013 and that it has a high-quality online business, this is a worrying signal for how the rest of the high street fared. The division between the winners and losers of Christmas 2015 could be stark. Solidly built bonuses A lot of problems would go away if our housebuilders were as efficient at construction as they are at designing share incentives for their executives. Berkeley Homes builds one in 10 of London\u2019s new homes, and said last week that it was on track to exceed by \u00a3500m the dividend target it set in 2011. That was good news for shareholders but better for five senior directors, who between them stand to collect 15.1m shares in 2021 if the targets are met. At the current price, the jackpot is worth \u00a3540m. A similar scheme at Persimmon could deliver \u00a3600m for bosses in 2021. The economy could turn before then, of course. But how hard can it be to make money from housebuilding right now? The chancellor is distributing subsidies for homebuyers like confetti.

      "body": "<p>Economists are split between those who see the world economy coming together and those who believe its major trading blocs are heading in opposite directions. It might only be a couple of weeks before we find out who is right.</p> <p>On 16 December Janet Yellen, the head of the US central bank, is expected to push up interest rates for the first time since 2006. The nudge upwards from 0.25% to 0.5% may not seem like the Federal Reserve\u2019s most momentous financial intervention, but 18 months ago even the thought of such a move caused panic across the world.</p> <p>Back then, the eurozone was still a long way from cobbling together a deal to end the Greek crisis, Japan was struggling and China was beginning to feel the after-effects of its post-crisis borrowing binge. A rise in the cost of borrowing US dollars was the last thing these countries needed.</p> <p>The optimists argue that, today, the situation is transformed. The US can boast an even longer track record of growth; Japan is pushing ahead with Abenomics, the mix of government spending, monetary stimulus and business reform named after prime minister Shinzo Abe; and China\u2019s slowdown has bottomed out. Europe can look back on 2015 as a solid if unspectacular year that saw most eurozone countries continue their modest recoveries.</p> <p>A rise in US interest rates will be met with equanimity across the world, argue the optimists, because everyone else is in better shape, if not growing quite as strongly.</p> <p>It a view with some high-profile backers in the investment business. The executive who wields $500bn of stocks and bonds for US fund manager Wells Fargo Asset Management was in London last week explaining how the global recovery would send oil prices back to $75 after tumbling to $43 last week.</p> <p>How, then, to explain the fuss over last week\u2019s decision by the European Central Bank to increase its efforts to stimulate the eurozone economy, and the reaction from markets when ECB boss Mario Draghi failed to match his tough words with action?</p> <p>It would be easy, not to say comforting, to believe Wells Fargo\u2019s all-encompassing growth story, if the signals of a third phase to the financial crisis could be easily dismissed. They can\u2019t.</p> <p>The US is most certainly galloping along and the UK appears to be keeping pace. On this aspect of the optimists\u2019 theory, analysts can agree. The question mark hangs over the eurozone, Japan, China and the recession-hit Bric countries of Brazil and Russia.</p> <p>Far from bottoming out, the China slowdown may continue for some time to come. Almost as importantly, the only lever Beijing can pull to keep GDP chugging along at something near the 7% it needs is a devaluation of its currency, the yuan.</p> <p>If the devaluation continues, it will destroy the European Central Bank\u2019s strategy, which also rests on a prolonged devaluation against all its major trading partners. At the moment the euro is low against the dollar and pound, but the Japanese have pushed down the yen by a third in the last couple of years. Unsurprisingly, Tokyo has no intention of undermining Japan\u2019s uncompetitive businesses with a higher-value currency.</p> <p>If the Chinese follow the same path and devalue the yuan, many of Europe\u2019s struggling economies \u2013 Italy, Portugal and France, not to mention Greece \u2013 will see their exports become more expensive, pricing them out of important markets.</p> <p>In these circumstances, euroland will need another boost, and in the absence of extra public spending by Brussels, Draghi must sign a bigger cheque, possibly early next year. It\u2019s possible central banks can strike a balance that keeps all the major economies growing. Wages might rise and petrol prices stay low at the same time, boosting consumer spending and business confidence. However, the odds must be against it.</p> <h2>No ding dong merrily on the high street</h2> <p>The spending figures for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the Saturday and Sunday in between are quite something. Online sales over the four days reached \u00a33.3bn, including \u00a31.1bn on Black Friday and \u00a3968m on Cyber Monday. This equates to \u00a3763,000 being spent every minute on Black Friday, up roughly a third on last year. But unfortunately for high street stores, this spending spree did not translate to \u201cphysical\u201d shops.</p> <p>Although retail bosses have not yet admitted it publicly, they are privately expressing surprise at the shape of spending over that weekend. Rather than flocking to the sales on Black Friday, consumers spread their spending over a week, and focused on grabbing deals online from the comfort of their sofa.</p> <p>We\u2019ll see the consequences of this over the next few weeks and in January when most of Britain\u2019s retailers publish their results for the festive season. Last weekend\u2019s events raise a series of key questions. Are high street shops left with unsold goods they now need to shift before Christmas? How much did the Black Friday sales cost, and has this damaged profits? Can retailers deliver customers\u2019 orders on time? Who were the winners and losers?</p> <p>We have already been given a glimpse of the answers, with Argos customers complaining of delayed deliveries and John Lewis publishing results that suggest some high street chains might have had a difficult day.</p> <p>John Lewis enjoyed a record week, with sales in store and online rising 12% year-on-year on Black Friday itself. However, this is way behind the wider online growth reported, suggesting that John Lewis may have seen its share of overall spending fall.</p> <p>When you consider that John Lewis is likely to emerge as one of the winners of Christmas \u2013 as it has for the past few years \u2013 and that it has a high-quality online business, this is a worrying signal for how the rest of the high street fared. The division between the winners and losers of Christmas 2015 could be stark.</p> <h2>Solidly built bonuses<br></h2> <p>A lot of problems would go away if our housebuilders were as efficient at construction as they are at designing share incentives for their executives.</p> <p>Berkeley Homes builds one in 10 of London\u2019s new homes, and said last week that it was on track to exceed by \u00a3500m the dividend target it set in 2011. That was good news for shareholders but better for five senior directors, who between them stand to collect 15.1m shares in 2021 if the targets are met. At the current price, the jackpot is worth \u00a3540m. A similar scheme at Persimmon could deliver \u00a3600m for bosses in 2021.</p> <p>The economy could turn before then, of course. But how hard can it be to make money from housebuilding right now? The chancellor is distributing subsidies for homebuyers like confetti. The managers at Berkeley and Persimmon may work hard, but their potential rewards are mostly the function of a bull market. City fund managers were asleep at the wheel when they approved these schemes.</p>",

But last week\u2019s vintage episode, in which the wannabe entrepreneurs flogged flats in London, carried a clear message about the capital\u2019s property market: it is now so unhinged that literally anyone can make money out of it. It\u2019s hardly news that homes in London are not cheap, but the parade of buy-to-let cash purchasers who trooped in and out of the half-finished high-rise show flats, nodded sagely at the drivel from Lord Sugar\u2019s victims and signed on the dotted line, were flesh-and-blood representatives of a market gone mad. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised, then, that both the Treasury and the Bank of England are increasingly concerned about the burgeoning growth in buy to let. In the summer budget, the chancellor limited some of the tax deductions landlords can claim, with the aim of levelling the playing field with owner-occupiers; and in the autumn statement, he clobbered buy to letters \u2013 and second home owners \u2013 with a 3% stamp duty surcharge. Meanwhile, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, which has the job of preventing a future crash, worries that buy-to-let landlords could bail out quickly in case of trouble, and are more at risk if interest rates rise. So the FPC announced last week that \u2013 assuming Osborne\u2019s measures haven\u2019t taken the steam out of buy to let already \u2013 it may turn its new \u201cmacroprudential\u201d tools on the sector. Governor Mark Carney has made it clear that he sees these new powers, which are meant to allow it to rein in lending in specific pockets of the economy without clobbering growth, as the first line of defence against a housing bubble. Macroprudential policy is poorly understood by sophisticated investors, let alone the general public, and could yet prove controversial. A nudge to banks and other lenders from the FPC could have as much impact on whether some borrowers can get a mortgage as an across-the-board rate rise. But the FPC\u2019s aim is to prevent financial instability, not to tackle housing affordability. That\u2019s the job of politicians \u2013 and so far, they\u2019ve failed lamentably. While Lord Sugar was unleashing his would-be business partners on London\u2019s high-rise rabbit hutches, some of his fellow peers were taking a more cerebral look at the housing market (though it didn\u2019t make quite such good telly). The high-powered Lords economic affairs committee, which includes a former chancellor (Lord Lamont), an LSE professor (Lord Layard) and a former TUC general secretary (Lord Monks), took evidence from economist Kate Barker \u2013 herself a Dame \u2013 about the knotty, longstanding problem of why Britain has consistently failed to build enough houses, and prevent prices surging out of reach. She warned that 300,000 new homes a year would be needed to tackle the housing affordability crisis \u2013 and suggested that the construction industry would struggle to meet this target. But her harshest judgment was reserved for the housing measures outlined in the autumn statement, which she predicted would make things worse, not better. After his stint at the dispatch box last month, George Osborne got himself photographed smearing mortar on to a wall with a trowel to underline his message that \u201cwe are the builders\u201d. But the package of policies is more likely to drive up prices than put more bricklayers to work. As Barker put it, they are \u201cdesigned to be supportive of people who are just on the cusp of being able to buy, and need nudging over the edge\u201d. The availability of cut-price, government-backed mortgages could, she said, reinvigorate the market and exacerbate the problem of homes costing too much. Indeed, the Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that average house prices will increase faster than average wages every year until 2020. So for every lucky buyer given a hand with taxpayers\u2019 cash, many more are likely to be priced out. Meanwhile, tenants have little protection from rising rents and bad landlords. PricedOut, a pressure group that speaks for renters \u2013 and will give evidence to the Lords next week \u2013 wants a target of zero house price inflation to allow wages to catch up. Doing so might force policymakers to consider a slate of radical options: boosting the benefits councils get when new homes are built; direct funding of housebuilding by Whitehall; or taxing property wealth more heavily. But it would also involve ditching the long-held belief that in \u201caspirational\u201d Britain, rising house prices are, always and everywhere, a good thing. Enter the Labour party. If Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell are genuinely keen to junk tired old orthodoxies, housing policy will be a key test. Last week\u2019s harmless brainwave from Labour\u2019s Treasury team, the \u201cgood business kitemark\u201d, is unlikely to set the world alight. But a genuinely radical housing policy would send a clear signal that Labour is determined to grapple with perhaps Britain\u2019s biggest economic challenge. McDonnell has a board of heavyweight economists on hand to advise him: he could show he means business. Meanwhile, we await keenly whatever searing social insights arise from this week\u2019s outing by teams \u201cVersatile\u201d and \u201cConnexus\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Europe may not be leading the way when it comes to technology companies, having never produced a giant to rival the likes of Google or Facebook. But the continent punches at or above its weight in some key areas, boasting companies as big and as well-respected as any in the world. In aerospace and defence, Airbus is second only to the US\u2019s Boeing, and owes its formation to Europe\u2019s capacity for war and peace. The firm behind the world\u2019s largest passenger jet, the A380, has its roots in a collaboration between France, Germany and the UK, conceived to take on Boeing. The three countries developed vast aerospace expertise through successive wars in which air power was crucial. Britain\u2019s Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, Italy\u2019s Finmeccanica and French groups Dassault and Safran are also in the top 20 global aerospace firms by revenue. The state-owned oil and gas producers of Opec nations such as Saudi Arabia and Iran are major players, but strip them out and you are left with big, private multinationals. America\u2019s ExxonMobil may be the largest, but Europe is home to a host of rivals. The UK has the continent\u2019s two biggest, BP and Shell, which is half Dutch. France\u2019s Total is not far behind and Italy\u2019s Eni is far from a minnow. European oil powerhouses owe much of their strength to the continent\u2019s history of colonialism, which allowed them to a foothold in oil-producing parts of Africa and the Middle East. When it comes to the automotive sector, the US and Europe play second fiddle to Japan, with Toyota very much the car in front. But German companies fill the upper echelons: Volkswagen is the world\u2019s next-biggest carmaker, although the diesel emissions scandal could change that. Mercedes owner Daimler and BMW occupy the next two positions \u2013 ahead of Detroit-based General Motors and Ford. Most major European countries in Europe have a globally recognisable auto champion: France\u2019s Renault, Sweden\u2019s Volvo or the UK\u2019s Jaguar Land Rover (ultimately owned by Indian conglomerate Tata). Italian firm Fiat may have merged with US rival Chrysler, but it remains very much an Italian company and the home of Ferrari. The US dominates the pharmaceuticals industry: Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer are the world\u2019s two largest drug and biotech firms. But Europe is no slouch. The UK has AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, while tax-light Switzerland boasts Roche and Novartis. Pfizer is trying to seal a $155bn takeover of Irish-based Allergan that would allow it to move its headquarters to Dublin and take advantage of lower corporation tax. Pfizer would still be a US company, but its brass plate would be European. When the world\u2019s rich want upmarket brands, they turn to Europe, with its long history of trade and craftsmanship. The champion is Paris-headquartered LVMH, the firm behind Louis Vuitton and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, as well as subsidiaries including Dior, Krug champagne, Glenmorangie single malt and watchmaker Bulgari. Then there are classic British brands such as Burberry, Aston Martin, Fortnum &amp; Mason and Mulberry, and fashion houses like Italy\u2019s Armani and Versace and Germany\u2019s Hugo Boss. The demand for European quality from the burgeoning middle classes of developing nations such as China, India and Brazil has cemented the continent\u2019s position as the go-to place for high-end designer goods.",

      "body": "<p>Europe may not be leading the way when it comes to technology companies, having never produced a giant to rival the likes of Google or Facebook. But the continent punches at or above its weight in some key areas, boasting companies as big and as well-respected as any in the world.</p> <p>In aerospace and defence, Airbus is second only to the US\u2019s Boeing, and owes its formation to Europe\u2019s capacity for war <em>and</em> peace. The firm behind the world\u2019s largest passenger jet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/08/theairlineindustry.travel\" title=\"\">the A380</a>, has its roots in a collaboration between France, Germany and the UK, conceived to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/29/boeing-787-dreamliner-airbus-a380-battle-for-skies\" title=\"\">take on Boeing</a>. The three countries developed vast aerospace expertise through successive wars in which air power was crucial. Britain\u2019s Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, Italy\u2019s Finmeccanica and French groups Dassault and Safran are also in the top 20 global aerospace firms by revenue.</p> <p>The state-owned oil and gas producers of Opec nations such as Saudi Arabia and Iran are major players, but strip them out and you are left with big, private multinationals. America\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/22/private-empire-exxon-mobil-review\" title=\"\">ExxonMobil</a> may be the largest, but Europe is home to a host of rivals. The UK has the continent\u2019s two biggest, BP and Shell, which is half Dutch. France\u2019s Total is not far behind and Italy\u2019s Eni is far from a minnow. European oil powerhouses owe much of their strength to the continent\u2019s history of colonialism, which allowed them to a foothold in oil-producing parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p> <p>When it comes to the automotive sector, the US and Europe play second fiddle to Japan, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/26/volkswagen-top-spot-toyota-vw-emissions-scandal\" title=\"\">Toyota very much the car in front</a>. But German companies fill the upper echelons: Volkswagen is the world\u2019s next-biggest carmaker, although the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-explained-diesel-cars\" title=\"\">diesel emissions scandal</a> could change that. Mercedes owner Daimler and BMW occupy the next two positions \u2013 ahead of Detroit-based General Motors and Ford. Most major European countries in Europe have a globally recognisable auto champion: France\u2019s Renault, Sweden\u2019s Volvo or the UK\u2019s Jaguar Land Rover (ultimately owned by Indian conglomerate Tata). Italian firm Fiat may have merged with US rival Chrysler, but it remains very much an Italian company and the home of Ferrari.</p> <p>The US dominates the pharmaceuticals industry: Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer are the world\u2019s two largest drug and biotech firms. But Europe is no slouch. The UK has AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, while tax-light Switzerland boasts Roche and Novartis. Pfizer is trying to seal a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/23/pfizer-allergan-agree-160-billion-dollars-deal-tax\" title=\"\">$155bn takeover</a> of Irish-based Allergan that would allow it to move its headquarters to Dublin and take advantage of lower corporation tax. Pfizer would still be a US company, but its brass plate would be European.</p> <p>When the world\u2019s rich want upmarket brands, they turn to Europe, with its long history of trade and craftsmanship. The champion is Paris-headquartered LVMH, the firm behind Louis Vuitton and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, as well as subsidiaries including Dior, Krug champagne, Glenmorangie single malt and watchmaker Bulgari.</p> <p>Then there are classic British brands such as Burberry, Aston Martin, Fortnum &amp; Mason and Mulberry, and fashion houses like Italy\u2019s Armani and Versace and Germany\u2019s Hugo Boss. The demand for European quality from the burgeoning middle classes of developing nations such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/global-luxury-goods-market-exceeds-1tn-euro\" title=\"\">China, India and Brazil</a> has cemented the continent\u2019s position as the go-to place for high-end designer goods.</p>",
