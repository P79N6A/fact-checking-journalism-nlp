      "bodyText": "Ladies and gentlemen, there will now be a short interval while Pfizer re-arms and AstraZeneca is softened up for the kill. This, it seems, is the script being crafted by BlackRock, Schroders and a few other fund managers in control of chunky stakes in AstraZeneca. They want more \"engagement\" \u2013 which sounds like a euphemism for a deal \u2013 and they want it soon. Normal form, as dictated by the Takeover Code, is to disallow fresh approaches from the same bidder for at least six months unless a third party shows up. This is for the commonsense reason that a target company deserves some time to breathe and to concentrate on running its business. But BlackRock, like a surly six-year-old, doesn't want to wait for Christmas. Its ruse is to prod AstraZeneca's board to invite Pfizer to come back to the table in three months' time. This would get around the six-month rule because, formally, AstraZeneca would have voluntarily waived the protections of the code and requested Pfizer to make an offer. The three-month idea is clever. But, as a demonstration of how deeply short-term instincts have infected the fund management industry, it is depressing. This takeover saga has been running in on-off form for six months if one takes the start as Pfizer's initial approach to AstraZeneca in November last year. There were further behind-the-scenes talks in January; then the affair burst into the open at Easter. Monday's 5pm deadline for Pfizer to put up or shut up is meant to be a cut-off. Instead, if the three-month idea gains momentum, we're in for a summer of speculation. Fund managers are entitled to voice their opinions on the merits of a takeover offer, of course. But the bullying of AstraZeneca to replay the match with Pfizer as soon as August is perverse. It was Pfizer that created Monday's deadline by declaring its \u00a355-a-share proposal to be final, which it didn't have to do. By that stage, AstraZeneca had even named its price to roll over \u2013 \u00a358.85. Pfizer chose not to match that price. Let the Takeover Panel's six-month cooling-off period run its course. Half a year has always seemed a reasonable and pragmatic fudge. The target company is guaranteed some time to operate without the distractions of a siege; and its shareholders are not denied, for long, the opportunity to see another offer if the bidder is still willing. In attempting to manufacture new talks after a lull of only 90 days, it's as if BlackRock and Schroders are giving AstraZeneca three months to cure cancer or else. It would be better if everybody took a reasonable breather. Politicians in the US and Britain, fretting about tax \"inversions\" and the possible threat to the science base respectively, could decide if they want to change the rules. And Schroders could usefully \"engage\" with its clients, the real shareholders. Many of its UK retail punters, one suspects, would say they want nothing to do with a bid that rests on tax arbitrage on a grand scale. Other fund managers are available. Over at Old Mutual there is Richard Buxton, who just happened to jump ship from Schroders last year. From his new berth he writes to the FT to say he's pleased to see support for AstraZeneca's rejection of \"such an obvious piece of financial engineering\". Buxton also has a good idea. When a board such as AstraZeneca's rejects an offer, link directors' long-term incentives to the price they spurned. This would \"provide comfort to shareholders that if things do not play out as the management envisage, the executives have shared in the pain felt by shareholders at the lost opportunity.\" Yes, that's both fair and easy to understand. In the long list of big banks' recent misdemeanours, failing to stop a rogue trader from rigging the official price of gold doesn't make the top 10. This week alone we've seen Credit Suisse plead guilty to criminal charges relating to an \"extensive and wide-ranging conspiracy\" to help US clients evade taxes. The Swiss bank also settled for a $2.6bn (\u00a31.9bn) fine. But Barclays deserves its more modest fine of \u00a326m in the gold case for arrogance and stupidity alone. Daniel Plunkett, the trader who has now been barred from working in the City, executed his cunning plan to shift the official gold \"fix\", and benefit his trading book by $1.75m, on 28 June 2012. This was about two years after the start of investigations into Libor-rigging at Barclays and several other banks. Barclays' board, led by chief executive Bob Diamond from January 2011 to July 2012, would have known a Libor storm was coming and that it would probably be wise to get internal controls up to scratch on other trading desks. Instead, as the FCA points out with exasperation, Plunkett was able to do his stuff on the day after Barclays' \u00a3290m fine in the Libor scandal was announced. There is no excuse for a rotten culture, bad behaviour and weak controls. But the system for \"fixing\", in the unfortunate terminology, the price of gold looks woefully vulnerable to manipulation. Representatives of a handful of banks join a 10-minute telephone conference call and declare their \"buy\" and \"sell\" orders at various prices. The chairman of the panel then leads a shuffling process to establish the price at which supply and demand meet. Then a \"fix\" is declared. As Plunkett spotted, injecting a big order at the right moment can have a near-instantaneous effect. There must be a more transparent way to establish prices when single derivative bets can be worth millions of dollars. When they've found it, the banks involved should find a new name for the process of price discovery. \"For over 80 years we have been fixing the price of gold,\" no longer sounds like something to boast about. Flotation fatigue? Not really. The private equity backers of Saga were just too greedy on price. At 245p, Permira, Charterhouse and CVC were pushing for a valuation of 18 times earnings. That was absurd for a business that still makes most of its money from car and home insurance. Saga eventually got away on Friday at 185p, or 14.4 times earnings, which is hardly a bad rating. It was 200,000 Saga customers who saved the day by piling in for new shares. The private equity houses declined to sell any of their shares at 185p, which is their right. But they also got a useful reminder that, when you're trying to clear a job-lot of shares, you'd better offer a decent price. There are about 2,000 companies with a main-market listing; their shares are all available for investment.",

      "body": "<p>The waning appetite of investors for stock market flotations left Saga marooned yesterday as the over-50s cruises and insurance company saw its shares tread water on their debut.</p> <p>Despite floating at the bottom of the price range on Friday, the company's shares closed trading unmoved at 185p amid signs that fund managers are becoming concerned at lofty valuations.</p> <p>The City has seen a number of flotations struggle in recent weeks, including Card Factory and Just Eat. Ivor Pether, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, warned that \"vendors are being overly ambitious\" and asking for valuations that are too high.</p> <p>\"Saga is a classic example. It's not a reflection on the quality of the company; it's the valuation that was being asked. Overall, the IPO pipeline has become over congested and it needs sellers to adjust their pricing expectations to get it flowing again and to get long-term investors interested. If that doesn't happen the IPO market will stall,\" he said.</p> <p>Private equity groups, which include Saga's owners Permira, Charterhouse and CVC, are also being viewed as part of the problem, according to Pether. \"We are interested in buying good companies with decent prospects at an attractive price.</p> <p>\"You can find some of those qualities but not the latter.

      "bodyText": "The waning appetite of investors for stock market flotations left Saga marooned yesterday as the over-50s cruises and insurance company saw its shares tread water on their debut. Despite floating at the bottom of the price range on Friday, the company's shares closed trading unmoved at 185p amid signs that fund managers are becoming concerned at lofty valuations. The City has seen a number of flotations struggle in recent weeks, including Card Factory and Just Eat. Ivor Pether, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, warned that \"vendors are being overly ambitious\" and asking for valuations that are too high. \"Saga is a classic example. It's not a reflection on the quality of the company; it's the valuation that was being asked. Overall, the IPO pipeline has become over congested and it needs sellers to adjust their pricing expectations to get it flowing again and to get long-term investors interested. If that doesn't happen the IPO market will stall,\" he said. Private equity groups, which include Saga's owners Permira, Charterhouse and CVC, are also being viewed as part of the problem, according to Pether. \"We are interested in buying good companies with decent prospects at an attractive price. \"You can find some of those qualities but not the latter. A number of the owners of these companies are private equity firms and they are selling because they think it's a good time to sell.\" The experience of Saga and others has not deterred easyJet's founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who announced yesterday that he was listing his easyHotel business on the stock market in the billionaire's first flotation since his budget airline went public in 2000. EasyHotel is seeking to raise up to \u00a360m on London's Alternative Investment Market to fund expansion.

Haji-Ioannou launched his budget hotel chain in 2004, one of the many businesses under his \"easy\" brand. The company, which is fully owned by easyGroup Holdings, has 20 hotels, 17 of which operate as franchises. It has seven hotels in London, one each in Edinburgh and Glasgow and the rest spread across European cities, Dubai, Johannesburg and Haji-Ioannou's native Cyprus. Haji-Ioannou said: \"I see easyHotel as one of the best, most natural extensions of the easy brand from the airline. \"EasyHotel is raising money to accelerate growth at a much faster rate than I could have grown it as a private company, whilst enabling me to spend more time on my diversified portfolio of other investments.\" As well as funding growth in European cities, the money will be used to repay a loan to easyGroup.

A vote for forces that have promised to \u201ctear up\u201d the financial aid agreements Athens has signed with its creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF would send all the wrong messages, said the conservative leader. \u201cWhat would happen with the banks? How would other European capitals react when they thought Greece had got over the danger and they woke up finding it in a vacuum again? How would international markets, which have just welcomed Greece \u2026 and investors who have already come and the millions of foreign tourists who have already made bookings this summer, react?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt took many sacrifices to get Greece back on its feet But it would take an \u2018accident,\u2019 an unwise vote at the polls, to let everything go to waste.\u201d</p> <p>As the count-down to the vote closes, coalition government officials have voiced concerns over an abstention rate that in local elections last weekend \u2013 run-offs will be held on Sunday in tandem with the European parliament poll \u2013 reached 40%. One of Europe\u2019s most politicized nations, Greeks, traditionally, see Euro elections as a chance to vent their spleen by casting protest votes. \u201cIt would be a mistake to allow the European election to create instability because instability can have unchecked consequences,\u201d said Samaras.</p> <p>The Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras has warned that the government will be effectively de-legitimised if it suffers a resounding defeat, saying that such a result will send the clearest message yet that Greeks oppose the policies of austerity.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-478e9bf5-db0e-4d7f-96cf-97d21f925765\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400862390054/b510f492-8860-4045-98d4-7974282cc71e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Greece's Syriza party election campaign poster for the upcoming May 25 European elections.

But that is a protest vote. European election voter turnout is low, the parliament is of limited relevance, and governments often get a kicking in mid-term elections. </li> <li><strong>When it matters, UKIPs influence is smaller: </strong>UKIP would do well to capture one parliamentary seat in the 2015 general election. The party gained 16.5% of the vote in the 2009 European elections but only 3.1% of the 2010 general election vote and won no seats. </li> <li><strong>But the party is still disruptive:</strong> UKIP should not be dismissed. It raises the chances of a hung parliament by eating into the two main parties\u2019 support. It makes the election results unpredictable, with all parties losing lost votes to UKIP. It has forced policy changes in other parties. The Conservatives will hold a 2017 \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum if they are in power. Labour is pursuing a statist cost-of-living campaign.</li> <li><strong>A big question is what the European elections signal for the main parties\u2019 fortunes:</strong> Much of the significance of this week\u2019s elections lies in their implications for Labour\u2019s mid-term lead over the Conservatives. General election polls currently give the Labour party enough support to gain an outright majority in Parliament, but those polls will change over the next year and this week\u2019s elections will be just one test of Labour\u2019s support.</li> <li><strong>The Scottish referendum:</strong> UKIP attracts much less support in relatively europhile Scotland. In a recent YouGov poll, Scots supported EU membership 54-24, compared to 42-37 for the UK as a whole. A surge in support for UKIP\u2019s version of \u201clittle England\u201d could be grist to SNP leader Alex Salmond\u2019s mill, pushing more wavering voters towards the Scottish independence campaign. Rather than getting the UK out of the EU, UKIP could succeed in getting Scotland out of the UK.</li> <li><strong>Limited effect on national politics:</strong> Across Europe, there will be protest votes this weekend, although perhaps not as strong as expected. Dutch exit polls give Geert Wilders\u2019 party one-third fewer votes than in 2009. The protest votes are unlikely to be repeated fully in national elections.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fb4826d6-dcd9-4774-b648-01815fc4c71b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400836341956/1009a958-4313-4d6f-b3cc-523577e15837-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"UKIP leader Nigel Farage gives a media interview before leaving his home in Cudham, Kent, as his party made gains across the country following yesterdays voting in local council elections.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UKIP leader Nigel Farage gives a media interview before leaving his home in Cudham, Kent, as his party made gains across the country following yesterdays voting in local council elections.

Much has changed over the past five years in the euro zone, as right-wing anti-euro parties have fast become the by-product of the crisis. This time around, there\u2019s concerns that Brussels will lose its grip and influence on the wider EU, with countries such as the UK showing hesitation regarding further inclusion into EU-driven policies.</p> <p>At the same time, we have Ukrainian elections on Sunday which prompt some nerves, though the withdrawal of forces by Russia this week has been seen as sign of de-escalation of the crisis, so markets are exhibiting less discomfort than usual. What is a little more worrying for global investors - particularly those with a strong focus in Asian assets - is the military coup in Thailand which is dominating the headlines.</p> <p>With the long holiday weekend in most parts of Europe, traders are taking no chances, cutting down exposure to risk, with disappointing German IFO data denting the mood further. Like the ZEW survey out of Germany last week which fell short of expectations, the IFO survey reached its lowest level of the year in May. The survey's \"business climate\" component fell to 110.4, down from 111.2 in April, and just under the 110.9 predicted by economists. The current conditions component was a little better but the forward looking component declined \u2013 clearly the weaker run of German macro data seems to be one of the drivers behind the recent dovish stance taken by the Bundesbank who have now endorsed a broader stimulus approach by the ECB next month.</p> <p>Elsewhere, on a brighter note, Greece\u2019s credit rating was increased by Fitch Ratings with its long-term debt to B, five levels below investment grade, from B-. Fitch said that\u2019s due to an improving economic and fiscal outlook for the country that sparked the euro area\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis.

If the price fixed above US$1,558.96 (the Barrier) during the 3:00 p.m. Gold Fixing on 28 June 2012, then Barclays would be required to make a payment to its customer. But if the price fixed below the Barrier, Barclays would not have to make that payment. </p> <p>During the 3:00 p.m. Gold Fixing on 28 June 2012, Plunkett placed certain orders with the intent of increasing the likelihood that the price of gold would fix below the Barrier, which it eventually did. As a result, Barclays was not obligated to make the US$3.9m payment to its customer, and Plunkett\u2019s book profited by US$1.75m (excluding hedging), which was in addition to an initial profit that his book had received upon the sale of the Digital.</p> <p>Very shortly after the conclusion of the 3:00 p.m. Gold Fixing on 28 June 2012, the customer became aware that the price had fixed just below the Barrier and sought an explanation from Barclays as to what happened in the Gold Fixing. When Barclays relayed the customer\u2019s concerns to Plunkett on 28 and 29 June 2012, he failed to disclose that he had placed orders and traded during the Gold Fixing.

      "bodyText": "European markets have ended the week on a positive note ahead of the results of the latest round of voting, but the UK market has missed out.David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: Although off the lows, the FTSE 100 is opting out of a global move higher for a second consecutive day. A long weekend, pending euro election results and some Ukraine-related worries have combined to keep risk appetite at bay, while the less than stellar arrival of Saga on the London market has dampened sentiment as well. Overall, the final scores on the doors showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 4.81 points or 0.07% lower at 6815.75 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.48% to 9768.01 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.33% better at 4493.15 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.83% higher at 20,745.96 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 0.36% to 10,558.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 56 points or 0.34% higher. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back next week. Over in Greece prime minister Antonis Samaras, who is preparing to address thousands in what will be a last pre-election rally, has warned that a win for anti-austerity opposition parties could derail all the economic progress the debt-stricken country has made. Helena Smith writes: With opinion polls giving the lead to Greece\u2019s anti-bailout radical left Syriza party in Sunday\u2019s European election, prime minister Antonis Samaras appealed to voters not to be complacent. A vote for forces that have promised to \u201ctear up\u201d the financial aid agreements Athens has signed with its creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF would send all the wrong messages, said the conservative leader. \u201cWhat would happen with the banks? How would other European capitals react when they thought Greece had got over the danger and they woke up finding it in a vacuum again? How would international markets, which have just welcomed Greece \u2026 and investors who have already come and the millions of foreign tourists who have already made bookings this summer, react?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt took many sacrifices to get Greece back on its feet But it would take an \u2018accident,\u2019 an unwise vote at the polls, to let everything go to waste.\u201d As the count-down to the vote closes, coalition government officials have voiced concerns over an abstention rate that in local elections last weekend \u2013 run-offs will be held on Sunday in tandem with the European parliament poll \u2013 reached 40%. One of Europe\u2019s most politicized nations, Greeks, traditionally, see Euro elections as a chance to vent their spleen by casting protest votes. \u201cIt would be a mistake to allow the European election to create instability because instability can have unchecked consequences,\u201d said Samaras. The Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras has warned that the government will be effectively de-legitimised if it suffers a resounding defeat, saying that such a result will send the clearest message yet that Greeks oppose the policies of austerity. And here are the results of the HSBC annual meeting votes: Commenting on the US home sale figures, Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is a touch higher than anticipated, also considering the upward revision for the March reading. That said, the less volatile three month print remained on a modest downward trend (425,000 from 433,000) as it carries over the decline seen during the winter months when harsh weather conditions weighed on housing activity. The stock of homes for sale edged a touch higher in April (up to 192,000 from 191,000) but it still remains depressed if compared to pre-crisis levels (around 550,000 in mid 2007). As for house prices, April registered a modest decline, both in terms of median and average prices. Prices have entered in a modest contraction pace also on a year on year basis. Recent survey indicators (NAHB) signalled that the housing market is moving sideways as some headwinds to growth remain well alive. With mortgage rates edging higher in the past few months and still tight credit conditions, demand is still constrained. Over in the US, there are more signs of a recovery in the housing market. Sales of new single family homes rose by a better than expected 6.4% to 433,000 in April, compared to March, after two months of decline. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 425,000. March's number was revised up from 384,000 to 407,000. But compared to April last year, sales were down 4.2%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has edged up 6 points. European markets are still flat. On that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $4 trillion under management, said today one of its main bond funds has cut its holdings of peripheral eurozone bonds to the lowest level since the height of the crisis. Scott Thiel, the firm's head of European and global bonds said the rally in lower-rated bonds prompted his Fixed Income Global Opportunities fund to book profits, and added he was \"not convinced\" the European Central Bank would introduce a money-printing asset purchase programme. Expectations that the ECB would take decisive action to nurture the eurozone's fragile recovery helped drive Italian, Spanish and Irish ten-year bond yields to record lows of less than 3% last week, while Portuguese yields dropped to the lowest level in over eight years. Yields hit peaks of more than 7% at the height of the crisis in 2011 and 2012, before ECB president Mario Draghi's declaration he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. Let's take a quick look at what's been happening today. European stock markets are flat as voters go to the polls in Europe's marathon parliamentary election, with results due on Sunday night. Traders are also watching developments in Ukraine and the military coup in Thailand. The FTSE 100 index in London has lost nearly 20 points at 6801.11, a 0.3% fall. Germany's Dax and France's CAC are up 0.2% and 0.1% higher respectively. Barclays has been fined \u00a326m over mistakes made in relation to gold price fixing and a former trader has been fined and banned from working in key roles in the City HSBC has seen off a shareholder revolt over management bonuses Greece has been upgraded by Fitch while Spain has been upgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's German business confidence fell to the lowest level this year in May, suggesting economic growth will slow in months to come \u2013 after a strong performance in the first quarter (0.8% growth). HSBC has tweeted that 83.95% of shareholders have backed its remuneration report, which means a sizeable chunk voted against or abstained. This compares with 89% at last year's AGM. Even fewer approved its remuneration policy: 79.35%. The debate on executive pay and bonuses continues at HSBC's annual meeting. This is bound to cause amusement (or anger) among HSBC shareholders. Many thanks to a reader, Imvho1, who posted a link to a \"Stimmungsbarometer\" (barometer of public opinion) for the European elections for every country, in German news magazine Der Spiegel. Just click on the country of your choice. Shareholders have started asking about executive pay at the HSBC annual meeting. Back to the Barclays fine. Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury Select Committee, and is a former chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: It is essential that the regulators do what is necessary to give us confidence that the integrity of these markets is being maintained. It is equally essential that the drive to improve standards with the fundamental reforms outlined by the Parliamentary Commission among others is maintained. The long-awaited \"fracking\" report released by the British Geological Survey this morning concludes that \"a reasonable central estimate for shale oil is 4.4bn barrels in the ground\" in the Weald basin \u2013 an area which lies under Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire. The top estimate is 8.5bn barrels of oil. The report is likely to cause alarm in Tory heartlands. But the government was accused of cynically releasing the report a day after the European and local elections in order to bury controversial news. Read more here. Lorna Roseacre, campaigner of Frack Off, said: For fracking companies to extract just 4% of the 4.4bn barrels of shale oil that the British Geological Survey say lies under Southern England would require 1,400 wells. If they could access 10%, which is extremely generous, it would require 3,500 wells to be drilled'. We are talking about a huge number of wells and industrialisation for a tiny amount of oil. To put that in perspective, 4% of the reported reserve is 176 million barrels which equates to 120 days of UK oil consumption and 10% of the reserve would be 440 million barrels of oil which is 290 days of UK consumption.' 'he government knows communities don't want this industry and has upped it's bribe accordingly. No amount of cash is going to make people sit back and let their community become a gasfield. At HSBC's AGM, chief executive Stuart Gulliver told shareholders he sees no need to \"exit large chunks\" of the investment banking business like rivals. He also pledged to increase dividend payouts despite uncertainties over future capital requirements for banks demanded by regulators. The rise in the dividend for 2013 was less than analysts expected after HSBC missed forecasts with a 9% increase in annual profit. It has continued to build up capital, but it is unclear how much it will need to hold under global and UK rules. Gulliver said: In spite of the continuing uncertainty around the level of capital that we are required to hold, we have continued to demonstrate our ability to generate enough capital to deliver a progressive dividend. HSBC, which is based in London but made two thirds of last year's profit in Asia, reiterated its goal to deliver a further $2-3bn of annual cost savings. The bank has axed more than 40,000 jobs and sold or closed 60 businesses over the past three years. HSBC has pledged to keep increasing dividends despite regulatory uncertainties. Jennifer Rankin is at the annual meeting, where the Q&amp;A started a few minutes ago. HSBC has published the speeches given at its AGM on its website. Chairman Douglas Flint has kicked off the meeting with a general look at the banking industry: There is no question that in recent years it has been socially challenging to be in banking. In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, our industry has, deservedly, had to face up to well-founded public criticism and deal with the implications for its business models of a severe loss of trust. The consequential public policy response has been intense and prolonged, leading to significant regulatory changes as well as requiring banks to undertake critical self-examination as to their social purpose and culture. Sir Simon Robertson, who chairs the bank's remuneration committee, said about Flint's controversial bonus (the bank had planned to pay its chairman a bonus in shares of up to \u00a32.25m but reduced this under shareholder pressure to a one-off payment of \u00a31.06m): The existing policy allows the committee to make an award to Mr Flint in exceptional circumstances. The proposed policy limits any such award to the chairman to a maximum of 100% of fixed pay. However, following consultation with shareholders, the committee has decided to go further by restricting any potential future award to 44% of Mr Flint's fixed pay. Any such award would be 'one-off' and exceptional. That is to say that if the committee deems an award to be merited, no further such award could be made during the three-year term of the remuneration policy without additional approval from shareholders. Back to the Barclays fine. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: Dodgy gold deals are more mafioso than high street bank. Unfortunately this is just the latest in a seemingly endless line of scams and subterfuge from Britain's supposedly reformed financial sector. The government has given the City far too long a leash - it's time to bring the banks to heel and ensure that instead of ripping us off they make a positive contribution to society. You can watch the live webcast from HSBC's annual meeting at the Barbican in London here. Former Barclays trader Daniel James Plunkett who was fined and banned from working in key roles in the City for trying to make a \"quick buck\" from a client, was hoping for a \"mini puke\", as my colleague Jill Treanor reports. Plunkett, a director on the precious metals desk, sent an email on the evening of 27 June 2012 telling colleagues that he was hoping for a \u201cmini puke to 1558\u201d - where \u201cmini puke\u201d referred to a fall in the price of the gold. Barclays\u2019 chief executive, Antony Jenkins, who was promoted to replace Bob Diamond in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, insisted the bank was already making changes to its culture to avoid such problems happening again. HSBC's annual meeting is about to start (11am BST) at the Barbican in London. The pay package awarded to its chairman Douglas Flint last year has attracted controversy, and the bank has staged a partial climbdown over his bonus in an attempt to head off a revolt from shareholders. My colleague Jennifer Rankin, who is at the AGM, wrote a week ago: Bowing to investor pressure, the bank revoked an earlier offer to hand its chairman Douglas Flint a \u00a32.25m award in shares. Under HSBC's latest plan, Flint's bonus would be limited to a one-off payment of \u00a31.06m. HSBC said Flint's reward would be capped at 44% of his fixed pay, which was about \u00a32.43m last year. In another attempt to appease investors, the bank said the reward under the HSBC share scheme would be for one year only. Flint, who has been HSBC chairman since 2010, would have seen his pay almost doubled if HSBC's first plan had gone ahead. The bank argued that he deserved a \u00a32.25m bonus, because the latest round of banking regulation reform had added significantly to his workload. But large investors recoiled from the plan, believing that Flint was receiving a big increase in pay while his job description remained unchanged. The standoff could have led to an investor rebellion at HSBC's annual general meeting on 23 May, prompting the bank to offer an olive branch to big City shareholders. The first preliminary results of the European parliamentary elections will be posted on the European Parliament's website on Sunday night from 10pm BST. The last polling stations will close at that time, and the first estimates at European level will be published from 9pm BST. The pound has hit a 17-month high against the euro, which was knocked by weaker growth prospects in Germany, but struggled against the dollar. Several banks predicted this week that any further gains by sterling will be against the euro. It rose 0.2% to 80.83p. Against the dollar, sterling lost 0.1% to $1.6851 this morning. Analysts at Berenberg Bank have looked at UKIP's success, which they say is a protest vote and a poor guide to next May's general election. UKIP may win the European parliament elections by tapping into anti-EU, anti-immigration sentiment. But that is a protest vote. European election voter turnout is low, the parliament is of limited relevance, and governments often get a kicking in mid-term elections. When it matters, UKIPs influence is smaller: UKIP would do well to capture one parliamentary seat in the 2015 general election. The party gained 16.5% of the vote in the 2009 European elections but only 3.1% of the 2010 general election vote and won no seats. But the party is still disruptive: UKIP should not be dismissed. It raises the chances of a hung parliament by eating into the two main parties\u2019 support. It makes the election results unpredictable, with all parties losing lost votes to UKIP. It has forced policy changes in other parties. The Conservatives will hold a 2017 \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum if they are in power. Labour is pursuing a statist cost-of-living campaign. A big question is what the European elections signal for the main parties\u2019 fortunes: Much of the significance of this week\u2019s elections lies in their implications for Labour\u2019s mid-term lead over the Conservatives. General election polls currently give the Labour party enough support to gain an outright majority in Parliament, but those polls will change over the next year and this week\u2019s elections will be just one test of Labour\u2019s support. The Scottish referendum: UKIP attracts much less support in relatively europhile Scotland. In a recent YouGov poll, Scots supported EU membership 54-24, compared to 42-37 for the UK as a whole. A surge in support for UKIP\u2019s version of \u201clittle England\u201d could be grist to SNP leader Alex Salmond\u2019s mill, pushing more wavering voters towards the Scottish independence campaign. Rather than getting the UK out of the EU, UKIP could succeed in getting Scotland out of the UK. Limited effect on national politics: Across Europe, there will be protest votes this weekend, although perhaps not as strong as expected. Dutch exit polls give Geert Wilders\u2019 party one-third fewer votes than in 2009. The protest votes are unlikely to be repeated fully in national elections. Here's a handy summary of today's developments from ETX Capital. We'll be getting US new home sales data later (3pm BST). Since the last election in 2009, we\u2019ve had a euro-wide debt crisis, bailouts, austerity measures and ECB action. Much has changed over the past five years in the euro zone, as right-wing anti-euro parties have fast become the by-product of the crisis. This time around, there\u2019s concerns that Brussels will lose its grip and influence on the wider EU, with countries such as the UK showing hesitation regarding further inclusion into EU-driven policies. At the same time, we have Ukrainian elections on Sunday which prompt some nerves, though the withdrawal of forces by Russia this week has been seen as sign of de-escalation of the crisis, so markets are exhibiting less discomfort than usual. What is a little more worrying for global investors - particularly those with a strong focus in Asian assets - is the military coup in Thailand which is dominating the headlines. With the long holiday weekend in most parts of Europe, traders are taking no chances, cutting down exposure to risk, with disappointing German IFO data denting the mood further. Like the ZEW survey out of Germany last week which fell short of expectations, the IFO survey reached its lowest level of the year in May. The survey's \"business climate\" component fell to 110.4, down from 111.2 in April, and just under the 110.9 predicted by economists. The current conditions component was a little better but the forward looking component declined \u2013 clearly the weaker run of German macro data seems to be one of the drivers behind the recent dovish stance taken by the Bundesbank who have now endorsed a broader stimulus approach by the ECB next month. Elsewhere, on a brighter note, Greece\u2019s credit rating was increased by Fitch Ratings with its long-term debt to B, five levels below investment grade, from B-. Fitch said that\u2019s due to an improving economic and fiscal outlook for the country that sparked the euro area\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis. Meanwhile, S&amp;P Ratings upgraded Spain\u2019s rating one level to BBB from BBB-. Spain has been upgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, which cited improved growth prospects in the country which is emerging from a six-year economic slump. The upgrade, to BBB/A-2 from BBB-/A-3, pushed the ratings to two notches above junk status. S&amp;P said its outlook for Spain is stable and reflects its view of \"improving economic growth and competitiveness as a result of Spain's structural reform efforts since 2010, including the 2012 labor reforms.\" Greece, for its part, has been upgraded by rival ratings agency Fitch. The weaker German Ifo business confidence number has knocked the euro. Expectations that the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy next month pushed the European single currency to a three-month low against the dollar. Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics, said: The renewed fall in the Ifo in May suggests that the German recovery may be slowing. We expect annual GDP growth of about 2% this year and next, which wil not be strong enough to drive a rapid recovery across the eurozone or to eradicate the threat of deflation. My colleague Jill Treanor reports on the latest Barclays fine: Almost two years after being hit by a \u00a3290m fine for rigging the key benchmark rate Libor, Barclays is now facing the wrath of regulators again - this time for almost 10 years of inadequate oversight of the way it was involved in setting the price of gold, known as the fix. Antony Jenkins, promoted to replace Bob Diamond in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, insisted the bank was already making changes to its culture to avoid such problems happening again. The Financial Conduct Authority said it had fined Daniel James Plunkett \u00a395,600 and banned him from working in key roles in the City after he was tempted to make a \"quick buck\" from a client. His actions took plave on 28 June 2012 - the day after the bank received its Libor fine which unleashed a furious public reaction and led the creation of the parliamentary commission on banking standards. Germany's Dax has turned positive again after a brief foray into negative territory, trading nearly 7 points higher at 9727.59. France's CAC has edged some 3 points higher to 4481.56. The FTSE 100 index in London is still down some 10 points at 6810.63, a 0.15% fall. The German Ifo survey shows business confidence fell in May to the lowest reading this year. The closely watched business climate index from the Munich-based institute Ifo fell to 110.4 points from 111.2 points in April, suggesting economic activity could slow in coming months. The breakdown of GDP data showed earlier that growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, was driven entirely by booming domestic demand in the first quarter, while exports \u2013 traditionally a key driver \u2013 put the brakes on activity. Germany grew by 0.8% between January and March, with consumer spending up 0.7% and public spending rising 0.4%. Business investment on factories and machinery was strong, growing at the fastest rate in 3 1/2 years, up 3.3%. As a director on the precious metals desk at Barclays, Plunkett (who has been fined by the FCA and banned from working in the City) was responsible for pricing products linked to the price of precious metals and managing Barclays' risk exposure to those products. The FCA says: Plunkett was responsible for pricing and managing Barclays' risk on a digital exotic options contract (the Digital) that referenced the price of gold during the 3:00 p.m. Gold Fixing on 28 June 2012. If the price fixed above US$1,558.96 (the Barrier) during the 3:00 p.m. Gold Fixing on 28 June 2012, then Barclays would be required to make a payment to its customer. But if the price fixed below the Barrier, Barclays would not have to make that payment. During the 3:00 p.m. Gold Fixing on 28 June 2012, Plunkett placed certain orders with the intent of increasing the likelihood that the price of gold would fix below the Barrier, which it eventually did. As a result, Barclays was not obligated to make the US$3.9m payment to its customer, and Plunkett\u2019s book profited by US$1.75m (excluding hedging), which was in addition to an initial profit that his book had received upon the sale of the Digital. Very shortly after the conclusion of the 3:00 p.m. Gold Fixing on 28 June 2012, the customer became aware that the price had fixed just below the Barrier and sought an explanation from Barclays as to what happened in the Gold Fixing. When Barclays relayed the customer\u2019s concerns to Plunkett on 28 and 29 June 2012, he failed to disclose that he had placed orders and traded during the Gold Fixing. Further, Plunkett misled both Barclays and the FCA by providing an account of events that was untruthful. Read more about the latest Barclays fine on the FCA's website. Barclays has contributed to setting the price of gold in London since June 2004. The Gold Fixing is an important price-setting mechanism which provides market users with the opportunity to buy and sell gold at a single quoted price. Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said: A firm\u2019s lack of controls and a trader's disregard for a customer's interests have allowed the financial services industry\u2019s reputation to be sullied again. Plunkett has paid a heavy price for putting his own interests above the integrity of the market and Barclays\u2019 customer. Traders who might be tempted to exploit their clients for a quick buck should be in no doubt - such behaviour will cost you your reputation and your livelihood. Barclays' failure to identify and manage the risks in its business was extremely disappointing. Plunkett's actions came the day after the publication of our LIBOR and EURIBOR action against Barclays. The investigation and outcomes in that case meant that the firm, and Plunkett, were clearly on notice of the potential for conflicts of interests around benchmarks. We expect all firms to look hard at their reference rate and benchmark operations to ensure this type of behaviour isn\u2019t being replicated. Firms should be in no doubt that the spotlight will remain on wholesale conduct and we will hold them to account if they fail to meet our standards. Barclays has been fined \u00a326m by the Financial Conduct Authority for failings in relation to London gold fixing between 2004 and 2013. Former Barclays trader Daniel James Plunkett has been fined \u00a395,600 and banned from working in the City. The landmark deal by Russia's Gazprom to supply gas to China may affect prices in Europe, the boss of the state-owned company, Alexei Miller, said today. Russia and China signed a 30-year gas supply contract, worth more than $400bn, earlier this week when Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the country. The price was not disclosed, but industry sources told Reuters it was between $350 and $380 per thousand cubic metres, similar to what most European utilities pay under discounted long-term contracts signed in the last two years. The comments came ahead of a report on oil reserves in England by the British Geological Survey, out at 10am. It is expected to show that there are several billion barrels of oil in shale rocks across southern England, but getting it out will involve \"fracking,\" which is controversial. Ratings agency Fitch has upgraded Greece's debt by a notch to B from B-, with a stable outlook. Here is the full statement. The agency said Greece is over the worst, and pointed to the progress made by Athens on debt reduction. The upgrade is a boost for prime minister Antonis Samaras's government before it faces its first major electoral test in local and European Parliament elections on Sunday since it came to power two years ago. The upgraded rating still classes debt-laden Greece's bonds as junk \u2013 \"highly speculative\" \u2013 and is five notches below investment grade. Fitch said: A better fiscal track record is being established. Greece's deficit reduction over the past four years of its two programmes has been remarkable. With the most challenging phase of Greece's adjustment behind it, the rating is becoming less sensitive to policy hold-ups and political crises. In the UK, the anti-EU UKIP party scored strong gains in local elections, early results show, while a Dutch exit poll for the EU elections suggests that the anti-Islam, Eurosceptic Freedom Party had missed its goal of topping the poll. Get the latest news on the UK local elections on Andrew Sparrow's live blog. The Guardian's political editor Patrick Wintour writes: Ukip has delivered the first tremors of the political earthquake promised by Nigel Farage as the party weakened Labour's grip in its northern heartlands and caused the Conservatives to lose control of at least eight flagship councils. Labour pulled off coups by winning David Cameron's favourite London council, Hammersmith and Fulham, as well as Redbridge, Merton and Cambridge. But outside the capital, it struggled to make expected gains in key targets such as Swindon, Walsall, Tamworth and Portsmouth, while losing Thurrock to no overall control because of a surge in Ukip votes. Farage also ate into Conservative strongholds, causing the party to lose control of eight councils, including Maidstone, Southend-on-Sea, Castle Point, Basildon and Brentwood \u2013 the constituency of the local government secretary, Eric Pickles. European stock markets are trading slightly lower this morning, but are more or less steady near last week's six-year highs. Investors are keeping a close eye on Ukraine, where more than a dozen servicemen were reported killed yesterday in a clash with pro-Russian separatists, fuelling security concerns ahead of Sunday's presidential election. The other big event is the EU's marathon parliamentary election. Polling kicked off yesterday in Britain and the Netherlands, and Ireland and the Czech Republic vote today. The vast majority of the EU's 28 member states go to the polls on Sunday. Voting is compulsory in Greece, Belgium, Cyprus and Luxembourg. Find out more about the election here. Right-wing, anti-EU parties are expected to benefit from protest votes in many countries. Suit hire firm Moss Bros has put out an upbeat trading statement ahead of its annual meeting, with like-for-like sales up 6.3% in the 16 weeks to 17 May. Independent City analyst Nick Bubb has looked at it in detail. The AGM trading update today is quite upbeat (\u201cthe Board remains confident the business will meet market expectations for the year\u201d), with overall like-for-like sales running up by 6.3% in the 16 weeks to 17th May, despite a weak wedding hire market. Retail LFL sales, including e-commerce, were up by 8.5%, whilst Hire sales were 3.8% lower. Total e-commerce sales were up by 115% and now comprise 6.5% of total sales. Moss Bros has been one of the best performing stocks in the whole sector so far this year (with the price up from 73p to 123p) and shareholders should be happy with today\u2019s news... After a long search, Standard Life, the insurer, has appointed a new finance chief \u2013 Luke Savage who joins from Lloyd's of London, the world's largest and oldest insurance market. He takes up his new role in August. Standard Life has been without a chief financial officer since Jacqui Hunt stepped down in April last year. Oriel analyst Marcus Barnard said: This is a positive movement for Standard LIfe and removes an outstanding uncertainty. Barrie Cornes, insurance analyst at Panmure Gordon, also welcomed the news. He is well regarded within the Lloyds community as a no-nonsense proactive head of finance and as such we view the appointment as a positive for Standard Life. We note however that the last FD of Lloyds who moved to the company market was Andrew Moss who became FD of Aviva prior to becoming its ill-fated CEO. Although Luke's appointment won't move the share price we think that it is a good move for Standard Life and we reiterate our positive stance and 420p target price. The FTSE 100 index has opened some 7 points lower at 6812.97, a 0.1% loss. France's CAC is flat while Italy's FTSE MIB and Spain's Ibex are down 0.1%. Germany's Dax is bucking the trend, rising 0.1% after strong first-quarter GDP data. FirstGroup shares have opened 4.9% lower after the company lost its Thameslink rail contract. It has been awarded to rail and bus operator Go-Ahead, whose shares are the biggest riser on the FTSE in early trading, up 7%. Amid the IPO frenzy, EasyHotel is floating on the stock market. Zoopla, the property website, and B&amp;M, the budget retailer, announced flotations yesterday. My colleague Sean Farrell reports: Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is listing his easyHotel business on the stock market \u2013 the billionaire\u2019s first flotation since easyJet went public in 2000. EasyHotel is the latest business to tap investors in a feverish market for initial public offerings (IPOs). It is seeking to raise up to \u00a360m on London\u2019s Alternative Investment Market to fund expansion. The company did not say how big a stake it would sell to raise the money or what market value it hoped to secure. Sir Stelios launched his budget hotel chain in 2004 as one of his many businesses under the \u201ceasy\u201d brand, which he owns and licences to easyJet. The company, which is fully owned by Sir Stelios\u2019s easyGroup Holdings, has 20 hotels, 17 of which operate as franchises. EasyHotel has seven hotels in London and one each in Edinburgh and Glasgow with the rest spread across European cities, Dubai, Johannesburg and Sir Stelios\u2019s native Cyprus. After years in the doldrums, the IPO market has gone into overdrive this year as investors bet on economic recovery and look for growth stocks. Zoopla, the property website, and B&amp;M, the budget retailer, were among four companies that announced flotations on Thursday. But investors\u2019 fervour shows signs of waning after a series of recent IPOs, including Pets at Home and Appliances Online, left them out of pocket. FatFace, the leisurewear retailer, pulled its planned float on Thursday and Saga, the over-50s travel and insurance company, had to cut the price of its offering to the bottom of the proposed range. On the corporate front, Saga \u2013 which specialises in insurance and holidays for the over 50s \u2013 has priced its share flotation in London at the bottom of its offer range, valuing the company at \u00a32.1bn and leaving its private equity owners struggling to sell down their stakes. After pricing at 185p a share, the bottom of the 185-245p range, Saga will only sell \u00a3550m of new shares. It is owned by private equity firms Permira, Charterhouse and CVC, which can sell 15% of teh share capital in an over-allotment option or greenshoe, assuming there is enough demand. Otherwise they are subject to a 180-day lock-up. Half of the new shares have been allocated to retail investors, and half to institutions. More on the German growth numbers: investment in factories and machinery rose by 3.3% in the first quarter, the biggest gain in 3 1/2 years, while construction investment saw the biggest rise in three years, up 3.6%. Overall economic growth doubled from the fourth quarter rate of 0.4%. This cements Germany's position as the growth locomotive of the eurozone's \u20ac9.5 trillion economy, which expanded by just 0.2% in the first quarter, according to preliminary figures. But things are starting to look up, some economists say. Holger Sandte of Nordea said: We expect that exports will gain speed too. The rest of the eurozone is not doing so badly any more. The German GDP numbers are out: strong investment and consumer spending propelled the German economy to its fastest growth in three years between January and March. However, a word of caution: growth was helped by milder than usual winter weather and is expected to slow. Data from Germany's Federal Statistics Office showed Europe's largest economy expanded by 0.8% in the first quarter, in line with an earlier flash estimate. Compared with a year ago, GDP was up 2.5%. Exports \u2013 usually one of the main drivers of German growth \u2013 were hit by economic weakness in Germany's trading partners and were a drag on growth. The Statistics Office said: Positive impetus came exclusively from wihtin the country in a quarter-on-quarter comparison. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. As Europe goes to the polls, markets are set for a mixed open. Voters are electing 751 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Voting takes place on different days but the election results from all 28 EU countries are due on Sunday evening. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: While elections are not expected to cause any disruption to today\u2019s session, France\u2019s disappointing manufacturing and services PMIs yesterday highlights the difficulty being felt outside of Germany in the EU. There is still high unemployment and very little growth and the electorate is understandably in a state of discontent with the status quo in some counties. The performance of the increasingly popular euro-sceptic parties across Europe will be an important gauge of how much political will there is to carry out necessary fiscal and structural reforms to promote competitiveness, growth and employment. It is a light day for economic data, with nothing scheduled in the UK. The breakdown of German GDP growth in the first quarter has just come out \u2013 more later. We will also get the latest German Ifo business confidence survey later, which is expected to show a small dip in sentiment. Lawler's equity market calls: FTSE100 is expected to open 1 point lower at 6,819 DAX is expected to open 9 points higher at 9,729 CAC40 is expected to open 3 points lower at 4,475",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has lodged a formal complaint with the European commission after French police raided its Marseille offices as part of an new inquiry into the low cost airline's operations in France. The Dublin-based company has sent protest letters to Brussels, the Irish government and the French embassy in Dublin claiming it is being unjustly targeted. \"It is unacceptable that a European airline that is conforming perfectly with European employment law in the air sector should be hindered in an unfair and illegal way by magistrates and local gendarmes in Marseille,\" it wrote. Dominique Moyal, however, a public prosecutor, told Le Monde newspaper that the search was part of a \"legal inquiry that was opened several months ago\" into whether Ryanair continued to flout French employment law. The airline was fined \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3162,000) and ordered to pay almost \u20ac9m in interest and damages in October 2013 after being convicted in a French court of breaching the law by employing its 127 French-based staff on Irish contracts. Ryanair argued that the arrangement complied with EU rules on workers' mobility and has appealed against the judgment. The airline closed its base in Marseille in 2011, and has since only operated flights during the summer. The new inquiry was launched after a complaint by the French pilots' union. Another outpost of Ryanair's European network suffered a rebellion this week when a group of pilots used the Berlin air show to voice their complaints against the airline. At an event speakers said a third of the pilots planned to leave the company within a year, complaining of a lack of respect from management. According to German reports, speakers at the event said 95% of Ryanair pilots are unable to take regular holidays and receive poor pay after taxes and fees are deducted from their gross salary. Five hundred pilots have left the company in the last 18 months, according to a survey presented at the event. Ryanair said the claims reported from the event were false and that the survey of pilots had been carried out by a company run by the pilots of direct competitors Air France, KLM and Aer Lingus. Ryanair did, however, acknowledge this week that it had done too little to assuage passengers' concerns. The airline said it was \"asleep at the wheel\" as passenger disquiet grew over its customer service standards. Its deputy chief executive, Howard Millar, made the admission as the company reported its first drop in annual profits in five years, down 8% to \u20ac523m amid downward pressure on fares across the industry. \"The low fares industry has evolved.

TSGN will also deliver the government's Thameslink project, for which major work on track and stations is well under way that will allow 24 trains an hour to travel between Blackfriars and St Pancras in central London. Brown said they would draw on Keolis's experience of Paris's RER cross-city transit.</p> <p>The franchise departs from previous models, with Govia now handing over revenue to the government rather than paying set premiums. Instead, the DfT will pay Govia a flat fee of around \u00a38.9bn over the seven years, from expected revenues of \u00a312.4bn \u2013 effectively generating a total premium of \u00a33.5bn from Govia in traditional terms.</p> <p>The train operator expects to make a 3% profit.

Gatwick airport said it warmly welcomed news of the award, saying it would \"deliver a hugely improved service and experience for our passengers as well as the local communities\". Another 150 new carriages will replace the 40-year-old trains currently operating on the route between Moorgate, north London and Hertfordshire, in 2018.</p> <p>The new operator will also have to meet tough targets to improve punctuality, reducing delays by around a fifth, and to improve cleanliness. A \u00a350m investment to enhance the 239 stations will include improvinged access and information, with free wifi onat aroundbout half of them.</p> <p>Combined, tThe existing Thameslink and Southern franchises account for 273 million passenger journeys a year, employ 6,500 people and generate annual passenger revenues ticket sales of \u00a31.3bn. The Southern and Gatwick Express brands will be retained, while Thameslink replaces First Capital Connect from September.</p> <p>Go-Ahead shares rose 10% on Friday morning.</p> <p>The rail minister, Stephen Hammond, said: \"A world class railway is a vital part of our long-term economic plan. New state-of-the-art trains, more seats, better connections and improved stations will transform travel across London and the south-east. That's great news for businesses and the hundreds of thousands of passengers who use these vital services every day.\"</p> <p>The outcome was another blow to FirstGroup's rail ambitions after it won the west coast route in 2012, but then promptly lost the franchise when the DfT admitted the bidding process was flawed. FirstGroup shares fell 3.6% in early trading. FirstGroup's T, and the company's chief executive, the former London Underground boss Tim O'Toole, said he was disappointed to lose the route.</p> <p>\"We submitted a strong bid which would have delivered high quality services for passengers, value for taxpayers and an economic return for shareholders,\" he said. \"We are tremendously proud to have operated a significant part of this network over the past eight years through our First Capital Connect franchise, and of the many improvements we have delivered during that time.\"</p>",

Another 150 new carriages will replace the 40-year-old trains currently operating on the route between Moorgate, north London and Hertfordshire, in 2018. The new operator will also have to meet tough targets to improve punctuality, reducing delays by around a fifth, and to improve cleanliness. A \u00a350m investment to enhance the 239 stations will include improvinged access and information, with free wifi onat aroundbout half of them. Combined, tThe existing Thameslink and Southern franchises account for 273 million passenger journeys a year, employ 6,500 people and generate annual passenger revenues ticket sales of \u00a31.3bn. The Southern and Gatwick Express brands will be retained, while Thameslink replaces First Capital Connect from September. Go-Ahead shares rose 10% on Friday morning. The rail minister, Stephen Hammond, said: \"A world class railway is a vital part of our long-term economic plan. New state-of-the-art trains, more seats, better connections and improved stations will transform travel across London and the south-east. That's great news for businesses and the hundreds of thousands of passengers who use these vital services every day.\" The outcome was another blow to FirstGroup's rail ambitions after it won the west coast route in 2012, but then promptly lost the franchise when the DfT admitted the bidding process was flawed. FirstGroup shares fell 3.6% in early trading. FirstGroup's T, and the company's chief executive, the former London Underground boss Tim O'Toole, said he was disappointed to lose the route. \"We submitted a strong bid which would have delivered high quality services for passengers, value for taxpayers and an economic return for shareholders,\" he said. \"We are tremendously proud to have operated a significant part of this network over the past eight years through our First Capital Connect franchise, and of the many improvements we have delivered during that time.\"",

Almost two years after being hit with a \u00a3290m fine for rigging the Libor rate, Barclays is now facing the wrath of regulators again, this time for almost 10 years of inadequate oversight of the setting of the price of gold, known as the fix. Barclays' chief executive, Antony Jenkins, who was promoted to replace Bob Diamond in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, insisted the bank was already making changes to its culture to avoid such problems happening again. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it had fined Daniel James Plunkett \u00a395,600 and banned him from working in key roles in the City \u2013 for which he would need to be authorised \u2013 after he was tempted to make a \"quick buck\" from a client. His actions took place on 28 June 2012, the day after the announcement of the bank's Libor fine unleashed a furious public reaction that led to the creation of the parliamentary commission on banking standards. The Bank was fined for failing to have systems and controls in place over the gold price fix between 2004 and 2013.

A number of lawsuits have already been filed relating to alleged price manipulation. A source familiar with the Barclays fine said it was a one-off and not part of a wider investigation. Barclays: a sorry tale \"We are truly sorry for what has happened and that you have been let down.\" July 2012: then Barclays chairman Marcus Agius began what was to become a string of apologies by the bank in a public letter \"The industry, and Barclays, got it wrong on occasions. We were too aggressive, we were too short-term focused and too self-serving\" January 2013: after a series of management changes, new boss Antony Jenkins talks to an audience in Davos \"Trust is a very easy thing to lose, and a very hard thing to win back\" December 2013: Jenkins, as guest editor of the Today programme \"We get it. The world has changed, the industry must change, there is no going back to the way things were\" February 2014: Jenkins at a conference in Brussels \"We very much regret the situation that led to this settlement. Barclays has undertaken a significant amount of work to enhance our systems and controls and is committed to the highest standards across all of our operations.\" 23 May 2014: Jenkins again returns to the theme",
