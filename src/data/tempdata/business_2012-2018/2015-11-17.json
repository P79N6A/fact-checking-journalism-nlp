      "bodyText": "Six months ago it was possible to think Aldi and Lidl had enjoyed their moment in the sun and that the fightback by the old guard \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 would have an impact. After all, the big four told us they were \u201cinvesting\u201d in price \u2013 their coy term for cutting prices \u2013 while improving service and the quality of goods. The tactics aren\u2019t working, or at least they haven\u2019t been pursued sufficiently aggressively. The latest data from compilers Kantar shows Aldi and Lidl are accelerating again. As a pair, the discounters are now 10% of the market. Part of that increase is mechanical \u2013 if you open more stores when others do not, your share of the market tends to increase. But consumers are also happy to shop around: almost half of all shoppers now visit a discounter and a regular full-line supermarket every quarter. As Kantar pointed out, Aldi and Lidl have grown from 5% of the market to 10% since 2012; it had previously taken the duo nine years to crawl from 2.5% to 5%. It is probably now too late to prevent the discounters from claiming 15% because they are flogging expansion for all its worth. But, if the mainstream brigade wish to stop 15% becoming 20%, they will have to start throwing some punches that the opposition actually feels. It is jarring, for example, to hear Andy Clarke, the chief executive of Asda, after yet another weak trading quarter, talk about \u201cclosing the gap\u201d with the limited assortment discounters. Why can\u2019t Asda offer a core range of similar goods that eliminates, rather than merely closes, the gap? The short answer is that Asda prefers to protect its profit margins as far as it can. But that strategy is starting to look extremely short-termist. David McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, suggests the big boys should lower prices by 15% on their core ranges. That sounds more like what is required. EasyJet profits fly higher It seems like only yesterday that easyJet was ordering more aircraft to meet predicted demand, defying the wishes of its founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who thought the board was engaged in a \u201cvanity exercise\u201d that would destroy shareholder value. Actually, it was 2013, but now the airline has its chequebook out again. Another 36 Airbus A320s have been ordered. We don\u2019t know what Haji-Ioannou thinks today but, as last time, one suspects easyJet\u2019s board would be able to deflect the suggestion of overexpansion. Predicting passenger growth of 7% a year into the middle distance may sound adventurous, but the truth is that easyJet and Ryanair are competing as strongly as ever with the old national flag-carriers. Those airlines may try to imitate the low-cost model, but easyJet and Ryanair remain streets ahead. Last year was the fifth to see an increase in annual profits, a rise of 18% to \u00a3686m. Being picky, easyJet said nothing to prompt the City to raise forecasts for the current year, which is why the share price fell 4% after a strong run. But it\u2019s hard to argue with a dividend that has gone from zero in 2010 to 55.2p a share now. For the Haji-Ioannou family, with a 34% holding, that\u2019s worth \u00a374m. One of these years, Haji-Ioannou\u2019s old worry that new aircraft will be used to chase growth on lower-margin routes in an oversupplied market may be proved correct. But, on easyJet\u2019s current form, it still feels like next decade\u2019s concern. Luckily for him, Haji-Ioannou didn\u2019t follow his scepticism by selling many shares. The banking debate must remain public The banking lobby is feeling confident again, which is why Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, felt compelled on Monday to warn regulators not to yield to special pleading. As mentioned here on Tuesday, he said new rules, including the erection of ringfences between retail and investment banking units, had to be implemented speedily, as parliament intended. On Tuesday Tyrie had a chance to question regulator-in-chief Andrew Bailey, the head of the Prudential Regulation Authority. It gave rise to an odd exchange in which Bailey said he doesn\u2019t like banks (Barclays was mentioned) airing their grievances via the press; he would prefer them to approach the PRA directly. This seems unnecessarily fussy. The correct answer, surely, would have been to say that the PRA is confident in its judgments and quite capable of countering the banks\u2019 lobbying machine wherever, and however, it operates. Bailey, thankfully, said nothing to suggest he has gone soft, but this preference for conducting debates behind closed doors is not reassuring. The rest of us would rather hear the bankers\u2019 whinges: it makes it easier to detect concessions.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Defence company shares moved sharply higher as France promised to increase spending on security and launched a new wave of strikes on Isis in the wake of last week\u2019s attacks in Paris. Smiths Group, which makes detection systems used in airports, surged 10% to \u00a310.20, making it the biggest riser in a buoyant FTSE 100, despite the company reporting a 4% fall in first quarter profits. Rolls-Royce \u2013 where 15% of revenues come from defence \u2013 rose 5% to 555p and arms manufacturer BAE Systems climbed 2% to 473p. Chris O\u2019Shea, Smiths\u2019 finance director, said: \u201cSad as it is, [the Paris attack] is the kind of thing that can drive demand for our product. You\u2019ll find with large pieces of infrastructure, they\u2019ll review what they\u2019ve got and find it\u2019s not the most up to date product. It\u2019s a reminder to people that you need to keep this stuff up to date.\u201d Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets said: \u201cGiven \u2026 the near certainty that western powers will be vastly upping their vigilance in the long term, Smiths\u2019 capability in threat and contraband detection is likely to be in ever increasing demand.\u201d Meanwhile, Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of easyJet, said increased airport security was inevitable after the Paris attacks and the crash of a Russian jet over Egypt, caused by what the Russian government said was a bomb. \u201cAcross Europe, people will be much more aware of security and that\u2019s a good thing, and wherever there are gaps, that will be tightened and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d McCall said. \u201cIt will take a little bit longer to get through airport security, but I don\u2019t think passengers will mind that because it\u2019s safety first.\u201d EasyJet\u2019s 18% rise in full-year profits to \u00a3686m was overshadowed by the attacks on France, and McCall said there had been a \u201ccooling-off\u201d period since Friday with passengers wary of flying to the country. \u201cThere was definitely an increased number of no-shows on flights to France,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is specific at the moment to France.\u201d On Monday, more than \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn) was wiped off shares in European travel and hotel companies amid concerns the attacks would damage tourism and consumer confidence. But the sector recovered some ground on Tuesday, with holiday group TUI up 2% at \u00a311.10 and InterContinental Hotels adding 1.5% to \u00a325. Mining shares were among the main fallers as copper fell to its lowest level for six years, hit by renewed worries about falling demand in China and a strong dollar, which makes commodities more expensive outside the US. Overall, the FTSE 100 jumped nearly 2% or 122 points to 6,268 while France\u2019s Cac added 2.8% and Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.4%, as investors shrugged off concerns that the Paris attacks would have a lasting effect on the global economy. Markets were also comforted by the prospect of central banks providing more stimulus measures if growth did slow down dramatically. In the case of the European Central Bank that would mean extending its quantitative easing programme and, for the US Federal Reserve, not raising interest rates in December after all. News that Greece had reached an agreement with its creditors also provided some support for European shares. Meawhile, on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average had climbed 95 points, or 0.5%, by lunchtime in New York.",

      "bodyText": "As the readership of lads\u2019 mags has declined, their dwindling audience has migrated to the internet. Men looking for their daily fix of irreverent humour, tales of the bizarre and scantily clad models can now find everything they want online without paying a penny. The big winner to emerge from this transition is controversial social media site the Lad Bible, which has built a huge following since it was launched in 2012 by entrepreneurs Alex Solomou and Arian Kalantari. The Lad Bible has consciously targeted those young men who used to read magazines such as FHM and Zoo, which will both close at the end of the year, and has been accused of unfettered sexism. The site\u2019s own Facebook data suggests that half of all British men between 18 and 24 read the Lad Bible, but also 20% of women in that age group. Its first detailed accounts are due to be filed within weeks and are expected to show it is in profit, on the back of revenues of more than \u00a33m. The company\u2019s income largely comes from advertising and it says it is debt free. Swift expansion has been built on low overheads and savvy use of social media, to the point where the Lad Bible claims to reach 150 million people a week through Facebook alone. Web audience statistics place the site as the 12th most popular in the UK, ahead of PayPal and Mail Online. Staff numbers have increased from 25 to 70 in the past few months. The only accounts filed with Companies House give limited data but do show that shareholders had \u00a3198,000 at their disposal at the end of 2014. A company spokesman denied that the site promotes misogyny, pointing to its popularity among women. \u201cWomen love it,\u201d she said, adding that the Lad Bible aims to ensure that \u201cwomen cannot be the butt of the joke always\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "With investors seemingly convinced that the Paris attacks will not have a long term effect on the global economy - and even if they did, central banks would act to provide more stimulus - leading shares enjoyed a buoyant day. Defence companies were among the main risers as France stepped up its air strikes on Isis, while travel and leisure businesses recovered from Monday\u2019s losses. News that Greece had reached an agreement with its creditors which could release \u20ac2bn of bailout funds also helped sentiment. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 122.38 points or 1.99% higher at 6268.76 France\u2019s Cac closed up 2.77% at 4937.31 Germany\u2019s Dax added 2.41% to 10,971.04 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.28% to 22,309.39 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.36% at 10.363.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.18% to 657.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 96 points or 0.5% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on US inflation, and financial information group Markit also believes a rate rise is likely next month: The sustained strength of underlying price pressures... adds weight to the belief that the Fed will start hiking interest rates in December, especially as the odds look to be tilted more towards inflation rising than falling in coming months. Still with Greece, and here is the official European Commission announcement on the agreement between the country and its creditors: The Greek authorities and the institutions have reached substantive agreement on all outstanding issues regarding the measures included in the first set of milestones and on the financial sector measures that are essential for a successful recapitalisation process. This is good news. The Eurogroup Working Group discussed the state of play today and welcomed the substantive progress made. Legislation will be adopted in the Greek parliament on Thursday. Upon the completion of the agreed conditionality and the implemented legislation, the Eurogroup/EWG stand ready to support the disbursement of the \u20ac2 billion sub-tranche linked to the first set of milestones and the transfer to the HFSF of the funds needed for the recapitalisation of the Greek banking sector, as required, out of the \u20ac10 billion earmarked for this purpose. [A reminder: the EWG is the Euro Working Group and the HFSF is the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, a vehicle set up to help stabilise the Greek banking sector.] Here\u2019s more on the marches underway in Greece to mark the uprising against military rule: US markets have slipped back in early trading after Monday\u2019s surge, with energy shares hit by weakness in the crude oil price amid renewed concerns about oversupply and falling demand. Brent crude is currently 1.9% lower at $43.73 a barrel. Investors were also cautious after US inflation figures suggested there was little to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates at its meeting next month. So despite better than expected results from Wal-Mart, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1% and the S&amp;P 500 is 0.12% lower. Here are more details about the agreement reached between Greece and its creditors to free up \u20ac12bn of bailout cash and funds to recapitalise the country\u2019s banks. One of the main sticking points seems to have now been resolved: there has been a compromise on foreclosing on people who get into arrears with their mortgages, which will protect around 60% of endebted households (see earlier). AP reports: Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Greece and the creditors had reached a deal on all outstanding issues, a development that also brings promised discussions on reducing Greece\u2019s debt burden one step nearer. \u201cI am happy to confirm that agreement has been reached on the remaining measures needed to complete the first set of milestones,\u201d he told a press briefing in Brussels. \u201cWe expect finalization of the process to take place shortly following the swift adoption of necessary legislation by the Greek Parliament on Thursday,\u201d he added. Once Greek lawmakers approve the measures, Moscovici said the institutions that oversee Greece\u2019s bailout program will assess Athens\u2019 compliance, paving the way for the cash disbursements. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, was similarly upbeat, hailing the \u201cgood news\u201d of a \u201csubstantive agreement.\u201d In Athens, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos confirmed that legislation would be fast-tracked though parliament and voted on late Thursday. \u201cIt was a difficult negotiation that was held under a lot of time pressure,\u201d Tsakalotos said. \u201cThe pressing issue was the bank recapitalization ... We want banks that will not just keep their heads above water but will start giving loans.\u201d The government has also agreed a gambling tax on games at betting firm OPAP, to raise between \u20ac300m and \u20ac400m a year and to replace a controversial 23% VAT rate on education, Reuters is reporting. Back with Greece: (NPLs are non-performing loans, EWG is the Euro Working Group assessing the details of the proposals) More US data, and industrial production fell in October for the second straight month. It dipped by 0.2% after a 0.2% decline in September. That compares to expectations of a 0.1% rise last month. ING\u2019s Rob Carnell again: A mixed production report from the US for October, with overall production down 0.2% month on month, but a better then expected manufacturing figure, which registered a 0.4% month on month gain. All of the weakness was contained in the utilities and mining sectors - with mining no doubt reflecting ongoing softness of production in the oil and gas sector. We doubt policy-makers will be too disappointed with these figures, though the overall strength of the US economy does mask important areas of weakness, such as the goods producing sector, and additional headaches for the Fed as it seeks to normalise policy rates. October\u2019s US inflation figures give more fuel to the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its December meeting, analysts believe. Inflation rose 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in September, with the core rate of inflation - which strips out food and energy - unchanged at 1.9% year on year. David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo, said: Ultimately, the inflation numbers do nothing to dampen speculation that the Fed is limbering up to hike rates for the first time since June 2006 at its FOMC meeting next month. Rob Carnell at ING Bank suggested there was the prospect not only of a rise in December but the chance of further increases shortly after: By February next year, there should be very little drag on headline inflation from oil/energy prices, unless we see a considerable further decline in oil from its already depressed levels. And as we approach this point, we should see headline inflation rapidly begin to close in on these higher core figures. This of course raises the prospect that if the Fed does indeed raise rates in December, as we and the market now believes likely, and if the October hourly wages growth increase was not a one off, then the Fed is going to come under rising pressure to consider a further March hike in addition to any December increase. We believe that the Fed will want to stick to its \u201ccautious\u201d approach to normalising rates, but if this conflicts with a buoyant activity and broad price picture, then longer dated bond yields are going to come under upward pressure, with the Fed having to fight any tendency for the dollar to appreciate by keeping policy rate expectations capped. Here\u2019s a quick recap European stock markets have bounced sharply today, as investors put aside concerns that last week\u2019s terror attacks will hurt the global recovery. The Paris market is leading the rally, up over 2% right now, cheered by France\u2019s determination to win the fight against Islamic State. It follows a recovery in Asia overnight. Lorne Baring, managing director of B Capital Wealth Management, says: \u201cInvestors are showing resilience to the recent attacks in Paris despite mounting worries over security in Europe.\u201d Defence stocks have jumped, as France asks its EU allies for help. Manuel Valls has confirmed that France\u2019s plans for higher security spending mean it will not get its budget deficit into line by 2017. The 3% of GDP target will \u201cnecessarily be exceeded\u201d, he said. The Commission has already signalled its support for the move. Pierre Moscovici told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cThe security of citizens in France and everywhere is the absolute priority. The Commission will show full understanding for that priority\u201d. The euro has hit its lowest point since April. It weakened as economists predict fresh stimulus measures from the European Central Bank soon. Christoph Riniker, Head of Equity Strategy Research at Julius Baer, explains: \u201cThe latest developments after the terror attacks in Paris will strengthen the political support for ECB actions in order to extend its balance sheet further at its upcoming meeting on 3 December. Elsewhere in Europe, Greece has reached an agreement to unlock its next bailout payments. And in the world of data: UK inflation is still negative, with prices down by 0.1% The US inflation rate has inched up to 0.2% And German investor confidence has risen Her\u2019s some colour (or color, perhaps) from today\u2019s US inflation report, showing how prices of essentials and non-essentials alike are creeping up. Just in... America\u2019s inflation rate rate has inched higher in October. The US consumer prices index rose by 0.2% last month, on both a monthly and an annual basis. That\u2019s up from +0.1% year-on-year in September, suggesting a slight build-up in inflationary pressures. And core inflation, which strips out food and energy, came in at 1.9%. That could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs at next month\u2019s meeting. Celebrations and marches are currently underway in Greece to mark the 42nd uprising against military rule - a student revolt that paved the way to the collapse of seven years of US-backed dictatorship. Helena Smith has the details: Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, was heckled this morning when he laid a wreath at the Athens Polytechnic. The anniversary is often exploited by black clad anarchists to run riot when Greeks traditionally stage a protest march to the US embassy. Addressing parliament, Tsipras berated the \u201cso-called anti-establishment\u201d and said they should not be allowed to \u201cspeak in the name of the people.\u201d Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party, in the past, was frequently accused of having ties to the anti-establishment bloc - Tsipras\u2019 intervention will be interpreted as yet another milestone in the politician\u2019s reincarnation as a centrist leftist. And a march is getting underway in Athens now: The Greek stock market has jumped by 2.5% today, after a preliminary deal was finally struck between Athens and its lenders over how to address defaulting mortgages. The agreement must be passed by the Greek parliament, but it should unlock \u20ac2bn of aid and \u20ac10bn of new capital for Greece\u2019s banking sector. Precise details aren\u2019t available. But a Greek government source has said the compromise reached will protect around 60% of indebted households from having their primary residence seized. Analyst site Macropolis says that houses worth less than \u20ac170,000 could be protected: The Greek government had originally wanted to protect the poorest 70%, while creditors had only wanted to exclude 20% from seizure (ie, meaning cheaper houses could be repossessed). Officials have told our Helena Smith that: \u201cWe will table the agreement in parliament today prior to a vote probably on Thursday.\u201d Money continues to pour into defence stocks this morning, on anticipation that Europe will be spending rather more on security measures. The STOXX Europe total market aerospace index is currently up 2.8%, adding to yesterday\u2019s gains. This comes as France makes a formal request to its EU allies for help - the first time that the treaty clause seeking military assistance has been triggered. French aerospace group Thales\u2019s shares are up almost 3.5% today. It makes short-range missile systems, command and control kit, and various naval and underwater equipment. Rolls-Royce, whose engines are used across the military, is up almost 4%. BAE Systems is up 1.6%. It makes aircraft such as the Eurofighter, various military vehicles, and also offers cyber security protection. Citi economists have already told clients that: \u201cWe expect extra spending on policing, private security and military intervention.\u201d Italy, Spain, Austria and Lithuania have all been told that their budgets for 2016 risk breaking EU targets: France\u2019s 2016 budget has met with approval, though. Paris is already under Brussels\u2019 \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u201d, giving it until 2017 to get its borrowing into line (the target that is now going to be missed). The Paris stock market continues to climb - now up 113 points, or 2.3%, at 4918. Commission vice-president Vladis Dombrovskis has also indicated that Brussels won\u2019t try to block France\u2019s new security spending blitz. I\u2019m \u201cconfident that we can find a way\u201d to adjust budget targets to account for the events in Paris, he told Bloomberg TV. Unfortunately the feed cut out before Dombrovskis could say whether EU countries struggling to cope with the refugee crisis would also get more budget leeway. Pierre Moscovici\u2019s team have also tweeted that the Commission will show an \u201cintelligent and humane\u201d approach to Paris: The European Commission has just backed France\u2019s decision to boost security spending at the expense of deficit reduction. Economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has told reporters in Brussels that the EC will show \u201cfull understanding\u201d of France\u2019s situation, after Paris said it will not get its deficit below the target of 3% of GDP by 2017. Moscovici (a former French finance minister) insists there is flexibility within the rules to allow states leeway, when needed. He says: \u201cOne thing that is clear in the current circumstances is that in this terrible moment the protection of citizens, the security of citizens in France and Europe is the priority.\u201d We may be accused of being inflexible, but actually we can adapt to all kinds of situation, Moscovici adds. France\u2019s pledge to spend whatever it takes to defeat ISIS is pushing shares higher still. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are cheering the French government\u2019s plan to breach deficit rules in favour of security spending - as outlined by PM Valls this morning. It\u2019s simply unrealistic to expect the French government can balance its books and enforce austerity at a time when it must also spend more on defence and intelligence. Mahony explains: President Francois Hollande is looking to flout EU rules over budget deficits in order to cancel defence cuts, while promising heightened security across the board. The fiscal boost of expansion of defence spending is likely to be something that will play out across Europe as the war against ISIS intensifies and the 4% rise in BAE shares so far this week perfectly illustrates this. The downing of a Russian plane over Egypt by ISIS-linked terrorists only goes to expand the idea that military spending will rise globally over time. The Paris CAC 40 index has extended its rally. It\u2019s now up by 2%, up 97 points at 4901. London\u2019s FTSE 100, and the German DAX, have both gained around 1.7%. Defence companies are leading the London stock market on anticipation that they\u2019ll benefit from France\u2019s new security spending plans. Smiths Group, the UK engineering firm which also makes high tech body scanners, has risen by 10% after reporting that current trading is broadly in line with expectations. Nick Fletcher\u2019s latest market report has all the details: German investor confidence has bounced back. Data just released by the ZEW institute showed that economic sentiment rose in October, despite the slowdown in emerging markets this summer. ZEW\u2019s forward-looking growth expectations index jumped to 10.4, from just 1.9 in October. It suggests Europe\u2019s largest economy will keep growing in the final months of 2015. These falling prices do raise fears that Britain is heading into deflation. But Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, argues that negative inflation should be welcomed: \u201cFalling prices of essentials, including food and energy, are delivering a windfall bonus to UK consumers, bolstering spending power and enabling consumers to spend more on cars and \u201cbig ticket\u201d items. This reduction in prices, combined with rising real incomes and ultra-low interest rates, should help the UK recovery plough on despite the headwinds from emerging markets.\u201d A reminder from RBS that cheaper oil played a key role dragging down UK inflation: Something curious happened in the drinks sector last month too. The ONS reports that alcoholic beverages and tobacco prices fell by 0.4% between September and October this year compared with a rise of 0.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. This is the first time that prices, overall, have fallen in this sector between a September and October since 2009 and the largest fall between these 2 months since official records began in 1996. Could it be a knock-on effect from England\u2019s rugby World Cup exit? Or a surge of discounting by supermarkets? All theories welcome... Education prices dragged back inflation in October, according to the ONS. But that\u2019s not because going to college has suddenly become cheaper. Instead, it\u2019s because most students are now paying tuition fees, which were introduced in 2012 (so it\u2019s only 4th-year students who are paying more than a year ago). So education costs only rose by 3.6% between September and October this year compared with a larger rise of 7.9% in 2014. This chart shows which items are cheaper than a year ago, and what still costs more: UK inflation has been bobbing around zero all year: UK inflation was minus 0.1% year-on-year in October, meaning prices are still falling (a little) across the economy. That matches September\u2019s reading, and is the first time the annual CPI has fallen two months running since the series was created in 1996. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices all pushed inflation down last month, the Office for National Statistics reports, while clothing and footwear prices rose. The boss of budget airline easyJet has predicted that passengers won\u2019t be deterred by the Paris attacks. Speaking on the BBC Today programme, Carolyn McCall said: \u201cIf you look at any tragic event that has happened \u2013 and it\u2019s been terrible what has happened in Paris and we have over a thousand people out there \u2013 post-9-11 and post-7-7 things start to get back and people get mobile and they want to travel again,\u201d \u201cOur profitability has been driven by more passenger demand \u2026 There is a real demand for travel and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to abate.\u201d She was talking after easyJet posted another year of record profits: Speculation that the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy next month is pushing the euro down. The single currency has hit $1.10647 against the US dollar - the lowest since early April. Tony Cross, analyst at TrustNet Direct, sums up the morning: London equities are certainly making good progress shortly after the open, with the vast majority of FTSE-100 constituents in positive territory and the index as a whole already having added in excess of 1%. Strong gains in both US and Asian sessions appears to be the driver here, although it\u2019s difficult to pin the move on any single piece of fundamental data \u2013 but it\u2019s clear that at least for now, the majority of stocks globally remain unfazed by last week\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris. Confidence is rippling through Europe\u2019s stock markets, pushing the main indices all higher this morning. There are solid gains in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan. The STOXX 600 index, which tracks Europe\u2019s biggest 600 companies, has jumped 1.5%, echoing last night\u2019s rally on Wall Street. Two factors appear to be driving the rally: 1) Investors are concluding that the atrocities in Paris are unlikely to have a long-term impact on growth, and thus corporate profitability. History shows that terrorist attacks don\u2019t have a long-term effect on markets (although they often have a short-term impact) France\u2019s determination to breach deficit rules to boost its security spending could also be good for growth, as Paris will effectively be pumping more money into its economy. 2) Central banks are more likely to keep monetary policy loose. Two senior ECB officials warned on Monday that confidence could be damaged by the Paris attacks, suggesting it may announce more stimulus moves soon. French hotel group Accor was one of the big fallers on Monday, dropping 7% at one stage. But it\u2019s leading the risers on the Paris market index today, up nearly 2%: France\u2019s prime minister has confirmed that Paris will not be sticking to the budget rules imposed by Brussels, as it beefs up its security spending. Manuel Valls told France Inter ratio this morning that European fiscal rules would not be allowed to prevent France taking the necessary measures in response to Friday\u2019s attacks. Reuters has the details: The deficit target will \u201cnecessarily be exceeded\u201d as France amends budget plans to hire 10,000 more police and gendarmes and boost their resources, Valls told France Inter radio. \u201cThe European Commission must understand,\u201d Valls said, that the struggle against Islamic State militants \u201cconcerns France but also concerns Europe\u201d. France was already on track to breach the EU\u2019s 3% deficit target, by borrowing 3.3% of GDP next year. Hiring thousands more police and security officials will push spending higher. European markets are open, and rallying. The FTSE 100 has jumped by more than 1%, gaining 70 points to 6215. France\u2019s CAC index and Germany\u2019s DAX have both gained around 1% too, as the overnight rally in Asia ripples across to Europe. World stock markets are pulling a \u2018stunning u-turn\u2019 today, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. It\u2019s a sign of the times how easily markets can digest such geopolitical horrors and demonstrate such resilience in the face of atrocity. Stock market gains comes in spite of lingering worries about a slowing China (Copper has hit fresh 6 year lows) and the US dollar hitting new highs as traders price in a December US rate hike and global central bank policy divergence. It\u2019s Turnaround Tuesday in Tokyo. Having shed 1% on Monday following the awful events in Paris, Japan\u2019s benchmark index recovered its losses - and more - today to finish 1.2% higher. Other markets also rallied - apart from China which was pretty flat. Investors are encouraged by the solid trading in Europe yesterday, as traders in London, Paris and Frankfurt held their collective nerve. Hikaru Sato, senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, explains: \u201cInvestors think that the attacks in Paris would have little impact on the global economy in the long-term.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are rallying today, as international investors put aside worries that the tragic attacks in Paris will derail the global economy. Asia indices have all risen overnight, and spread betters are calling Europe higher too. The London and Paris markets are both expected to jump, after showing resilience yesterday during a day when \u20ac2.5bn was wiped off the travel sector. Also coming up this morning, new inflation figures from the UK may show that prices fell again last month. US inflation data is coming up later, and may show a small increase in the cost of living. 9.30am GMT: UK inflation: Expected to remain at -0.1% 10am GMT: German ZEW confidence figures 1.30pm GMT: US inflation Data: Expected to rise to 0.1% from 0% And there may be developments in Greece, where talks continued last night with creditors over the remaining bad loan measures needed before Athens gets its aid tranche. Greek officials say a preliminary deal has been reached, which could unlock bailout funds. It\u2019s also the 42nd anniversary of the famous student uprising against the junta at Athens Polytechnic, so security in the capital will be tight. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

And as we approach this point, we should see headline inflation rapidly begin to close in on these higher core figures.</p> <p>This of course raises the prospect that if the Fed does indeed raise rates in December, as we and the market now believes likely, and if the October hourly wages growth increase was not a one off, then the Fed is going to come under rising pressure to consider a further March hike in addition to any December increase.</p> <p>We believe that the Fed will want to stick to its \u201ccautious\u201d approach to normalising rates, but if this conflicts with a buoyant activity and broad price picture, then longer dated bond yields are going to come under upward pressure, with the Fed having to fight any tendency for the dollar to appreciate by keeping policy rate expectations capped.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-564b314ee4b0e0595dc6c5fa\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-17T14:08:59.155Z\">2.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime(ish) summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a quick recap</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/17/stock-markets-bounce-back-uk-us-inflation-live#block-564affcce4b0e0595dc6c519\">European stock markets have bounced sharply today, as investors put aside concerns that last week\u2019s terror attacks will hurt the global recovery</a>.</strong></p> <p>The Paris market is leading the rally, up over 2% right now, cheered by France\u2019s determination to win the fight against Islamic State. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/17/stock-markets-bounce-back-uk-us-inflation-live#block-564adb7ee4b0a51fe20186be\">It follows a recovery in Asia overnight</a>.</p> <p>Lorne Baring, managing director of B Capital Wealth Management, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cInvestors are showing resilience to the recent attacks in Paris despite mounting worries over security in Europe.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b09f507f3ff1ff9c53b4d9113d05344816d1b907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b09f507f3ff1ff9c53b4d9113d05344816d1b907/0_0_662_221/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets at 2pm today\" width=\"500\" height=\"167\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European stock markets at 2pm today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/17/stock-markets-bounce-back-uk-us-inflation-live#block-564b1383e4b0e0595dc6c572\">Defence stocks have jumped</a></strong>, as France asks its EU allies for help.<br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/17/stock-markets-bounce-back-uk-us-inflation-live#block-564ae0fce4b0e0595dc6c4c5\">Manuel Valls has confirmed that France\u2019s plans for higher security spending mean it will not get its budget deficit into line by 2017</a></strong>.

      "bodyText": "The City of London skyline is to be dominated by a newcomer after the latest version of a tower formerly known as the Pinnacle or Helter Skelter received the green light from planners. The revived building, officially known as 22 Bishopsgate \u2013 or simply 22 \u2013 will be the tallest building in the Square Mile at 278 metres (912ft), eclipsing the nearby Heron tower at 231m. It has been redesigned for its new owners without the distinctive curly design at the top that earned it its original nicknames. It is also 10m shorter \u2013 but because it retains much of its width for most of its height it has 30% more floor space than the originally planned Pinnacle, which was defeated by the financial crash and recession. After construction came to an abrupt halt four years ago when funding dried up, the tower was left as a nine-storey shell, dubbed the Stump. Earlier this year, a consortium led by France\u2019s Axa Investment Managers\u2019 real estate arm bought the site near Liverpool Street station for an initial \u00a3220m from a group of Middle Eastern investors. The City of London\u2019s planning and transportation committee has granted permission for the newly designed office tower sooner than expected. Construction is expected to start early next year and finish in early 2019. The tower was approved despite objections to the plans from members of the public, Royal Parks, the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Islington and the charity Historic Royal Palaces. The charity criticised the new design, which unlike the Pinnacle with its slender tapering top is \u201cbroad shouldered\u201d and will overshadow the Tower of London, it said. Brushing aside the concerns, the City of London concluded that the \u201cproposal accords with the development plan as a whole [and] that it would preserve the setting of listed buildings\u201d. Its chief planning officer, Annie Hampson, said: \u201cThis is a substantial high-quality tower; 22 Bishopsgate exemplifies many of the qualities we are looking for in our landmark buildings \u2013 it is elegant, calm, and open to the public \u2026 Tall buildings in the City\u2019s eastern cluster near transport hubs are an effective way of creating the increase in office space and employment needed for a growing London.\u201d Lipton Rogers has been retained as the project\u2019s developer and the old concrete stump is being taken down by Australian contractor Brookfield Multiplex, but the previous foundations and basements will be used, which will speed up construction. The 62-storey tower will provide office space for more than 12,000 people and up to 100 companies, along with shops and services such as doctors and drycleaners. The Axa-led consortium plans to rent the 124,000 sq metres (1.33 million sq ft) to financial firms, technology companies and small and medium-sized businesses, including start-ups. Axa has already held informal discussions with potential tenants and will start formal marketing next year. There will be bars and a restaurant at the top, along with a public viewing gallery that will be free to visit, with a dedicated entrance and lifts. The new design scrapping the expensive curved-glass panels at the top was the work of PLP Architecture. It is the same team, led by Karen Cook, that came up with the original designs while they were working for Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates of the US, but they left that practice in 2009 to set up their own firm. About \u00a3400m had already been spent on the Pinnacle before the new owners took over, and the total cost could be up to \u00a31.5bn. The building will loom above a number of other recent City skyscrapers, including the Cheesegrater on Leadenhall Street and the Walkie Talkie on Fenchurch Street. But the Shard across the river remains western Europe\u2019s tallest building at 309 metres. Bruce Dear, the head of London real estate at law firm Eversheds, said: \u201cFor a global city, London is low rise. It only has 15 towers over 150 metres. New York has 188 and Hong Kong, the high-rise world champion, has 302. So 22 Bishopsgate is very welcome. There is plenty more room in the cockney clouds. We need a high-rise revolution if London is to remain the world\u2019s most desirable work and urban living space.\u201d",

The charity criticised the new design, which unlike the Pinnacle with its slender tapering top is \u201cbroad shouldered\u201d and will overshadow the Tower of London, it said.</p> <p>Brushing aside the concerns, <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1447780787897/22-Bishopsgate-London-EC2N.pdf\">the City of London concluded</a> that the \u201cproposal accords with the development plan as a whole [and] that it would preserve the setting of listed buildings\u201d. </p> <p>Its chief planning officer, Annie Hampson, said: <em>\u201c</em>This is a substantial high-quality tower; 22 Bishopsgate exemplifies many of the qualities we are looking for in our landmark buildings \u2013 it is elegant, calm, and open to the public \u2026 Tall buildings in the City\u2019s eastern cluster near transport hubs are an effective way of creating the increase in office space and employment needed for a growing London.\u201d</p> <p>Lipton Rogers has been retained as the project\u2019s developer and the old concrete stump is being taken down by Australian contractor Brookfield Multiplex, but the previous foundations and basements will be used, which will speed up construction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/30/22-bishopgate-skyscraper-london-skyline-development\">22 Bishopsgate \u2013 and the steroidal towers set to ruin London's skyline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 62-storey tower will provide office space for more than 12,000 people and up to 100 companies, along with shops and services such as doctors and drycleaners. The Axa-led consortium plans to rent the 124,000 sq metres (1.33 million sq ft) to financial firms, technology companies and small and medium-sized businesses, including start-ups. Axa has already held informal discussions with potential tenants and will start formal marketing next year.</p> <p>There will be bars and a restaurant at the top, along with a public viewing gallery that will be free to visit, with a dedicated entrance and lifts. </p> <p>The new design scrapping the expensive curved-glass panels at the top was the work of PLP Architecture. It is the same team, led by Karen Cook, that came up with the original designs while they were working for Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates of the US, but they left that practice in 2009 to set up their own firm. About \u00a3400m had already been spent on the Pinnacle before the new owners took over, and the total cost could be up to \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>The building will loom above a number of other recent City skyscrapers, including the Cheesegrater on Leadenhall Street and the Walkie Talkie on Fenchurch Street. But the Shard across the river remains western Europe\u2019s tallest building at 309 metres.</p> <p>Bruce Dear, the head of London real estate at law firm Eversheds, said: \u201cFor a global city, London is low rise. It only has 15 towers over 150 metres. New York has 188 and Hong Kong, the high-rise world champion, has 302. So 22 Bishopsgate is very welcome. There is plenty more room in the cockney clouds. We need a high-rise revolution if London is to remain the world\u2019s most desirable work and urban living space.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Asda\u2019s chief executive, Andy Clarke, has said retailers face a tough Christmas, as the supermarket reported its fifth consecutive quarter of declining sales. The retailer, owned by Walmart of the US, said sales at established stores dropped 4.5% in the three months to the end of September, compared with the same period last year. The decline was only a slight improvement on the 4.7% fall in the previous quarter, the worst performance in Asda\u2019s 50-year history, which Clarke at the time described as a \u201cnadir\u201d from which performance would improve. On Tuesday he admitted business continued to be tougher than expected. Clarke said households had an average of \u00a318 more a week to spend this year but the signs were that most would not be splashing out in the shops this Christmas. Asda\u2019s research suggests that more than one in five shoppers expect to spend less money this Christmas than last, and a further 68% intend to spend the same. \u201cIt is going to be a very challenging Christmas for all retailers and 2016 will continue to be challenging,\u201d Clarke said. But he insisted Asda would not be drawn into drastic price cuts or issuing vouchers in order to \u201cbuy short-term sales\u201d. He added: \u201cWe have a long-term sustainable plan and the strongest financial position in this market to give us real choices at the right time rather than react to short-term challenges from other retailers.\u201d Clarke said one problem for Asda in the latest quarter had been poor clothing sales due to the warm weather, which led to a difficult start to the autumn. He said industry-wide deflation and Asda\u2019s moves to cut prices had also affected the top line, as the supermarket tried to maintain a gap with its rivals on price and get closer to discounters Aldi and Lidl. Clarke said Asda was 10% more expensive than the two German chains but wanted to halve that gap over time. He confirmed that doing so would mean investing more than the \u00a31bn Clarke originally planned to put into price cuts over five years when he launched a revival strategy two years ago. Asda will also trim ranges by an average of 10% as it aims to improve efficiency and get better deals from suppliers to lower prices for shoppers. Clarke said Asda\u2019s price guarantee scheme, under which it promises to refund customers if their weekly shop is not at least 10% cheaper than it would be in Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Waitrose, was under review because shoppers were becoming tired of such complex price-matching schemes. He said a decision on its future would be taken next year. \u201cWe are clear that investment should be in pure price on the shelf and that gives confidence to the customer.\u201d Clarke is under pressure to turn around performance at the chain, which has been the worst performer of Britain\u2019s big four supermarkets this year. Traditionally the cheapest of the large grocers, Asda had held its own against the onslaught of the Aldi and Lidl until sales dived this year. Clarke said he had the backing of Asda\u2019s parent company for his long-term plan. \u201cI\u2019m confident that by reinforcing our offer we can further extend our price advantage over major competitors and close the gap against the limited assortment discounters \u2013 not only on price, but across range, service and quality,\u201d he said. Last month Clarke set out his strategy to get Asda back on track by revamping big stores, cutting everyday prices and shelving plans to expand internet click and collect services. He has also decided to scale back the group\u2019s Black Friday promotions, which caused fights between customers at some stores last year. Black Friday had been great for Asda when it introduced the idea two years ago, but it had been less successful in 2014, Clarke said. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how many retailers continue next year. I would suggest it will probably be less,\u201d he added. Figures from Kantar Worldpanel show Aldi and Lidl took a combined 10% share of the UK grocery market for the first time, doubling their share from three years ago. In the three months to 8 November, the German chains increased sales by 16% while Asda, Tesco and Morrisons lost sales. Clarke said the rise of the discounters was inevitable and they were likely to take about a 15% market share in the UK, on a par with their position in the rest of Europe. His project renewal, as the current plan is called, includes making improvements to 95 large stores. Clarke and his management team worked on the scheme for six months, studying shoppers\u2019 habits, before it was launched.",

The government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living remained unchanged at -0.1% in the year to October, but will turn positive when the data for November is released next month. The reason is that the consumer prices index (CPI) fell by 0.3% in November 2014 as a result of the plunging cost of crude oil. Unless that decline is repeated this November \u2013 which it won\u2019t be \u2013 the annual inflation rate will mechanically rise. Inflation figures will increase again in the new year, when last January\u2019s 0.9% drop in the CPI will cease to bear down on the annual inflation rate. Again, this increase in the annual rate will reveal more about what was happening this time last year than it does about current price pressures. Inflation hawks will point to the small increase in so-called core inflation as evidence that these pressures are building. The Office for National Statistics calculates inflation excluding items \u2013 such as energy and food \u2013 where prices can fluctuate because of what is happening on global markets. Unlike headline inflation, the core measure of the cost of living did not turn negative and reached a trough of 0.8% in April and June this year. Since then, it has risen gently, and a recovery in clothing and footwear prices pushed it up by 0.1 points to 1.1% last month. It will be the core rather than the headline measure of inflation that the Bank of England will be focusing on in the months to come, and the small rise in October has convinced some City analysts that a rate increase in the first half of 2016 is possible. There are, though, reasons why the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is likely to remain wary of acting too quickly. Firstly, inflation has been lower for longer than Threadneedle Street imagined at the start of the year. Second, wage pressures remain weak, in large part because employers have adjusted down pay offers to reflect the lower level of inflation. Third, the strength of the pound has been making imports cheaper and the effect of sterling is likely to persist well into next year. Finally, a fresh fall in oil and other commodity prices is cutting costs for manufacturers. Producer prices \u2013 the cost of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 are barely rising. What does that all mean? It means that, while the UK\u2019s flirtation with deflation is over, the MPC will want stronger evidence of a real underlying increase in inflation before it pulls the interest rate trigger.",

      "bodyText": "Pubs group Enterprise Inns has reported flat profits as it restructures its business in the face of changes to the industry. The company - the largest pub owner in the UK - plans to sell unwanted assets, expand its managed pub business and develop a commercial property division. As the strategy gets underway, its annual profits edged up from \u00a3121m to \u00a3122m. Full year like for like income rose 0.8%, which it said was a good performance given that the previous year benefitted from the FIFA World Cup. During the year it sold 260 pubs for \u00a375m, but wrote down the value of the rest of its estate by \u00a3163m. Enterprise said trading in the first six weeks of the new financial year was in line with expectations, and its new strategy was on track. The news has lifted its shares by 3.55p or 3.7% to 98.55p. In a buy note Jeffrey Harwood at Stifel said: Enterprise Inns is in the early stages of a number of initiatives to exploit the potential of its estate. It is developing its Managed Estate where it currently operates 35 pubs. In addition, it is developing a commercial property business which currently has 213 properties and a rent roll of \u00a312m per annum. There are ambitious plans to expand the scale of the managed estate to 800 by 2020 and the commercial property portfolio to 1000 units. The shares have been disappointing performers recently, despite the consistent nature of trading and some positive developments from the recent Government Consultation on the new pubs code. While leverage remains high, the rating of the shares is low both in PE terms and in relation to net asset value. We consider the shares have upside potential on recovery grounds. At Numis, Douglas Jack also issued a buy recommendation: Like for like net income is being supported by: increased growth capex; enhanced operational support (40 versus 55 pubs per regional manager); and a further 18% reduction in the number of business failures (to around 8% of the estate per annum). Licensees are also benefiting from discounts on WiFi, Sports TV packages, food offerings (with menu advice and support), training and marketing (at a 2015 cost of \u00a36m to Enterprise). Our recommendation remains Bby, but we prefer Punch Taverns on the grounds of lower enterprise value/EBITDA and net debt/EBITDA ratios and lower execution risk.",

      "bodyText": "The fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl now control a 10th of British grocery sales \u2013 double their share three years ago. The German-owned chains increased sales by more than 16% in the three months to 8 November, according to the data published by Kantar Worldpanel on Tuesday. Three of their big four rivals \u2013 Tesco, Morrisons and Asda \u2013 suffered a sales slide in their worst quarterly performance of this year, on Kantar\u2019s measure. Of the major grocers, only Sainsbury\u2019s gained sales. \u201cThe discounters show no sign of stopping and, with plans to open hundreds of stores between them, they\u2019ll noticeably widen their reach to the British population,\u201d said Frazer McKevitt, head of retail at Kantar Worldpanel. McKevitt said the two chains had attracted a million more shoppers between them compared with a year ago, while each customer had spent an average of \u00a318.85 \u2013 4% more. Lidl\u2019s market share reached a record high of 4.4% in the period, increasing by 0.7 percentage points on last year after sales growth of 19%. Aldi increased sales by 16.5%, keeping its market share at 5.6% for the fifth consecutive month. Analysts said the strong performance was partly driven by Aldi and Lidl opening new stores while many of their bigger rivals were closing outlets. The figures also indicated the discounters were likely to take a bigger share of Christmas trade, when they have tended to lose out to traditional supermarkets as shoppers \u201ctrade up\u201d and buy more expensive items. \u201cMaybe this year will be different, placing further pressure upon the superstore model,\u201d Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said. The latest market share figures indicate the success of efforts by Aldi and Lidl to broaden their ranges to include more luxury items, such as champagne and lobster, to persuade shoppers to stick with them in the runup to Christmas. Both now run big seasonal ad campaigns, and Lidl has tried to give itself a more mainstream image by improving stores and even becoming the official supermarket of the England football team. Jonathan Neale, joint managing director of Aldi, said: \u201cOur sales growth and market share performance during 2015 has been incredibly strong. We\u2019re expecting an exceptional Christmas this year after making our biggest-ever investment in product innovation and range.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s was the only one of the big grocers to increase market share over the 12-week period, helping it leapfrog Asda to become the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket. A 1.5% sales rise helped Sainsbury\u2019s take a 16.6% share of the grocery market compared with Asda\u2019s 16.4%. The two chains have been vying for position all year. Asda released quarterly sales figures on Tuesday after announcing plans to revamp stores and shelve expansion of click and collect services since recording its worst sales performance in its 50-year history in August. Retailers focused on the south-east and London \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s, Lidl, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 all noted a significant increase in growth. Analysts at Bernstein Research said data from Kantar suggested sales in the capital were rising more than 4% faster than in the rest of the country. \u201cToday\u2019s results would suggest that this trend is continuing,\u201d Bruno Monteyne said.",

The company, which helps maintain Britain\u2019s roads and railways but has also been building up its nuclear business, is paying $318m (\u00a3206m) in cash for the nuclear services division of EnergySolutions (PP&amp;T). The move follows last year\u2019s acquisition of Nuclear Safety Associates, and allows the company to expand its ability to decommission nuclear projects, as well as bidding for larger contracts in the US. Atkins chief executive Dr Uwe Krueger said: This acquisition accelerates our nuclear strategy and creates a global platform. Our combined business is well positioned in all the major nuclear markets in north America, UK, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific. In the US, which has the largest nuclear fleet, we are at the top table for decommissioning, site operations, major projects and consultancy. Atkins\u2019 shares have jumped 107p to \u00a314.69, and analysts were positive on the acquisition. John Mullane at Investec said: The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of calendar 2016, should be between 15-20% accretive to 2017 estimated earnings before interest and tax. The acquisition will significantly accelerate Atkins\u2019 growth in the nuclear decommissioning space, which benefits from attractive growth dynamics. Overall, we think this looks like a very attractive deal for WS Atkins. Will Wallis at Numis said: We think nuclear decommissioning is a robust long- term growth market, with the cumulative number of commercial plants decommissioned by 2030 likely more than double the current number. We see significant opportunities to sell into a broader combined customer base, in particular leveraging PP&amp;T\u2019s technology portfolio (e.g. vitrification and water clean-up) and providing a better platform for growth in for example Japan, China and Germany. Both parts of the business also have a presence in the nuclear new build market. Liberum said: The acquisition fits the stated strategy of diversifying away from the UK and growing in Energy. It is a high margin business (10.9% historic). There is technology differentiation. Atkins has known the management team for more than 10 years, which clearly reduces risk. At the interim results last week, management did talk about adding to Energy business. The acquisition should strengthen Atkins position in Nuclear in the UK and provide further decommissioning opportunities in Europe such as Germany. It is possible to offer EnergySolution\u2019s Nuclear Waste removal technology (eg vitrification and water filtration) to Atkins\u2019 existing clients, such as EDF and TEPCO. Atkins can also offer its suite of infrastructure capability (civils, Faithful &amp; Gould etc) to EnergySolutions\u2019 existing clients.",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation remained negative at -0.1% in October", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation was negative for a second successive month in October, at -0.1%, according to official figures, leaving the cost of living for Britain\u2019s households practically unchanged since January. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rising cost of clothing - the biggest upward contribution to inflation - had been more than offset by declining food prices and the fading impact of costly student fees. It is the first time two successive monthly readings have been below zero since the consumer prices index (CPI) started to be calculated in 1996. The continued absence of inflation suggests the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will be in no hurry to push up interest rates in the coming months \u2014 though some economists did warn that prices may now have troughed. Richard Campbell, of the ONS, said inflation, as measured on the CPI, had been hovering around zero since the beginning of the year. \u201cCPI remained steady at -0.1% in October, with stronger clothing price growth being offset by food and alcohol and tobacco, as well as a smaller impact from rising tuition fees. This is the ninth month running that CPI has been at or very close to zero,\u201d he said. Ian Stewart, chief economist at consultancy Deloitte, said negative inflation should help to boost consumer spending in the runup to Christmas. \u201cFalling prices of essentials, including food and energy, are delivering a windfall bonus to UK consumers, bolstering spending power and enabling consumers to spend more on cars and big ticket items,\u201d he said. The ONS said the largest increase in prices came from sharper than expected increases for clothes, especially coats, between September and October. But that was more than offset by a 0.4% fall in food prices over the month, as supermarket price rivalry continued unabated, and a decline in the price of wine, spirits and tobacco, which the ONS said was rare for October. The retail prices index, used for calculating pensions and rail fares, was 0.7% in October. Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit, said the continued weakness of price growth supported the Bank of England\u2019s recent decisions to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. \u201cUK inflation remained in negative territory in October, helping shore up the Bank of England\u2019s belief that there\u2019s no rush to start raising interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation has been completely absent from the UK economy since February as low oil and commodity prices, plus a stronger currency, have helped bring down prices.\u201d Economists expect inflation to rise in the coming months, however, as the effect of the sharp declines in oil prices at the end of 2014 drops out of the calculations. Robert Wood, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, pointed out that the declines in fuel prices seen over the past 12 months, with petrol costs down 14% in October, would soon start to fade. The impact of the rise in sterling earlier this year, which tends to bear down on inflation by making imports cheaper, is also likely to ease. He expects CPI inflation to hit 1.6% by the final quarter of 2016, strengthening the argument of anti-inflation hawks on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee who are keen to press ahead with rare rises. Core inflation, which excludes the price of volatile items such as food and fuel, crept up to 1.1% year on year. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has said that he expects the decision about when to start raising borrowing costs to \u201ccome into sharper relief around the turn of the year\u201d. The US Federal Reserve, which, like the Bank, has kept rates at emergency levels since the financial crisis, is widely expected to implement its first rate rise in December.

Analysts at Jefferies issued a buy note, saying: Today\u2019s trading update was unlikely to contain positive news \u2013 and it does not \u2013 but trading is broadly in line with expectations, something of a moral victory, in our view. That suggests Smiths is displaying the greater vitality the previous management sought to instil. There is some good news on pension funding, too. Smiths has also been supported as investors were reminded of its detection business in the wake of plans for increased security following the Paris attacks. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: The diversified engineering group is clearly managing the downturn in oil and gas well, but on top of this its exposure to high tech body scanners used to enhance security is arguably another reason they\u2019re finding support. Meawhile Rolls-Royce, whose engines are used by military as well as civil aircraft, is up another 22p to 550p as attacks on Syria increase. Defence aerospace accounts for around 15% of Rolls\u2019 revenues last year. Travel and hotel companies, hit on Monday on worries about a slowdown in business after Paris, have recovered some lost ground. Tui is up 17p at \u00a311.05, InterContinental Hotels has added 27p to \u00a324.88 and British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines is 9p better at 585p. But easyJet is down 52p at \u00a317.31 after a disappointing update, while Imperial Tobacco has slipped 29p to \u00a335.60 as recent takeover froth subsides a little.",

      "bodyText": "German discount chain Lidl has been appointed official supermarket of the England football team. From Tuesday, the Neckarsulm-based grocer will be the official supplier of water, fish, fruit and vegetables for Roy Hodgson\u2019s boys under a multimillion-pound three-year deal with the Football Association. It will also be official supplier of fish, fruit and vegetables for Scotland and Wales after signing similar deals with their equivalent footballing bodies. The deal also covers support for grassroots football including the provision of 1.5m sessions of professional coaching for children in England, Wales and Scotland. Ryan McDonnell, purchasing director for Lidl UK, said: \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity for Lidl and one that we are both excited and extremely proud to be a part of. We look forward to building successful partnerships with the English, Scottish and Welsh FAs in developing the sport at both national and community levels.\u201d Martin Glenn, chief executive of the FA, said: \u201cLidl has joined us at an exciting time as we focus our efforts on supporting the grassroots movement through better facilities and coaching. The skills programme is a great opportunity for young people to get involved in the game, hone their talents and have fun.\u201d Tesco signed a similar deal with the FA to be official supermarket of the England team before the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, later saying this had helped sales of television sets. The retailer also had a separate seven-year arrangement to supports grassroots football with the FA, which came to an end last year when the company was struggling to cope with a dive in profits and an accounting scandal. The supermarket, and the three other major traditional chains: Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, have been forced to cut prices and take a profit hit to prevent shoppers switching to fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. Lidl\u2019s tie-up with the England football team marks the next stage of its ambition to become a mainstream British retailer. The company has adapted its ranges to include more fresh food sourced from the UK and is changing its stores to reflect British expectations including customer toilets and wider aisles. Lidl plans to invest \u00a31.5bn in its UK operation over the next three years as it steps up store expansion, opening 40-50 a year, compared with 20 in 2014. The company will also refurbish up to 150 existing sites to its \u201cstore of the future\u201d concept over the next three to four years. Lidl\u2019s first \u00a32m store of the future opened in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last week. The 1,400 sq metre building is one of the first Lidl stores in the UK with customer toilets, baby-changing facilities and self-checkouts. This article was changed on 17 November: Lidl is the official supplier to the England football team, not, as the original headline said, Scotland and Wales too",

It will also be official supplier of fish, fruit and vegetables for Scotland and Wales after signing similar deals with their equivalent footballing bodies.</p> <p>The deal also covers support for grassroots football including the provision of 1.5m sessions of professional coaching for children in England, Wales and Scotland. </p> <p>Ryan McDonnell, purchasing director for Lidl UK, said: \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity for Lidl and one that we are both excited and extremely proud to be a part of. We look forward to building successful partnerships with the English, Scottish and Welsh FAs in developing the sport at both national and community levels.\u201d </p> <p>Martin Glenn, chief executive of the FA, said: \u201cLidl has joined us at an exciting time as we focus our efforts on supporting the grassroots movement through better facilities and coaching. The skills programme is a great opportunity for young people to get involved in the game, hone their talents and have fun.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco signed a similar deal with the FA to be official supermarket of the England team before the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, later saying this had helped sales of television sets. </p> <p>The retailer also had a separate seven-year arrangement to supports grassroots football with the FA, which came to an end last year when the company was struggling to cope with a dive in profits and an accounting scandal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/13/a-tale-of-two-lidls-is-the-supermarket-ready-for-an-upmarket-rebrand\">A tale of two Lidls: is the supermarket ready for an upmarket rebrand?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The supermarket, and the three other major traditional chains: Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, have been forced to cut prices and take a profit hit to prevent shoppers switching to fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl.<br></p> <p>Lidl\u2019s tie-up with the England football team marks the next stage of its ambition to become a mainstream British retailer. </p> <p>The company has adapted its ranges to include more fresh food sourced from the UK and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/13/a-tale-of-two-lidls-is-the-supermarket-ready-for-an-upmarket-rebrand\">is changing its stores to reflect British expectations including customer toilets and wider aisles</a>.</p> <p>Lidl plans to invest \u00a31.5bn in its UK operation over the next three years as it steps up store expansion, opening 40-50 a year, compared with 20 in 2014. </p> <p>The company will also refurbish up to 150 existing sites to its \u201cstore of the future\u201d concept over the next three to four years.</p> <p>Lidl\u2019s first \u00a32m store of the future opened in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last week. The 1,400 sq metre building is one of the first Lidl stores in the UK with customer toilets, baby-changing facilities and self-checkouts.</p> <ul> <li>This article was changed on 17 November: Lidl is the official supplier to the England football team, not, as the original headline said, Scotland and Wales too</li> </ul>",
