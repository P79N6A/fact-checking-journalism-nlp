It is home to motor racing millionaire Eddie Jordan, TV celebrities such as Sir Bruce Forsyth and more international golf stars than you can shake a five-iron at. Welcome to Virginia Water, a leafy little town complete with a traditional red phone box, on the borders of Surrey and Berkshire, and the first and so far only town in the country with an average house price of more than \u00a31m. Fancy a place in this most upmarket Surrey address, which was named after the local lake that honours the \"Virgin Queen\" Elizabeth I? Well, you'll need an average of \u00a31.03m - nearly \u00a3200,000 more than an average abode in Cobham, the UK's second most expensive town, also in Surrey, and a favourite residence for footballers. Virginia Water's position at the top of the UK's house price league is revealed in a new Property Rich List compiled by property website Zoopla. The survey shows that entire postcodes within London now have average prices running into the millions. The most expensive street is Kensington Palace Gardens, dubbed the \"boulevard of billionaires\", which boasts an average price of \u00a336.1m, while in The Boltons, located in the Brompton district of Kensington and Chelsea, and formerly home to Madonna, the average is \u00a323.4m. Over the past year, a typical property in the chichi W8 postcode of west London has jumped in value by more than \u00a3100,000 \u2013 or around four times average annual earnings. The survey, published on Friday, reveals that the number of million-pound homes in the UK has soared by nearly a third to more than 320,000 over the past year. The number of streets where the average house price is now more than \u00a31m has climbed 23% to 8,230 over the same period. In truth, not even \u00a31m will go far on Virginia Water's Wentworth estate, a series of private streets with its own security guards and dogs built around the world-famous golf club where 18 holes will set you back \u00a3360. On the doorstep of bucolic Windsor Great Park, Wentworth boasts 700 high-end homes scattered around three world-class golf courses. This is where Forsyth and Jordan hang their hats. At Wentworth, prices start at \u00a32m, but marble mansions with swimming pools fetch much more. \"You can get some seriously expensive houses,\" says John Henson, an associate at Knight Frank estate agents. \"It is private, it is leafy, it is green, it is well-cared for.\" Virginia Water is at the centre of a type of England reminiscent of an Evelyn Waugh novel \u2013 close to elite private schools, such as Eton, and Heathfield for girls, as well as the Ascot racecourse and a polo club. These aristocratic trappings have proved a huge draw for foreign buyers. Most high-level properties at Wentworth are snapped up by foreigners looking for a weekend home, says Henson, with buyers hailing from Russia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, China and the Middle East. Many of these buyers are demolishing the mock Tudor houses put up by Surrey master builder Walter George Tarrant in the 1930s, which charmed an earlier generation of stockbrokers. Lattice windows and sloping rooms with chimneys are making way for marble palaces boasting cinemas, gyms and three-car garages. \"Our foreign buyers really like brand new,\" says Henson. \"Anything that is a little bit old is a bit harder to sell than something fresh out of the ground.\" While there may be Porsches and plenty of BMWs in the local car park, Virginia Water's sleepy high street does not scream ostentation. With a Blockbuster video and a Budgens convenience store, there is little sign of the incredible fortunes that exist around the corner. That may be because the most wealthy residents rarely shop on the high street. Charlotte Kennedy, 21, who helps to run the family bakery, says more business comes from builders and landscape gardeners working at Wentworth than from its residents. \"We don't tend to see a lot of them. They are only here for something like eight weeks a year,\" she says. \"When they are here we might be asked to deliver fresh bread and things like that but apart from that we don't get much from them.\" The draw for all locals is the peace and quiet, with one businesswoman objecting to the Zoopla survey's designation of Virginia Water as a \"town\". \"People like the fact that it is still a village and that keeps it small and quiet.\" The prosperous town sees little crime. \"There have been people who have had some incidents with animals going missing,\" says Declan Hester, who works in the video shop. And he can recall a case last summer when two men got in a fight outside his store. \"The blokes had just had too much to drink,\" he says. \"I don't think the people actually lived here.\"",

      "bodyText": "EU leaders have now got down to work in Brussels, and probably won't hold a press conference until late tonight. So I'm going to stop the liveblog -- and catch up on developments in the morning. We'll have more news on the EU summit on the website this evening, and I'll be back in the morning. Thanks and goodnight. GW More details leaking out... EC president Herman Van Rompuy opened the EU summit tonight by urging leaders to take \"concrete action\" on two key issues \u2013 youth unemployment, and the credit crunch that is holding small firms back. You can watch a recording here. It suggests that the draft statement that emerged earlier today, outlining new 'investment plan' to fight joblessness and drive growth, is on the money (see 4.36pm). A couple of photos from inside the EU headquarters in Brussels, as tonight's Summit got underway: City analysts had predicted earlier this week that the Federal Reserve might respond to last week's tumbling markets with some reassuring statements....and lo, the Atlanta Fed's president is doing just that. Dennis Lockhart, in a speech in Marietta, argued that the financial markets had mis-interpreted Ben Bernanke last week. No reason to panic about the US 'tapering' its quantitative easing, he soothed. If growth falters, we'll keep stimulating. Here's Lockhart's key quotes: The pace of purchases, the composition of purchases and the ultimate size of the Fed's balance sheet still depend on how economic conditions evolve. If inflation expectations of the public and those indicated by financial markets soften appreciably, we policymakers would have to re-evaluate the appropriateness of policy for the situation. And this seems to be driving another rally in government bonds, with US Treasuries, UK gilts, German bunds, and peripheral debt from the eurozone all strengthening. Here's the 10-year bond yields tonight: (falling yields means higher prices): \u2022 US: 2.47%, down 6 basis points (ie, from 2.53% last night) \u2022 UK: 2.42%, down 2bp \u2022 Germany: 1.729%, down 3bp \u2022 Spain: 4.75%, down 5bp \u2022 Italy: 4.58%, down 13bp \u2022 Greece: 10.69%, down 45bp Shares up, volatility down. That's the simple story from Europe's stock markets today -- particularly after William Dudley of the New York Fed suggested America's bond-buying stimulus package will continue for longer than Ben Bernanke indicated last week (see 3.37pm). Here's the closing prices: With the FTSE 100 finishing 77 points higher, IG's David Madden said pessimists in the City were starting to get edgy,. They'll probably take the initiative again soon, though, he added: After three strong \u2018up\u2019 days for the FTSE 100, the bears can be forgiven for feeling downcast. With the index straying into triple-digit territory, everyone has been reminded that the volatility of June is not likely to go away as we move into the next month. It looks as if we might have one last hurrah ahead of month-end before reality sets in once again. Over in Brussels, a draft copy of the agreement that will be announced at the end of today/tomorrow's EU summit is circulating. It suggests leaders will announce a new 'investment plan', in an effort to tackle the youth jobless crisis (or at least look like they're tackling the youth jobless crisis) Open Europe has published its views of the EU bank rescue deal agreed early this morning: Bank bail-in plans finally agreed, but its only a small step towards banking union It welcomes the fact that bank creditors, not taxpayers, will be on the hook for future losses, but is concerned about the 'flexibility' given to national governments over whether to contribute to a rescue (under the plan, a state could cover up to 5% of a bank's liabilities, after creditors have contributed 8%) Here's a flavour of Open Europe's analysis: Positives Reaching a deal is positive in itself, as it adds some much needed certainty following the Cypriot crisis. It also keeps the progress towards banking union inching along. The burden has been shifted away from taxpayers towards bank creditors. The added flexibility is important between eurozone and non-eurozone countries, with the UK and Sweden scoring some important caveats. The deal highlights that non-eurozone countries can still have influence on such rules and the acceptance of the need for flexibility between the two groups. Negatives From a eurozone point of view, the flexibility could be counterproductive, particularly the use of exemptions in exceptional circumstances. How exactly will this be defined and determined? If at national level, then there could be clear political pressure in a crisis to invoke this. For example, it is hard to imagine that the crises in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain would not have triggered this in some way. Could see cost of bank funding rise, particularly in terms of unsecured credit due to fairly strong depositor preference. Lots of unanswered questions \u2013 not least, when and how will these rules apply? It\u2019s not clear in exactly what situation and at what time the new rules would kick in. Does it rely on a request for aid from the bank or the national government? Furthermore, there are questions over how this will work practically in different circumstances \u2013 for example, the difference between a bank which has almost completely failed and one which is simply struggling to recapitalise. The timeline also still seems very long, with the actual bail-in rules not in force until 2018, even though the directive is due to be in place by 2015. That said, the broad template may well still apply, particularly where banking union is involved. More here. After a quiet day in Europe, stock markets are now romping ahead with the FTSE 100 up by 105 points, and the Dow Jones 150 points to the good. The trigger is comments from a member of the Federal Reserve's Open Market committee, suggesting that the UE economy might not be strong enough to to justify ending its stimulus package. William Dudley, the head of the New York Federal Reserve, told an audience in New York that: Economic circumstances could diverge significantly from the FOMC\u2019s expectations. If labor market conditions and the economy\u2019s growth momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC\u2019s outlook \u2014 and this is what has happened in recent years \u2014 I would expect that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for longer. The suggestion that the Fed might not start to 'taper' its $85bn/month bond-buying programme is music to the markets' ears, it seems..... Eurocrats are in cheerful mood as they prepare to get the EU summit underway. Not only because of the bank rescue framework agreed overnight. but because a 'political deal' has been struck over the sticky problem of the next EU budget. The 'multi-year financial framework', covering spending for the next seven years, was agreed back in February and famously included the first-ever real-term cut in spending. MEPs, though, promptly blocked it. But this morning, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and Irish PM Enda Kenny (in his final few days holding the rotating presidency) announced that a deal had been reached. Under the compromise, the final budget size is unchanged at \u20ac960bn, but there will be more flexibility about how unspent commitments can be reassigned between budget areas, and different years. Barroso declared that the plan is a boost for Europe, as it will help Brussels to invest in projects to boost growth and employment: This is really important for these citizens and these regions in Europe that badly need investment. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said he was \"optimistic\" that MEPs will give their approval next week. AP's take is here: EU strikes $1.3 trillion multi-annual budget deal and the FT's is here: EU reaches \u20ac960bn budget deal David Cameron appeared to show some concern about today's agreement, though, telling reporters in Brussels that Europe must stick to the terms of the original deal. The key point is that not all the commitments in the EU budget are actually delivered. This extra flexibility agreed today could mean less money remains unspent. Heads-up: European leaders have started arriving for the EU Council summit in Brussels. Portugal's anti-austerity general strike is in full swing. A group of protesters in Lisbon blocking a road to show their opposition to the country's deep spending cuts: Local reports say that while transport links were badly hit, few private workers are taking part in the walkout - partly because they cannot afford to lose a day's pay. Carlos Silva, leader of Portugal's UGT union, acknowledging that the private sector has less opportunity to take part in industrial action. Silva also declared: These austerity policies punish the country, violate the people, penalise workers and pensioners, so the strike will be a cry of resistance to these policies. Over to Greece, and the latest opinion poll data shows that the governing New Democracy is maintaining a narrow lead. Despite the row over the closure of state broadcaster ERT, ND came top with 22% of support followed by the opposition left-wing Syriza group on 20.8%. The extremist Golden Dawn party is still third on 9.1%, then PASOK (ND's junior coalition partner) on 6.1%, Independent Greeks on 5.5% and the Communist Party on 5.1%. Democratic Left, which quit the coalition last Friday, is now polling just 3% support - any lower and it won't qualify for seats in the parliament. Here's a round-up of economist reaction to Ireland's fall back into recession, via Reuters. AUSTIN HUGHES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, KBC IRELAND The economy is on a slightly weaker trajectory than was generally envisaged, but it's not entirely surprising given the global backdrop that exports have performed poorly.\" \"The economy is still making uneven progress, but it's very fragile and it probably means we have to be very careful about the scale of adjustment in budget 2014. For my money, this suggests we use most of the promissory note savings on the economy and avoid even weaker growth over the next year.\" \"These numbers are very volatile, the reality is there is still a marginal improvement in employment, so i don't think these numbers are saying we are tumbling into a dramatically poorer condition. But it does say that it is uneven, any sort of progression is very modest. Its flatlining. PHILIP O'SULIIVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INVESTEC IRELAND It's not a huge surprise what's out today. Merchandise exports were quite weak due to patent cliff effects, so there was going to be a bit of an expectation that that was going to be a bit of a drag anyway.\" \"The other thing to note is that retail sales were quite poor too which was a bit of a negative read through in terms of personal consumption, and a certain amount of that was down to a disappointing couple of months for car sales. Things should get better as the year goes on. ALAN MCQUAID, ECONOMIST, MERRION STOCKBROKERS It's not a good number and it clearly shows that we're not immune to what's going on globally. Given these numbers you'd be hard pushed to have growth for the year as a whole.\" \"Whether it puts your bailout into question... I think the NTMA (debt agency) would argue that they're flush with money so there's no serious issue there and I think if they want to leave (the bailout), they will leave. The news that Ireland's economy has shrunk for three quarters in a row has dashed any hopes of a recovery, my colleague Lisa O'Carroll writes. Today's revised gross domestic produce for 2012 show the economy flatlined with GDP rising by just +0.2%, revised down from +0.9%. GDP for the third and fourth quarters of 2012 was lower than previously stated, at -1% and -0.2%, the central statistics office in Ireland said on Thursday. The economy continued to contract in the first quarter of 2013 when GDP growth stood at now -0.6%. This was due to falling exports and weakening consumer spending, said the CSO. Karl Whelan, professor of economics at University College Dublin, tweeted that the Irish ministers should heed the data and stop discussing Ireland's 'recovery': The full release is here. It shows that Gross National Product (which strips out foreign companies based in Ireland) did rise during the last quarter. Now this is a nasty surprise. Ireland is back in recession after its GDP data was revised sharply lower. Figures just released show that the Irish economy has actually been shrinking for the last nine months, including a 0.6% contraction in the first quarter of this year. Details and reaction to follow Back to the EU bank bailout deal agreed in the early hours in Brussels (in which bondholders, shareholders and depositors with over \u20ac100,000 in the bank would contribute to future rescue deals if a bank failed). Tim Dolan, a partner at the international law firm SJ Berwin, comments on the deal: This deal creates a clear set of rules for dealing with failing banks which should lead to a level playing field between banks based in larger and smaller European nations. The risk with this deal was that smaller European nations would be left having to require failing banks to resort to obtaining support from creditors while larger European nations would be able to support failing banks by deploying taxpayer support. This deal should ensure broad consistency. All creditors of banks, and particularly unsecured bondholders, need to understand that there is a greater risk that they will suffer some loss should their bank fail in the future. There is also a greater risk that, in the event of a complete collapse of a bank, shareholders and large depositors will be required to provide some support before the taxpayer. Here's some reaction to the UK GDP revisions (see 9.35am onwards) from Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First: This data release highlights the problems that Britons are currently facing in a nut shell. Levels of disposable income have fallen to the lowest since 1987 as inflation bites at wage packets whilst savings ratio falls have shown that people are using life savings to keep their heads above water. Whether the UK entered a double-dip or, as today\u2019s numbers show, it didn\u2019t matters little to the man on the street who is seeing large falls in real term wage growth as a result of the lack of business output. Sterling has fallen in the aftermath of this announcement, and although this data is 3 months old and could be considered stale, the lack of real improvement since leaves the government and the new Bank of England Governor a lot to do. Another gloomy point in today's UK economic data - disposable income fell at its biggest rate since 1987 in the first three months of this year. The pound has fallen since the new GDP data was released, down almost half a cent against the US dollar at $1.526. Jonathan Portes of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research makes the same point. Today's new data shows the UK suffered a severe downturn, and has only managed a feeble recovery since. Britain's economy is still 3.9% lower than its pre-recession peak, the ONS's new data shows (see 9.35am onwards). That's even worse than the 2.6% previously estimated. So we've lost the double-dip, but the original dip was even more of a shocker. The elimination of Britain's double-dip recession is getting plenty of attention, but the fact that the original downturn was even more severe is more important. Chris Giles of the Financial Times comments: The ONS also confirmed that Britain's economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, as previously expected. However the year-on-year figure has been revised down to just +0.3%, from +0.6% before. That's because of the revisions the ONS has made to legacy data. It's official, Britain never suffered a double-dip recession. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that the economy did not shrinking in the first quarter of 2012, as previously thought. However, it's not all good news. After carrying out a major revision of recent economic data, the ONS has calculated that UK GDP actually tumbled by a jaw-dropping 7.2% in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. Not 6.3% as previously thought. More to follow! The general strike called by Portugal's two biggest unions is underway, as workers register their anger over the country's austerity programme. Reuters reports that public transport has come \"to a virtual standstill\": Trains were not running, metro and ferry services stopped in Lisbon, and many bus routes were suspended, forcing those who chose to go to work take longer, alternative routes that were served by fewer buses than usual. State-owned airline TAP has warned of possible disruption but not cancelled any flights. Germany's labour market continues to outperform the rest of the eurozone. Data just released shows that the jobless total fell by 12,000 this month, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economist had expected a rise of 8,000. It leaves Germany's jobless rate flat at 6.8% (May's original reading of 6.9% was revised down) compared to a eurozone average of 12.2%. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, suggests we shouldn't expect major progress at the EU summit which starts later today: Reuters' Hugo Dixon gave the EU deal (see opening post for details) a cautious welcome: Gloom in France -- consumers are at their most pessimistic since records began in 1972, according to data released this morning. The French statistics agency INSEE reported that consumer confidence slid again, to its lowest level since it began monitoring morale in 1972. French consumers are also more downbeat than ever before about their future living prospects. At just 78, the reading was somewhat shy of analyst forecasts of 81, and far from the long-term average of 100. The French economy is currently in recession, with unemployment moving steadily higher, and the government trying to cut public spending to hit EU deficit targets. Consumers have plenty of reasons to worry. Morgan Stanley's analysts aren't too impressed with the plan: The Wall Street Journal flags up that weaker euro-zone governments would be able to borrow from the currency union's rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, to top up their own backstops. But it won't be easy: Taxpayer-funded bailouts will only be allowed under \"extraordinary circumstances,\" when it is technically impossible to impose losses on certain creditors in a rush or when a government is worried about effects on financial stability, officials said. Such exceptions will have to be authorized by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. Rich countries like Germany and Finland worked hard to make it as difficult as possible for poorer countries to tap the euro-zone rescue fund. Ministers agreed that the common fund could eventually be used to recapitalize failing banks directly, but only to protect depositors\u2014not shareholders or bondholders\u2014and if the bank's home government has run out of money. More here. Speaking to reporters after the deal was agreed, Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem argued it was a significant step forward: If a bank gets in trouble we will now, throughout Europe, have one set of rules on who pays the bill,\" he said. \"The financial sector itself will now to a very, very large extent become responsible for dealing with its own problems. (that's from the BBC's take on the deal) Dijsselbloem had been heavily criticised a few months ago for indicating that the Cyprus bailout (which forced massive losses on some large depositors) was a template for future rescue deals. He backtracked on the comments, but this deal confirms that the Cypriot experience could be repeated across the continent. And German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble confirmed this point, telling reporters: They can affect German savers just as well as they can affect any other investor in the world. France's Pierre Moscovici told the press pack that Europe's bailout fund could still be used for bank rescues (after creditors have been hit). Reuters got the quotes: French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici signalled that ministers also agreed to French demands that the euro zone's rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, can be used to help banks in the 17-nation currency area that run into trouble. It makes the whole thing coherent,\" said Moscovici. \"It creates a solidity for the system and a system of solidarity. Here's the official statement from the EU, outlining the deal. In the Financial Times, Alex Barker describes the deal as the eurozone's \"flagship effort to bolster Europe\u2019s patchy national defences against bank failure\". Barker explains how ministers finally agreed some flexibility: Under the compromise, after the minimum bail-in is implemented, countries are additionally given an option to dip into resolution funds or state resources to recapitalise the bank and shield other creditors. The intervention is capped at 5 per cent of the bank\u2019s total liabilities and is contingent on Brussels approval. This issue of national flexibility bedevilled the talks for months, as member states jockeyed to tailor the rules to suit their own banks and past experiences of handling financial crises. A German-led group pushed for strict, automatic bail-in procedures, while France and some non-eurozone countries demanded more national discretion. Jurgen Baetz of Associated Press writes that the deal gives \"new credibility\" to Europe's push for banking union. He writes: Following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, countries like Ireland, Britain and Germany each had to pump dozens of billions of fresh capital into ailing banks to avoid the financial system from collapsing. To avoid that happening again, finance ministers discussed who should contribute in which order and how much to a bank's rescue - a so-called bail-in - so that ordinary taxpayers aren't left with the bill. \"Bail-in is now the rule,\" stressed Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan, adding the rules put an end to moral hazard by making it clear that banks will suffer before the government might come in to help, if at all. \"This is a revolutionary change in the way banks are treated,\" he added. But John O'Donnell and Robin Emmott of Reuters warn that banking union is far from agreed: Thorny issues lie ahead, not least whether countries or a central European authority should have the final say in shutting or restructuring a bad bank. The European Commission, the EU executive, is expected to unveil its proposal for a new agency to carry out this task of \"executioner\" as early as next week, officials said. \"The most important discussion has yet to start and that is how decisions on restructuring will be made,\" said Nicolas Veron, a financial expert at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. \"It's premature to say that Europe is getting its act together.\" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events in the eurozone, the world economy and the financial markets. Europe's finance ministers have finally agreed new rules to handle the cost of future bank bailouts, which will see losses forced onto creditors such as large depositers as well as bond holders and shareholders. After another late-night session in Brussels, ministers hammered out rules that will mean creditors are 'bailed in' to help cover the cost of future rescue deals. It's meant to end the era of taxpayers automatically picking up the tab, and should help Europe move towards proper banking union. The key to the deal is that 8% of a failing bank's total liabilities \u2013 first shareholders, then junior bondholders, then 'uninsured deposits' (over \u20ac100,000) \u2013 must be effectively 'wiped out' before public funds can be used. Deposits of under \u20ac100,000 remain protected. And the deal also puts big deposits held by large companies ahead in the firing line before those of smaller companies and individuals. Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, described it as a revolutionary change in the way banks are treated in the European Union. The deal also leaves some discretion for national goverments to decide whether to step in, as Jurgen Baetz of Associated Press explains: Those forced losses will go as high as 8% of a bank's total liabilities, only then would national governments kick in and top it up with a bailout possibly worth another 5% of the liabilities. The negotiations were complicated because some nations feared being bound by overly rigid European rules. Others warned that too much flexibility would create new imbalances between the bloc's weaker and stronger economies and a lack of common rules would destroy certainty for investors and erode trust in the financial system. Another key point: member states are expected to set up \"ex-ante resolution funds\", eventually holding a sum equal to 0.8% of national deposits, to fund their own contributions. The draft deal still needs the approval of the EU parliament, and is expected to begin in 2018. I'll pull together reaction to the deal, and more details, shortly. The deal comes before an EU summit where countries could agree further steps to move closer to full banking union. Leaders will also discuss plans to fight Europe's youth unemployment crisis. Also coming up today -- a general strike is taking place in Portugal in protest at the country's ongoing austerity measures; and new GDP data for the UK is released at 9.30am BST.",

It also keeps the progress towards banking union inching along.</li> <li>The burden has been shifted away from taxpayers towards bank creditors.</li> <li>The added flexibility is important between eurozone and non-eurozone countries, with the UK and Sweden scoring some important caveats. The deal highlights that non-eurozone countries can still have influence on such rules and the acceptance of the need for flexibility between the two groups.</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Negatives</strong></h2> <ul> <li>From a eurozone point of view, the flexibility could be counterproductive, particularly the use of exemptions in exceptional circumstances. How exactly will this be defined and determined? If at national level, then there could be clear political pressure in a crisis to invoke this. For example, it is hard to imagine that the crises in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain would not have triggered this in some way.</li> <li>Could see cost of bank funding rise, particularly in terms of unsecured credit due to fairly strong depositor preference.</li> <li>Lots of unanswered questions \u2013 not least, when and how will these rules apply? It\u2019s not clear in exactly what situation and at what time the new rules would kick in. Does it rely on a request for aid from the bank or the national government?</li> <li>Furthermore, there are questions over how this will work practically in different circumstances \u2013 for example, the difference between a bank which has almost completely failed and one which is simply struggling to recapitalise.</li> <li>The timeline also still seems very long, with the actual bail-in rules not in force until 2018, even though the directive is due to be in place by 2015. That said, the broad template may well still apply, particularly where banking union is involved.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/bank-bail-in-plans-finally-agreed-but.html\">More here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cc2dcce4b06b850836181e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-27T14:57:32.490Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Shares rally on Fed comments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After a quiet day in Europe, stock markets are now romping ahead with the FTSE 100 up by 105 points, and the Dow Jones 150 points to the good</strong>.</p> <p>The trigger is comments from a member of the Federal Reserve's Open Market committee, suggesting that the UE economy might not be strong enough to to justify ending its stimulus package.</p> <p><strong>William Dudley</strong>, the head of the New York Federal Reserve, told an audience in New York that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic circumstances could diverge significantly from the FOMC\u2019s expectations.</p> <p>If labor market conditions and the economy\u2019s growth momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC\u2019s outlook \u2014 and this is what has happened in recent years \u2014 I would expect that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>The suggestion that the Fed might not start to 'taper' its $85bn/month bond-buying programme is music to the markets' ears, it seems.....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/statuses/350263285054070784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_FX\">@katie_martin_FX</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/8DAU1p5xS9\">pic.twitter.com/8DAU1p5xS9</a></p>&mdash; Mike van Dulken (@Accendo_Mike) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/statuses/350263285054070784\">June 27, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cc20dee4b09046677b1bfb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-27T14:20:59.598Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU budget deal cheers Brussels, but Cameron shows concern</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4ec4274f-4bfd-4a6e-94a4-b5f2d364ab98\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372330417813/7cbfe2b2-6751-4de3-bc0b-50764a87dfb1-460x248.jpeg\" alt=\"European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, left, and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny participate in a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, June 27, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"248\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, left, and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny announcing today's deal.

The intervention is capped at 5 per cent of the bank\u2019s total liabilities and is contingent on Brussels approval.</p> <p>This issue of national flexibility bedevilled the talks for months, as member states jockeyed to tailor the rules to suit their own banks and past experiences of handling financial crises. A German-led group pushed for strict, automatic bail-in procedures, while France and some non-eurozone countries demanded more national discretion.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jurgen Baetz</strong> of <strong>Associated Press</strong> writes that the deal gives \"new credibility\" to Europe's push for banking union.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.turnto10.com/story/22698160/eu-agrees-on-bank-failure-rules-to-avoid-bailouts\">He writes:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, countries like Ireland, Britain and Germany each had to pump dozens of billions of fresh capital into ailing banks to avoid the financial system from collapsing.</p> <p>To avoid that happening again, finance ministers discussed who should contribute in which order and how much to a bank's rescue - a so-called bail-in - so that ordinary taxpayers aren't left with the bill.</p> <p>\"Bail-in is now the rule,\" stressed Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan, adding the rules put an end to moral hazard by making it clear that banks will suffer before the government might come in to help, if at all. \"This is a revolutionary change in the way banks are treated,\" he added.</p> </blockquote> <p>But John O'Donnell and Robin Emmott of Reuters <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/27/uk-eu-banks-idUKBRE95Q02H20130627\">warn that banking union is far from agreed</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thorny issues lie ahead, not least whether countries or a central European authority should have the final say in shutting or restructuring a bad bank.</p> <p>The European Commission, the EU executive, is expected to unveil its proposal for a new agency to carry out this task of \"executioner\" as early as next week, officials said.</p> <p>\"The most important discussion has yet to start and that is how decisions on restructuring will be made,\" said Nicolas Veron, a financial expert at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. \"It's premature to say that Europe is getting its act together.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cbdc15e4b0fc8ffec466c5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-27T06:35:52.750Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New bank rescue rules force losses on creditors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events in the eurozone, the world economy and the financial markets.</strong></p> <p>Europe's finance ministers have finally agreed new rules to handle the cost of future bank bailouts, which will see losses forced onto creditors such as large depositers as well as bond holders and shareholders.</p> <p>After another late-night session in Brussels, ministers hammered out rules that will mean creditors are 'bailed in' to help cover the cost of future rescue deals. <strong>It's meant to end the era of taxpayers automatically picking up the tab, and should help Europe move towards proper banking union.</strong></p> <p>The key to the deal is that 8% of a failing bank's total liabilities \u2013 <strong>first shareholders, then junior bondholders, then 'uninsured deposits' (over \u20ac100,000)</strong> \u2013 must be effectively 'wiped out' before public funds can be used.</p> <p>Deposits of under \u20ac100,000 remain protected. And the deal also puts big deposits held by large companies ahead in the firing line before those of smaller companies and individuals.</p> <p><strong>Michael Noonan</strong>, the Irish finance minister, described it as a revolutionary change in the way banks are treated in the European Union.</p> <p>The deal also leaves some discretion for national goverments to decide whether to step in, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaetz\"><strong>Jurgen Baetz</strong></a> of Associated Press explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those forced losses will go as high as 8% of a bank's total liabilities, only then would national governments kick in and top it up with a bailout possibly worth another 5% of the liabilities.</p> <p>The negotiations were complicated because some nations feared being bound by overly rigid European rules. Others warned that too much flexibility would create new imbalances between the bloc's weaker and stronger economies and a lack of common rules would destroy certainty for investors and erode trust in the financial system.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another key point: member states are expected to set up \"ex-ante resolution funds\", eventually holding a sum equal to 0.8% of national deposits, to fund their own contributions.</p> <p>The draft deal still needs the approval of the EU parliament, and is expected to begin in 2018.</p> <p>I'll pull together reaction to the deal, and more details, shortly.</p> <p><strong>The deal comes before an EU summit where countries could agree further steps to move closer to full banking union. Leaders will also discuss plans to fight Europe's youth unemployment crisis.</strong></p> <p>Also coming up today -- a general strike is taking place in Portugal in protest at the country's ongoing austerity measures; and new GDP data for the UK is released at 9.30am BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-27T07:10:48.670Z\">at 8.10am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Britain never suffered a double-dip recession in 2012 but suffered a deepercollapse in output following the financial crash than previously thought, according to new data that show the economy is even further away from a full recovery. The Office for National Statistics has reworked its quarterly growth figures for the beginning of last year to show a flat performance instead of previous estimates of a 0.1% decline. Without a fall in GDP in the first three months of 2012, Britain did not suffer two consecutive quarters of negative growth that would have resulted in its second recession in three years \u2013 otherwise known as a double-dip. The ONS said, however, that the first post-crunch recession in 2008/2009 was deeper than first estimated, meaning that economic output is now 3.9% lower than its pre-crash peak, compared with a previous estimate of 2.6%. David Tinsley, UK economist at investment bank BNP Paribas, said the figures revealed a weak economy in need of further stimulus from the Bank of England. \"The data highlights both the damage done to the economy following the crisis and the size of the challenge still facing it to rebalance. Unless it bounces considerably it raises serious concerns that after a solid second quarter, growth will at best be weak. These are good arguments for new Bank of England governor Mark Carney to consider a significant easing in policy as early as next week.\" Carney takes over from Sir Mervyn King on Monday and is under pressure in some quarters to take a more active role than his predecessor. But the nine-strong monetary policy committee that he will head has shown little appetite in recent months to pump further central bank funds into the economy, under the \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme. King and two other committee members have voted since February to increase the QE stock by \u00a325bn, only to be blocked by the remaining six. Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at the foreign exchange firm World First said Carney and the chancellor need to take further action to bring about a sustainable recovery. \"Whether the UK entered a double-dip or - as today's numbers show, it didn't - matters little to the man on the street who is seeing large falls in real-term wage growth as a result of the lack of business output. Sterling has fallen in the aftermath of this announcement, and although this data is three months old and could be considered stale, the lack of real improvement since leaves the government and the new Bank of England governor a lot to do.\" Coming a day after George Osborne was forced to announce a further \u00a311.5bn of cuts to government spending in 2015/16, the news that a double-dip recession has been written out of the economic history books will cheer the Treasury. Ministers have battled to show that the economy was healthier than official statistics showed during the turbulent years of 2011 and 2012, which were marred by the eurozone crisis and fears that the currency zone would break up. Separate figures revealed the economy is further away from getting back to its early 2008 peak and disposable incomes are at levels last seen in 1987. The ONS said the downturn in 2008/09 saw GDP decline by 7.2%, from the previous estimate of 6.3%. A deeper recession and a prolonged period of low growth leaves the government with a higher mountain to climb to restore the economy back to health, said analysts. Figures showing a long-term fall in disposable incomes emphasised the difficult task facing the Treasury as it struggles to boost consumer confidence and high street spending, both of which remain weak. Household disposable income fell by 1.7% in the first three months of 2013 compared with the previous quarter, which left it down by 0.3% year on year. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the fall \"undoubtedly reflected higher inflation, very low wage growth and faltering employment at the start of the year\". Consumer spending continued to rise, however, which Archer said was partly financed by a drop in the household savings ratio to 4.2% from 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 7.1% in the third quarter. \"This highlights the fact that consumers do still face serious headwinds,\" he said. Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said the revised figures showed the economy has grown by 1.1% since 2010, compared to the 6% forecast at the time. \"That's why living standards are falling and the deficit is not coming down.\"",

      "bodyText": "Toy and hobby retailer Modelzone has collapsed into administration, leaving 400 jobs at risk in the latest blow to the British high street. The company has appointed administrators from Deloitte in the hope of finding a white knight to save the business. Known for selling a range of products from model cars to aircraft and train sets, the business has struggled in recent years, making an operating loss in 2012 of \u00a3750,000, after a disastrous expansion plan left it with a hefty rent bill. Monday was the day for the latest quarterly rent payments, a deadline notorious for pushing struggling retailers into administration. Administrators are hopeful of finding a buyer with several parties thought to be interested, including former owner David Mordecai. Richard Hawes, joint administrator at Deloitte, explained: \"We are working closely with customers and employees to ensure the business has the best possible platform to secure a sale, preserve jobs and generate as much value as possible for all creditors.\" The company's 47 stores will remain open but the website has been shut down. Gift vouchers can still be used, but will only be worth 50% of their original value, the company said. Modelzone admitted it was struggling in its most recent accounts filed with Companies House: \"Trading performance for the year was disappointing \u2026 Following a review of the business, it became clear that the business infrastructure and management capability was insufficient, not only to take the business forward and grow further, but also to deliver sustainable profitability. It was also evident that the sales and profit expectations of the new stores opened between 2010 and 2012 were unrealistic.\" The stores also stock Hornby products through concessions and the administration could be a risk to Hornby employees on those sites. Hornby said it was aware of Modelzone's problems and did not think it would impact on its business. The retailer is the latest company to face closure, with furniture company Dwell going bust last week and curtains and soft-furnishings business Mostyn's also on the brink of collapse. Meanwhile, department store Debenhams said like-for-like sales remained flat in the three months to 22 June, with bosses warning that the high street will continue to struggle. Its chief executive, Michael Sharp, said: \"Consumer confidence has continued to bump along the bottom. You've seen more retailers falling this week and the CBI talking about stagnant sales volumes, so we've seen nothing that is showing a change to that sentiment.\"",

      "bodyText": "Fresh from taunting Labour at Wednesday's Spending Review that he inherited \"one of the biggest economic crises of the post-war era\", George Osborne discovered this morning that it was even worse than he or anyone had thought. As part of a blizzard of revisions to historical data, the Office for National Statistics announced that the economy was growing more strongly before the crisis than it had previously calculated \u2013 and crashed more spectacularly. The peak-to-trough fall in GDP was a catastrophic 7.2%, rather than the already-grim 6.3% of the last estimate. So despite the fact that the \"double-dip recession\" of 2011-12 has now been erased from history GDP is now estimated to be 3.9% below its pre-recession peak, instead of 2.6%. Or as John Hawksworth, chief executive of PwC puts it, \"we fell into a big hole and it is taking us longer to get out it of then we thought\". And these new figures will only deepen the disquieting sense that what happened in 2008-09 didn't just come out of a clear blue sky: it was partly the inevitable result of an unsustainable boom, that was allowed to run out of control, even as the Bank of England and the Treasury believed they had secured the holy grail of sustainable, non-inflationary growth. Gordon Brown's Treasury actually revised up its estimate of the long-term potential growth rate of the economy to 2.5% in 1999, a judgment that seemed vindicated when the economy expanded at 2-3% a year \u2013 or, we now learn, even faster \u2013 between 2002 and the onset of the crisis, without unleashing an inflationary spiral. But there were special factors operating during that period to keep inflation in check, not least the arrival of billions of pounds of cut-price goods from China. Meanwhile, house prices were rocketing at double-digit rates, the champagne corks were popping in the City, and the feckless banks were fuelling a credit bonanza. We can't undo the recklessness of those years; but perhaps the real underlying message from the ONS's latest calculations should be that even without the sub-prime crisis, Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers, it couldn't have gone on forever \u2013 and we must now get used to a very different world. \u2022 The subheading on this article was amended on 28 June 2013. An earlier version said economic growth was estimated to be 3.9% below its pre-recession peak. The figure is for GDP, not economic growth.",
