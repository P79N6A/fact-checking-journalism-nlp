      "bodyText": "Shortly before the fateful referendum, Lord Carrington, the Tory party\u2019s most distinguished elder statesman, was at a Sunday lunch in the country, listening patiently to the younger element discussing the merits or otherwise of one Alexander (Boris) Johnson. When they eventually paused for breath, the great man spoke, and brought the conversation to a halt with the simple remark: \u201cAnyway, he won\u2019t do.\u201d I recalled this episode last week when Ken Clarke, one of my favourite Tories of the generation after Carrington, and now in turn very much an elder statesman in his own right, was reported as saying something that could be paraphrased as \u201canyway, the referendum won\u2019t do\u201d. What Ken apparently wrote in an email to a constituent was that most politicians \u201cpaid lip-service to the supposedly democratic nature of the [referendum] exercise\u201d, but he would do his best \u201cto contribute to mitigating the disaster that this decision on 23 June might otherwise cause\u201d. He said he would probably vote against any move to trigger, via the infamous article 50, the Brexit process, and noted the shambles the government has already got itself into over trying to square the circle of remaining in the single market and customs union while satisfying the anti-immigration lobby. Which brings us to an interesting revelation by Nick Clegg, who has just published his version of the coalition years that wrecked the Lib Dem vote in last year\u2019s general election. Here we are, with the biggest housing crisis since the second world war, and Clegg tells us that either David Cameron or George Osborne (he can\u2019t remember which, but that hardly matters since, to coin a phrase, they were \u201call in it together\u201d) told him: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing: it just creates Labour voters.\u201d Clegg found Osborne\u2019s behaviour \u201cvery unattractive, very cynical \u2026 Welfare for Osborne was just a bottomless pit of savings, and it didn\u2019t really matter what the human consequences were.\u201d This, from a recent interview in the Guardian, provides chapter and verse for the conclusion that my fellow critics and I came to about Osborne right from the start of his nasty austerity programme. Not only was the attack on the poor disgraceful, and out of keeping with the kind of Conservatism believed in by Tories such as the late Ian Gilmour (who was meant to be one of David Cameron\u2019s heroes), but it must have contributed to the revolt against London and the establishment that was one of the factors behind the Brexit vote. In which context, the Oxford economist Andrew Graham \u2013 son of Winston Graham of Poldark fame \u2013 wrote in the course of the referendum campaign: \u201cOne of the more unedifying aspects of this campaign is observing Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, both members of a government that has been imposing cuts in public services, having the gall to blame [the pressure on public services] on immigration.\u201d Now, for the moment Theresa May has ruled out not only a second referendum but even a parliamentary vote on article 50. But Tim Farron, the leader of the Lib Dems, made the point last week that, as the public wakes up to the realisation that leaving the EU is a \u201ccalamitous situation that our children will pay for\u201d, the prevailing belief that a second referendum is out of the question may be challenged. I would add to Farron\u2019s observation: yes, \u201cthe people have spoken\u201d, but human nature is fickle, especially when faced with dawning reality, and the people may want to speak again. Indeed some of the people are already upset at reports that they may have to pay for visas to go to the continent. One of the more bizarre aspects of this rotten business is the title that has been bestowed upon my old friend and champion of civil liberties, David Davis. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Pure Yes, Minister. You could not make it up. Many people seem to have forgotten that Davis could well have become leader of the Conservative party until he was upstaged by David Cameron, who is now reduced to saying that at least one promise he kept was the one to hold a referendum \u2013 in truth, the one promise he should never have kept. Davis backed what turned out to be Theresa May\u2019s ultra-short-lived campaign, although he had often disagreed with her in the past. There is a mutual respect there, but it is already being sorely tested by May\u2019s understandable desperation to maintain as many trading advantages as possible, while Davis is quite cavalier about the single market. He believes that the completion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations in the 1990s was more important for the British economy than joining the single market (which latter move Mrs Thatcher, no less, initiated). One can agree to disagree on this, but what is especially absurd about Brexit is that the kind of regulations and tariff barriers that are in prospect for British business would make current complaints about \u201cBrussels\u201d look like a vicarage tea party. Yes, sorry: I refuse to accept the prevailing view that we must accept the results of the referendum and \u201cmove on\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Red velvet curtains hung on the windows and painted cherubs played on the ceiling as Jim Ratcliffe accepted the 2016 ICIS Kavaler Award at the Metropolitan Club in New York last week. The British billionaire is the first foreigner to be awarded the honour, given by leaders in the chemical industry. It comes as Ineos, the chemicals company he founded, plans to bring fracking \u2013 the controversial oil and gas extraction process \u2013 back to the UK. Ineos is planning as many as 30 applications for fracking sites in the UK within the next year. As part of its campaign to win over critics, Ineos invited journalists to tour fracking sites in Pennsylvania operated by Consol, a Pittsburgh-based producer of natural gas and coal and, supposedly, an example of why fracking will be good for the UK. What\u2019s in store for the UK can be seen about an hour southwest of Pittsburgh, in township of Switzerland, Ohio, where a rig stands near a farm. The well is in its earliest stages: drilling goes on 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Sitting in a big armchair surrounded by screens, \u201cT-Ball\u201d, a burly 6ft drill operator, works 12-hour shifts, controlling the drilling like a video game. He does this for two-week stints. At night, another person takes over \u2013 also working a 12-hour shift. Ineos estimates that it will be at least five years before any of its UK wells are actually producing shale gas. Fracking will be good for Britain, according to Ineos, making it more independent and creating jobs. By 2018-19, about 69% of UK gas will be imported. Fracking, Ineos says, would help the UK become less dependent on other nations and would supplement dwindling North Sea resources. A 2014 Ernst &amp; Young report predicts that fracking could create more than 64,000 jobs. It has certainly been a boon to the US jobs market \u2013 albeit one with a sting in its tail. A National Bureau of Economic Research study published last year found that, between 2005 and 2012, the fracking boom added as many as 640,000 jobs in the US in the energy industry and related services. But boom turned to bust as oversupply led to tumbling oil prices, stalled production and layoffs. Since 2014, the US energy and mining sectors have shed more than 223,000 jobs. Despite the appeal of energy independence and possibility of thousands of new jobs, many UK residents remain opposed to fracking due to concerns over environmental damage, climate change and the possibility of tremors. In the process of fracking, water, sand and chemicals are forced into the ground under high pressure to extract natural gas. Earth tremors have been linked to disposal wells \u2013 where excess water from drilling is injected back into ground \u2013 created during the process. There has been no fracking in the UK since 2011, when Cuadrilla Resources\u2019 operations were said to be a \u201chighly probable\u201d cause of two earth tremors in northwest England. The moratorium on fracking was lifted in May 2013, but no fracking well proposals were actually approved until earlier this year, when North Yorkshire county council gave the go-ahead to an application by Third Energy. \u201cDrilling does not cause earthquakes,\u201d said Tim Dugan, chief operating officer of Consol. According to Dugan, seismic testing has improved over the years and data shows faultlines that could potentially cause tremors, allowing drillers to avoid them. But the consequences of unfettered fracking are clear in the US. A study by the US Geological Survey showed that increased fluid pressure in geological fault zones from disposal wells has increased earthquake vulnerability in a some states. As a result, parts of Oklahoma and Kansas now face earthquake risks on a par with California. Ineos insists that fracking in the UK will be different. For one, the technology has come a long way over the past decade. As the US fracking industry has matured, lessons were learned, making it easier to replicate best practices on fracking sites in the UK. To ease the inconvenience of light, noise and traffic during drilling, Ineos has also pledged 6% of its profits to the UK communities where it will frack. But fracking in the UK still faces stiff opposition from communities where drilling is planned, and from environmental campaigners. There is no way fracking can be done responsibly, \u201cno matter what regulations are proposed\u201d, according to John Detwiler of the Marcellus Protest coalition, an environmental pressure group in Pennsylvania. He said many company-sponsored fact-finding trips to Pennsylvania were \u201cmerely window-dressing for decisions being made in back rooms\u201d. \u201cNaturally, the drillers, and the government officials whose election campaigns they\u2019ve sponsored, can be expected to put on a good show for invited visitors, but the truth is that fracking has not been a success in Pennsylvania,\u201d he said.",

Sales at stores open more than a year rose 10% in the six months to the end of July. Even executive chairman Peter Cowgill sounded surprised by the group\u2019s 66% rise in underlying profits, revealed on Tuesday, saying they \u201cexceeded reasonable expectations.\u201d But the performance should not be a shock. The sportswear market is generally less weather-dependent than the rest of the clothing market and JD is at the centre of the catwalk-led \u201cathleisure\u201d trend for sportswear as fashion. Major brands such as Nike and Adidas have been expanding their ranges to include the kind of sportswear meant to be worn outside the gym. Celebrities such as Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 whose athleisure line, Ivy Park, is sold in JD \u2013 have given a boost to the trend, which is drawing more women into sport stores. Sales in JD\u2019s womenswear are soaring, having traditionally made up less than 30% of the chain\u2019s sales compared with 60% for the whole UK clothing market. Of course trends come and go, so there is some debate whether JD\u2019s mini-boom will drop off once young people move on to something new. Cowgill argues: \u201cWe can never predict the future but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trend. I think it\u2019s a culture, a lifestyle situation. Not long ago you couldn\u2019t go into a bar with trainers on: now it is more acceptable.\u201d And it\u2019s not only bars. Sales of trainers are rising around the world as casualwear becomes the norm in offices as well as at social events. Richard Hyman, the veteran independent retail analyst, says: \u201cTrainers have become shoes and the key beneficiary has not been traditional footwear retailers or apparel retailers with footwear departments. This market is highly branded, whereas mainstream fashion is very own-label. People want the credibility of a brand and JD has built a business on that.\u201d Of course, Sports Direct has also benefited from that trend, but to a lesser extent, as JD has a much stronger relationships with the key brands. This gives it access to more exclusive products, and launches of sought-after new designs. Cowgill says fostering those relationships through investment in the look and ambience of stores has been key to keeping such brands on board. Kate Calvert, an analyst at JD\u2019s house broker Investec, says: \u201cSports Direct has had quite a turbulent time with the two major suppliers, Nike and Adidas \u2013 they\u2019re always falling in and out of love with each other.\u201d In that environment, JD has been able to get access to premium products at premium prices, insulating it from some of the wider market deflation. Sports Direct has cottoned on to this and is trying to woo the brands back with investment in stores, alongside efforts to tackle the employment and governance practices that have drawn so much bad publicity. Fiona Paton, an analyst at Verdict Retail, says: \u201c[JD] has benefited from Sports Direct\u2019s mass of bad publicity and the distractions that has caused its senior management. \u201cHowever, this will not go on indefinitely, and Sports Direct has announced plans to target more premium brands with investment in its Flannels fascia, so JD Sports is likely to face tougher competition in the near future.\u201d Cowgill counters: \u201cAll our competitors worry us. We\u2019ve got to keep an eye on various parts of the market.\u201d He adds with a smile about Sports Direct: \u201cIt remains to be seen if they get their act together. We try to avoid being in direct competition. We see the market as huge enough for the two of us.\u201d That market increasingly includes Europe, where JD is expanding its main chain in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and, most recently, Portugal. It also owns Sprinter in Spain, Chausport in France and has taken its trendy Size? footwear chain into five countries over the channel. Further afield, it has bought outlets in Malaysia and Australia. Revenues are up 38% in Europe and 14% elsewhere, although the profitability of these operations is not yet clear. Last week, Cowgill was in a bullish mood. \u201cWe never rest on our laurels and we are gutted if there\u2019s even a day when our numbers are negative. We drive as hard as we possibly can.\u201d It could be a speech from a professional sportsman.",

      "bodyText": "Let bygones be bygones? Not if Elizabeth Warren has anything to say about it. This past week marked the eighth anniversary of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers \u2013 and the near collapse of the entire US financial system. And Warren, the crusading Democratic senator from Massachusetts, still hopes to bring some of the individuals responsible for the debacle to justice. When the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) wrapped up its work investigating the causes of the cataclysm, it referred nine individuals to the justice department, noting commission members believed they had identified serious violations of securities laws or other offenses. Warren wants to know why the justice department has been twiddling its thumbs for eight years, while citizens\u2019 confidence in both government and the financial system dwindles. She points out that of the nine individuals named referred for possible prosecution, only one has ever faced any penalties. Even then, when the Securities and Exchange Commission fined former Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd for misleading investors about the degree to which the mortgage funding entity was at risk of collapsing due its exposure to risky mortgages, it was Fannie Mae itself that wrote the $100,000 check on Mudd\u2019s behalf, to a special US Treasury account that accepts \u201cgifts\u201d. Thanks to the National Archives, we know the identities of the other individuals the FCIC panel referred to the DoJ to be considered for criminal charges. Among the most notable figures is Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary who oversaw Wall Street\u2019s deregulation and has held top jobs at two of the biggest beneficiaries of that move, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Rubin, the FCIC members suggested, may have been responsible \u2013 together with fellow top Citigroup management \u2013 for keeping the value of the mortgage securities that were stuck on the bank\u2019s balance sheet and for which they couldn\u2019t find buyers, inflated. That meant they could hide the extent to which Citi was exposed to subprime mortgages, declaring at one point it was 76% lower than the actual levels. That may rise to the level of fraud. Another name on the list is that of Charles Prince, Citi\u2019s CEO, who achieved fame/infamy for his comment that \u201cas long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance\u201d. At the FCIC hearings, he tried to argue that no individual bank had the power to stop the madness that led up to the financial crisis: as long as his competitors kept making more reckless loans, he had no choice but to follow suit \u2013 and keep dancing. The problem is that whining that \u201cwell, Joey was doing it, too, and he made me do it\u201d is the kind of excuse that goes out of fashion by the time you\u2019re a teenager. It\u2019s inappropriate in a middle-schooler, much less a middle-aged man. And yet, as Elizabeth Warren points out, the DoJ has been sitting on a list of middle-aged bankers for several years now. It\u2019s unclear to what extent any wrongdoing can still be prosecuted, given that the statute of limitations will apply to many of these cases. But at the very least, the DoJ can explain why they failed to act, as she has requested. True, financial crimes can be tough to prosecute: the issues are complex and lend themselves to finger-pointing, with everyone pointing to someone else as the culprit. And some of the trials that have taken place haven\u2019t had results that would necessarily have encouraged the DoJ. Most recently, several the traders accused of being involved in rigging the key Libor interest rate, affecting the cost of trillions of dollars of loans, mortgages and other financial deals, and who were known by names like \u201cLord Libor\u201d and \u201cBig Nose\u201d, were acquitted in trials. A Swiss private banker was acquitted of helping his US clients duck taxes in a Miami trial. In one of a handful of cases directly linked to the financial crisis itself, the managers of a Bear Stearns hedge fund that collapsed in 2007 after investing in subprime mortgage securities were accused of securities fraud. It was supposed to be an easy win for prosecutors in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, but jurors acquitted the two men in late 2009. In fact, one of the only major courtroom victories came in 2013, when \u201cthe fabulous Fab\u201d, aka former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre, was found liable by a federal jury for defrauding investors in a mortgage deal that made hedge fund managers who took the other side of the deal a lot of money \u2013 but cost the investors millions. But this was a civil, not a criminal case, and Tourre had to pay monetary damages, not spend any time in jail. Goldman Sachs, too, forked over $550m to settle related charges, neither admitting nor denying any wrongdoing in the matter, a phrase calculated to drive Warren and all of Wall Street\u2019s other critics around the bend. No one has gone to jail. Perhaps this would matter a little less \u2013 a little, a very little \u2013 if Wall Street\u2019s arrogance had been dimmed by the events of 2008. Or if it the Libor trading scandal hadn\u2019t flared up, or if JP Morgan Chase hadn\u2019t experienced the London Whale derivative trading losses, the latter ultimately costing the bank $6bn. In neither case has anyone been marched off to jail. Two of the colleagues of Bruno Iksil, the derivatives trader who orchestrated the trades \u2013 the \u201cwhale\u201d in question \u2013 have been charged with criminal conspiracy, but haven\u2019t set foot in the US to face those offenses. Meanwhile, Iksil resurfaced and in true whale-like fashion, made a big splash earlier this year by objecting to his moniker. He also insisted, in a letter sent to Bloomberg, that his managers told him what to do; that it was a bank-designed strategy that ran amok. \u201cThe losses \u2026 were not the actions of one person acting in an unauthorized manner,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy role was to execute a trading strategy that had been initiated, approved, mandated and monitored\u201d by bank management. In other words, if we want to comfort ourselves by thinking of Iksil and others like him as rogues, we\u2019re demented. That\u2019s something to ponder now as we read the headlines about the revelations at Wells Fargo, where some 5,300 middle-ranking and junior employees were fired for opening sham accounts in the name of existing customers. The employees met the bank\u2019s sales targets and their own productivity targets; the customers didn\u2019t have a clue about what was going on until they realized they were hit with a fee for an account they hadn\u2019t opened, or saw their credit was downgraded for some unknown reason. The good news is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exists; stopped this and collected a penalty. But Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the consumer banking division that was busy doing all this, will walk away with $124.5m in pay, while being called a \u201cstandard-bearer for our culture\u201d by John Stumpff, the bank\u2019s CEO. Thankfully, federal prosecutors are already looking at Wells Fargo\u2019s sales practices \u2013 but the investigation can\u2019t stop at the lower level. At some point, the cultural standard bearers \u2013 the bosses \u2013 the people who put in place trading strategies and policies that others implement \u2013 will have to do more than simply sign the checks made payable to the SEC and other regulators. From dipping into their own (very, very healthy) bank accounts, to defending their actions in a civil or criminal court, it\u2019s time to hold top managers accountable for what happens within their firms. They can\u2019t just scoop up the profits and pretend they don\u2019t know the risks that the institution is running to generate those returns, or ignore the possibility that earning them required abusing the trust of clients, or even putting the financial system at risk. The events of eight years ago remind us what happened when Rubin, Prince, and others forgot. It\u2019s time to rally behind Warren and demand an accounting for those events, so that we have a precedent for holding Stumpff responsible for what just took place at Wells Fargo. Never again.",

Most recently, several the traders accused of being involved in rigging the key Libor interest rate, affecting the cost of trillions of dollars of loans, mortgages and other financial deals, and who were known by names like \u201cLord Libor\u201d and \u201cBig Nose\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jan/29/serious-office-back-in-the-dock-after-libor-acquittals\">were acquitted</a> in trials. A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-ag-banking-weil-idUSKBN0IN26820141104\">Swiss private banker</a> was acquitted of helping his US clients duck taxes in a Miami trial. </p> <p>In one of a handful of cases directly linked to the financial crisis itself, the managers of a Bear Stearns hedge fund that collapsed in 2007 after investing in subprime mortgage securities were accused of securities fraud. It was supposed to be an easy win for prosecutors in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/business/11bear.html?_r=0\">jurors acquitted the two men in late 2009</a>. In fact, one of the only major courtroom victories came in 2013, when \u201cthe fabulous Fab\u201d, aka former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre, was <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/former-goldman-trader-tourre-says-he-will-not-appeal/\">found liable by a federal jury</a> for defrauding investors in a mortgage deal that made hedge fund managers who took the other side of the deal a lot of money \u2013 but cost the investors millions. </p> <p>But this was a civil, not a criminal case, and Tourre had to pay monetary damages, not spend any time in jail. Goldman Sachs, too, forked over $550m to settle related charges, neither admitting nor denying any wrongdoing in the matter, a phrase calculated to drive Warren and all of Wall Street\u2019s other critics around the bend. No one has gone to jail.</p> <p>Perhaps this would matter a little less \u2013 a little, a very little \u2013 if Wall Street\u2019s arrogance had been dimmed by the events of 2008. Or if it the Libor trading scandal hadn\u2019t flared up, or if JP Morgan Chase hadn\u2019t experienced the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/19/investing/jpmorgan-london-whale-fine/\">London Whale derivative trading losses</a>, the latter ultimately costing the bank $6bn. In neither case has anyone been marched off to jail. Two of the colleagues of Bruno Iksil, the derivatives trader who orchestrated the trades \u2013 the \u201cwhale\u201d in question \u2013 have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/14/investing/jpmorgan-london-whale/index.html?iid=EL\">charged with criminal conspiracy</a>, but haven\u2019t set foot in the US to face those offenses.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Iksil resurfaced and in true whale-like fashion, made a big splash earlier this year by objecting to his moniker. He also insisted, in <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-23/jpmorgan-s-london-whale-surfaces-to-say-12-loss-not-his-fault\">a letter sent to Bloomberg</a>, that his managers told him what to do; that it was a bank-designed strategy that ran amok. \u201cThe losses \u2026 were not the actions of one person acting in an unauthorized manner,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy role was to execute a trading strategy that had been initiated, approved, mandated and monitored\u201d by bank management.</p> <p>In other words, if we want to comfort ourselves by thinking of Iksil and others like him as rogues, we\u2019re demented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aae315bb633c56a1d2d554f274c05aca25f4b99c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aae315bb633c56a1d2d554f274c05aca25f4b99c/0_22_4003_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Goldman Sachs vice president Fabrice Tourre had to pay monetary damages, but did not spend any time in jail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ex-Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre had to pay monetary damages, but did not spend any time in jail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s something to ponder now as we read the headlines about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/wells-fargo-settlement-illegal-sales-accounts\">revelations at Wells Fargo</a>, where some 5,300 middle-ranking and junior employees were fired for opening sham accounts in the name of existing customers. The employees met the bank\u2019s sales targets and their own productivity targets; the customers didn\u2019t have a clue about what was going on until they realized they were hit with a fee for an account they hadn\u2019t opened, or saw their credit was downgraded for some unknown reason. </p> <p>The good news is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exists; stopped this and collected a penalty. </p> <p>But Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the consumer banking division that was busy doing all this, will walk away with $124.5m in pay, while being called a \u201c<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/12/wells-fargo-cfpb-carrie-tolstedt/\">standard-bearer for our culture</a>\u201d by John Stumpff, the bank\u2019s CEO. </p> <p>Thankfully, federal prosecutors are already looking at Wells Fargo\u2019s sales practices \u2013 but the investigation can\u2019t stop at the lower level. </p> <p>At some point, the cultural standard bearers \u2013 the bosses \u2013 the people who put in place trading strategies and policies that others implement \u2013 will have to do more than simply sign the checks made payable to the SEC and other regulators.</p> <p>From dipping into their own (very, very healthy) bank accounts, to defending their actions in a civil or criminal court, it\u2019s time to hold top managers accountable for what happens within their firms. They can\u2019t just scoop up the profits and pretend they don\u2019t know the risks that the institution is running to generate those returns, or ignore the possibility that earning them required abusing the trust of clients, or even putting the financial system at risk. </p> <p>The events of eight years ago remind us what happened when Rubin, Prince, and others forgot. It\u2019s time to rally behind Warren and demand an accounting for those events, so that we have a precedent for holding Stumpff responsible for what just took place at Wells Fargo. </p> <p>Never again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As thousands of people flocked to New York this past week for New York Fashion Week, the great cycle began again. Clothes worn by the models will make their way from the runway to fashion desks and designer stores and then to people\u2019s closets. Some of the most expensive pieces will make it to consignment stores offering bargain hunters the chance to snap up high-end clothing at affordable prices. Consignment stores that let fashionistas trade their clothes for cash have been with us for decades but now there\u2019s a growing appetite for secondhand clothes stores specializing in high-end labels. Everyone seems to benefit. The rich get to offload last season\u2019s looks and the rest of us get to shop the closets of the in-crowd and the 1%. Department stores have experienced a drop in sales and stores like Sears, Gap, Macy\u2019s and Kate Spade have all announced that they were shuttering shops across the country but resale shops, on the other hand, enjoyed an increase in sales in 2015. The resale industry \u2013 including not-for-profit stores like thrift shops \u2013 grew at about 7% a year in 2014 and 2015, according to the National Association of Resale Professionals (Narts). It also saw an increase in inventory with more people looking to make money off of their clothes, according to Narts. Consignment stores are winning because they have a smart business model, said Tammy Fluhr-Gates, whose family founded and still owns Michael\u2019s on Madison Avenue in New York. Michael\u2019s opened in 1954 and was among the first consignment stores in the US. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much overhead because we don\u2019t own the merchandise. We don\u2019t have to project six months out for what the trend will be and can change on a dime,\u201d Fluhr-Gates explained. Consignment stores can adjust prices according to whatever is happening that day \u2013 whether there are more people buying or selling. \u201cThere are few businesses where everyone feels like they are winning.\u201d Consignors are winning because they are able to monetize a piece of clothing they no longer need or want. Shoppers win because they get a piece of high-end clothing at a discount. The consignment store wins by \u201cbringing them together\u201d. On average, Americans selling their clothes get from 40% to 60% of the selling price. The rest goes to the store. About 80% of clothes taken in by Michael\u2019s are sold within the first 30 days, said Fluhr-Gates. \u201cWe price to sell,\u201d she said, adding that consignors should think of clothes as real estate. If you overprice your house, you run the risk of it sitting on the market for too long. \u201cThe same kind of phenomenon can happen in the consignment store.\u201d Elizabeth Murphy, who along with her husband Ben Malik Karambiri owns three high-end consignment stores called Eleven \u2013 one in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn \u2013 loves the hustle of consigning. \u201cIt\u2019s always something new every day whether it\u2019s the consignor being crazy or irate and fighting with us about what she wants for price point or someone coming in and buying $3,000 worth of old Givenchy T-shirts because they collect them,\u201d she said. Haggling over prices does not faze Murphy \u2013 there is a specific formula to pricing items at a consignment shop. \u201cAnything that\u2019s not Chanel or Herm\u00e8s immediately depreciates by half the minute you walk out of the store. You bought a Prada dress for $500 from Prada on Fifth Avenue. You walk out the store, it is now worth $250. If the tags are on it, you have never worn it, it\u2019s never been photographed, you\u2019ve never washed it, I am going to keep it at $250. After it sells, you can have a half of that. That\u2019s a 50-50 split. That\u2019s consignment. We are glorified eBay essentially with the different percentage,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it has been washed, loved, abused, you were photographed in it, it has been worn 10 times or it is a mass-produced item, I cut the price in half again so now that $500 dress is at $125. That\u2019s my price point. That\u2019s how I decided prices.\u201d There is a reason why items from Chanel and Herm\u00e8s sell for more: they are unique and the collections are limited. \u201cI tell people the clothes don\u2019t have the best retail value because they are so mass produced. I mean Prada is in 30 states in the United States and 75 countries. This is glorified Zara at that point,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cWhen something becomes mass produced, it loses its value just like any antique or a car. Mass production kills value.\u201d Owners of consignment stores agree that the idea of selling and buying used clothes has become more mainstream over the years. For one, there was a rise in websites like eBay that enabled people to sell their possessions. Then came the recession. As many Americans found themselves without a raise for years or taking lower-paid jobs to make ends meet, making money off clothes one already owned, as well as buying slightly used clothes at a discount, became more and more appealing. \u201cWe have seen everything. We have seen a young girl who got a handbag for Christmas \u2013 she wore it, loved it, abused it \u2013 and now wants to sell it and make some rent money. We have seen a woman from Connecticut sell us four Birkin bags from the back of her car in a parking lot because she is getting a divorce and has to make money. She is selling them under the fly from her husband,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cNine times out of 10, [consignors are] someone who just needs straight money.\u201d Anyone doubting the widespread acceptance and popularity of shopping for used clothes need look no further than Macklemore\u2019s 2013 hit Thrift Shop. The song sat on top of Billboard\u2019s top 100 list for weeks. It was subsequently deemed \u201cthe most successful track in the 25 years of Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart\u201d. The $20 bill burning a hole in Macklemore\u2019s pocket, however, would do him no good at any of the high-end consignment stores in New York, where price tags can range from a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousand. Despite the prices, the market has gotten slightly younger over the years, said Greg Selig, owner of Encounters. Encounters was the first high-end consignment store to open in the US in 1954. Selig\u2019s mother was a salesperson there before she and her husband bought the store in 1981. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a young girl just out of college, she wants her first job, she wants her first fancy handbag. It\u2019s the woman between 22 and 40 \u2013 they want to keep up with the Joneses. They want to look good. They are practical shoppers. It\u2019s people who are trendsetters. It\u2019s people who go: I can\u2019t go to Macy\u2019s. I can\u2019t go to Bloomingdale\u2019s. I can\u2019t wear the same thing my friend does. I have to wear something super unique. I want to stand out,\u201d Murphy agreed. While the buyers might have gotten younger, consignors remain slightly older. \u201cThe younger audience is not going to be spending $1,200 on a [new] bag in terms of an accessible income. The customer base has gotten younger but in terms of the consignment base \u2013 the people selling the goods \u2013 there\u2019s only so young you can get in terms of who has accessible income\u201d to buy the items often seen on the runway, Selig explained. Fluhr-Gates recalled once telling another reporter that the most expensive item sold at Michael\u2019s was an $18,000 handbag. Who would buy that? Someone rich, she said. \u201cPeople who are purchasing from us have the ability to walk down to Herm\u00e8s and buy it from Herm\u00e8s directly, but they understand the value of consignment because they can get it for a few thousand dollars less, which is not chump change,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, because they recognize that recycling has a benefit and that value can also reside in the thrill of the hunt. There is also a psychological aspect to shopping consignment. And you never know what you are going to find.\u201d",

That\u2019s how I decided prices.\u201d</p> <p>There is a reason why items from Chanel and Herm\u00e8s sell for more: they are unique and the collections are limited.</p> <p>\u201cI tell people the clothes don\u2019t have the best retail value because they are so mass produced. I mean Prada is in 30 states in the United States and 75 countries. This is glorified Zara at that point,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cWhen something becomes mass produced, it loses its value just like any antique or a car. Mass production kills value.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5d0605277e37621b860c57dba766619ff36717b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5d0605277e37621b860c57dba766619ff36717b/0_21_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cA bag will fit everybody.

For one, there was a rise in websites like eBay that enabled people to sell their possessions. Then came the recession. As many Americans found themselves without a raise for years or taking lower-paid jobs to make ends meet, making money off clothes one already owned, as well as buying slightly used clothes at a discount, became more and more appealing.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen everything. We have seen a young girl who got a handbag for Christmas \u2013 she wore it, loved it, abused it \u2013 and now wants to sell it and make some rent money. We have seen a woman from Connecticut sell us four Birkin bags from the back of her car in a parking lot because she is getting a divorce and has to make money. She is selling them under the fly from her husband,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cNine times out of 10, [consignors are] someone who just needs straight money.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QK8mJJJvaes?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Anyone doubting the widespread acceptance and popularity of shopping for used clothes need look no further than Macklemore\u2019s 2013 hit Thrift Shop. The song sat on top of Billboard\u2019s top 100 list for weeks. <a href=\"http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/macklemore-s-thrift-shop-tops-billboard-s-100-hot-rap-songs-of-the-last-25-years-news.9686.html\">It was subsequently deemed</a> \u201cthe most successful track in the 25 years of Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart\u201d.</p> <p>The $20 bill burning a hole in Macklemore\u2019s pocket, however, would do him no good at any of the high-end consignment stores in New York, where price tags can range from a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousand.</p> <p>Despite the prices, the market has gotten slightly younger over the years, said Greg Selig, owner of Encounters. Encounters was the first high-end consignment store to open in the US in 1954. Selig\u2019s mother was a salesperson there before she and her husband bought the store in 1981.</p> <p>\u201cI would say it\u2019s a young girl just out of college, she wants her first job, she wants her first fancy handbag. It\u2019s the woman between 22 and 40 \u2013 they want to keep up with the Joneses. They want to look good. They are practical shoppers. It\u2019s people who are trendsetters. It\u2019s people who go: I can\u2019t go to Macy\u2019s. I can\u2019t go to Bloomingdale\u2019s. I can\u2019t wear the same thing my friend does. I have to wear something super unique. I want to stand out,\u201d Murphy agreed.</p> <p>While the buyers might have gotten younger, consignors remain slightly older.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger audience is not going to be spending $1,200 on a [new] bag in terms of an accessible income. The customer base has gotten younger but in terms of the consignment base \u2013 the people selling the goods \u2013 there\u2019s only so young you can get in terms of who has accessible income\u201d to buy the items often seen on the runway, Selig explained.</p> <p>Fluhr-Gates recalled once telling another reporter that the most expensive item sold at Michael\u2019s was an $18,000 handbag. Who would buy that? Someone rich, she said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who are purchasing from us have the ability to walk down to Herm\u00e8s and buy it from Herm\u00e8s directly, but they understand the value of consignment because they can get it for a few thousand dollars less, which is not chump change,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, because they recognize that recycling has a benefit and that value can also reside in the thrill of the hunt. There is also a psychological aspect to shopping consignment. And you never know what you are going to find.\u201d</p>",
