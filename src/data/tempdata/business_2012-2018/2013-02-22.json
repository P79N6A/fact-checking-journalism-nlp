      "bodyText": "The loss-making Lloyds Banking Group is poised to reignite rows over executive excess and rewards for failure by giving a \u00a31.4m bonus, on top of \u00a31m basic salary, to its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. The remuneration committee of the bank, which was bailed out with \u00a321bn from the taxpayer in 2008, meets next week to recommend the payout despite Lloyds being expected to report a loss for 2012 of more than \u00a3500m. The bosses of Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, Antony Jenkins and Stephen Hester, have waived their 2012 bonuses and Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said last night that Horta-Os\u00f3rio should do the same. The peer, who resigned from the government believing it too soft on the banks, said it would not be appropriate for Horta-Os\u00f3rio to receive any extra payout until there was more tangible evidence of Lloyds' contribution to supporting small and medium-sized businesses. The bank, which remains 40% state-owned, would not comment publicly and insisted privately that no decision had yet been made about the chief executive's payout, but sources confirmed that a figure of around \u00a31.4m was under consideration, to be paid in shares and deferred until the taxpayer broke even on its stake. Lloyds is understood to have taken soundings from the government on the payout to ensure it will not face immediate opposition from ministers. Friends of the Portuguese-born chief executive pointed out that he played no part in the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal, which had done most damage to the bank's 2012 financial figures, to be formally released on 1 March. They also noted that the bank boss has presided over an increase in business loans and an astonishing bounceback in the Lloyds share price, which outperformed all other members of the FTSE 100 index of leading companies. \"The maximum he [Horta-Os\u00f3rio] is eligible for is 225% of his annual salary which would be \u00a32.3m and he has very tough financial and non-financial targets to meet, including lending to small businesses.

The equivalent statutory loss for the previous year was \u00a33.5bn. The PPI problems, which have so far cost Lloyds \u00a35.3bn in provisions, took place before Horta-Os\u00f3rio arrived from rival Santander UK two years ago. The group's underlying pre-tax profits for last year are expected to come in at \u00a32.4bn, up from \u00a3638m in 2011. The Lloyds boss waived his bonus for the year before last, a decision made easier by the fact that he took an eight-week break from work suffering from exhaustion. Meanwhile the Lloyds annual losses will look good when compared with an almost \u00a34bn deficit expected to be announced by RBS when it provides its figures on 28 February. RBS, which is 81% owned by the state after a \u00a345.5bn billion bailout at the height of the financial crisis, disclosed last November that it was taking an additional \u00a3400m hit for claims relating to PPI. The bank also revealed that another \u00a350m was needed to cover a computer system failure which left millions of people without access to their accounts. Hester said last year he would waive his annual bonus after the bank's IT collapse, but next month he is in line for around \u00a3780,000 in shares, which can be cashed in 12 months later, as part of a reward scheme for his performance in 2010.",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone recession set to continue", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The eurozone will remain mired in recession in 2013 and leading nations such as France and Spain will miss debt-cutting targets, the European commission has admitted, backtracking on forecasts that the 17- country bloc will grow this year. The European Union's executive body blamed a lack of bank lending to households and businesses, and record joblessness, for delaying the recovery. Unemployment in the eurozone is set to peak at 12% in 2013, or more than 19 million people, it said. Greece and Spain will be the worst-hit countries, with jobless rates of 27% this year. The estimate highlights the widening chasm between Germany and France, the two largest eurozone economies, amid warnings this week that France is drifting closer to the bloc's periphery than its main economic rival. The commission predicts that Germany will grow by 0.5% this year, while France is expected to eke out just 0.1% growth. Joblessness among the French is expected to hit 10.7%, compared with 5.7% in Germany. A senior ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel accused France of being a \"problem child\" in the eurozone. Michael Fuchs told German radio the French needed to save, implement economic reforms and work longer hours. \"Other countries have done their homework a lot more intensively, for example Spain and Italy \u2026 but the French believed they could escape this,\" he said. Marco Buti, the commission's director general for economic and financial affairs, said unemployment remained unacceptably high. This had grave social consequences, he said, and could weigh on growth in the future if it becomes entrenched. The figures also have consequences for the UK because the eurozone is the economy's largest trading partner and is the fulcrum of hopes for an export-led recovery in Britain's finances. The commission said the threat of a breakup of the eurozone had receded and financial market conditions had improved substantially, but the impact had not yet fed through into the real economy. As a result, it said the 17 eurozone economies would contract by 0.3% in 2013 rather than grow by 0.1%, as previously predicted. The figures harboured bad news for Spain and France's debt-cutting targets. Under EU budget rules, eurozone states can face fines if they fail to take action to meet deficit targets \u2013 the difference between income and spending \u2013 set by EU finance ministers. The main strggler is Spain, which badly missed the deficit target of 6.3% of GDP for 2012 with a result of 10.2%. This year, Madrid will have a deficit of 6.7% rather than the 4.5% it has been set. And unless government policies change, Spain will have a gap of 7.2% in 2014 against the target of 2.8%, the commission said. France will also miss its targets. This year's shortfall will be 3.7% rather than the 3% agreed with the EU, because of weaker-than-expected growth. There was a silver lining in the figures for the wider zone, however. The commission said the region has bottomed out and it expects economic activity to gradually accelerate, with GDP 0.7% higher in the last quarter of 2013 than in the same period last year. The commission expects domestic demand to rebound in 2014 and take over from exports as the main driver of strengthening GDP growth. Economists said the grim forecasts could prompt the commission \u2013 which is part of the troika of lenders to crisis-hit countries \u2013 to ease its demands of austerity from eurozone governments, while the European Central Bank may be moved to adopt measures to boost the economy. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"A downward revision to the EC's economic growth forecasts for the eurozone suggest that governments will be given more time to reduce budget deficits without implementing harsher austerity measures, while at the same time putting more pressure on the European Central Bank to provide a further boost of stimulus, perhaps via a cut in its main policy rate.\" Williamson said the weaker forecasts were a blow for the UK, which depends on the eurozone for export growth. \"Given the outlook of persistent weak demand at home and a further year of contraction in the eurozone, there appear to be few drivers of UK economic recovery in 2013,\" he said. The commission predicts that the UK economy will grow by 0.9% this year, although joblessness will rise to 8%. The wider European Union of 27 member states is expected to grow by 0.1% this year, with a jobless rate of 11%.",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone may be in a deeper than expected recession, there may be uncertainty over the Italian elections and the US spending cuts and tax rises, but stock markets have shrugged off these concerns, it seems. Investors have taken advantage of Thursday's steep falls to move back into equities in search of some bargains. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 44.16 points higher at 6335.70, up 0.7% \u2022 Germany's Dax is 1.03% higher \u2022 France's Cac has closed 2.25% better \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is up 1.4% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has added 2.05% \u2022 The Athens market is up 0.7% And in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.58% higher. So with that, it's time to shut up shop for the weekend. We'll be back on Monday, with the Italian election on the agenda, in a week which also includes the deadline for the US to solve its spending cuts dilemma. Thanks for all the comments, have a good weekend and see you back here next week. German president Joachim Gauck has called for English to be made the language of the EU and appealed for the UK to remain in the EU. Kate Connolly in Berlin writes: [Gauck] earned applause for his remarks made in Berlin on Friday in a speech on Europe's future at a time of rising Germans scepticism towards the EU. \"Dear English, Scots, Welsh, Northern Irish and new British citizens, we want to continue having you on board,\" he said. \"We need your experience as the oldest parliamentary democracy, we need your traditions, your sober-mindedness and your courage.\" Kate's full story is here. A street newspaper to be sold by homeless and unemployed people will be launched in Greece next week. The paper, called Shedia (\u2018Raft\u2019) will be sold in Athens and becomes the 122nd street paper to join the Glasgow-based International Network of Street Papers (INSP). According to a press release, Shedia has recruited over 70 vendors ahead of the launch next Wednesday and will sign up more once it hits the streets. Vendors buy the magazine for \u20ac1.50 and sell it for \u20ac3, keeping the proceeds. Chris Alefantis, founder of Shedia said: Following years of preparations, the country's only street paper is about to be launched. Fighting poverty and social exclusion is at the forefront of our campaign, particularly considering the desperate economic hardship that Greece and its people are currently faced with. On the last day of the current five day strike by Iberia airline staff in Spain, there have been protests at airports in Madrid and Barcelona. According to AP, several thousand protesters gathered inside the largest terminal of Madrid's international airport, blowing whistles and air horns in a noisy demonstration against the airline's 3,800 planned job cuts. In all the unions plan 15 days of strikes. Business confidence in Belgium rose to a 10 month high in February, but was still in negative territory. The index came in at -11 compared to -13.2 in January and expectations of around -12. The improvement came as manufacturers said they were increasingly positive about the outlook. The news follows the German Ifo index, which showed its biggest monthly rise since July 2010. On the Belgian figures, Philippe Ledent at ING said: After a very disappointing result in January, Belgian business confidence rebounded in February. In the manufacturing sector, which constitutes the biggest part of the index, confidence increased by 2.8 points, after a drop by the same amplitude last month. A healthier assessment of inventories and better confidence in future demand are driving this slight recovery. Confidence also increased in the service sector, for the second month in a row. Even if the short term outlook remains quite subdued, today\u2019s business confidence confirms that the Belgian economy is probably turning the corner. To be sure, full year growth is likely to remain limited in 2013, to the tune of 0.2%. But compared to last year (-0.2%), this has to be considered as good news. One of the first indications as to how the markets view the Italian election outcome will come early next week as the country issues more bonds. Reuters reports: Italy may have to pay a big premium to sell bonds next week if the market gets rattled by an indecisive election result that puts in doubt reforms needed to spur growth and cut the country's debt. A sale of inflation-protected bonds on Monday will be the first test of investor demand as Italians go to the polls to choose a new government that will have to deal with the country's mammoth \u20ac2trn of public debt. This will be followed up by an auction of an estimated \u20ac7bn of conventional bonds on Wednesday, expected to include a new 10-year benchmark paper. The Italian Treasury [is] the sole scheduled issuer in the euro zone primary market next week. Markets are widely expecting the centre-left party of Pier Luigi Bersani to win the February 24-25 vote and rule in coalition with technocrat centrist Mario Monti, with a comeback by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi - reviled by markets - largely dismissed. This has kept Italian bond yields steady in recent weeks after an initial sell-off in early February, with benchmark 10-year debt yields within the 4.10%-4.75% range that has prevailed so far this year. Am scooting now, so Nick Fletcher will guide the blog into port. Have good weekends all (I'll be in the office on Sunday, so expect I'll be tweeting the latest Italian developments then too). GW Italy's outgoing premier, Mario Monti, has held his final pre-election rally in Florence today: Can't find a transcript yet, but Monti's official Twitter feed has been tweeting various pledges, including several aimed at younger Italians: Young people are paying for 20 years of inefficiency, so our priority is to create new jobs and Now that our public finances are no longer temporary, I promise to make the lives of our young people less precarious Reuters has just published an article warning that Italy's next prime minister faces an extremely difficult task. Here's the first section (full story here): Italy's new government, after elections this weekend, must cut bureaucracy and taxes and reform an ineffective legal system if the shrinking economy is to be jolted back to life, businesses and foreign investors say. Italians vote on Sunday and Monday for a successor to Mario Monti's technocrat government whose austerity policies saved Italy from a Greek-style debt crisis but did nothing to pull it out of deep recession. Italy's economy has contracted for six consecutive quarters, shrinking 2.2 percent last year, and companies say it is time to pull down the barriers that have hampered Italian businesses and put foreign investors off Italy for years. \"I would like a government that truly thinks about growth and that could bring Italy out of the quicksand,\" said Massimo Scaccabarozzi, CEO of pharmaceutical company Janssen-Cilag SpA, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson. \"It's no secret that we are bottom of the list when it comes to ease of business.\" It also points out Italy ranks 73rd out of 183 countries as a place to do business, according to the World Bank index. \"The new government must simplify procedures, make the system more transparent and figure out how to cut labour costs,\" said Fabio Gianisi, a Milan lawyer who advises Chinese and Russian investors with an interest in Italy. Europe's stock markets have not been hit by this morning's predictions of a deeper eurozone recession (10.09am onwards), or the latest talk of a hung Italian parliament (see 11.52am). FTSE 100: up 49 points at 6340, + 0.78% German DAX: up 85 points at 7668, + 1.13% French CAC: up 72 points at 3697, +2% Italian FTSE MIB: up 292 points at 16302, +1.8% Spanish IBEX: up 137 points at 8151, + 1.7% And in the bond market, Spanish and Italian sovereign debt has strengthened slightly. The yields on their 10-year bonds are down 4 basis points, or 0.04%, at 5.16% (Spain) and 4.43% (Italy). Pier Luigi Bersani, whose centre-left Democratic Party is most likely to win Italy's general election, is pledging to push European leaders to rethink their approach to the crisis: Sony Kapoor, head of the Re-Define thinktank, says today's warning of a deeper eurozone recession is the fault of European leaders for pursued \"economically illiterate, socially destructive, self-defeating polices\" since the financial crisis began: This self-defeating policy must change, he argues. Here's a flavour: Instead of a more relaxed fiscal and monetary policy supporting the structural reforms that were necessary, as we have been suggesting for a long time now, the EU has followed a deeply flawed policy of fiscal contraction. This is the result of the application of a \u2018small economy mentality\u2019 that prevails in the German economic debate to what is the largest economic area in the world. The current economic policy betrays a level of macroeconomic illiteracy that is shocking for an otherwise well-educated policy-making elite. Instead of on focussing on a 5-10 year strategy and a financially, politically and socially sustainable adjustment path for rebalancing, EU leaders have taken a very short-termist view of policy. At the same time that they rant against the short-termism of financial markets, their own policies have been even more myopic. What may be rational for a small country in the short-run, which is the policy lens they have used, will be self-defeating and irrational for the EU-wide economy over a longer horizon. Re-Define argues that Europe's leaders are failing their own test, of reducing fiscal deficits and stabilizing debt to GDP ratios, even if we ignore the ripping of the region's social fabric. Instead of the current policies Re-Define proposes a \"grand political bargain\", which addresses the imbalances across the eurozone and creates a fairer balances between fiscal consolidation and growth: What we need at this point is a grand political bargain, and that is one that only Mrs Merkel can offer. We will require a period of five to ten years of adjustment in the European economies which needs to happen both in deficit countries as well as surplus ones not suffering from the immediate crisis. During the course of this adjustment, financial support needs to be made available at reasonable cost to the economies to provide political and economic space for structural reforms and medium-term fiscal adjustment. Without such a grand political bargain, which gives certainty, predictability and which puts us onto an economically, financially socially and politically sustainable path we are in deep-deep trouble. But such a bargain is not likely, at least not before the German elections. Let us see what happens after, but we are not holding our breath. The full article is here. Anecdotal evidence of Grillo's impact on the race: Back to Italy, and there are reports that Beppe Grillo's radical Five Star movement is polling in second place, ahead of the Berlusconi-Northern League alliance. Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, provides this punchy analysis of the general election campaign: Pier Luigi Bersani this morning switched his attack to Beppe Grillo, and got personal. One of Grillo\u2019s vulnerabilities as a paladin of the people is the considerable wealth he has amassed \u2013 a product of his successful career as a comedian. \u201cI\u2019m the son of a mechanic, not abillionaire\u201d, said Bersani. His remark added substance to a report in Corriere della Sera this morning that Bersani\u2019s aides are now thoroughly alarmed by Grillo\u2019s progress in the final stages of the campaign. Without quite saying so (because Italian publications are banned from carrying poll results in the last two weeks before the vote), Corriere indicated clearly that surveys conducted for the Democratic party showed Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement (M5S) overtaking Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Freedom People (PdL) movement to regain the second placeit held for a while early last summer. Now, if you look here, you will see the rather more heavily disguised results of a poll carried out by a firm that has consistently favoured Berlusconi. It does not show Grillo in second place, but it does show him on 19%, which is a huge leap \u2013 of about six per cent \u2013 since the polling ban came into effect. (As this Google translation may explain, they've pretended the election is a horse race \u2013 perhaps the losers will show up in UK supermarkets). Back to Hoops: That is bad enough for Bersani's PD. But just as worryingly, there is mounting evidence from the same un-publishable polls that the alliance flung together by the outgoing prime minister, Mario Monti, is fading rapidly. That makes psephological sense. Monti and Grillo both represent alternatives to the established parties. Trend lines drawn through poll results by the Termometro Politico web site have been showing for some time that support for their two parties is inversely correlated. If Monti and his pals were to take only 10% of the vote, say, we might well get either a hung parliament or a centre-left that could only pass legislation with more help than Monti can offer. Even if the radical left-wing alliance headed by a state prosecutor, Antonio Ingroia, can muster enough votes for a seat or two, that is going to mean going cap in hand to Grillo. The European Central Bank has just spooked the markets by reporting that fewer banks than expected have taken the chance to repay ultra-cheap loans handed to them just over a year ago. The ECB reported that 356 banks will hand back a total of \u20ac61.1bn of Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) funding, sharply lower than the \u20ac130bn analysts had expected. Banks didn't have to hand back the money today \u2013 last month, though, the amount repaid early was much large than expected. That was taken as a sign that bankers were more optimistic about the situation. So what's changed?... A quick chart of the European commission's revised forecasts for 2013, from my colleague Nick Mead. Here's some early reaction to the EC's predictions of a deeper eurozone recession: And here's our early news story on the EC's forecasts: Eurozone economy to shrink again in 2013, EU says This table compares today's forecasts to the previous EC estimates (via Reuters) Bit hard to read, I'm afraid, but this table shows the EC's new forecasts (you can see a clearer version on page 13 of this pdf) Marco Buti, the EC's director general for Economic and Financial Affairs, warns in today's Winter Forecasts that Europe's unemployment crisis is deepening. Buti wrote: Employment is forecast to shrink further for some quarters, and unemployment remains unacceptably high in the EU as whole and even more so in the Member States facing the largest adjustment needs. This has grave social consequences and will, if unemployment becomes structurally entrenched, also weigh on growth perspectives going forward. The most recent data shows that the Eurozone unemployment rate is 11.7%. The EC's new Winter Forecasts for 2012 to 2014 can be downloaded as a pdf here. Breaking news: the European Commission has slashed its growth forecasts for the eurozone, and now believes the single currency region will not return to growth this year. In its Winter Forecasts, the EC predicted that eurozone GDP would shrink by 0.3% during 2013, not manage the 0.1% growth pencilled in previously. The EC warned that Europe's unemployment crisis was a desperately serious problem. It warned that Italy would shrink by 1% in 2013, not the 0.5% contraction it had expected. And for Cyprus, it now sees a 3.5% plunge in GDP, down from a 1.7% drop before. Germany is expected to grow by just 0.5% this year, not 0.8%. While France will manage a measly 0.1% growth, not 0.4%. More to follow! German business confidence has jumped this month, as Europe's biggest economy shrugged off the suffering elsewhere in the eurozone. The monthly IFO survey (which measures morale at 7,000 German firms), has risen to 107.4 for February, up from 104.3 in January. That's the biggest month-on-month rise since the summer of 2010. Economists see it as another sign Germany has returned to growth after shrinking by 0.6% in the last three months of 2012. Extra information on that GDP decline was also released this morning - it showed that falling demand for exports knocked 0.8% off GDP, while domestic demand contributed 0.2% of growth. Five-Star Movement leader Beppe Grillo held a rally in Viterbo, north of Rome, last night -- and his supporters packed the place: Grillo is the wildcard in the Italian election. He's playing the game his own way -- avoiding the usual round of TV interviews in favour of web campaigning and barn-storming rallies. Grillo's message is that the old politics is dead and must be chopped out, by a new wave of MPs untainted by sleaze and corruption. Alongside a euro referendum, he wants to give people more control over political decisions (allowing them to vote on whether a new road or hospital is built). He also argues that Europe's malaise is so great that radical measures - including rewriting all major Eu treaties \u2013 are needed. Euronews has a decent explanation of Grillo's policies here, concluding: The comedian from Genoa is the figurehead leading a team of politically-untested candidates \u2013 and Italians have heard big promises so many times. Feeling terribly let down by the mainstream, many potential voters, undecided, seemed caught in the glare. Bloomberg is unimpressed, warning in an editorial: In his way, Grillo is a visionary, but he says Five Star won\u2019t join any coalition government and he won\u2019t serve in parliament. Instead, he promises to oppose and obstruct, and says his goal is to have enough legislators in parliament to topple the next government. If Grillo can suck enough votes away from other parties on Feb. 24-25, then he could make the formation of a stable government impossible from the outset, forcing new elections. This would be a replay of the damage wrought by the upstart Syriza party in the first of Greece\u2019s repeat elections last year. Think of the lost time and the instability that resulted, and then multiply that mayhem by eight to reflect the size of Italy\u2019s economy. The markets may not like it, but it's called democracy. European stock markets are clawing back some of Thursday's big losses, suggesting they're not as nervous about Silvio Berlusconi romping to triumph this weekend. FTSE 100: up 45 points at 6337, + 0.7% German DAX: up 42 points at 7630, +0.6% French CAC: up 38 points at 3662. +1% Italian FTSE MIB: up 211 points at 16221, +1.3% Spanish IBEX: up 109 points at 8123, + 1.35% Yesterday's selloff was triggered by the latest minutes from the US Federal Reserve, which showed concern over its quantitative easing programme. Traders have now had more time to digest this, and concluded that there's no risk of the Fed tightening policy soon. As Chris Weston of IG explains: We know there are hawks within the Fed\u2019s ranks, many of them non-voters and what the minutes (as opposed to the actual FOMC statement) gives is a chance for non-voters to express their view.... while at the margin the minutes were hawkish there were still some clear dovish underlying themes that will see the Fed firmly in the market till the end of the year. A quick run-through the details of the Italian election: There are four groups fighting for votes in Italy. 1) The centre-left coalition led by the Democratic Party, and its leader Pier Luigi Bersani. 2) The alliance between People of Freedom, Silvio Berlusconi's party, and The Northern League 3) Mario Monti's centrist coalition -- comprising MPs running under the Civic Choice with Monti for Italy banner, along with Christian Democrats Future, and Freedom for Italy./ 4) The Five Star Movement -- comedian Beppe Grillo's group. He is winning popular support on a platform demanding fundamental changes on public water, transportation, development, internet availability, and the environment. The far-left FARE party is also fielding candidates. The political set-up The parties are fighting for seats in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of parliament), and in the Senate (or upper house). There are 630 MPs in the Chamber of Deputies, where Bersani is expected to win the most votes. The convoluted Italian political system ensures he'll then get a majority of seats. The Senate consists of 315 elected member. Here, the winning party in each region is guaranteed 55% of available seats, with the other parties sharing the remaining 45% of the seats based on voting share. Given the Senate's political power, the key question is whether Bersani wins an outright majority (158 seats), or can hit that total through an alliance with Mario Monti. This depends on the results of the four swing states - Lombardy, Campania, Sicily and Veneto. Political commentator Alberto Nardelli reckons a centre-left majority can't be ruled out, given \"recent polling and trends in Lombardy and Sicily\". Nardelli also predicts that Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement will come third with more than 15%, with Monti\u2019s centrist coalition lagging behind. Good morning, and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of the latest developments in the eurozone, and the global economy. Election fever is mounting as the Italian general election campaign enters its final couple of days. Voters head to the polls on Sunday, for a poll that has major implications for the whole eurozone. If a clear winner emerges (most likely the centre-left group led by Pier Luigi Bersani), then Italy is likely to continue on the path of financial reforms and austerity set by Mario Monti \u2013 who could even join Bersani in a coalition. But there's a strong chance that the election will result in a divided parliament, leaving Italy's next leader struggling to govern effectively. With a ban on new opinion polls, speculation over the result is rife. Investors dread the prospect of a resurgent Silvio Berlusconi holding the balance of power, while analysts aren't convinced that even a Bersani-Monti coalition could hold power for long. As Eoin Ryan of IHS Global Insight puts it: A surge in support for anti-austerity parties is raising chances of an indecisive election result and post-vote political instability. Berlusconi's breezy promise to eliminate Italy's much-loathed new property tax has lured some floating voters back to his People of Freedom party. There is also significant support for Beppe Grillo, the (professional) comedian whose radical manifesto includes a referendum on Italy's eurozone membership. In the complex world of Italian electoral mathematics, a strong performance by Grillo's Five-Star Movement could scupper Bersani's hopes of winning enough seats to govern.

Confidence also increased in the service sector, for the second month in a row.</p> <p>Even if the short term outlook remains quite subdued, today\u2019s business confidence confirms that the Belgian economy is probably turning the corner.

Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Instead of a more relaxed fiscal and monetary policy supporting the structural reforms that were necessary, as we have been suggesting for a long time now, the EU has followed a deeply flawed policy of fiscal contraction. This is the result of the application of a \u2018small economy mentality\u2019 that prevails in the German economic debate to what is the largest economic area in the world. The current economic policy betrays a level of macroeconomic illiteracy that is shocking for an otherwise well-educated policy-making elite.</p> <p>Instead of on focussing on a 5-10 year strategy and a financially, politically and socially sustainable adjustment path for rebalancing, EU leaders have taken a very short-termist view of policy.

What may be rational for a small country in the short-run, which is the policy lens they have used, will be self-defeating and irrational for the EU-wide economy over a longer horizon.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Re-Define</strong> argues that Europe's leaders are failing their own test, of reducing fiscal deficits and stabilizing debt to GDP ratios, even if we ignore the ripping of the region's social fabric.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ca58f135-5f3a-4591-9a69-70be39406478\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/22/1361536448955/9c8a3d71-6a2b-44bf-91d1-b9ddc752802f-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"On 21 February, approximately 40'000 protesters marched through the streets of Brussels, Belgium to give the government a firm anti-austerity signal.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yesterday, around 40,000 protesters marched through the streets of Brussels, Belgium in an anti-austerity demonstration.

We will require a period of five to ten years of adjustment in the European economies which needs to happen both in deficit countries as well as surplus ones not suffering from the immediate crisis. During the course of this adjustment, financial support needs to be made available at reasonable cost to the economies to provide political and economic space for structural reforms and medium-term fiscal adjustment.</p> <p>Without such a grand political bargain, which gives certainty, predictability and which puts us onto an economically, financially socially and politically sustainable path we are in deep-deep trouble. But such a bargain is not likely, at least not before the German elections.

One of Grillo\u2019s vulnerabilities as a paladin of the people is the considerable wealth he has amassed \u2013 a product of his successful career as a comedian.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the son of a mechanic, not abillionaire\u201d, said Bersani.</p> <p>His remark added substance to <a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/politica/speciali/2013/elezioni/notizie/22-febbraio-grillo-sondaggi-meli_ec11787c-7cb6-11e2-a4ef-4daf51aa103c.shtml\">a report in Corriere della Sera this </a><a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/politica/speciali/2013/elezioni/notizie/22-febbraio-grillo-sondaggi-meli_ec11787c-7cb6-11e2-a4ef-4daf51aa103c.shtml\">morning</a> that Bersani\u2019s aides are now thoroughly alarmed by Grillo\u2019s progress in the final stages of the campaign.</p> <p>Without quite saying so (because Italian publications are banned from carrying poll results in the last two weeks before the vote), Corriere indicated clearly that surveys conducted for the Democratic party showed Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement (M5S) overtaking Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Freedom People (PdL) movement to regain the second placeit held for a while early last summer.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.notapolitica.it/2013/2/21/mancia_bressan_corsa_clandestina_ippodromo_meneghino.aspx\">if you look here</a>, you will see the rather more heavily disguised results of a poll carried out by a firm that has consistently favoured Berlusconi. It does not show Grillo in second place, but it does show him on 19%, which is a huge leap \u2013 of about six per cent \u2013 since the polling ban came into effect.</p> </blockquote> <p>(<a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.notapolitica.it%2F2013%2F2%2F21%2Fmancia_bressan_corsa_clandestina_ippodromo_meneghino.aspx\">As this Google translation may explain</a>, they've pretended the election is a horse race<em> \u2013 perhaps the losers will show up in UK supermarkets</em>).</p> <p>Back to <strong>Hoops</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is bad enough for&#xa0;Bersani's PD. But just as worryingly, there is mounting evidence from the same un-publishable polls that the alliance flung together by the outgoing prime minister, Mario Monti, is fading rapidly. That makes psephological sense.</p> <p>Monti and Grillo both represent alternatives to the established<br> parties. <a href=\"http://www.termometropolitico.it/sondaggi\">Trend lines drawn through poll results by the Termometro </a><a href=\"http://www.termometropolitico.it/sondaggi\">Politico web site</a> have been showing for some time that support for their two parties is inversely correlated.</p> <p>If Monti and his pals were to take only 10% of the vote, say, we might well get either a hung parliament or a centre-left that could only pass legislation with more help than Monti can offer. Even if the radical left-wing alliance headed by a state prosecutor, Antonio Ingroia, can muster enough votes for a seat or two, that is going to mean going cap in hand to Grillo.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-22T12:04:16.880Z\">at 12.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5127560ab5793aa1f789c2fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-22T11:27:06.261Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">LTRO repayments are lower than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> has just spooked the markets by reporting that fewer banks than expected have taken the chance to repay ultra-cheap loans handed to them just over a year ago.</p> <p>The ECB reported that 356 banks will hand back a total of \u20ac61.1bn of Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) funding, sharply lower than the \u20ac130bn analysts had expected.</p> <p>Banks didn't <strong>have</strong> to hand back the money today \u2013 last month, though, the amount repaid early was much large than expected. <a href=\"http://www.ifre.com/bankers-cheer-ltro-repayments/21065569.article\">That was taken as a sign that bankers were more optimistic about the situation</a>.

Instead, he promises to oppose and obstruct, and says his goal is to have enough legislators in parliament to topple the next government. If Grillo can suck enough votes away from other parties on Feb. 24-25, then he could make the formation of a stable government impossible from the outset, forcing new elections.</p> <p>This would be a replay of the damage wrought by the upstart Syriza party in the first of Greece\u2019s repeat elections last year.

He is winning popular support on a platform demanding fundamental changes on public water, transportation, development, internet availability, and the environment.</p> <p>The far-left FARE party is also fielding candidates.</p> <h2>The political set-up</h2> <p>The parties are fighting for seats in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of parliament), and in the Senate (or upper house).</p> <p>There are 630 MPs in the Chamber of Deputies, where <strong>Bersani</strong> is expected to win the most votes. The convoluted Italian political system ensures he'll then get a majority of seats.</p> <p>The Senate consists of 315 elected member. Here, the winning party in each region is guaranteed 55% of available seats, with the other parties sharing the remaining 45% of the seats based on voting share.</p> <p>Given the Senate's political power, the key question is whether Bersani wins an outright majority (158 seats), or can hit that total through an alliance with Mario Monti. This depends on the results of the four swing states - <strong>Lombardy</strong>, <strong>Campania</strong>, <strong>Sicily</strong> and <strong>Veneto</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://albertonardelli.tumblr.com/post/43637816828/my-final-italy-pre-election-thoughts\">Political commentator <strong>Alberto Nardelli</strong> reckons</a> a centre-left majority can't be ruled out, given \"recent polling and trends in Lombardy and Sicily\".</p> <p>Nardelli also predicts that Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement will come third with more than 15%, with Monti\u2019s centrist coalition lagging behind.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5127267d95cbaacb1b0516d9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-22T08:14:28.831Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italian election looms</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e80a378a-6daa-4ae5-aa98-85265f6e6980\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/22/1361520666492/5c3cb68b-3a56-4c9b-9e87-ce03a695f6d8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A man walks past election campaign posters in Rome, February 21, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plastering of election campaign posters in Rome.

Voters head to the polls on Sunday, for a poll that has major implications for the whole eurozone.</p> <p>If a clear winner emerges (most likely the centre-left group led by <strong>Pier Luigi Bersani</strong>), then Italy is likely to continue on the path of financial reforms and austerity set by <strong>Mario Monti</strong> \u2013 who could even join Bersani in a coalition.</p> <p>But there's a strong chance that the election will result in a divided parliament, leaving Italy's next leader struggling to govern effectively.</p> <p>With a ban on new opinion polls, speculation over the result is rife. Investors dread the prospect of a resurgent <strong>Silvio Berlusconi</strong> holding the balance of power, while analysts aren't convinced that even a Bersani-Monti coalition could hold power for long.</p> <p>As <strong>Eoin Ryan </strong>of IHS Global Insight puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A surge in support for anti-austerity parties is raising chances of an indecisive election result and post-vote political instability.</p> </blockquote> <p>Berlusconi's breezy promise to eliminate Italy's much-loathed new property tax has lured some floating voters back to his People of Freedom party. </p> <p>There is also significant support for <strong>Beppe Grillo</strong>, the (professional) comedian whose radical manifesto includes a referendum on Italy's eurozone membership. In the complex world of Italian electoral mathematics, a strong performance by Grillo's Five-Star Movement could scupper Bersani's hopes of winning enough seats to govern.</p> <p><strong>One thing is clear - it's going to be fascinating to watch....</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

John Fingleton, who recently tried to set up a bank account for his own small business, says banks need a radical shakeup if they are to stimulate, rather than depress, economic activity. In an article for the Financial Times, he wrote: \"We hear that many banks are casinos; they are not lending enough to small businesses, suppressing growth.

After failed attempts to open accounts at HSBC, Barclays and Santander, Fingleton said he was forced to try smaller new entrants, including US group Metro Bank, which opens seven days a week, and Swedish offshoot Handelsbanken, which leaves the decision-making to branch managers. These challengers are grabbing a growing share of new business in the UK, helped along by the scandals enveloping most major banks. Bombarded with headlines about bumper bonuses, the mis-selling of payment protection insurance, Libor rigging, and money laundering for drugs barons, customers are increasingly inclined to look beyond the traditional players. Fingleton says banks \"seem to have lost the ability to understand customers' needs\" and their \"crude systems\" impose superfluous private-sector red tape. He added: \"Standardising and centralising decision-making has been counterproductive for banks and the wider economy. If my effort to open a simple business account reflects a collective inability to distinguish high-growth businesses from bad credit risks in their lending decisions, it is hardly surprising UK productivity figures are so dismal. \"Our banks need a radical transformation if they are to stimulate, rather than depress, economic activity.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bosses of Britain's largest companies are too close to the \"Big Four\" accountancy firms which carry out the overwhelming majority of audits, a report is expected to say on Friday. The Competition Commission's review into how KPMG, PwC, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte audit 90% of UK-listed blue chip businesses is expected to say that while it found no evidence of collusion between them, there is a restricted amount of competition. It is expected to attack the cosy relationship between auditors and senior management at City firms, who are often alumni of the Big Four themselves. High-ranking members of Big Four firms also sit on many company boards. It will reportedly not seek the break up of these firms \u2013 which also provide a wide range of non-audit services to their clients \u2013 but suggest measures to reduce their stranglehold over the UK's largest firms, including a ban on \"Big Four-only\" clauses in loan documents from banks and giving shareholders a greater say in the choice of auditors. Firms could also be ordered to rotate between auditors and invite other firms to tender for work on their accounts. The investigation, ordered in 2011, was partly prompted by a House of Lords inquiry which found that listed companies, which must have their annual reports signed off by an auditor, use the same accountant for an average of 48 years, a figure the Big Four dispute. The fear is that auditors become less sceptical over time about what clients tell them. There was also anger that accountants gave banks a clean bill of health just before taxpayers had to rescue them during the financial crisis. The inquiry has looked at issues such as the gap between the big four and mid-tier firms, barriers to entry and expansion for smaller firms, and cites the case of Arthur Andersen, which collapsed after it was implicated in the Enron scandal, as showing that size does not guarantee stability. The Big Four's audit and advisory income easily outstrips their rivals. In the financial year ended 2011, the audit income for the four largest firms ranged from \u00a3403m to \u00a3893m, compared with \u00a3133m for the largest mid-tier company. The Big Four have insisted competition is strong, pointing to downward pressure on fees. \"When reaching its provisional findings, the Competition Commission should recognise that the large company audit market currently produces competitive outcomes for large companies and investors,\" PwC said. The European Union's has drafted a law which proposes mandatory switching or rotation of auditors every six years and even a market share cap. The US audit watchdog has also aired plans for auditor rotation.",

      "body": "<p>The bosses of Britain's largest companies are too close to the \"Big Four\" accountancy firms which carry out the overwhelming majority of audits, a report is expected to say on Friday.</p> <p>The Competition Commission's review into how KPMG, PwC, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte audit 90% of UK-listed blue chip businesses is expected to say that while it found no evidence of collusion between them, there is a restricted amount of competition.</p> <p>It is expected to attack the cosy relationship between auditors and senior management at City firms, who are often alumni of the Big Four themselves.</p> <p>High-ranking members of Big Four firms also sit on many company boards.</p> <p>It will reportedly not seek the break up of these firms \u2013 which also provide a wide range of non-audit services to their clients \u2013 but suggest measures to reduce their stranglehold over the UK's largest firms, including a ban on \"Big Four-only\" clauses in loan documents from banks and giving shareholders a greater say in the choice of auditors.</p> <p>Firms could also be ordered to rotate between auditors and invite other firms to tender for work on their accounts.</p> <p>The investigation, ordered in 2011, was partly prompted by a House of Lords inquiry which found that listed companies, which must have their annual reports signed off by an auditor, use the same accountant for an average of 48 years, a figure the Big Four dispute.</p> <p>The fear is that auditors become less sceptical over time about what clients tell them.</p> <p>There was also anger that accountants gave banks a clean bill of health just before taxpayers had to rescue them during the financial crisis.</p> <p>The inquiry has looked at issues such as the gap between the big four and mid-tier firms, barriers to entry and expansion for smaller firms, and cites the case of Arthur Andersen, which collapsed after it was implicated in the Enron scandal, as showing that size does not guarantee stability.</p> <p>The Big Four's audit and advisory income easily outstrips their rivals. In the financial year ended 2011, the audit income for the four largest firms ranged from \u00a3403m to \u00a3893m, compared with \u00a3133m for the largest mid-tier company. The Big Four have insisted competition is strong, pointing to downward pressure on fees.</p> <p>\"When reaching its provisional findings, the Competition Commission should recognise that the large company audit market currently produces competitive outcomes for large companies and investors,\" PwC said.</p> <p>The European Union's has drafted a law which proposes mandatory switching or rotation of auditors every six years and even a market share cap. The US audit watchdog has also aired plans for auditor rotation.</p>",
