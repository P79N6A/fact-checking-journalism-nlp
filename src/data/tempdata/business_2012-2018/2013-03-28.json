      "bodyText": "The gas and oil wealth of Qatar has been used to snap up another UK asset after the emirate bought the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel in a \u00a3400m deal. Constellation Hotels, part of the Qatar Holding investment vehicle that has invested in Sainsbury's and Barclays, has paid \u00a3301.5m for InterContinental Hotel Group's 57-year lease on the 447-bedroom property close to Hyde Park, the company announced on Thursday. In a separate \u00a3100m deal it also acquired the freehold from the Crown Estate, the property company that controls the assets of the Queen. The Qataris beat six other bidders to the deal, thought to include other sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia. The level of competition meant the \u00a3301.5m price tag gave IHG a 62% premium to the hotel's book value. One IHG source said: \"We are pretty pleased.\" The move comes after it emerged last year that the Qataris had backed indebted Irish property investor Patrick McKillen, who was seeking \u00a370m to buy a controlling stake in Maybourne Hotel Group \u2013 which includes Claridges \u2013 from billionaire brothers David and Frederick Barclay. The increasingly bitter saga between McKillen and the twins ended up with the two sides fighting for control of the hotels in London's high court. The latest announcement comes after a run of deals that are thought to have resulted in Qatar investing \u00a33bn in European real estate in the 12 months to mid-August 2012, the equivalent to six weeks' revenue from the country's liquefied natural gas exports, according to Reuters. It is also Qatar's latest asset in London, after investments in the Shard skyscraper, Harrods department store and the athlete's village in the Olympic Park. However, despite these high profile moves, the Qatari companies remain opaque. A spokesman for Qatar Holding declined to comment on the deal, as he had been given no details by the sovereign wealth fund. Those who have worked with Qatar Holding say it is the personal investment vehicle of the emir \u2013 Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani \u2013 and it prefers to buy overseas assets in order to diversify its vast natural resource wealth into investments that guarantee future prosperity. The chairman of Qatar Holding is Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabor al-Thani, Qatar's prime minister, cousin of the emir and known to City bankers as HBJ. He first made headlines in the UK a decade ago following a \u00a3500m arms deal between Qatar and BAE Systems after which \u00a37m was transferred into two Jersey trusts of which he was a beneficiary. The funds were frozen by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, which then began a court case and investigation. HBJ paid the Jersey authorities \u00a36m as a \"voluntary reparation\" as \"the structures put in place by his advisers may have contributed to the cost and complexity of the inquiry\" and the case was dropped while all parties denied any wrongdoing. There have been other brief controversies too, and most recently Barclays has been dealing with allegations about its relationship with Qatar at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, when the emirate was the main contributor to a \u00a37.3bn lifeline that allowed the bank to avoid a taxpayer bailout. The Serious Fraud Office and Financial Services Authority are reportedly investigating whether Barclays lent Qatar funds to buy shares in the bank.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy is getting stronger and should avoid a triple-dip recession, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Paris-based thinktank sounded a positive note as official figures showed that the services sector, which contracted at the end of last year, returned to growth in January. Barring changes in government policy, the UK is expected to have grown at an annual rate of 0.5% in the first quarter and to grow at 1.4% in the second. Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD's chief economist, said: \"The situation [in the UK] is still fragile. I think the policy course, both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, is going in the right direction and improvements are beginning to be seen.\" Until recently, the OECD and the International Monetary Fund had been warning George Osborne that his austerity policies risked prolonging the longest economic depression in 100 years. Padoan had called on the chancellor to relax spending cuts and put forward growth policies, in a shift to a Plan B for the economy. But the more upbeat outlook from the OECD was reinforced by a survey of the UK's services industry that showed an improvement during January, offsetting a weakening picture in the construction and manufacturing sectors. The Office for National Statistics said the services sector, accounting for three-quarters of economic activity, expanded by 0.3% on the previous month and was 0.8% ahead of the same month a year earlier. Unfortunately for ministers hoping to see an improvement across the private sector, the strongest element of the services index in recent years has proved to be government spending. The financial services sector has almost recovered to its pre-recession peak, along with business services, leaving the distribution, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage and communication sectors well below their high-water mark. Chris Williamson, chief economist of financial data provider Markit, said the services data combined with strong retail sales would persuade the Bank of England to stay its hand when it meets next week. Capital Economics said an increase in quantitative easing from the current \u00a3375bn the Bank of England had pumped into the economy would probably need to wait until at least the autumn, when incoming governor Mark Carney would have established a new remit focused on growth. The OECD said activity was picking up in many major economies, with the global outlook improving since its last update in November. It expected the US to rebound in the first three months of this year, while Japan had been boosted by a new growth strategy and stimulus package. But it said improvements in financial markets around the globe had not been fully reflected in real economic activity, in part because confidence remained low. Padoan warned that the flood of cheap money into the system, via generous stimulus packages, had also led to some \"excessive risk-taking\". \"We have now learned that imbalances build up in a way we tend to ignore,\" he said. \"Let's watch prices of assets going up which are not warranted by fundamentals. Let's be very careful. At the same time, let's be careful of not putting a brake on the recovery that is slowly materialising. It's a delicate balancing act.\" The OECD said a meaningful recovery in Europe would take longer than in the rest of the G7. It blamed this on a deteriorating jobs market, which had depressed consumer confidence. \"Especially in Europe, the rise of long-term unemployment, with more of the unemployed moving off unemployment insurance on to less generous social benefits, is worsening poverty and inequality,\" it said. The thinktank also highlighted the growing divergence between Germany, which it expects to pick up strongly in the first half of this year, and other economies, which are forecast to either contract or show minimal growth. Germany is expected to grow by 2.3% on an annual basis in the first quarter, and then 2.6% in the second. By contrast, France is forecast to shrink by 0.6% on an annual basis in the first quarter, followed by 0.5% annualised growth in the second quarter. Growth in emerging markets is still much faster than in the G7 and these countries will drive the global economy this year. The OECD said annualised growth in China was expected to continue to be well above 8% in the first half of 2013. US economy perking up The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, but not enough to suggest the labour market recovery was taking a step back. Other data showed the economy expanded at an annual rate of 0.4% in the fourth quarter, more than the government had estimated. The reports reinforced the view that the US economy perked up in the first quarter, although it still appeared vulnerable to fiscal austerity measures that kicked in early in the year. \"The underlying growth trend is showing some encouraging signs, but the key risk is how much fiscal tightening we'll see this year,\" said Laura Rosner, economist at BNP Paribas in New York. While jobless claims increased more than expected last week, they have trended lower this year and remain near five-year lows. Last week, initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000, the labor department said. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labour market trends, rose 2,250 to 343,000. Still, for many economists a trend reading below the 350,000 level points to a firm pace of hiring in March. Reuters, Washington",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "City watchdog the Financial Services Authority has been accused of \"falling short\" in its efforts to call to account the Bank of Ireland for raising interest rates paid by thousands of mortgage holders. The embattled Irish bank told 13,500 customers in March that tracker mortgages, which take the Bank of England base interest rate and add a percentage, would rise steeply in May \u2013 despite base rates being unchanged. Payments will double and in some cases triple for borrowers. Almost half of those hit hold standard residential home loans, while the rest are buy-to-let landlords, some of whom may have a dozen or more mortgages. Parliament's Treasury select committee is unhappy with the FSA's response to the debacle, and wants more checks to ensure other banks will not use the same loopholes to extract higher payments from their customers. On Thursday the committee published an exchange of letters between its chairman, Andrew Tyrie MP, and the FSA managing director Martin Wheatley, in which questions are raised about whether the FSA was distracted from dealing with the issue because it was preparing for its own reorganisation. The watchdog will be split into two separate bodies next week. Tyrie said: \"We need more information to be confident that the regulator has thought carefully about this issue. It must exercise judgment to ensure customers are being treated fairly. Mr Wheatley's letter appears to fall short on both counts.\" He has asked the FSA to ensure that Bank of Ireland customers hit by the surprise rate rise were warned this could happen when they took out their mortgages, and demanded to know whether other lenders would be allowed to include similar terms in future. A spokesman for the watchdog said it would respond in due course. Bank of England base rates are at a historic low of 0.5% and unlikely to rise for a few years. For residential borrowers, the Bank of Ireland will increase the amount it adds to the base rate to 2.49% in May, and again to 3.99% in October. Buy-to-let borrowers will take a single hit, seeing their rate rising from 2.25% to 4.99% in May. In a 2008 speech, the FSA vowed to police tracker mortgage rates, saying tracker interest rate \"floors\" needed to be \"clear and unambiguous to the consumer\" and \"consistently and prominently spelt out\" in the lender's documentation. \"If it is not, you run the real risk of both breaching our disclosure requirements and having an unfair contract term you can't enforce,\" said the regulator.

    "webTitle": "Triple-dip recession forecast? The outlook is mixed", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Freezing weather has hit sectors, but whether growth is negative or 0.2%, the underlying picture is of an economy struggling", 
      "body": "<p>Will it or won't it? Is the UK about to experience its first ever triple dip or will the next set of growth figures be the point at which the economy finally turns the corner? One thing is for sure. Every piece of data published in the few remaining weeks before the release of the flash estimate of GDP at the end of April will be pored over for triple-dip clues.</p> <p>Two things are worth mentioning from the outset. The first is that the political impact of a weak number will be greater than its economic significance. It doesn't matter that much whether growth was plus or minus 0.2% in the first three months of 2013; the underlying picture is of an economy struggling to get out of first gear.</p> <p>The second is that the initial estimates of GDP from the Office for National Statistics are tentative, based as they are on incomplete evidence which can be substantially revised later.</p> <p>It is worth noting, in this respect, that Britain's double-dip recession in late 2011 and early 2012 now looks extremely shallow, with output declining by 0.1% in two of the three quarters of negative growth. It is possible the double dip will eventually be revised away completely.</p> <p>Still, none of that will count for much if the ONS reports on 24 April that the economy did suffer a second consecutive quarter of falling GDP between January and March this year.</p> <p>So what is the outlook? The data so far is both scanty and mixed. Output of both the industrial production and construction sectors was down in January.

      "bodyText": "Will it or won't it? Is the UK about to experience its first ever triple dip or will the next set of growth figures be the point at which the economy finally turns the corner? One thing is for sure. Every piece of data published in the few remaining weeks before the release of the flash estimate of GDP at the end of April will be pored over for triple-dip clues. Two things are worth mentioning from the outset. The first is that the political impact of a weak number will be greater than its economic significance. It doesn't matter that much whether growth was plus or minus 0.2% in the first three months of 2013; the underlying picture is of an economy struggling to get out of first gear. The second is that the initial estimates of GDP from the Office for National Statistics are tentative, based as they are on incomplete evidence which can be substantially revised later. It is worth noting, in this respect, that Britain's double-dip recession in late 2011 and early 2012 now looks extremely shallow, with output declining by 0.1% in two of the three quarters of negative growth. It is possible the double dip will eventually be revised away completely. Still, none of that will count for much if the ONS reports on 24 April that the economy did suffer a second consecutive quarter of falling GDP between January and March this year. So what is the outlook? The data so far is both scanty and mixed. Output of both the industrial production and construction sectors was down in January. But there was better news for George Osborne from Thursday's report from the service sector, with 0.3% growth between December 2012 and January 2013. That's a relatively modest increase, but given that services account for 77% of GDP, the pickup helps to offset the bigger falls in industry and on building sites. What's more, the performance of the service sector would almost certainly have been stronger had it not been for the poor weather in the second half of January. Evidence from the high street suggests that there was a bounce back in spending in February once the thaw set in, and the Office for Budget Responsibility believes the economy will expand by 0.1% in the first quarter. Crucially, though, that forecast was made before it became clear that the UK would have its coldest March for 50 years, and before Cyprus provided the latest twist to the eurozone saga. Despite some signs that the economy is strengthening slightly, a triple dip remains a very real possibility.",

Since the start of the month the index has gained 1% but since the turn of the year, the rise is an impressive 8.7%.</p> <p>In the US the S&amp;P 500 finally regained its 2007 highs on Thursday, helped by hopes the US Federal Reserve will continue its bond buying programme to boost the US economy.</p> <p>Despite worries about Italy's continuing inability to form a government, the relatively calm reopening of banks in Cyprus after being closed for twelve days helped keep investors in a positive mood ahead of the Easter break.</p> <p>Some bright economic news also helped matters, with better than expected UK consumer confidence figures, an upward revision to US fourth quarter GDP from 0.1% to 0.4%, as well as reasonable retail sales data from Germany. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG said:</p> <blockquote> This may be a Fed-inspired rally, but it is a rally nonetheless; over the course of the last three months markets have taken almost everything in their stride, be it US budget crises, inconclusive Italian elections or a bailout of yet another eurozone member. Having had such a good start to the year, the question is now whether the run can be sustained. Cynics will point to the abundance of problems, but the underlying theme today remains the same as at the end of 2012; a supportive Federal Reserve is not to be trifled with. </blockquote> <p>A number of companies decided to get their updates out of the way before the break, and one of those to benefit was <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong>. Shares in the speciality ingredients business rose 25p to 850p, making it the best performer in the FTSE 250. The company said it had been performing well since its half year statement and expected \"modest progress\" for the full year. Operating profits in the speciality food ingredients business would be in line with last year, it said, despite sucralose volumes expected to be slightly lower. Sweeteners peformed well in the US and Europe, offsetting the costs of 2012's severe drought in the US and a tough market for ethanol. Investec analyst Martin Deboo said the fourth quarter update was \"reasurringly dull.\" He said:</p> <blockquote> We read [the update] as consistent with both 2013 consensus and third quarter commentary. Eyes are therefore turning to 2014, where the key issues for us remain those of competition in sweeteners and US high-fructose corn syrup dynamics. 2014 trading guidance will need to wait for the prelims, but early signals are for better foreign exchange on profits offset by higher tax and financing. For us, this amounts to a 3% or so net upgrade relative to our post-third quarter forecast. We remain holders at our recently upgraded 860p price target. </blockquote> <p><strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> climbed 50p to \u00a323 after the platinum refiner paid \u00a3107m for Swedish specialist chemical company Formox.</p> <p><strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong> sold its London Park Lane hotel for \u00a3301.5m in cash to Qatari-backed investment group Constellation, and saw its shares jump 55p to \u00a320.07. It has agreed a 30 year management contract on Park Lane, with three possible ten year extensions.</p> <p><strong>National Grid</strong> added 14p to 765p as it said earnings would be modestly ahead of previous expectations. The company also unveiled a new dividend policy, with the aim of growing payouts to shareholders at least in line with retail price index inflation. Killik &amp; Co said:</p> <blockquote> The announcement will clearly allay the concerns of some market commentators that the group would cut its dividend, while also removing any lingering fears over the prospect of a rights issue. At a time when the rate of return on cash is at historical lows, and the expectation for inflation has increased, we believe a 5.7% prospective dividend yield growing in real terms is very attractive. <br> In addition, the increase in M&amp;A across the market, in particular for assets with predictable cash generation, underpins the attraction of the business. We therefore reiterate our positive recommendation. </blockquote> <p>But mining shares were among the losers, with <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> down 11.6p at 246.1p and <strong>Antofagasta</strong> 41p lower at 984p. The market had its first chance to react to Wednesday's late news that Antofagasta had decided to resume construction of its costly Antucoya mine, after halting the project in December to review its costs. Numis analysts said:</p> <blockquote> We estimate Antofagasta is pricing in a long term copper price in the order of $2.90-$3.00 a pound to make this work (Numis long term price is $2.50 a pound). With no growth over the next few years, it looks like the options were limited for the copper miner. <br> </blockquote> <p>Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote> Without a material capex or opex reduction, we had assumed the project would be abandoned. In its place we had assumed management would pay a similar special dividend in 2013 as that proposed for 2012, namely a special of 70 cents. Given that the bulk of the remaining spend is likely to come in 2014, we have cut the total payout back to the more usual 35% payout ratio or 36 cents. </blockquote> <p>A bid for a European coffee maker had a negative knock-on effect on consumer group <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong>.</p> <p>The maker of Cillit Bang and Dettol fell 57p to \u00a347.18 on concerns that German investment group Joh A. Benckiser - led by former Reckitt boss Bart Becht - could sell part of its 10.7% to help fund a bid for coffee group D.E. Master Blenders.</p> <p>JAB said it was in takeover talks about an offer which would value the Douwe Egberts company at more than \u20ac7.5bn. Exane BNP Paribas analyst Eamonn Ferry told Reuters:</p> <blockquote> The market is anticipating that JAB could sell some more of its stake in Reckitt. However if they go below 10%, they may lose board representation and that is a consideration. </blockquote> <p>In May, JAB sold \u00a31.2bn worth of shares, cutting its stake from around 15%.</p> <p>Reckitt was also hit by a downbeat note from Barclays, which cut its 2013 earnings forecasts for heroin substitute Suboxone. The bank kept its underweight rating with a \u00a337 price target.</p> <p>Building shares have performed strongly since last week's Budget introduced measures to benefit the housing market. In the wake of that, JP Morgan issued a positive note on the sector, helping push <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> 2.65p higher to 90.9p, <strong>Bellway</strong> 57p better to \u00a312.97, <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> up 6.5p to 274.1p, and <strong>Bovis Homes </strong>ahead 10.5p to 741.5p. JP Morgan analyst Emily Biddulph said:</p> <blockquote> Last week's UK Budget announcements on housing completely surpassed our expectations. While we saw scope for an extension of new-build incentive schemes, we did not expect stimulus to be extended to the wider housing market. We now expect both material market growth from 2014 and believe that material house price inflation is a realistic prospect over the medium term, driving revenue growth, gross margin expansion and improved capital turn for the house builders. Our increased medium term earnings expectations drive an average increase of 19% to our price targets. We upgrade Taylor Wimpey and Bellway to overweight from neutral, and Barratt and Bovis to neutral [from underweight]. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>RPC</strong>, the plastic packaging group which makes jars for Heinz and Nescafe, dropped nearly 12%, down 53.5p to 397.5p after it warned full year operating profits were likely to be lower due to higher polymer prices and the strength of the pound against the euro, which would knock profits by \u00a34m. Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> A tough finish to the year for RPC, with pressure on a number of fronts that results in us downgrading our forecasts for both the years to March 2013 and 2014. While activity levels in higher-margin products improved over the third quarter, trading conditions remain challenging elsewhere and growth rates for the year ahead now look weaker than previously anticipated. <br>Coupling this with on-going higher resin prices makes a fairly downbeat short-term picture, though RPC remains best placed within its markets to increase market share and prosper accordingly. We reduce forecasts and target price to 466p on this update (491p), and switch our recommendation to hold [from buy]. </blockquote> <p><strong>Laura Ashley </strong>was steady at 29p as the fashion retailer reported a 6.9% rise in full year profits to \u00a320.1m, boosted by e-commerce and franchising and licensing. Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald said:</p> <blockquote> We believe the stock remains undervalued at 13.5 times our forecast 2014 earnings, valuing it at a discount to the sector and peers. This is unjustified, in our view, considering the company's track record, potential for internet and overseas development, with both channels reporting significant growth in 2013. The company also has the support of a dividend yielding almost 7%, which we believe is sustainable given the company's model, strong cash flow and strength of balance sheet. The company is forecast to have a cash balance of around \u00a330m by end of 2014. We reiterate our buy recommendation but increase our target price to 35p (from 32p) to reflect the strong performance in the general retail sector over the last year. <br> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Thorntons</strong> added 0.25p to 66p on hopes the chocolate retailer was enjoying a good Easter, despite the poor weather.</p> <p>Lower down the market, life assurance group <strong>Chesnara</strong> closed 1p higher at 235p, following a 9% rise in full year profits to \u00a324.5m and a 3% increase in the total dividend. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said:</p> <blockquote> Chesnara has delivered a good set of 2012 results driven by strong operational performance in the UK, progress being made in Scandinavia and a positive impact from improving investment markets. The shares are trading at a 14% discount to 2012 enterprise value of 271p per share despite the 2012 dividend yield of 7.7%. We have consequently increased our target price to 264p per share (249p). </blockquote>",

Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald said: We believe the stock remains undervalued at 13.5 times our forecast 2014 earnings, valuing it at a discount to the sector and peers. This is unjustified, in our view, considering the company's track record, potential for internet and overseas development, with both channels reporting significant growth in 2013. The company also has the support of a dividend yielding almost 7%, which we believe is sustainable given the company's model, strong cash flow and strength of balance sheet. The company is forecast to have a cash balance of around \u00a330m by end of 2014. We reiterate our buy recommendation but increase our target price to 35p (from 32p) to reflect the strong performance in the general retail sector over the last year. But Thorntons added 0.25p to 66p on hopes the chocolate retailer was enjoying a good Easter, despite the poor weather. Lower down the market, life assurance group Chesnara closed 1p higher at 235p, following a 9% rise in full year profits to \u00a324.5m and a 3% increase in the total dividend. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said: Chesnara has delivered a good set of 2012 results driven by strong operational performance in the UK, progress being made in Scandinavia and a positive impact from improving investment markets. The shares are trading at a 14% discount to 2012 enterprise value of 271p per share despite the 2012 dividend yield of 7.7%. We have consequently increased our target price to 264p per share (249p).",

      "bodyText": "Time for a closing summary. \u2022 Cyprus's banks have reopened for the first time in 12 days. Fears of a bank run proved unfounded, thanks to capital controls which limit people to withdrawing just \u20ac300. (photos here) \u2022 Branches opened as planned at 10am GMT or noon local time, closing six hours later after giving people their first change to use many banking services since Cyprus agreed a bailout on 16 March (follow the action from here onwards) \u2022 Although the queues were caim, Cypriots showed their anger and fears over the crisis which grips their country (interviews here..... and here) \u2022 But journalists outnumbered customers at some branches during the day, as Cyprus held its nerve (see here). \u2022 President Anastasiades later thanked the people for showing 'maturity and collectedness'. He is taking a 25% pay cut in solidarity with the nation (details) \u2022 The news helped to push shares higher in London and on Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 ended the day at a record closing high (see here) \u2022 In Cyprus, people were also adjusting to a new world of capital controls, which mean they can only take \u20ac1,000 in cash out of the country (more details here). \u2022 The decree bringing capital controls into force says they would initially last a week...but tonight its foreign minister said that might be relaxed in a month. Economists fear it will be longer. (see here) \u2022 New data showed that Cypriot bank deposits fell in February, before the bailout was announced -- with deposits from customers in other euro members down by 18% (see here). Thanks all, and goodnight! GW Over on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 has closed at a new record high. The stock index beat its previous closing record (set back in 2007 before the financial crisis struck). S&amp;P: up 6.54 points at 1,569 Dow Jones: up 51 points at 14577 Some investors, though, are warning that the markets are being puffed up by central bank easing. Wall Street trader Chris Gersch told Bloomberg TV: We [Wall Street] are the best of the worst right now.... this is an inflationary rally and I think we'll have a pullback. Earlier the European markets had ended mixed, with the FTSE 100 up 28 points at 6411, but the German DAX and the Italian FTSE MIB basically flat. If you're wondering how much damage a 12-day bank holiday can cause, then read this piece by Reuters tonight: Christakis Petsas counts the cost of the turmoil in Cyprus in terms of cars - 40 of them, stuck at the port in the coastal town of Limassol and costing him \u20ac800 a day in lost earnings. That's \u20ac12,000 since banks in Cyprus closed their doors almost two weeks ago and refused to transfer the import tax payment on the new fleet of vehicles for Petsas Rent-A-Car of Nicosia. Banks reopened on Thursday, but the ripple effect of their closure and the tough terms of a rescue deal that saved Cyprus from bankruptcy will strangle business on the island for a long time to come. \"The situation is tragic,\" said Petsas, a veteran of the 1974 Cypriot war that left the island divided between Greeks and Turks. \"I lived through the war as a soldier and I've never seen people so anxious. Back then you knew who the enemy was. These days you don't know whom you're fighting, or what tomorrow will bring.\" More here. Elsewhere in the eurozone crisis, the political instability in Italy deepened after centre-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani said he was unable to form a government. Bersani has spent a week talking to other parties. But as feared, he couldn't reach a consensus. Speaking to reporters in Rome, he said: I told the president that [my attempt to form an administration] had not found a solution and at this point the president decided to immediately verify the situation himself. President Napolitani must now decide his next step, explains Italian politics expert Alberto Nardelli: Last month's inconclusive election has left Italy in a real mess. A return to the ballot box feels inevitable, but analysts believe it could be delayed for months - perhaps into 2014 - if president Napolitani can put together a cabinet that could run the country in the meantime. There's some handy analysis here by Open Europe, and a nice piece on Quartz by Simone Foxman: Italy\u2019s failure to form a government doesn\u2019t bode well for the euro (both from yesterday). Back at Larnaca Airport, Channel 4's Faisal Islam says earlier today he spied the plane which flew in billions of euros into Cyprus last night ready for when its banks reopened: (see our opening post for a picture of the convoy of trucks that is understood to have transported the money to the country's central bank) One happy customer, having withdrawn cash at a branch of Laiki Bank in Limassol. Under the new capital control rules, he couldn't have taken more than \u20ac300 out. That restriction prevented a bank run breaking out today -- the relief is that people don't appear to have disputed it. Any lingering hopes that Cyprus's capital controls would be lifted in a week have been snuffed out by the country's foreign minister. Ioannis Kasoulides told reporters in Nicosia that Cyprus expects to fully lift the regime on its banks in \"about a month.\" Kasoulides added: A number of restrictions will be lifted and gradually, probably over a period of about a month according to the estimates of the central bank, the restrictions will be fully lifted. The decree finalised last night explained that the measures would initially last for a week - but many experts have predicted Cyprus will keep them for many months. Kasoulides may still be too optimistic. Cyprus's banks are shutting their doors, after a day which calmed fears that savers would panic over the crisis that grips the country. Slovenia's central bank governor has denied that his country is at risk of seeking a bailout. With speculation swirling that Sovenia's banks are being dragged down by bad loans, Marko Kranjec told the STA news agency that the country was stable. I can claim categorically that Slovenia is not in a position to need a bailout...But it is very important that policy makers give clear signals about stabilisation of public finances, rehabilitation of the banking sector and particularly of the real sector of the economy. But Slovenia does have problems, as my colleague Jo Moulds explains: The once-booming former Yugoslav republic was plunged into recession by the economic crisis, which dented demand for its exports of manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals and food. The economy is expected to shrink by at least 2% this year. But the statistic that has everyone concerned is the \u20ac7bn of bad loans on Slovenian banks' books, an amount equivalent to around one fifth of the country's total GDP. The rating agency Moody's has already downgraded Slovenia's second largest bank, and the IMF has estimated that the government needs to recapitalise the nation's lenders to the tune of at least \u20ac1bn. More video footage from Cyprus, this time of the banks opening for business: Cyprus will probably have to wait a month until it learns whether the International Monetary Fund will contribute to its bailout package. Although the IMF backed the deal put together in Brussels last Sunday, it has not yet confirmed that it will support the loan. It plans to spend several weeks considering the issue, which could mean a nervous wait for Nicosia. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters that officials from the IMF, the EU and the ECB are currently in Cyprus working on technical details. We expect the work of that mission to conclude in early April. After that our executive board will need to discuss the possible financing arrangement for Cyprus, so I would therefore not expect a final decision on a financial package from the IMF before the end of April. The Troika of international lenders could have a busy April - they are also due back in Athens next week to assess Greece's progress... Relief that Cyprus's banks reopened so smoothly has pushed shares higher in Europe and on Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 has risen over it's previous closing lifetime high. Here's the latest prices: FTSE 100: up 41 points at 6428, +0.65% German DAX: up 44 points at 7,833, +0.76% French CAC: up 37 points at 3,748, +1% Spanish IBEX: up 35 points at 7,935, +0.455% Italian FTSE MIB: up 83 points at 15,437, + 0.55% Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 42 points at 14568, +0.3% S&amp;P 500: up 2.49 points at 1565.34, +0.16% The euro is also up this morning, gaining half a cent against the US dollar to $1.283. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, says there had been fears of panic when the Cypriot government allowed branches to reopen: There has been much ado about the potential for a bank runs in Cyprus, but thus far, predictions have fallen short of reality.... I suggest that the capital controls in place \u2013 limiting Cypriots to withdrawals of \u20ac300/day \u2013 are the reason why we\u2019ve seen a lack of panic; accordingly, without them, Cypriot banks would be seeing massive outflows. Cyprus's president is taking a 25% pay cut in 'solidarity' with the Cypriot people. The move was announced in Nicosia this afternoon. AP has the details: Cyprus' president has cut his salary by a quarter in a show of solidarity with ordinary Cypriots feeling the effects of the country's severe financial crisis. President Nicos Anastasiades authorized the country's accountant-general to make the pay cut, undersecretary to the President Constantinos Petrides. Anastasiades' Cabinet ministers have also decided to slash their own wages by 20%. Cypriot banks reopened for the first time in nearly two weeks Thursday after they shut down to prevent people from withdrawing all their savings and triggering further chaos in the country's financial system. Back in February 2012, Greece's president surrendered his entire salary - worth almost \u20ac300,000 per year (see here) Here's Russia Today's take on the re-opening of Cyprus's banks today: From Nicosia, Associated Press reports that Cypriots formed 'large but orderly lines' to get into banks which have been closed since Saturday 16th March. People filed calmly into banks across the country once they had opened, and no crowd issues were reported.... Although people were calm, there was also concern that the restrictions on withdrawals (people can only get \u20ac300 per day) would be disruptive: In Nicosia, one 70 year-old pensioner who only gave his name as Ioannis arrived at the bank some two hours ahead of the scheduled opening time. \"I had to come this early, I came from my village 20 kilometers away, what do they want me to do, keep coming and going?\" he said Here's a gallery of photos from Cyprus so far today: Cyprus banks re-open - in pictures Passengers at Larnaca airport are warned that they cannot take more than \u20ac1,000 out of Cyprus, under the new rules on Capital Controls announced last last night (see details here). There was quite a queue outside this branch of the COOP Bank in Nicosia today. Worth noting that not everyone has turned up at the bank to access their savings - some have said they were actually paying money or cheques in. The eurozone has now been locked in a crisis for three and a half years, since Greece first admitted that there was a black hole in its accounts. Since then we've seen five rescue packages (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain's banking sector, and finally Cyprus), two unelected prime ministers (in Greece and Italy),widespread protests, lengthening jobless totals and an ongoing recession. You can track it all in our interactive timeline: Here's video footage of the scenes outside Cypriot banks today: The president of Cyprus has thanked the Cypriot people for the \"maturity and collectedness\" shown today as the country's banks reopened. Channel 4's Faisal Islam spies a dozen private jets at the runway at Larnaca Airport, in Cyprus, and different ones from his last visit: (corrected as I rather misread Faisal's tweet originally. Apologies - roll on Easter....) Further evidence that bank accounts started emptying before the Cypriot bailout... From Reuters: Savers from other euro zone countries withdrew 18% of the cash they held in Cyprus in February, amid fears the struggling island would impose a tax on bank deposits. Figures from the Central Bank of Cyprus published on Thursday show deposits from other euro zone states fell \u20ac860m to \u20ac3.9bn making them the fastest category to leave the stricken country. I mentioned earlier that total deposits in Cyprus's outsized banking sector fell by over 2% in February. So it appears that foreign savers, not ordinary Cypriots, were the primary cause. This eurozone data obviously excludes any movement of deposits to Russia. This photo shows a Laiki Bank manager tries to calm depositors waiting for the opening of the bank's branch in Nicosia. And here's a man leaving a Bank of Cyprus branch in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. One of our readers in Nicosia has very kindly provided this report of the situation an hour ago at a local branch: There was a queue of about 12 outside the large Bank of Cyprus Branch on Strovolos Avenue. in Nicosia. I do not know how many were inside, but the banking hall would accommodate 30 or more. All was calm and orderly. No police or security staff visible. We have used internet banking to transfer a very few hundred Euro from a BoC Instant Access account to a BoC current account. The transaction was accepted, but is marked as awaiting confirmation. He also points out that Cyprus will not be marking Good Friday with a bank holiday -- the Greek Orthodox Easter is some weeks away. Monday is a bank holiday - for Cyprus Independence Day. Natalie Powell of @featurestory reports that many Cypriots say they have no intention of pulling all their savings out of the bank. In fact, they plan to leave it there to support Cyprus. She reports: A lot of people are saying to me that they are not intending on taking all of their savings out of the bank, or even trying to.... The country needs money, and they will keep that money in the banks and support them. You can listen to her latest audio clip from Cyprus here. Good news. The three branches which didn't manage to open in time for 10am GMT (see 10.26am) are now all dealing with customers. It's a good effort by staff after the 12 day bank holiday; many don't know how much longer they'll have a job. Four people at a time being allowed in at the Bank of Cyprus branch on Evrou Avenue. Helena Smith is there, and reports a sense of pragmatism, not panic: \"I want to cash my salary,\" says Christina Andreou wielding a cheque for \u20ac1300. \"There's no point being anything but patient. Fighting is going to get us nowhere,\" says Dinos Volides who turned up at bank with a cane. \"Everyone in the bank is trying to be as helpful as possible.\" The only commotion, so far, has come from a woman visitor from Catford who is giving rousing speech outside the bank invoking the crowd to remember \"the suffering of the Lord on Good Friday. Ask for his forgiveness, acknowledge that you have gone astray,\" she says. It's clear now that several branches failed to hit the noon deadline to open their doors: At some branches, customers are being allowed in one at a time to ensure order. Everyone was also handed a copy of the capital control decree agreed overnight - so they are aware what they can, and cannot, do This branch wasn't quite ready to open, though: People began entering one Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia in an orderly fashion, under the watching gaze of Sky News. There was a security guard on hand to prevent a crush inside, but no suggestion of panic. One gentleman, Mr Lucas (80), explained: They have stolen our money... which we have been working for 60 years. How are we going to live? And the banks are open, with one lady taking the time to put a reporter in their place: Speaking of Laiki, Tanya Talaga of the Toronto Star flags up that customers are encouraged not to abuse its bank staff today: Many Laiki staff are likely to lose their jobs when its toxic assets and large deposits are placed in a 'bad bank' and run down, with its small deposits heading to Bank of Cyprus. The queuing customers don't look likely to riot, though. Many are elderly people, who don't own ATM cards. The entire board of Laiki Bank (Cyprus Popular Bank) have submitted their resignations, according to a filing to the Athens stock market (Reuters reports). Laiki, of course, is being wound-down under the bailout agreement. Cyprus: still calm as banks get ready..... Now this is interesting. Private sector deposits in Cyprus fell by 2.2% in February, to \u20ac46.4bn, according to data released by the European Central Bank. The drop in savings levels, which matches a fall in January, came as deposits in Greece rose by 2.2%, to \u20ac171bn. Such monthly figures are volatile, but they do suggest that some Cypriot depositors were canny enough to shift their savings abroad before the bailout was agreed (on 16 March). Martin van Vliet of ING commented: A further sharp decline in Cypriot bank deposits in March looks all but guaranteed. More importantly, however, next month\u2019s figures will shed more light on how (large) depositors in other peripheral countries have reacted to the uninsured-depositors-will-be-hit Cyprus bailout deal. Hats off to the Telegraph's Nick Squires for interviewing the Cypriot with the parrot on his head (see 9.00am) outside a bank branch. The man is 87, the parrot is 67. One of them is called Costas; it is not clear which as his English is negligible. More here. The scene on the ground in Nicosia is quiet but, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports, people are also struggling to cope with the trauma of recent days. Helena writes: On the streets of Nicosia it is busy as usual. At the best of times the Cypriot capital is a sleepy place, languorous and laid back.On the face of it today is no different - shops are open, clinics are accepting patients, people are sweeping the front steps of their homes and apartment blocks. When I ask a Greek Cypriot Orthodox priest in a stovepipe hat whether today is a big day, he responds with a simple shrug and smiles. But there is no denying that this is a populace in deep shock with many repeatedly likening what has happened to them with the sudden death of a loved one. \"We're feeling the same sort of emptiness,\" said Afrodite Elisaou, a doctor whose husband works in Laiki and still has no idea whether he will have a job tomorrow. \"It's the shock of it happening overnight, of going to sleep thinking you have a job and waking up not having one. Had all this happened to us gradually, and not in a day, it would have been much better.\" A couple of photos from inside a Laiki Bank branch. Laiki is being wound-up under the bailout deal agreed last week, but its customers (with under \u20ac100k) will be transferred to Bank of Cyprus. If the bank re-opening goes smoothly, expect to see a lot of this gentleman and his pet parrot: The European Commission has supported Cyprus's decision to impose capital controls, but urged the country to lift them as soon as possible. In a statement this morning, the EC said it had made a 'preliminary assessment' that the measures restricting the movement of capital are legal: In current circumstances, the stability of financial markets and the banking system in Cyprus constitutes a matter of overriding public interest and public policy justifying the imposition of temporary restrictions on capital movements. The EC added that it will continue monitor the need to \"extend the validity of or revise the measures\", to make sure they are proportionate to the need to maintain financial stability in Cyprus. While the imposed restrictive measures appear to be necessary in the current circumstances, the free movement of capital should be reinstated as soon as possible in the interests of the Cypriot economy and the European Union's single market as a whole. Here's the statement: Statement by the European Commission on the capital controls imposed by the Republic of Cyprus As Hoth25 wittily pointed out in the comments thread t below, Cyprus bank customers can only withdraw \u20ac300 from their account per day. So you can't simply show up, empty your account and transfer it to your mattress. That restriction was confirmed under the capital controls announced late last night. You can see the final decree on capital controls here: It's broadly as expected: \u2022 cashing cheques is banned, \u2022 people can only carry \u20ac1,000 each when they leave the country \u2022 Savings accounts cannot be accessed early (except to pay a loan) \u2022 transferring funds abroad is heavily restricted: (businesses must seek approval for payments over certain levels, people abroad can only withdraw \u20ac5,000 per month on their cards, payments to students overseas are capped at \u20ac5k+ tuition fees per quarter). And the decree \"shall apply for a seven day period starting from the day of its publication in the Official Gazette of the Republic\". Another sign of early calm - journalists outnumbering customers at this bank: Matina also confirms that there's \"no hysteria\", but security guards are stationed outside branches. The situation in Cyprus appears pretty quiet so far. Instead of a bank run, there are reporters racing around the branches -- and the good news is that they haven't found any signs of trouble. Cash is being delivered by security teams to branches, that are currently expected to open in 2 hours time. Breaking news: the Cyprus stock market has just announced that it will not reopen his morning. That's a surprise -- the bourse had been scheduled to begin trading after its own suspension. More as we get it.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the crisis in Cyprus. What happens if you close a country's banks for almost two weeks, restrict cash withdrawals, agree swingeing controls on taking money out of country, and then reopen the branches again? Panic? Anger? Or calm? We'll find out this morning, as Cyprus's banks open their doors for the first time since the country signed up for its ill-fated bailout package 12 days ago. It's a remarkable situation -- last night, trucks (apparently) carrying containers of euros arrived in Nicosia amid tight security. Hundreds of staff from the private security firm G4S are also guarding branches and shipping money around Cyprus to ensure branches have sufficient funds to cope. The banks are due to reopen at noon Cyprus time, and run until 6pm, so 10am-4pm GMT. Last night Cyprus finally agreed the details of tough capital controls to limit money flooding out of the country. Limiting people to taking out just \u20ac300 per day is meant to prevent a bank run. So perhaps all will be calm. We'll see....",

But high street banks were not inundated as they reopened, despite the fact that wealthy savers could face losses of at least 40%.</p> <p>As planned, banks closed around 6pm (4pm GMT). The Cyprus stock exchange, however, remained shut for the day, having abandoned plans to reopen less than an hour before trading was due to start.</p> <p>Hopes that Cyprus's new capital controls would be lifted in a week's time were dashed tonight, as foreign minister Ioannis Kasoulides predited they would last for \"about a month\".</p> <p>The day began with extra security being been drafted in from G4S to manage any trouble, and some banks limiting the number of people allowed in each branch.</p> <p>\"I want to cash my salary,\" said Christina Andreou, wielding a cheque for \u20ac1,300 at a Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia.</p> <p>\"There's no point being anything but patient. Fighting is going to get us nowhere,\" said Dinos Volides. \"Everyone in the bank is trying to be as helpful as possible.\"</p> <p>Many of the people turning up at branches were older customers who do not have bank cards and need to withdraw cash for daily expenses.</p> <p>At other branches, bank staff asked for calm from customers, saying they too were \"victims of the actions and or failures that caused this catastrophe\".

      "bodyText": "Cyprus's banks returned to business on Thursday with only limited queues (video), amid strict controls to stop people withdrawing all their savings and triggering a catastrophic bank run. The country had feared a stampede on the banks after a 12-day hiatus while the government negotiated a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.4bn) bailout package to avoid financial collapse. But high street banks were not inundated as they reopened, despite the fact that wealthy savers could face losses of at least 40%. As planned, banks closed around 6pm (4pm GMT). The Cyprus stock exchange, however, remained shut for the day, having abandoned plans to reopen less than an hour before trading was due to start. Hopes that Cyprus's new capital controls would be lifted in a week's time were dashed tonight, as foreign minister Ioannis Kasoulides predited they would last for \"about a month\". The day began with extra security being been drafted in from G4S to manage any trouble, and some banks limiting the number of people allowed in each branch. \"I want to cash my salary,\" said Christina Andreou, wielding a cheque for \u20ac1,300 at a Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia. \"There's no point being anything but patient. Fighting is going to get us nowhere,\" said Dinos Volides. \"Everyone in the bank is trying to be as helpful as possible.\" Many of the people turning up at branches were older customers who do not have bank cards and need to withdraw cash for daily expenses. At other branches, bank staff asked for calm from customers, saying they too were \"victims of the actions and or failures that caused this catastrophe\". Employees of Laiki, the country's second largest bank, are likely to lose their jobs when its toxic assets and large deposits are placed in a \"bad bank\" and run down, with smaller deposits transferred to the Bank of Cyprus. The population remains deep in shock, with one Cypriot describing the crisis like the sudden death of a loved one. \"We're feeling the same sort of emptiness,\" said Afrodite Elisaou, a doctor whose husband works at Laiki and still has no idea whether he will have a job on Friday. \"It's the shock of it happening overnight, of going to sleep thinking you have a job and waking up not having one. Had all this happened to us gradually, and not in a day, it would have been much better.\" Under the capital controls, cash withdrawals will be limited to \u20ac300 a day, although in recent days banks have restricted withdrawals to \u20ac100 per customer. Yiangos Demetriou, the head of internal audit at the island's central bank, told the Cypriot state broadcaster that a limit of \u20ac5,000 would be set on the use of credit cards abroad and said the measures would be imposed for just four days. Anyone leaving the country will be unable to carry more than \u20ac1,000 in banknotes, while families with members studying abroad will not be able to send more than \u20ac5,000 a quarter, plus tuition fees, to their relatives. It is the first time a member of the single currency has faced such emergency measures to keep cash within its borders since the euro was launched in 1999. \"The rationale is that these measures will be reviewed on a daily basis, so if there is the possibility of relaxing them we will,\" Demetriou said. Bob Lyddon, the general secretary of IBOS, an international banking association, described the controls as \"more reminiscent of Latin America or Africa\". \"These are permanent controls until the economy recovers,\" said Lyddon, casting doubt on any suggestion the capital controls could be temporary. The Cypriot financial sector has grown to eight times the size of its \u20ac17bn economy, inflated by deposits from wealthy foreigners. Much now hinges on the reaction of Russians who have made huge deposits in Cyprus in recent years. In the US, New York's powerful financial services industry has already benefited from a silent Cyprus bank run. \"This past year, we've been seeing a shift in investments in the United States as a result of the financial state of the European Union,\" said Ed Mermelstein, a New York real estate lawyer who advises wealthy Russians. Banks in Cyprus were closed 12 days ago shortly before the country's president, Nicos Anastasiades, announced the terms of its bailout, which included skimming all savers to raise \u20ac5.8bn. The terms have since been altered to ensure that those with less than \u20ac100,000 in their accounts are not forced to take a cut, in a move that the European authorities hope will restore faith in the bank guarantee scheme across the 27 EU nations. Under the terms of the bailout with the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 known as the troika \u2013 Laiki will be closed down, while the nation's biggest bank, the Bank of Cyprus, faces a major restructuring. Depositors with more than \u20ac100,000 in their accounts, the level at which savings are guaranteed across Europe, face a levy to raise billions of euros towards the bailout. According to some estimates, this could be between 40% and 80%. In Britain, the government has been working on ways to keep Laiki's four branches being drawn into the Cypriot bailout, but there was little indication on Wednesday night that a solution had been found for the 13,000 customers potentially affected. Chris Pavlou, the former vice-chairman of Laiki, told Channel 4 News that Anastasiades was given little option by the troika but to accept the draconian terms, which force savers to take a hit for the first time in the fifth bailout of a eurozone country. Pavlou said: \"It's not very nice actually, to see two or three people half your age, clever people, coming over there and shaking their hands at the president and saying: 'You have to do this, otherwise we bring you down.' It is very painful for someone who's just been elected to actually face that.\" The meltdown of the Cypriot financial system came as no surprise to well-connected, wealthy Russians, who bundled some of their money to the US. \"Many of our clients had a heads-up on this issue,\" said Mermelstein. \"Cyprus had started having the conversations about what it was intending, and that's been going on for half a year.\" Michalis Sarris, the Cypriot finance minister, has admitted that Cypriot banks were suffering \"substantial outflows\" for weeks before the meltdown, indicating that Russians were already anticipating the crisis.
