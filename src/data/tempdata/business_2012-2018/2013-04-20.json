      "bodyText": "'Most people I speak to in manufacturing are flat out,\" says Cy Wilkinson, managing director of Cressall Resistors, which exports components for everything from oil rigs to trains from its factory on the outskirts of Leicester. Wilkinson recently took over from industry veteran Peter Duncan, who stands protectively nearby. He is part of a new generation of British manufacturers: he started as an apprentice toolmaker, then went off to do a masters and an MBA. He uses modern management thinking \u2013 including \"lean\" methods pioneered at Toyota \u2013 to help the firm cut costs, reduce delays and boost output. \"A lot of organisations are still not doing anything to get better, and I still find that confusing,\" Wilkinson says. \"We have invested in machinery, in people, in training.\" This is exactly the kind of success story business secretary Vince Cable wants to hear. The coalition is hoping a thriving industrial sector will help lift the economy out of the doldrums, create jobs and build sustainable growth. But with Britain's key market, the eurozone, deep in recession, and the services sector still struggling, the hoped-for export-led recovery has so far failed to materialise. Official figures will reveal on Thursday whether the economy shrank for a second successive quarter, from January to March, marking a triple-dip recession \u2013 unprecedented in living memory. Economist Peter Dixon of Commerzbank is expecting something between a 0.1% contraction in GDP and 0.1% growth, which, despite the efforts of Cressall and thousands of other thriving firms, would leave economic output about 3.5% below its pre-crisis peak. \"The fact that we're not even able to produce in volume terms what we produced five years ago tells us a lot about the nature of the recession,\" he says. Last month's budget suggested that even George Osborne, the architect of the \"march of the makers\" strategy for revival, is starting to lose patience with his own plan. Under pressure from restless Tory backbenchers, and perhaps acknowledging that the hoped-for rebalancing is unlikely to produce results this side of a general election, he announced a series of drastic policies, including a taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantee, designed to spark a revival in the housing market. These appeared to push in precisely the opposite direction to Osborne's stated desire to wean UK plc from debt-fuelled consumer spending to export-led expansion, and his Lib Dem colleagues are known to be sceptical. But in Leicester, there's already evidence of a modest housing revival \u2013 for which the chancellor may later hope to claim the credit. \"In the past two months it's become apparent that there's perhaps a little bit more confidence about,' says David Johnson of Leicester estate agency Readings. He says people have decided that, after waiting about for five years, \"maybe now's the time to make some changes\". It's also helpful that house prices here remain, by his reckoning, 16% below their pre-crisis peak. But he believes the industrial revival the coalition is hoping for will also be crucial in helping to underpin Leicester's property market. \"There are signs that the manufacturing industries for which this area was once well-known are starting to show some signs of life.\" As for the end of shop-till-you-drop Britain, there's little evidence of it at Highcross shopping centre, with its atrium-style ceiling, piped music and giant John Lewis. It's a slightly different story round on Gallowtree Gate, which used to be the main drag for Leicester's shoppers and is now dotted with empty shops. Jon Ashworth, the local Labour MP, points to the proliferation of pawn shops and short-term lenders. \"We do have a reasonably resilient manufacturing business in Leicester; at the same time, unemployment for the city is still high, and there's still huge deprivation in the city centre and surrounding council estates.\" Nationally, last week's retail sales figures showed a 0.7% decline in March. That was partly the result of grim spring weather, but the relentless decline in real wages since the downturn has continued to depress consumer spending. North of the city in Thurmaston, there's more evidence of the manufacturing renaissance. Robert Howard, managing director of Cooke Optics, proudly displays the Oscar statuette the company recently won for the contribution its camera lenses have made to the film industry. Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese are among the Hollywood film directors who favour what the company calls the \"Cooke Look\". Two staff from the factory in Leicester were flown to California for the ceremony. Like Wilkinson, Howard is among those optimistic about Britain's manufacturing sector. Cooke \u2013 owned by US businessman Les Zellan \u2013 has a bulging order book, because lower costs mean sophisticated digital movie cameras are being used for a wider range of jobs, including TV. \"Our lenses were used on Downton Abbey,\" Howard says. Cooke Optics has been producing sophisticated lenses for movie cameras in Leicester for more than a century. Parts of its factory look like a scientific lab; but elsewhere, blue-overalled workers bend over machines that wouldn't look out of place in a documentary about Britain's metal-bashing heyday. Howard says that's because while some of the grinding, polishing and coating of lenses is done by hi-tech, computer-controlled machines (mostly imported from Germany), for some parts of the job the skilled human hand and eye are still best. \"We reckon we make the best lenses in the world, and to do that you need this mix of new and old.\" He has expanded the company's floor space in recent years, and boosted the workforce to almost 90 people: \"A new person started today, in fact.\" The pattern is reflected across the area, according to Nick Pulley, regional director of commercial banking at Santander, who sits on Leicester's Local Enterprise Partnership, Osborne's favoured vehicle for stimulating growth. More than 70 local manufacturing firms have applied for a slice of up to \u00a37.8m that the LEP is making available from the government's regional growth fund to help smaller firms expand. \"Of the applications we have received, there's a groundswell of businesses undertaking what you could call 're-shoring',\" he says. In the textile sector, traditionally a strength for Leicester, he says many firms have continued to carry out research and design in the UK, while outsourcing manufacturing to the Far East. These are now bringing some production back home, whether because of rising wages in China, concerns about quality, or to shorten complex and inefficient supply chains. But if you ask either Howard at Cooke Optics or Duncan at Cressall whether they think a revitalised industrial sector is the key to revival, both have doubts. Both firms buy in parts, raw materials and machines from overseas, which means a cheaper pound drives up costs. It also means any increase in exports Britain achieves is accompanied by a jump in imports. And both men are aware that their firms are in what Howard calls \"a lovely niche\". \"Manufacturing is doing well,\" he says. \"Whether there's enough of an industrial base for it to help the whole economy, I don't know.\" Duncan, who started as an apprentice at Rolls-Royce and sits on the regional board of manufacturers' group the EEF, says: \"You have to play to your strengths, and what have we [GB Limited] got? We've got some really good engineers.\" He too is nervous about the burden placed on manufacturers, who make up just 10.5% of the UK economy. \"If you're going to put your hand in your pocket and invest in something new, you have to be pretty sure the market's there.\" And even if the economy has pulled clear of a triple dip, the ongoing turmoil in the eurozone and the slowdown in crucial growth markets, not least China, is likely to go on giving even the most thrusting exporters pause for thought. Dixon at Commerzbank says politicians will have to give up on the idea of a quick fix: \"There's been a realisation among policymakers that we're not going to get the typical V-shaped recovery, and the sooner we all get used to that, the better. You get seven fat years and then you get seven lean years, as the Bible says: it's not a new phenomenon.\"",

He is part of a new generation of British manufacturers: he started as an apprentice toolmaker, then went off to do a masters and an MBA.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gold and its beguiling promise of assured riches have lured clever men into making bad decisions for millennia. The latest to have fallen under its alchemical spell is apparently John Paulson, hedge fund billionaire and the man who made his name \u2013 and a $5bn (\u00a32.5bn) profit \u2013 betting against that other supposedly safe bet, the housing market. In just two days last week, the 57-year-old hedge fund manager lost almost $1bn as the gold price slumped at a speed unseen in decades. With a personal fortune valued by Forbes magazine at $11.2bn, Paulson can weather the loss, but this is not his first stumble since his historic bet on the property crash made him the world's most famous hedge fund manager. And despite recent events, he is still flying the gold standard. Paulson, known to his friends as JP, had been running a hedge fund for more than a decade before he shot to fame betting against the housing market. The New Yorker, an alumnus of Harvard Business School, had specialised in merger and acquisition share trades before turning his attention to the housing market. But betting against sub-prime mortgages earned him a record $5bn in 2010 \u2013 $13.7m a day. His funds became money magnets, managing just shy of $36bn at their height. For some, that's where Paulson's problems began: he had become too big not to fail. The funds are now thought to manage around $18bn in total. \"He's a talented and upstanding guy,\" says Keith McCullough, chief executive of hedge fund adviser and analyst Hedgeye Risk Management. \"The problem is that he's the victim of gravity. There has never been a hedge fund manager who has run that amount of money and continued the run [of profits].\" With so much money to invest, McCullough says, the bets that a hedge fund manager is forced to take become bigger and bigger. \"It becomes more and more difficult to hit the home runs,\" he says. \"Once you get that big, you can't get out. And once you can't get out, you're done.\" Paulson is still betting that the return of inflation and a meltdown in global currencies will save his gold investments. \"Federal governments have been printing money at an unprecedented rate, creating demand for gold as an alternative currency for individual and institutional savers and central banks,\" Paulson partner and gold specialist John Reade told Bloomberg last week. \"While gold can be volatile in the short term and is going through one of its periodic adjustments, we believe the long-term trend of increasing demand for gold in lieu of paper is intact.\" Gold prices rose throughout the economic crisis and were boosted by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's decision to pump billions into the US economy each month. But now the Fed looks as if it may slow down its largesse, the US economy is stumbling into the light and there's still no sign of inflation. \"Gold is a bet on the end of the world,\" says McCullough. \"Gold hates growth. If you actually get, God forbid, any economic growth, gold is not going to like it.\" Paulson is stuck in a huge one-way bet \u2013 a position not unlike that of the investors he bested who presumed the housing bubble would inflate forever. \"I've been a very vocal gold bear,\" says McCullough. \"I have 60 slide presentations, multiple institutional clients who have the other side of the Paulson trade. We have a very articulate case with a lot of fundamental underpinnings. But if I didn't have any of that, I could be right just by him being wrong.\" Paulson wouldn't the first hedge fund manager to fall victim to his own success. There is a grand tradition of hedge funds performing in a \"really horrible fashion\" once they get too big, says Gregory Zuckerman, author of The Greatest Trade Ever: How John Paulson Bet Against the Markets and Made $20 Billion. George Soros, the man whose trades famously \"broke the Bank of England\", together with hedge fund legends Michael Steinhardt and Julian Robertson, all stumbled after success swelled the size of their funds. \"I've discussed it with Paulson and he seems confident that relative to the rest of the market his 30-something billion is small. That's true, but when you manage that much money, you are forced to go with not all your best ideas,\" says Zuckerman. \"He was no housing expert. He came to it with a lot of research and saw something that other people didn't. He took the same approach with gold \u2026 He put a lot of research into it. You can make mistakes like that as well. \"He's married to his position. He started a gold fund, what's he going to do, short gold? Probably not.\" Paulson's woes are not all of his own making. Even some of the best-known hedge fund managers say the golden days are over for the industry. There are simply too many people running hedge funds with too much money. This year, Soros spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \"Since hedge funds are now a dominant force in the market, they can't, as a group, outperform the market,\" he said. Research from BarclayHedge and TrimTabs Investment Research suggests he is right.

      "body": "<p>Gold and its beguiling promise of assured riches have lured clever men into making bad decisions for millennia. The latest to have fallen under its alchemical spell is apparently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/john-paulson\" title=\"\">John Paulson</a>, hedge fund billionaire and the man who made his name \u2013 and a $5bn (\u00a32.5bn) profit \u2013 betting against that other supposedly safe bet, the housing market.</p> <p>In just two days last week, the 57-year-old hedge fund manager lost almost $1bn as the gold price slumped at a speed unseen in decades. With a personal fortune valued by <em>Forbes </em>magazine at $11.2bn, Paulson can weather the loss, but this is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/16/john-paulson-subprime-hedge-funds-investments-china\" title=\"\">not his first stumble</a> since his historic bet on the property crash made him the world's most famous hedge fund manager. And despite recent events, he is still flying the gold standard.</p> <p>Paulson, known to his friends as JP, had been running a hedge fund for more than a decade before he shot to fame betting against the housing market.</p> <p>The New Yorker, an alumnus of Harvard Business School, had specialised in merger and acquisition share trades before turning his attention to the housing market. But betting against sub-prime mortgages earned him a record $5bn in 2010 \u2013 $13.7m a day.</p> <p>His funds became money magnets, managing just shy of $36bn at their height. For some, that's where Paulson's problems began: he had become too big not to fail. The funds are now thought to manage around $18bn in total.</p> <p>\"He's a talented and upstanding guy,\" says Keith McCullough, chief executive of hedge fund adviser and analyst Hedgeye Risk Management. \"The problem is that he's the victim of gravity. There has never been a hedge fund manager who has run that amount of money and continued the run [of profits].\"</p> <p>With so much money to invest, McCullough says, the bets that a hedge fund manager is forced to take become bigger and bigger.</p> <p>\"It becomes more and more difficult to hit the home runs,\" he says. \"Once you get that big, you can't get out. And once you can't get out, you're done.\"</p> <p>Paulson is still betting that the return of inflation and a meltdown in global currencies will save his gold investments.</p> <p>\"Federal governments have been printing money at an unprecedented rate, creating demand for gold as an alternative currency for individual and institutional savers and central banks,\" Paulson partner and gold specialist John Reade told Bloomberg last week.</p> <p>\"While gold can be volatile in the short term and is going through one of its periodic adjustments, we believe the long-term trend of increasing demand for gold in lieu of paper is intact.\"</p> <p>Gold prices rose throughout the economic crisis and were boosted by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's decision to pump billions into the US economy each month.
