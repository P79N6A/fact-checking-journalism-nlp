      "bodyText": "The World Bank will end its financial support for oil and gas extraction within the next two years in response to the growing threat posed by climate change. In a statement that delighted campaigners opposed to fossil fuels, the Bank used a conference in Paris to announce that it \u201cwill no longer finance upstream oil and gas\u201d after 2019. The Bank ceased lending for coal-fired power stations in 2010 but has been under pressure from lobby groups also to halt the $1bn (\u00a3750m) a year it has been lending for oil and gas in developing countries. The Bank said it saw the need to change the way it was operating in a \u201crapidly changing world\u201d, adding that it was on course to have 28% of its lending going to climate action by 2020. At present, 1-2% of the Bank\u2019s $280bn portfolio is accounted for by oil and gas projects. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank said it would consider lending for oil and gas projects in the very poorest countries but only where it helped the poor get access to energy and the project did not conflict with commitments to reduce greenhouse gases made in the 2015 Paris climate change accord. The announcement was made at the One Planet Summit, convened by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the World Bank president, Yim Yong Kim, and the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to mark the two-year anniversary of the agreement. The Greenpeace International climate campaigner Gyorgy Dallos said: \u201cThe end is clearly coming for the oil and gas industry as the pace of change accelerates.\u201d Dallos said the Bank had sent a damning vote of no confidence in the future of the fossil fuel industry. \u201cThe world\u2019s financial institutions now need to take note and decide whether their financing is going to be part of the problem or the solution,\u201d he said. Stephen Kretzmann, an executive director of the Washington-based advocacy group Oil Change International, said: \u201cIt is hard to overstate the significance of this historic announcement by the World Bank. \u201cEnvironmental, human rights, and development campaigners have been amplifying the voices of frontline communities for decades in calling for an end to World Bank financing of upstream oil and gas projects. [Now] the World Bank has raised the bar for climate leadership by recognising the simple yet inconvenient truth that achieving the Paris agreement\u2019s climate goals requires an end to the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. It is time for all of the institutions, countries, investors and individuals who are still in the Paris agreement to stop funding fossils \u2013 once and for all.\u201d The World Bank announcement came as the Bank of England\u2019s governor revealed that there was growing global support for a new initiative designed to help pave the way for a low-carbon economy by persuading companies to come clean about their exposure to climate change risks. Speaking at the Paris summit, Carney said 237 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $6.3tn (\u00a34.7tn) were now backing the scheme. Britain\u2019s six leading banks \u2013 Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered \u2013 have all supported the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, set up by Carney in his role as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, an international body charged with preventing a repeat of the 2008 banking crisis. Under the plan, companies pledge to use their financial reports to disclose their direct and indirect exposure to global warming under a range of different scenarios. Banks are obliged to say how much they have lent to companies with climate-related risks. Carney said 20 of the 30 globally systemically important banks and eight out of 10 of the largest asset managers and leading insurance companies were committed to informing investors. Leading construction, consumer goods, transport, mining and energy companies have also signed up. \u201cMarkets need the right information to seize the opportunities and mitigate the risks that are being created by the transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThis solution, of the market and for the market, is truly entering the mainstream.\u201d UK sources said that London was becoming a hub for climate change-related finance, with green bonds issued in more than 40 different currencies, including the Indian rupee and the Chinese yuan. Michael Bloomberg, the chair of the taskforce, said: \u201cClimate change poses both economic risks and opportunities. But right now, companies don\u2019t have the data they need to accurately measure the risks and evaluate the opportunities.\u201d \u2022The article was amended on Thursday 14 December to better reflect the World\u2019s Bank\u2019s decision to end financial support for both exploration and extraction. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has admitted households are feeling the pain from rising inflation after the cost of living rose to a near six-year high of 3.1% in November. Amid fears that the intensifying pressure on living standards will hit high street spending in the runup to Christmas, the financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, said 2018 would bring better news. Stride said: \u201cInflation is expected to fall over the coming year, but I recognise families are feeling a squeeze now. We are determined to help, which is why the autumn budget cut income tax, boosted basic pay by more than inflation and froze alcohol and fuel duties.\u201d Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed dearer computer games and a smaller November fall in airfares than a year ago were the main factors behind a rise in the consumer price index measure of inflation from 3% in October. The annual inflation rate has more than doubled from 1.2% to 3.1% in the past year \u2013 its highest level since March 2012 \u2013 largely as a result of the fall in the value of the pound following the EU referendum in June 2016. Under the terms of its independence, the Bank of England is obliged to keep inflation within one percentage point of the government\u2019s 2% target, so November\u2019s increase will force its governor, Mark Carney, to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Carney will blame the overshoot on the depreciation in sterling and will add that inflation will come back towards its target during 2018 as the impact of the weaker pound fades. Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cAs we approach the end of the year, rising inflation will deepen the current squeeze on pay. For low-income families it also further erodes the value of working age benefits \u2013 which remain frozen at their 2015 levels. \u201cThis double hit means many families will be feeling the pinch in the runup to Christmas. While inflationary pressures are expected to ease next year, far stronger wage growth will be needed to get Britain\u2019s pay recovery back on track.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cChristmas dinner is going to be a lot more expensive this year. Food prices have gone up at twice the rate of wages. \u201cThe government is failing to deal with Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. Working people need a pay rise. They shouldn\u2019t have to worry about putting the turkey on the table.\u201d A breakdown of the ONS data showed food prices up by 4.1% on a year ago, with transport costs rising by 4.5% and clothing and footwear up by 3%. City analysts believe inflation is close to a peak but evidence that there may be more inflationary pressure in the pipeline emerged from separate ONS figures for producer prices, which measure the cost of the fuel and raw materials used by industry and the price of goods leaving factory gates. In November, fuel and raw material bills for manufacturers were 7.3% higher than a year ago, up from 4.8% in October, while factory gate prices rose by 3%, up from 2.8% in October. Mike Prestwood, the ONS head of inflation, said: \u201cCPI inflation edged above 3% for the first time in nearly six years, with the price of computer games rising and airfares falling more slowly than this time last year. These upward pressures were partly offset by falling costs of computer equipment. \u201cThe prices of raw materials and goods leaving factories continued to increase as oil and petrol prices continued to rise. Annual rises in house prices and rents continued to slow, with London seeing house price falls for the second month running.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The RAC has warned British drivers they could be paying 3p a litre more for fuel by Christmas after the shutdown of a major North Sea pipeline hit oil prices. The warning came as an explosion at a key European gas hub in Austria and disruption to supplies in Norway pushed gas prices to multi-year highs. The price of unleaded could climb to 123.76p a litre and diesel to 126.21p a litre, the highest since November 2014, the RAC said. \u201cAn increase of up to 3p a litre is very bad news for motorists,\u201d said a spokesman for the RAC. \u201cThis closure will inevitably lead to an unwelcome increase in the price with the knock-on effect of raising the wholesale cost of both fuels.\u201d The closure of the Forties pipeline, after a crack was found in a section of pipe in Aberdeenshire, was followed by an explosion on Tuesday morning at Austria\u2019s Baumgarten gas hub, which killed one person and led Italy to declare a state of emergency over energy supply fears. Meanwhile, Norway\u2019s Statoil said it was reducing gas flows from Troll, Europe\u2019s biggest offshore gas field, adding upward pressure to gas prices. They had already climbed after the UK firm Ineos on Monday announced a weeks-long closure of the North Sea\u2019s Forties pipeline. The UK government warned the oil industry against using the Forties pipeline closure to justify putting up fuel prices. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: \u201cThis incident should not have a significant impact on global oil supplies. It is important the oil industry does not use this short-term challenge as an excuse to put up the prices of fuel at the pump.\u201d The spokesperson added that \u201cshort-term spikes in the cost of gas will have a negligible effect on [energy] bills in the future\u201d. The market intelligence firm ICIS said the incidents, combined with high demand because of cold temperatures, had created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for rising prices. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has risen to $65.56, a level not seen since the summer of 2015. In the past fortnight, it has been in the $62-$64 range after Opec and Russia agreed to extend production curbs. UK wholesale gas prices for the day ahead leapt to 90p a therm, a height last reached during a cold snap in 2013. The UK government said there were no concerns over security of supply, but industry watchers said the supply disruptions would filter down to consumers. Jonathan Leitch, a research director at the oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, said: \u201cThe knock-on effect, because we\u2019ve taken some supply out of the market, that means outright prices go up, which should mean the consumer pays more at the pump for petrol and diesel.\u201d Ineos said it should know within days if repairs to a crack in the pipeline, which carries 40% of UK oil and gas, would take a fortnight or up to three weeks. \u201cIf it is more than three weeks, obviously the impact becomes deeper,\u201d said Leitch. The incidents across Europe will not immediately lead to higher gas bills for households, experts said, but could filter through to worse tariffs in the new year as energy suppliers seek to recoup their costs. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t see a short-term impact [on consumer gas bills],\u201d said Mike Mahoney, associate director at the analysts Cornwall Insight. However, he said the Austrian gas hub outage could see central Europe competing for Norway\u2019s gas supplies in the new year, pushing up UK gas prices in turn. Norway is the biggest supplier of the 60% of gas that Britain imports. Mahoney said that security of supply was not an issue but the pipeline shutdown had highlighted the UK\u2019s exposure to price swings after the country\u2019s biggest gas storage site, Rough, closed earlier this year. \u201cWhile it\u2019s positive we\u2019ve been able to cover our gas demand on a cold, very high demand day, it shows there\u2019s not a lot of room to manoeuvre when you have a supply disruption. Prices are going to jump significantly,\u201d he said. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThere is no security of supply issue for fuel or gas supplies as a result of the repairs needed to the Forties pipeline.\u201d Richard Harrington, the energy minister, spoke to Ineos on Tuesday morning. In Italy, gas prices doubled after the fire at Baumgarten, which is a key hub for Russian gas imports to Europe. Gas from Algeria and shipped liquified natural gas were expected to make up Italy\u2019s shortfalls, but Italy\u2019s industry minister, Carlo Calenda, said the incident showed Italy had \u201ca serious supply problem\u201d. Calenda said his country would not have had to declare a state of emergency if a new gas pipeline bringing supplies from the Caspian sea had been ready. The European Investment Bank\u2019s board was poised on Tuesday to approve a \u20ac1.5bn loan to help the Trans Adriatric Pipeline through its final, capital-intensive construction phase.

      "bodyText": "The crisis of confidence among owners of large shopping centres is contagious. Last week it was Hammerson, the Birmingham Bullring folk, bidding for Intu, owner of Gateshead\u2019s Metrocentre. Now, on grander scale, French giant Unibail-Rodamco is paying $25bn (\u00a318.5bn) to own Westfield, the Australian outfit that has erected its multistorey car parks, with malls attached, in east and west London. The new duo claimed \u201ccompelling\u201d rationale for the deal but never quite got round to saying what it\u2019s supposed to be. It can\u2019t be the cost savings since they are tiny in the context of a company that will own \u20ac61bn-worth of assets. The savings are worth just \u20ac100m, of which only \u20ac60m is attributed to eliminating \u201ccorporate overheads\u201d, which presumably means closing Westfield\u2019s Australian office. Instead, the impetus for this deal seems to be the idea that greater size offers better protection from the rise of online shopping. The new firm will certainly be big. Unibail brings 69 shopping centres in Europe, including Forum des Halles in Paris. Westfield, aside from the two London sites, has interests in 33 centres in the US. At the margin, maybe size helps. An international fashion brand seeking shops across Europe and the US could save time and hassle by making a single call to the Unibail/Westfield combo. In the end, though, property is always local. It\u2019s hard to understand why painting the \u201cworld famous Westfield brand\u201d on the Unibail centres is supposed to pull in more punters. Even the two London Westfields feel very different. The calculation, then, is that investment risk in the age of Amazon is best spread across a broader portfolio of properties. That\u2019s not so silly from the point of view of Sir Frank Lowy, Westfield\u2019s 87-year-old founder, who regards Unibail as \u201cthe natural home\u201d for the business he built. But a compelling logic? The rush to consolidate looks more like a defensive kneejerk reaction. Trump can\u2019t cloud climate change progress When Donald Trump began the process of pulling the US out of the Paris agreement on climate change in June, a few optimists suggested there might be a silver lining to his damaging action. The rest of the world might be so appalled that it would show greater unity. The good news, to judge by three developments this week in the financial world, is that there are reasons to be cheerful. First, the World Bank said it will no longer finance upstream oil and gas projects after 2019; the only exceptions will be in the poorest countries where other sources are energy are hard to secure. Second, Bank of England governor Mark Carney announced that an initiative to push companies to reveal their direct and indirect exposures to global warming is gaining traction. The UK\u2019s big six banks have signed up and are committed to saying how much they have lent to companies that pose the biggest risks to the climate. Eight out of 10 of the largest asset managers and insurance companies are also part of the effort and say they are committed to financing a lower-carbon global economy. Third, US oil giant ExxonMobil has finally agreed to bow to its shareholders\u2019 wishes and reveal data on how governments\u2019 actions to limit the increase in global temperatures will affect its business. We await details, but at least Exxon, after years of resistance, has accepted that it must publish. These are all small steps \u2013 and, note, greater disclosure of risks is not the same as mitigating actions. But they are welcome signs. So is the fact that, while there was no official US presence at the Paris summit at which Carney spoke, there were plenty of American non-government organisations and city mayors. Trump\u2019s lead, it seems, is being rightly ignored. H/2 must spell out where it stands H/2 Capital Partners, when it takes ownership of Four Seasons, the UK\u2019s largest care homes operator, must open up and tell us what it stands for. The reticent style was vaguely understandable while H/2 was buying up Four Seasons\u2019 debt at a discount to face value. But, when it claims control of the business from current owner Terra Firma, the US hedge fund will be responsible for the care of 17,000 elderly people who will want to know that it brings more to the industry than a keen eye for property values. Spencer Haber, H/2\u2019s founder, apparently likes cats, dogs and toucans (he produced a film about the latter). It\u2019s not much to go on, and there\u2019s no point checking the corporate website for past deals because there isn\u2019t one. Bland statements about bringing \u201cresponsible private capital\u201d are not enough. Who are you, and what\u2019s your track record in the US?",

      "bodyText": "Pilots working for Ryanair in Ireland have called a one-day strike next week, potentially disrupting flights for Europe\u2019s biggest airline on its home territory. Flights to and from Dublin, Shannon and Cork are likely to be affected by the walkout on Wednesday. The action has been taken in a bid to win collective representation in pay dealsrather than through Ryanair\u2019s own employee channels. Ryanair said it would \u201cface down\u201d the strike, though it admitted some \u201cdisruption may occur\u201d. Up to 117 pilots in the Irish Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Ialpa) union \u2013 part of Ireland\u2019s second-biggest trade union, Impact \u2013 are expected to take action, which Ryanair said is less than a third of the pilots it employs in Ireland. However, the union said that the 117 represent almost 90% of pilots directly employed by Ryanair, and the majority are captains, a rank needed on every flight. It said the walkout would either cause significant disruption or costs for Ryanair if it replaced them with captains from other European bases. Crew and pilots in Italy are also planning action on Friday, while pilots in Portugal have also voted to strike. Ryanair has told cabin crew in Italy that action by any one member will see their entire base lose rights to transfers or promotions. The airline said: \u201cRyanair will deal with any such disruptions if or when they arise, and we apologise sincerely to customers for any upset or worry this threatened action by less than 28% of our Dublin pilots may cause them over the coming days.\u201d Ryanair has told pilots who strike that they will be in breach of their agreements, conducted by the airline separately with each base, and lose benefits including guarantees over rosters and pay, and be denied promotion. It said its pilots had been offered 20% pay deals, adding: \u201cLike any group of workers, Ryanair\u2019s very well paid pilots are free to join unions, but like every other multinational, Ryanair is also free \u2013 under both Irish and EU law \u2013 to decline to engage with unions.\u201d Impact said Ryanair was the only Irish-based airline that refused to recognise unions and the dispute was \u201csolely about winning independent representation for pilots in the company\u201d. It warned more strikes could follow. Ashley Connolly, a union official, said: \u201cManagement\u2019s failed negotiating model has let down shareholders and tens of thousands of passengers whose flights were cancelled this year because company-controlled industrial relations proved incapable of recruiting and retaining enough pilots.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A late ps: petrol prices may rise by 3p per litre, due to the production freeze caused by the cracked Forties North Sea oil pipe, and the serious explosion in Austria today. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains; The RAC has warned British drivers they could be paying 3p a litre more for fuel by Christmas after the shutdown of a major North Sea pipeline hit oil prices. The warning came as an explosion at a key European gas hub in Austria and disruption to supplies in Norway pushed gas prices to multi-year highs. The price of unleaded could climb to 123.76p a litre and diesel to 126.21p a litre, the highest since November 2014, the RAC said.... Bad news for motorists, as this puts extra pressure on the cost of living. Goodnight! Right, time for a recap...via our own Larry Elliott: Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze has intensified after the annual rate of inflation hit a near six-year high of 3.1% in November. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed dearer computer games and a smaller fall in airfares than a year ago were two factors behind the unexpected increase from 3% in October. The small increase in the cost of living will force Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street has failed to keep inflation within one percentage point of the government\u2019s 2% target. A breakdown of the ONS data showed food prices up by 4.1% on a year ago, with transport costs rising by 4.5% and clothing and footwear up by 3%. The fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 has been the main factor behind the jump in the annual inflation rate from 1.2% in November 2016 to its highest level since March 2012. City analysts believe inflation is close to a peak but evidence that there may be more inflationary pressure in the pipeline emerged from separate ONS figures for producer prices, which measure the cost of the fuel and raw materials used by industry and the price of goods leaving factory gates. In November, fuel and raw material bills for manufacturers were 7.3% higher than a year ago, up from 4.8% in October, while factory gate prices rose by 3%, up from 2.8% in October. More here: NIESR\u2019s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, Amit Kara, fears that British workers\u2019 pay packets will remain under the cosh for some time: \u201cWe expect inflation to peak at current levels in the final quarter of this year before dropping back to the target rate by mid-2019. The Bank will in our view raise the policy rate every six months until the policy rate reaches 2% by mid-2021, with the next increase in May. Wage growth is likely to remain under pressure as a result\u201d. The energy market has been rocked by a major explosion at Austria\u2019s main gas line. One person has reportedly been killed in the blast, which occurred around 8.45am local time, with 18 people injured. The pipeline supplies gas to Italy, which has been forced to declare a state of emergency: This comes a day after a crack forced the closure of a major oil pipeline from the North Sea (as covered earlier this morning). This supply disruption has sent the cost of natural gas for delivery today into Britain soaring , by up to 40%: Just in: Inflation may be building in America too. Producer prices (what companies charge for their wares) rose by 0.4% last month, faster than expected. On an annual bases, producer prices are up by over 3%. Instead of battling inflation, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been busy fighting another noble course - climate change. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has announced growing global support for a new initiative designed to help pave the way to a low-carbon economy by persuading firms to come clean about their exposure to climate-change risks. Speaking at the One Planet Summit in Paris, Carney said he was delighted that 237 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $6.3tn (\u00a34.7tn) were now backing the scheme. Britain\u2019s six leading banks \u2013 Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered \u2013 have all supported the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, set up by Carney in his role as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, an international body charged with preventing a repeat of the 2008 banking crisis. Under the plan, companies pledge to use their financial reports to disclose their direct and indirect exposure to global warming under a range of different scenarios. Banks are obliged to say how much they have lent to companies with climate-related risks. ONS Head of Inflation Mike Prestwood has summed up this morning\u2019s data: \u201cCPI inflation edged above 3% for the first time in nearly six years, with the price of computer games rising and airfares falling more slowly than this time last year. These upward pressures were partly offset by falling costs of computer equipment. \u201cThe prices of raw materials and goods leaving factories continued to increase as oil and petrol prices continued to rise. \u201cAnnual rises in house prices and rents continued to slow, with London seeing house price falls for the second month running.\u201d While inflation has risen, house price inflation in the UK has dipped slightly - due to a slowdown in London. The average house price increased by 4.5% in the year to October 2017, down from 4.8% in September 2017. In London, prices were only 2.1% higher than a year ago. Rising inflation is a severe blow to families who rely on state benefits. Many of those benefits are currently frozen under the government\u2019s austerity programme, which means they are shrinking in real terms. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, say the government should rethink its policy: \u201cFalling wages and frozen benefits mean that many families will struggle to find the money to keep up with rising inflation. Today\u2019s update means that a family of four on the minimum wage will be \u00a3500 worse off every year due to the benefit freeze. \u201cThe cost of basic essentials is rising even faster than the headline inflation figure: food is up 4.1% and energy 6.4% in the last year. This means people on lower incomes are being hit particularly hard as they need to use more of their income to cover these costs. \u201cThe benefits freeze was a policy introduced at a time of zero inflation. The Government should help people in poverty by ending the freeze and keeping benefits in line with the rising cost of living.\u201d Mark Carney needs to give his letter to Philip Hammond plenty of attention, as parliament\u2019s Treasury committee are planning to grill him about it next year. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, says: \u201cInflation rising faster than earnings is squeezing household finances, driven in part by rising prices for household essentials such as food and transport. \u201cThe Governor will now have to write to the Chancellor to explain why the Bank has missed its inflation target by more than one per cent, and what action the MPC intends to take. \u201cThe Treasury Committee will scrutinise that letter in its regular hearings with the Bank.\u201d The TUC have created a useful, and frankly depressing, chart showing how food prices have risen over the last year. Disappointingly, we must wait until February 2018 to see Mark Carney\u2019s letter to Philip Hammond explaining why inflation has missed the government\u2019s 2% target. But how can the Bank of England governor defend this failure? Craig Inches, Head of Short Rates and Cash at Royal London Asset Management, thinks Carney should come out fighting: \u201cWith Brexit uncertainty still weighing heavy on the Bank\u2019s forecasts, we think Mr Carney\u2019s words are much more likely to be a robust defence of the Bank\u2019s existing position than any plea to the Chancellor to forgive the MPC for its sins in allowing inflation to run away with itself.\u201d Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG, reckons the Bank of England will feel justified in having raised interest rates last month: \u201cConsumer prices rose relatively strongly in November, bringing inflation to 3.1% from a year earlier, and requiring the Governor of the Bank of England to write a letter to the Chancellor explaining the divergence of over 1 per cent from the inflation target. The rise is likely to embolden earlier actions by the Monetary Policy Committee to raise rates for the first time in over ten years last month. Economist Shaun Richards argues that Carney actually caused the jump in inflation, by easing monetary policy after the Brexit vote: Gavin Jackson of the Financial Times thinks Carney should simply blame the exchange rate: Edmund Greaves of Moneywise thinks the whole practice is rather outdated: Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, argues the Conservative government must take the blame for allowing wage growth to lag behind inflation. Dows says: \u201cToday\u2019s rise in inflation to its highest level in over five-and-half years is extremely concerning, and once again reveals that after seven years of Tory economic failure, this Government has no answers to the problem of wages continuing to fail to keep up with prices. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that there will be millions of working families who will be struggling this Christmas already as a direct result of government policies such as the benefits freeze and the public sector pay cap; this is a further reminder of just how bad this double whammy of rising prices and Tory austerity policies will be this month for them. \u201cThe next Labour government will ensure working people\u2019s living standards are protected with a Real Living Wage of \u00a310 per hour, ending the public sector pay cap, and by building a high wage, high skill economy that works for the many, not the few.\u201d The UK\u2019s financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, says he understands that Britons are suffering from rising inflation: \u201cInflation is expected to fall over the coming year, but I recognise families are feeling a squeeze now. We are determined to help, which is why the Autumn Budget cut income tax, boosted basic pay by more than inflation and froze alcohol and fuel duties\u201d The pound initially jumped when the inflation figures were released, as foreign exchange traders swiftly calculated that it made an interest rate rise more likely. But that effect didn\u2019t last long. Sterling is now down around 0.15% against the US dollar and the euro. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says City traders are focusing on Brexit again. In particular, comments from European Parliament chief Guy Verhofstadt criticising UK Brexit secretary David Davis: \u201cSterling\u2019s gains from the release were extremely short lived, and the pound is now once again under pressure after Guy Verhofstadt made comments about David Davis scoring an \u201cown goal\u201d on the Brexit deal. The last hour of price action demonstrates quite clearly that for sterling, Brexit is still the only game in town.\u201d Britain\u2019s inflation squeeze may actually intensify over the festive period, warns Ben Edwards, Portfolio Manager at investment giant BlackRock: UK households may have to continue to endure higher costs in some segments over Christmas particularly as food retailers continue to pass on higher producer prices and airfares take their normal seasonal trip north. But Edwards also predicts that inflation will \u2018drift lower\u201d in 2018. That\u2019s partly because the impact of the weak pound will eventually drop out of the data (as inflation compares today\u2019s prices against the same items a year ago). There\u2019s little chance of UK wages catching up with inflation in the next few months, warns Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. Sentance also blames the weak pound for pushing up the cost of living, saying: The fall in sterling since the Brexit vote continues to push up the prices of imported goods and the strength of the global economy is also contributing to upward pressure on food and energy prices. \u201cWe are probably close to the peak for inflation now, but it will only fall back gradually next year. That means price rises will continue to run ahead of pay growth in the first half of 2018 - continuing the squeeze on real incomes and consumer spending. That is likely to continue to act as a dampener on economic growth in the next few quarters. With inflation rising, shoppers need to be particularly savvy this Christmas, warns Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk. She says people should pay particular attention to rising food costs, or risk a nasty shock at the till. With inflation now at a 6 year high there\u2019s no escaping the fact the luxury of low inflation is over. \u201cThe cost of food, non alcoholic beverages, transport and fun activities are creeping up so if you\u2019re not careful your household finances could be stretched. \u201cFor many of us prices are rising faster than our wages and we\u2019re in one of the most expensive times of year so budgeting is the key to beating the squeeze on your wallet. Digging into the inflation report, you can see that the cost of bread has jumped by 5.3% in the last year. Butter is up by over 21% - enough to make any late-breakfasting readers splutter over their toast. Imported lamb has risen by over 12% in the last year (compared to just 3.2% for home-reared animals), and fresh fish is 11.2% more expensive than in November 2016. Coffee was 10% more expensive than a year ago, but tea prices were virtually flat, according to the ONS\u2019s data (online here). Here\u2019s more detail (the final column shows the change in pricing over the last 12 months; alongside is the monthly change) This latest rise in inflation shows that Britain is still suffering from the plunge in the pound after the Brexit vote in June 2016. As Maike Currie of Fidelity puts it: Just two years ago, Mark Carney was writing his fourth letter to former Chancellor, George Osborne to explain why prices were in deflationary territory. But in the past year, British households have suffered an ongoing pinch on their spending power since sterling\u2019s Brexit-induced slum Channel 4\u2019s Siobhan Kennedy also blames the weak pound for driving up the cost of imports such as oil. The jump in the cost of food and fuel in the last year will hit the eldest and most vulnerable particularly hard, says Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. Today\u2019s inflation figures shows that food and non-alcoholic drink prices have jumped by 4.2% in the last 12 months. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says this will hurt families this Christmas. \u201cChristmas dinner is going to be a lot more expensive this year. Food prices have gone up at twice the rate of wages. \u201cThe government is failing to deal with Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. Working people need a pay rise. They shouldn\u2019t have to worry about putting the turkey on the table.\u201d The Bank of England won\u2019t be happy to see inflation over 3% either: The jump in UK inflation in November is a nasty shock for City economists, who had hoped that it might have peaked in October (at 3.0%). Aberdeen Standard Investments Chief Economist Lucy O\u2019Carroll explains: \u201cThis is slightly higher than expected and will prompt a letter from Bank of England Governor Carney to the Chancellor, explaining why inflation has overshot its target by this margin and what the Bank will do about it. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that inflation is now close to its peak. But some of the latest surveys suggest that service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall. So this could encourage the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates (they\u2019re currently just 0.5%). O\u2019Carroll adds: The Bank of England has a tricky tightrope to walk. Too much inflation could threaten the Bank\u2019s credibility and therefore its grip on the economy. But they need to keep consumer spending, the engine of the UK economy, chugging along too. If inflation keeps creeping up, or remains elevated, then the chances of the engine sputtering rise incrementally.\u201d Britain\u2019s inflation rate has been driven up to 3.1% by transport costs, food, and recreational spending (such as computer games): This charts shows the details: Breaking! UK inflation has hit its highest level in almost six years, as Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze continues to bite. The consumer prices index rose by 3.1% in the 12 months to November, the highest level since March 2012. Air fares were the biggest factor behind the jump, according to the Office for National Statistics, along with recreational and cultural goods and services such as computer games. With UK earnings only rising by around 2.1% to 2.2% in recent months, this means households are still suffering falling real wages in the run-up to Christmas. This will also force Bank of England governor Mark Carney to write a letter to chancellor Philip Hammond to explain why inflation isn\u2019t close to its 2% target. More to follow! Talk about bad timing, eh? Ineos only took ownership of the Forties pipeline from BP in late October. The discovery a crack in the pipe must be a nasty shock to the company\u2019s management, and might trigger a heated conversation with BP HQ. Still, buyer beware and all that.... Tim Crotty, director of INEOS, is discussing the pipeline crack on Bloomberg TV now. Crotty explains that the crack is five or six inches long, having widened over the weekend. It simply isn\u2019t possible to put a clamp over this section (similar to a bike inner tube puncture repair), so pipe-owner Ineos must now fabricate a new section and carry out a replacement. Crotty says that the shutdown is the safest option, both for its own workers and families who live near the pipeline. In a few days, Ineos should know exactly how long the pipeline will be closed for, but it will probably be two or three weeks. The pipeline normally carries 450,000 barrels of oil per day, so shippers must now find alternative arrangements to get crude to refineries, Crotty explains. He\u2019s confident that the UK won\u2019t run short of oil. However, he also confirms that oil rigs that use the Forties platform are being badly affected (as they can\u2019t get their crude to shore by other means). This is \u201cvery expensive for Ineos\u201d and also its suppliers, Crotty adds, so the repair will happen as quickly (and safely) as possible. The cost of wholesale gas in the UK has jumped by almost 6% this morning, reports Reuters: BRITISH WHOLESALE WITHIN-DAY GAS PRICE NOW RISING 5.9 PERCENT TO 72.00 PENCE PER THERM The impact of the Forties pipeline shutdown is \u2018rippling through\u2019 world energy markets, says Bloomberg. That\u2019s because the North Sea is a major oil supplier, and also because Brent crude is a key benchmark of energy prices. They explain: The U.K. link is critical because flows through it make up the single largest constituent part of so-called Dated Brent crude, which helps settle more than half the world\u2019s physical oil prices. It feeds the Hound Point export terminal near Edinburgh in Scotland and handles supplies from over 80 fields, and the shutdown forced Apache Corp.to suspend operations at its nearby Forties asset. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a supply disruption because it\u2019s more significant as a price maker,\u201d said Olivier Jakob, an analyst at Petromatrix GmbH who\u2019s based near Zug in Switzerland. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing which is the volume of oil which is lost, but it\u2019s also that it\u2019s a key price benchmark.\u201d Reuters\u2019 Alex Lawler reckons this is the first complete shutdown of the Forties pipe in around six years: But it could be even worse, points out Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets The UK government has insisted that oil supplies won\u2019t be affected by the Forties pipeline shutdown. A spokeswoman said: \u201cThere is no security of supply issue for fuel or gas supplies as a result of the repairs needed to the Forties pipeline. The government will continue to liaise with industry operators to monitor the situation to ensure repairs are undertaken as quickly as possible.\u201d But Martin Baccardax of financial news site The Street isn\u2019t convinced: The gap between Brent crude and US oil (WTI) has now widened to over $7 per barrel, a level last seen in August 2015, say analysts. This shows that \u201csupply disruptions can no longer be ignored in tight markets\u201d, says Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM. Here\u2019s energy correspondent Adam Vaughan on the Forties pipeline outage Fiona Legate, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System, even if only temporarily, would have wide-reaching implications the UK oil and gas industry. Apache, a Texas-based company with operations in the North Sea, said it had ceased production as a result. The Health and Safety Executive said: \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation, as we have since we were made aware of the issues with the pipeline.\u201d The shutdown will be a serious blow for Ineos, which only completed its \u00a3200m purchase of the pipeline system from BP at the end of October. The company had said that it was now the only UK company with refinery and petrochemical assets that were integrated in the North Sea, and would serve as a platform for more investments in the region. The cost of Brent crude oil has hit its highest level since June 2015, after one of Britain\u2019s most important oil pipelines was unexpectedly shut. A \u2018hairline\u2019 crack has been discovered in the Forties pipeline, which carries crude from the North Sea oil to Grangemouth in Scotland. Its operators, INEOS, have been forced to suspend pumping while they try to fix the problem, which is overland near Netherley, south of Aberdeen. The shutdown could last three weeks -- just as Britain enters a period of rather cold and frosty weather. More than 80 platforms use the Forties pipeline, so may have to pause production while Ineos tackles the problem, which was detected after a small seepage of oil was spotted. The news has sent Brent spiking to a new 2.5 year high of $65.70 per barrel, as analysts warned that the UK\u2019s energy industry could be seriously affected by the outage. That could push up the cost of heating and petrol in Britain - and potentially drive inflation even higher.... More to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze will be in focus again this morning, when November\u2019s inflation data is released. Prices are likely to have jumped by around 3% over the last 12 months, matching October\u2019s figure, and meaning that inflation is still accelerating ahead of wage growth (which is around 2.1% at present). Bad news for families in the run-up to Christmas. There\u2019s even a chance that higher petrol prices will have driven the Consumer Prices Index up to 3.1%, which would be a new five-year high. That would force Bank of England governor Mark Carney to write a letter to chancellor Philip Hammond explaining why inflation is racing over the BoE\u2019s 2% target. The Office for National Statistics will also release its latest house price figures. In previous months they\u2019ve shown a slowdown in London, as the rest of the country catches up with the capital. We\u2019ll also keep an eye on bitcoin, after the cryptocurrency\u2019s debut on the futures market yesterday.

The group, which delivered goods to 90,000 grocery and convenience stores, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and the Costcutter chain, called in administrators last month, resulting in 2,500 immediate redundancies. P&amp;H had been scrambling to shore up its finances since the spring amid a shake-out in the grocery wholesale market. Tesco won provisional approval of its takeover of Booker last month, while the Co-op\u2019s buyout of Nisa recently won the backing of shareholders and it has now taken on distribution to the Costcutter chain. The Guardian also uncovered that P&amp;H directors, former directors and other shareholders had extracted about \u00a370m in cash from the grocery wholesaler over the past nine years despite ongoing losses. Matthew Callaghan, a joint administrator and PricewaterhouseCoopers partner, said the team had hoped to find a buyer for P&amp;H\u2019s businesses, which sell confectionary and drinks direct from vans to convenience stores. He said there had been interest from potential buyers but no successful deal, resulting in another round of redundancies. He said: \u201cWe will be working with those being made redundant, as we have with those made redundant previously, to assist and provide support where possible.\u201d Mark Todd, a national officer for the Usdaw union, said: \u201cOur members are devastated that administrators have not been able to find a buyer for the Palmer &amp; Harvey van delivery business, particularly as these redundancies fall just before Christmas.\u201d About 450 people are still left in the remaining businesses at P&amp;H. The P&amp;H job losses come as administrators for the furniture chain Multiyork said they would be making 112 people redundant and beginning a wind-down process after failing to find a buyer. The roles are all at the group\u2019s head office in Thetford, Norfolk, while its 50 stores will continue to trade. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, the joint administrator, said some offers had been made for the business but \u201cthey were not at a level that either produced an acceptable outcome for the company\u2019s stakeholders or could guarantee the future stability of the business\u201d. \u201cWe will continue efforts to sell all \u2013 or parts of \u2013 the business; but during this period of managed wind-down, the process of selling in-store display items and other business assets will begin.

    "webTitle": "Europe's biggest mall owner buys Westfield for $25bn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s biggest commercial property company is to buy Westfield, the Australian company behind the UK\u2019s two highest-earning shopping centres, in a $25bn (\u00a319bn) deal that will create the world\u2019s largest mall operator. Unibail-Rodamco of France, which owns Forum des Halles in Paris, plans to roll out Westfield centres in Europe and the US. The Lowy family, Westfield\u2019s biggest shareholder, is selling its 9.5% stake for a mixture of cash and Unibail shares. The planned tie-up comes as the growing number of people buying items online, fuelled by Amazon, forces shopping centre operators to focus on their best assets. Jaap Tonckens, Unibail-Rodamco\u2019s chief financial officer, said shopping centres still had a future. \u201cEspecially younger people do their research on their phones and then go to malls to get what they want and to hang out with their friends and have a meal ... You are talking about people wanting an experience,\u201d he told Bloomberg. Many retailers are cutting shop-floor space and focusing their property portfolios on the most popular centres as consumers increasingly have fewer reasons to visit a store. Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and Toys R Us have announced plans to close stores, while the collapse of BHS last year left shops empty. Rents in premium shopping centres are holding up or rising, while less popular centres and some high streets are struggling. New or significantly refurbished UK shopping centres accounted for 63% of leasing transactions in the 12 months to June, according to the property advisory company Cushman &amp; Wakefield. In the US, where the majority of Westfield\u2019s shopping centres are located, there is a bigger shake-out under way. Of about 1,200 across the country, less than half are expected to be in operation five years from now. Years of underinvestment in older centres combined with overexpansion in the face of the online shopping boom is taking its toll. Unibail\u2019s takeover of Westfield comes after Hammerson, which owns Birmingham\u2019s Bullring shopping centre, agreed to buy Intu, the company behind Manchester\u2019s Trafford centre, in a \u00a33.4bn deal last week that will create Britain\u2019s biggest property company worth \u00a321bn. Westfield runs shopping centres in White City, west London, and Stratford, east London. It has plans to build a third centre in Croydon, south London. The company\u2019s portfolio of 35 centres includes sites in Italy, the US and Australia. Unibail runs 69 shopping centres in 11 EU countries but lacks a UK or US presence. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said: \u201cThe deal would plug the last remaining holes in Unibail-Rodamco\u2019s European dominant positioning \u2013 now also UK and Italy \u2013 and give the group access to a high-quality portfolio in the US.\u201d Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at the retail consultancy GlobalData said the Westfield takeover would enable Unibail to benefit from expected growth of 7.2% in the UK super-mall market over the next five years to \u00a312.3bn. \u201cWith consumers favouring destination shopping locations which appeal to shoppers\u2019 desire for a social and lifestyle experience, and Westfield setting the bar in terms of focus on overall experience, this is a beneficial move,\u201d she said. Both company boards unanimously recommended the deal. Frank Lowy, the Westfield chairman and co-founder, recently received a knighthood. He and his co-chief executive sons, Steven and Peter, will step down, but Lowy will chair an advisory board for the new company. The Westfield business empire grew out of a delicatessen and later a shopping centre founded in Sydney in the 1950s by Lowy, now one of Australia\u2019s richest men, and the late John Saunders, both immigrants from Hungary who survived the Holocaust.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British households are taking on the highest levels of fresh mortgage debt since the beginning of 2008, spurred by low interest rates from the Bank of England, even as the proportion of first-time buyers dwindles. Banks extended new mortgage commitments to borrowers worth \u00a369.6bn in the three months to the end of September, an increase of 14% on the same period in 2016 and the highest amount recorded over a three-month period since the start of 2008, official figures from Threadneedle Street show. The figures come after John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, launched a report on Monday warning that banks are becoming increasingly engaged in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d on mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans that has worrying parallels to years before the financial crisis. The report by GFC Economics on behalf of the Labour party said banks had diverted resources away from financing small businesses in favour of selling mortgages. The boom was driven by people remortgaging their homes in order to lock in cheap deals before the Bank raised the cost of borrowing in November for the first time in a decade. There was almost \u00a31.4tn of mortgage debt outstanding at the end of September, up 4.1% on the same point a year ago. Philip Shaw, the chief economist at Investec, said consumers were increasingly buying fixed-rate mortgages, \u201clighting a fire\u201d under the total value of new lending. He said consumers were becoming savvier about picking cheap deals before the Bank raises interest rates further and to avoid more expensive standard variable rate mortgages. Government ministers are likely to be embarrassed by the lending figures, which show the proportion of mortgages extended to first-time buyers fell over the period, despite their efforts to encourage more young people to get on the housing ladder with help-to-buy loan support. The share of new lending to first-time buyers fell by one percentage point to stand at 21% of the overall market. Philip Hammond was subjected to sharp criticism following the budget last month when analysis from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility showed steps to scrap stamp duty for most first-time buyers would push up house prices and only help 3,500 people buy a home. There was positive news for ministers seeking to curb the buy-to-let lending market after a boom in recent years, with the number of mortgages extended to landlords at its lowest level for four years. The figures also shine a light on cutthroat lending practices among banks, driven to offering more competitive rates by more lenders entering the market. Several small banks such as Aldermore and Atom Bank have started selling mortgages in recent years, while major banks such as RBS have also begun focusing more on home loans, viewing them as safer ways to make money than riskier investment banking. The Bank said the proportion of new loans extended at less than 2% above its base rate \u2013 which rose from 0.25% to 0.5% last month \u2013 now accounts for 65.1% of fresh loans sold to consumers, after a steady increase over the past year. However, the central bank will take comfort from figures showing how few people have slipped into arrears, with the lowest number of people falling behind on their monthly payments since at least the beginning of 2007. There was also a fall in the proportion of high loan-to-value mortgages, which are typically less risky for banks and easier for consumers to keep up with repayments. Threadneedle Street revealed last month that losses on mortgage lending would reach \u00a317bn in the event of a severe economic shock, as part of its annual health check of the financial system. But it said banks would continue to function despite these heavy losses forecast in the stress test scenario, which included a 4.7% fall in UK GDP, a 33% drop in house prices, interest rates rising to 4% and a 27% fall in the pound. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Why is Four Seasons Health Care, the country\u2019s largest care homes operator, in financial difficulty? Why is the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, having to prod and cajole creditors to agree a standstill on debt repayments to prevent the business falling into administration? Why is this crisis happening only six years after the failure of Southern Cross, which at the time was the biggest company in the industry? One could point to forces that are well-known. Fees are under pressure because local authorities\u2019 social care budgets have been squeezed; overheads have been forced up by increases in the national minimum wage; and, at the margin, Brexit complicates staffing requirements. Those factors are real but let\u2019s not lose sight of the ingredient at the centre of the Four Seasons affair. It\u2019s debt \u2013 too much of it. Terra Firma, Guy Hands\u2019 private equity firm, over-paid for the business in 2012 and loaded up with leverage. At heart, this is an old-fashioned tale of financial engineering gone wrong. Southern Cross came from the same unlovely stable \u2013 in that case, the financial error was addiction to fancy sale-and-leaseback property deals. Terra Firma would be correct to plead that its debt structure was more conservative than those imposed on Four Seasons by previous owners, notably the Royal Bank of Scotland. But it\u2019s not much of a boast. Hands\u2019 crew paid \u00a3825m for Four Seasons, of which about \u00a3500m was borrowed money. Look at the punishing interest payments it had to agree to find takers for the debt. There are \u00a3175m-worth of junior unsecured notes today that carry a coupon of 12.25%, and the \u00a3350m-worth of senior notes pledge to pay the bearer interest at 8.25% a year. Bond investors spotted at the outset that this was a high-risk deal in a sector with a history of financial accidents. What was Hands thinking? He thought Four Seasons was in his investment \u201csweet spot\u201d, he wrote in a letter in 2014 to the Economist, which had accused him of being in too much of a hurry after his big flop with music publisher EMI. Four Seasons, said Hands, was \u201casset-backed, in an essential industry and in need of fundamental change\u201d. Well, it was asset-backed only up to a point: 185 out of 343 homes are leasehold properties. But those other long-term virtues could only shine if the debt structure allowed room to manage through the lean years. Four Seasons\u2019 slow march towards crisis has been flagged for months \u2013 indeed, the first mini-crisis came at the end of 2014. To his credit, Hands tried to keep the financial show on the road with two extra \u00a350m injections of capital. And, as far as one can tell, he has honoured his promises to invest in the business. In the end, though, Four Seasons has arrived at a point where it is struggling to meet a \u00a326m debt interest payment due on Friday. H/2 Capital Partners, the US hedge fund that has bought up majority positions in both classes of debt, holds the aces. It will probably clean up at the expense of Terra Firma since, with a gentler debt structure, Four Seasons is a good business. H/2 should still do the decent thing and get the financial restructuring underway as soon as possible. There is no need for an administration that could cause problems for the regulator and local authorities. Get on with it. The rest of us, though, can only look at the current standoff and shake our heads. The UK is awash with long-term pension fund money that would happily build and own care homes for modest real returns. Instead, we have a high-stakes financial game in which players aim for fatter rewards. The result, in this case, is that control of the biggest care homes operator in the land will probably pass from a private equity outfit that made a rotten bet on financial leverage to an opportunistic US hedge fund that hunts for junk bonds to buy at a discount. It\u2019s a shocking way to fund provision of care homes for the elderly. What happened to the old bank? It\u2019s a triumph \u2013 sort of. HSBC has avoided the threat of prosecution from US authorities over the great Mexican and Colombian money-laundering scandal that was exposed half a decade ago. The US Department of Justice monitor who has been embedded in the bank since 2013 has deemed HSBC to be much improved. In truth, something would have gone seriously wrong if HSBC hadn\u2019t received a bill of health. The bank has thrown money and thousands of staff at overhauling compliance systems. Stuart Gulliver, soon to depart as chief executive, has also extracted the bank from \u201chigh-risk\u201d countries such as Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras. Those clean-up actions were a correct response to the crisis. But, amid their relief at the DoJ\u2019s move, HSBC investors will think of what might have been. A quarter of a century ago, this was the conservative bank that kept its nose clean. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

But it\u2019s not much of a boast.</p> <p>Hands\u2019 crew paid \u00a3825m for Four Seasons, of which about \u00a3500m was borrowed money. Look at the punishing interest payments it had to agree to find takers for the debt. There are \u00a3175m-worth of junior unsecured notes today that carry a coupon of 12.25%, and the \u00a3350m-worth of senior notes pledge to pay the bearer interest at 8.25% a year. Bond investors spotted at the outset that this was a high-risk deal in a sector with a history of financial accidents.</p> <p>What was Hands thinking? He thought Four Seasons was in his investment \u201csweet spot\u201d, he wrote <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21637346-letter-guy-hands\">in a letter in 2014 to the Economist</a>, which had accused him of being in too much of a hurry after his big flop with music publisher EMI. Four Seasons, said Hands, was \u201casset-backed, in an essential industry and in need of fundamental change\u201d.</p> <p>Well, it was asset-backed only up to a point: 185 out of 343 homes are leasehold properties. But those other long-term virtues could only shine if the debt structure allowed room to manage through the lean years. Four Seasons\u2019 slow march towards crisis has been flagged for months \u2013 indeed, the first mini-crisis came at the end of 2014.</p> <p>To his credit, Hands tried to keep the financial show on the road with two extra \u00a350m injections of capital. And, as far as one can tell, he has honoured his promises to invest in the business. In the end, though, Four Seasons has arrived at a point where it is struggling to meet a \u00a326m debt interest payment due on Friday. H/2 Capital Partners, the US hedge fund that has bought up majority positions in both classes of debt, holds the aces. It will probably clean up at the expense of Terra Firma since, with a gentler debt structure, Four Seasons is a good business.</p> <p>H/2 should still do the decent thing and get the financial restructuring underway as soon as possible. There is no need for an administration that could cause problems for the regulator and local authorities. Get on with it.</p> <p>The rest of us, though, can only look at the current standoff and shake our heads. The UK is awash with long-term pension fund money that would happily build and own care homes for modest real returns. Instead, we have a high-stakes financial game in which players aim for fatter rewards.</p> <p>The result, in this case, is that control of the biggest care homes operator in the land will probably pass from a private equity outfit that made a rotten bet on financial leverage to an opportunistic US hedge fund that hunts for junk bonds to buy at a discount. It\u2019s a shocking way to fund provision of care homes for the elderly.</p> <h2>What happened to the old bank?</h2> <p>It\u2019s a triumph \u2013 sort of. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/11/hsbc-prosecution-threat-us-money-laundering\">HSBC has avoided the threat of prosecution</a> from US authorities over the great Mexican and Colombian money-laundering scandal that was exposed half a decade ago. The US Department of Justice monitor who has been embedded in the bank since 2013 has deemed HSBC to be much improved.</p> <p>In truth, something would have gone seriously wrong if HSBC hadn\u2019t received a bill of health. The bank has thrown money and thousands of staff at overhauling compliance systems. Stuart Gulliver, soon to depart as chief executive, has also extracted the bank from \u201chigh-risk\u201d countries such as Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras.</p> <p>Those clean-up actions were a correct response to the crisis. But, amid their relief at the DoJ\u2019s move, HSBC investors will think of what might have been. A quarter of a century ago, this was the conservative bank that kept its nose clean.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers in the UK will spend a record \u00a34.2bn on food and drink in the final week before Christmas, shrugging off higher prices caused by the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. Total spending on festive feasts will be up by 3.6%, with Friday 22 December the busiest day as families prepare for the big day, according to analysts at Nielsen. \u201cWith Christmas Day falling on a Monday, people are likely to delay their big Christmas shop until the final week and we expect nearly all shoppers will visit a grocery retailer at least twice that week,\u201d said Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer insight. He said only a third of shoppers were planning to spend less on food and drink this year. Friday 22 December is on course to be the UK\u2019s highest-spending food shopping day ever, say analysts at Kantar Worldpanel. But the 3.6% rise in sales predicted by Nielsen for the final week before Christmas Day only matches the level of grocery price inflation measured by analysts at Kantar in its latest three-monthly shopping survey. Rises in the price of butter, fish and fresh pork pushed inflation up to the highest level since 2013 in the three months to 3 December up from 3.4% recorded in the 12 weeks to 5 November. The market was also lifted by sales of expensive spirits, especially gin and whisky, sales of which rose by 26% and 10% respectively. British households are facing the biggest squeeze on living standards since records began, according to the Resolution Foundation, amid rising inflation partly resulting from the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote. The UK\u2019s cheapest supermarket Christmas dinner will cost 18% more than it did last year, as the impact of inflation and Brexit-related commodity costs is felt. Cutbacks in spending on clothing and household goods are expected to result in a 0.1% dip in total UK spending during the key shopping period of November and December. That would be the first fall in Christmas spending since 2012. The four biggest supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 lost ground compared with the same period last year as they increased sales by less than the total 3.1% for the grocery market in the three months to 3 December, according to Kantar. In contrast, the discounter Aldi appears to be benefiting from the squeeze on shoppers\u2019 budgets. The German chain stepped up its pace of growth to 15.1% in the latest quarter compared with 13.1% reported last month. Kantar said Aldi\u2019s ready meals and desserts were helping boost its growth with sales up 40% over the period. Shoppers are also snapping up the chain\u2019s premium Specially Selected ranges, lifting sales by 25% over the 12 weeks. Lidl was the next fastest growing chain, with sales up 14.5% over the period. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration\u2019s zeal for environmental rollbacks has enabled it to fulfill almost all of the top priorities in a \u201cwishlist\u201d drawn up by the American Petroleum Institute (API), the leading lobby group for US oil and gas companies. In a document called \u201ccomments on specific regulations\u201d sent to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May, API highlighted eight key changes it wanted to ease the regulation of air and water pollution. An analysis shows that the EPA has now so far either partially or wholly delivered on six out of these eight key demands within the first year of the Trump administration, which solicited input on government rules from a number of trade groups. This comes as the Guardian and the Center for Public Integrity publish an investigation into the way the oil lobby has worked for decades to influence US government policy \u2013 and is tightening its hold. Earlier this year a letter penned by Howard Feldman, senior director of regulatory affairs at API, accompanied the lobby group\u2019s wish list for government, and it stated that fossil fuel companies are thriving \u201cdespite the unprecedented level of federal regulatory actions targeting our industry\u201d. Feldman called for the federal government to alter regulations in a way that \u201cpromotes access to domestic oil and natural gas resources, streamlined permitting and cost-effective regulations\u201d. The letter is addressed to Samantha Dravis, an EPA associate administrator who previously held a senior role at the Republican Attorneys General Association and was counsel to Freedom Partners, one of the groups in the Koch brothers network. The 25-page list of API\u2019s suggested regulatory changes places particular emphasis on eight key demands that peel away standards primarily imposed under Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The EPA\u2019s administrator, Scott Pruitt, previously a harsh critic of the agency who has pledged to rein in its \u201cout of control, anti-energy agenda\u201d, has overseen the delay or repeal moves in line with six of API\u2019s eight highest priorities. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that energy lobbyists are calling the shots in this administration, which has been all too willing to roll back public health protections,\u201d said Jeremy Symons, vice-president of Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cAnyone who doubts that can just look at their record.\u201d On March 22, Pruitt met with API executives at the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC . Less than a month later, Pruitt wrote to Feldman, as well as three other oil and gas industry representatives, to tell them he was temporarily suspending regulations that curb leaks from drilling operations while the EPA reconsiders the rule. In June, the EPA proposed a two-year pause to the rule, which was drawn up under the Obama administration in 2016 and aimed to reduce \u201cfugitive\u201d emissions such as methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In July, a federal court blocked the attempted suspension of the rule. The EPA has fared better in fulfilling other top API priorities. In June, Pruitt signed a two-year delay to regulations designed to improve the safety of chemical facilities. API argued that the rule, which followed several disastrous incidents at chemical plants, would be burdensome and do little to improve safety. API said the EPA \u201cshould reverse\u201d a separate regulation requiring power plants to follow air pollution rules when they are starting up, shutting down or undergoing maintenance. Pruitt, who previously sued the EPA to halt the rule, is now reassessing it. Implementation of new standards to reduce ozone, a pollutant that helps form smog, was delayed by a year at Pruitt\u2019s behest in June, a month after the API called for the EPA to reconsider the rule. Several states and health groups have launched legal action against the EPA after it missed a deadline to designate which areas of the country are failing to meet the tightened standards on smog. API also secured an early victory in February, when Donald Trump issued an executive order to scrap the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d rule, which was put in place under the Obama administration to protect streams and rivers that provide drinking water to around a third of Americans. The regulation has been opposed by some farmers and owners of golf courses and industrial plants as being too stringent. Several of API\u2019s lower priority proposals have also been fulfilled, with Pruitt introducing new rules for members of the EPA\u2019s scientific boards which open the way for more industry involvement and, separately, deciding to not introduce new financial responsibility requirements that API feared may have impacted the petroleum industry. \u201cPruitt and his team have no shame,\u201d said Liz Purchia Gannon, former head of communications at the EPA under the Obama administration. \u201cThey have made it clear from the start that oil, gas and coal industries trump science, the American people and public health and environmental organizations. \u201cWhat we can see from his schedule is an alarming pattern of meeting with special interest groups before making policy decisions favoring their bottom line at the expense of Americans\u2019 health and the environment.\u201d When contacted for comment, the API said it was happy for its previous statements to speak for themselves. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.",

The EPA\u2019s administrator, Scott Pruitt, previously a harsh critic of the agency who has pledged to rein in its \u201cout of control, anti-energy agenda\u201d, has overseen the delay or repeal moves in line with six of API\u2019s eight highest priorities.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question that energy lobbyists are calling the shots in this administration, which has been all too willing to roll back public health protections,\u201d said Jeremy Symons, vice-president of Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cAnyone who doubts that can just look at their record.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Pruitt and his team have made it clear that oil, gas and coal industries trump science</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Liz Purchia Gannon, former EPA communications head</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>On March 22, Pruitt met with API executives at the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC . Less than a month later, Pruitt <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-04/documents/oil_and_gas_fugitive_emissions_monitoring_reconsideration_4_18_2017.pdf\">wrote</a> to Feldman, as well as three other oil and gas industry representatives, to tell them he was temporarily suspending regulations that curb leaks from drilling operations while the EPA reconsiders the rule.</p> \n<p>In June, the EPA <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/06/16/2017-12698/oil-and-natural-gas-sector-emission-standards-for-new-reconstructed-and-modified-sources-stay-of\">proposed</a> a two-year pause to the rule, which was drawn up under the Obama administration in 2016 and aimed to reduce \u201cfugitive\u201d emissions such as methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In July, a federal court blocked the attempted suspension of the rule.</p> \n<p>The EPA has fared better in fulfilling other top API priorities. In June, Pruitt signed a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/rmp/final-amendments-risk-management-program-rmp-rule\">two-year delay to regulations</a> designed to improve the safety of chemical facilities. API argued that the rule, which followed several disastrous incidents at chemical plants, would be burdensome and do little to improve safety.</p> \n<p>API said the EPA \u201cshould reverse\u201d a separate regulation requiring power plants to follow air pollution rules when they are starting up, shutting down or undergoing maintenance. Pruitt, who previously sued the EPA to halt the rule, is now <a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/startup-shutdown-malfunction-update-august-8-2017\">reassessing it</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"859a516732003c1f5943dc759a8fc195d3244b20\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/859a516732003c1f5943dc759a8fc195d3244b20/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A depot used to store pipes for the planned Keystone XL oil pipeline in North Dakota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A depot used to store pipes for the planned Keystone XL oil pipeline in North Dakota.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terray Sylvester/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Implementation of new standards to reduce ozone, a pollutant that helps form smog, was <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-extend-deadline-2015-ozone-naaqs-area-designations\">delayed</a> by a year at Pruitt\u2019s behest in June, a month after the API called for the EPA to reconsider the rule.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s employers are the most pessimistic about hiring staff than at any time in five years, underscoring fears over the number of new jobs available as the country prepares to leave the EU. A poll of 2,102 employers across nine different industry sectors found a net balance of just 4% were planning to increase staff levels rather than make cuts in the final months of the year. London and the south east are home to the most pessimistic firms, where the outlook has fallen to 0% and 3% respectively. The survey results from employment agency ManpowerGroup, which are used to track hiring sentiment by the Bank of England and the government, represent a challenge for ministers who have relied on strong levels of job creation in recent years to defend their management of the economy. They also come ahead of official jobs figures on Wednesday. James Hick, the managing director of ManpowerGroup Solutions, said Britain had been hit by a fall in confidence across the country and flatlining hiring in London. \u201cThis makes for a pretty bleak midwinter considering it comes at a time when Brexit talks are on a knife-edge,\u201d he added. Britain\u2019s strong employment growth has been a positive of the economy in recent years and has continued to expand in the 18 months since the Brexit vote. Ahead of the EU referendum, the Treasury predicted that unemployment would rise by more than 500,000 in the next two years, but the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a fall of 182,000 between the July to August period of 2016 and the same three months in 2017. Employment was up by 279,000 over the same period while the jobless rate has fallen to 4.3%, its lowest since 1975. The latest ONS data provided some signs that the jobs boom has petered out following the slowdown in growth in the first half of 2017. The number of people in work over the three months to September fell by 14,000 \u2013 the first decline since April 2013. In its latest forecast, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected the unemployment rate to edge up to 4.4% in 2019 and to 4.6% in 2020. A combination of sluggish growth and rising employment has delivered weak productivity, but the most recent figures from the ONS found that output per hour worked rose by 0.9% between the second and third quarters of 2017. ManpowerGroup said there were signs of skills shortages in certain sectors, including for freight drivers where the transport industry has around 52,000 vacancies. This has driven up wages in the sector, with some firms offering bonuses and paying premiums of up to 20% on their standard rates in order to attract new workers. The shortage has also boosted the Midlands to become the UK\u2019s hiring hotspot, centred on what Manpower called the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d for the freight industry stretching from Northampton to Milton Keynes and Daventry. Some companies in the sector have been \u201cstockpiling\u201d workers, according to Hick, due to uncertainty over Brexit, by signing them up to permanent contracts ahead of May 2019. The Resolution Foundation thinktank published a report on Tuesday finding that one in 10 of Britain\u2019s workers put in paid overtime last year but only one-fifth of them got the \u201ctime-and-a half\u201d premium for their extra hours. The share of employees working overtime has fallen from 17% in 1997 to 10% in 2016, the thinktank said, adding that the premium paid over wage rates had also shrunk. Half of those doing paid overtime enjoyed a premium of at least 10% last year (down from 61% in 1997), while 20% of those doing overtime got \u201ctime and a half\u201d (down from 25%). \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
