      "bodyText": "Beleaguered cabinet ministers are expected to take steps to ameliorate the impact on the companies hit hardest by a shake-up in business rates that has fuelled a backlash among Conservative MPs. Communities secretary Sajid Javid is likely to join the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in adopting a more empathetic tone about the anger triggered by the decision to revaluate the rates based on updated property prices. The Guardian understands that Javid \u2013 who has been criticised for holidaying in Dubai at the height of the controversy \u2013 will face politicians in the House of Commons on Wednesday, where he is likely to promise to take action to soften its implementation. Javid has discussed the issue with Hammond, and the chancellor is now likely to use March\u2019s budget to lengthen the transitional period for companies that will face an increase in rates. There is also a suggestion that the government could agree to a wholesale review of the system, which levies the tax based on the size of property rather than a companies\u2019 profits, in an attempt to stave off a backbench revolt. Javid and Treasury chief secretary, David Gauke, angered colleagues within their party after sending out a bullish letter that said the shake-up represented the \u201cbiggest ever cut in business rates\u201d. Accusing the media of \u201cdistortions and half-truths\u201d, they further infuriated MPs by attaching an analysis of the new rates that were later said to underestimate the impact by up to 7%. Tories said the pair had also exaggerated how many companies would benefit. Javid\u2019s intervention will follow the Hammond, who told Tory MPs on Monday night that he is in \u201clistening mode\u201d. In the longer term, ministers are likely to attempt to end a loophole that means highly profitable internet companies, such as Amazon, will benefit from cuts while small independent businesses are badly hit. One senior MP accused Javid and Gauke of adopting the attacking language of US president Donald Trump in their attempt to quell the backlash. Grant Shapps claimed that Javid was wrong to put a positive glow on the shake up of business rates. \u201cWhat Sajid needs to do is take control of his officials who are urging him to claim that most businesses will see lower bills,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that this revaluation raises an extra \u00a31bn in tax and that is why this is hurting. \u201cBeing completely upfront about this would be far better than sending out a letter in a Trumpesque-tone blaming the media for higher business rates.\u201d There was sympathy among colleagues for the communities secretary, with some pointing out that he had faced most flack despite it being the Treasury that was in charge of setting business rates. One MP said Hammond now appeared to be \u201criding into the rescue\u201d. Another added: \u201cThe gossip in tea room is the fact that Sajid is being hung out to dry but it is not his fault.\u201d A number of MPs have written to the chancellor and to Javid urging immediate action. Ben Howlett questioned the \u201cincreasingly London-centric nature of economic policy\u201d, claiming some companies in his Bath constituency faced a 12.5% increase in the tax. Anna Soubry revealed that when she was business minister she had urged colleagues to reform the charge or even scrap it completely and raise the money via other means. \u201cBusiness rates are not fair because you have to pay them whether you are making money or not, and they don\u2019t represent your [profit], just what building you are in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could be running a multimillion pound business from relatively small building but pay the same as a shop of the same size employing three people with hugely smaller turnover.\u201d Despite sources strongly suggesting that the government could take action to reduce anger on the party\u2019s backbenches, the Conservative minister Marcus Jones told MPs there was no need for a review because one was carried out in 2015. \u201cThe clear view then, including from the business community, was that they wanted to retain the current system,\u201d he said, during a debate about the local government bill. The Labour and co-op MP Gareth Thomas, who was pushing the minister on the issue, said it was \u201chugely disappointing\u201d that the government rejected calls for a review and accused ministers of having a \u201ctin ear\u201d when it came to concerns. He called for business rate relief for both schools and hospitals warning they were already under \u201csevere financial pressure\u201d. His colleague, Bill Esterson, the shadow business minister, called for a \u201ccomprehensive overhaul\u201d of the entire system. The Liberal Democrats are also attacking the government over the controversy, and have picked out individual companies badly hit including the restaurant featured in the hit television programme, First Dates, which will face a 37% increase in rates \u2013 equivalent to almost \u00a327,000. The iconic nightclub, Fabric, will see its bill rise by slightly more than that. Companies want to see the impact of the revaluation limited but also a change in the rules so that decisions to invest in the property \u2013 for example with new machinery \u2013 are not linked to a further rise in business rates. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was \u201czapping productivity\u201d. \u201cOne of the best things that could be done is to eliminate that perverse incentive,\u201d he said, adding that ministers should also use the budget to \u201cblunt the impact of the revaluation\u201d. Meanwhile the decision by government to release data about Conservative constituencies to MPs has angered Labour politicians. Seema Malhotra has written to Hammond to say she believes it was an abuse of official data and has written to the UK Statistics Authority about it. Counting the cost Bryars and Bryars, Cecil Court, London Tim Bryars, who runs an antique book store near Covent Garden, is facing a 20% increase in his rates bill in the coming two years. \u201cI\u2019ve got to sell quite a lot of books to clear the extra profit required to cover that 20% increase,\u201d said Bryars. \u201cIf the market goes online I think something will be lost \u2026 you can only Google something if you\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d Bryars is particularly irked by the way the revaluation process has benefited online stores at the expense of the high street. \u201cPeople see independent stores closing and think those businesses couldn\u2019t cut it in the modern world because of the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut lots of small businesses are perfectly viable; they just can\u2019t find half their rent again in business rates before all the other expenses. The business rates system probably worked fine in the late 20th century but it is out of date if multinationals like Amazon see their rates bill fall while small independent retailers see theirs rise.\u201d Titanic Brewery, Stoke, Staffordshire Keith Bott and his brother Dave run Titanic Brewery, a small business that owns and operates eight pubs in Staffordshire, and Bott said the increase in rates will cost the business \u201ctens of thousands of pounds\u201d, once a transitional relief period ends in five years. He said the main problem was that rates on pubs were linked to their turnover not property value. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 25% increase in rateable values across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to recognise and understand the issue. Pubs are responsible for 0.5% of turnover of the UK economy but pay 2.8% of business rates.\u201d Rob Davies and Zoe Wood",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a bit rich for the chancellor, now reportedly in \u201clistening mode\u201d on business rates, to signal that he is aware of the challenges the digital economy presents to a property-based tax. That fundamental problem has been voiced for more than a decade and has simply been ignored by government. Amazon and the other big online retailers are no longer modern creations. Philip Hammond, one suspects, will end up inventing various reliefs to try to quell the anger of those small businesses in London facing increases of up to 400%. But something more than a sticking-plaster is required. If not, this toxic row will return every time potential rents \u2013 the basis for establishing rateable values \u2013 are recalculated. There are, of course, no easy alternatives to a tax that raises \u00a328bn a year for councils and the government. We already have a sales tax called VAT and corporation tax applies to profit. As to complaints that firms in London and the south east will suffer the biggest increases, that could be regarded as just given that the capital continues to enjoy the benefits of a lop-sided economy. But it is illogical to impose revaluations in such a jolting fashion. The last adjustment in 2010 was based on rateable values in 2008, so neither Hammond nor Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, should be surprised by the fury. Property values would surely have to continue to play a role in a reformed system if serious sums are to be raised. But a purely property-based approach will only create more distortions and deepen resentment. Hammond, once he has settled on his best short-term fudge, should order a proper study of alternatives and ways to smooth increases. The answer \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 would create losers as well as winners. But a better-designed system that takes account of the changing make-up of the economy must be better than an approach that feels unfair because successive governments have lacked the will to attempt improvement. HSBC under scrutiny as woes continue Congratulations if you bought shares in HSBC this time last year: your investment has risen in value by 50%. So have the legal and regulatory clouds blown away? Is HSBC now enjoying the benefits of all that cost-cutting, restructuring and pivoting to Asia, as the bank insists on describing its strategy? Are shareholders\u2019 dividends rising again? Not exactly. The biggest regulatory bust-ups may have passed but, as ever, there\u2019s something new to worry about at HSBC. The latest entry in the bulging \u201cregulatory matters\u201d file is an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into potential breaches of money-laundering rules. It\u2019s impossible to judge the seriousness of the inquiry from outside, but money-laundering and financial crime are sensitive subjects at HSBC. The US Department of Justice\u2019s monitor is still on the prowl \u2013 a consequence of 2012\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 and his latest update raised \u201ccertain concerns\u201d. The main instruction seems to be: move faster. HSBC can point to an expensive new IT system to combat crime, but it is clear that the monitor\u2019s book is not closed. On the restructuring front, news is better. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver could cite a $1.2bn, or 4%, fall in \u201cadjusted\u201d operating expenses last year, which helps to pay for the heftier compliance costs. On the other hand, revenues (ignoring currency movements) were flat, disappointing the City. Headline pre-tax profits, swamped by write-offs and one-offs, fell by 62% but even at the underlying level the figure was still virtually unchanged at $19bn. The dividend was exactly flat at 0.51 cents a share. That feels better in sterling terms after the pound\u2019s decline, which explains part of the bounce in the share price. A bigger factor is the expectation that interest rates will rise in the US. For well-capitalised HSBC, each quarter-point increase is worth $250m to $300m in net income. Very useful, assuming the US Fed Reserve obliges on the rate front. If not, investors\u2019 excitement around HSBC will be hard to sustain. The UK\u2019s biggest company is still struggling to find growth and the threat of protectionist trade policies is a serious worry. Tuesday\u2019s 6.5% fall in the share price was overdue. BHP shareholders to reap rewards of rebound The mining industry\u2019s new problem is how to distribute the spoils of the rebound in commodity prices. Well played BHP Billiton, which opted to increase its dividend above its promised minimum. That\u2019s a better choice than Rio Tinto\u2019s form of top-up \u2013 a $500m share buy-back. In a feast-or-famine business like mining, dividends beat buybacks every time. Nobody really knows when the commodity cycle will turn again. Share prices that have doubled in a year aren\u2019t obviously bargains.",

The latest entry in the bulging \u201cregulatory matters\u201d file is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/21/hsbc-cuts-pay-of-senior-executives-after-failing-to-combat-financial\">an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into potential breaches of money-laundering rules</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to judge the seriousness of the inquiry from outside, but money-laundering and financial crime are sensitive subjects at HSBC. The US Department of Justice\u2019s monitor is still on the prowl \u2013 a consequence of 2012\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 and his latest update raised \u201ccertain concerns\u201d. The main instruction seems to be: move faster. HSBC can point to an expensive new IT system to combat crime, but it is clear that the monitor\u2019s book is not closed.</p> <p>On the restructuring front, news is better. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver could cite a $1.2bn, or 4%, fall in \u201cadjusted\u201d operating expenses last year, which helps to pay for the heftier compliance costs. On the other hand, revenues (ignoring currency movements) were flat, disappointing the City. Headline pre-tax profits, swamped by write-offs and one-offs, fell by 62% but even at the underlying level the figure was still virtually unchanged at $19bn.</p> <p>The dividend was exactly flat at 0.51 cents a share. That feels better in sterling terms after the pound\u2019s decline, which explains part of the bounce in the share price. A bigger factor is the expectation that interest rates will rise in the US. For well-capitalised HSBC, each quarter-point increase is worth $250m to $300m in net income.</p> <p>Very useful, assuming the US Fed Reserve obliges on the rate front. If not, investors\u2019 excitement around HSBC will be hard to sustain. The UK\u2019s biggest company is still struggling to find growth and the threat of protectionist trade policies is a serious worry. Tuesday\u2019s 6.5% fall in the share price was overdue.</p> <h2>BHP shareholders to reap rewards of rebound</h2> <p>The mining industry\u2019s new problem is how to distribute the spoils of the rebound in commodity prices. Well played BHP Billiton, which opted to increase its dividend above its promised minimum. That\u2019s a better choice than Rio Tinto\u2019s form of top-up \u2013 a $500m share buy-back. In a feast-or-famine business like mining, dividends beat buybacks every time. Nobody really knows when the commodity cycle will turn again. Share prices that have doubled in a year aren\u2019t obviously bargains.</p>",

But badly received results from HSBC have left the FTSE 100 lagging its peers. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.34% or 25.03 points at 7274.83, with HSBC itself knocking nearly 37 points off the leading index Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.18% to 11,967.49 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.49% at 4888.76 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.34% better at 19,043.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.36% higher at 9561.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.43% to 655.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.44% at 20,714 having earlier hit a record 20,757. On that note, it is time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece workers with the communist-aligned labour group, PAME have taken to the streets to protest the prospect of yet more austerity measures, our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Thousands of protestors are marching en masse towards parliament in Syntagma square chanting: \u201cwe are not going to be spectators of our own wretchedness.\u201d The demonstration is one of 40 taking place across Greece in protest over the government\u2019s decision to agree to further talks with creditors in return for up front legislation of more unpopular cost-cutting measures. Addressing the crowd, the communist KKE party leader Dimitris Koutsoumbas said: \u201cWhile the government is writing, directing and playing in this new episode of deceit against the Greek people that has been played a thousand times before, we are here, in the struggle with the working class and the rest of the peoples\u2019 movement, loudly shouting \u201cit cannot go on! \u201cOur people cannot endure new measures against their income, against their and their childrens\u2019 lives. Here lies hope, in the fight, in the struggle, together with the KKE, for a better way to be able to be found for us, for our children. for all of the Greek people.\u201d With far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen gaining ground according to opinion polls, the euro has come under further pressure. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: In a sign of relative weakness, the euro fell against most major currencies despite the upbeat data [showing eurozone growth at a near six year high]. Political risk is clearly trumping economic strength in the currency market. The pound is currently up 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.1817 having climbed as high at \u20ac1.1839. The Greek government has claimed a \u201cdecisive victory\u201d following Monday\u2019s eurogroup announcement that a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d had been reached between creditors and Athens. Helena Smith reports: Amid accusations of crossing its own \u2018red lines\u2019, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led coalition went on the offensive today calling Monday\u2019s euro group a huge success that had ultimately put Greece on the path to economic recovery. \u201cThe position of the Greek government for not a euro more of austerity has been respected and accepted by all,\u201d the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters. \u201cThe demand for \u20ac4.5bn worth of extra measures in 2019 is no longer on the agenda of discussion,\u201d he said adding that upfront legislation of reforms that would be enforced as of January 2019 would be offset by counter measures and so \u201cfiscally neutral.\u201d Echoing that view senior government figures said counter measures would henceforth be voted through parliament alongside further cuts. \u201cThere is no room for further austerity,\u201d the minister of digital policy Nikos Pappas told Ant1 TV. \u201cMeasures and counter-measures will be voted together after the review has been completed,\u201d he insisted, explaining that if the tax-free threshold was reduced to \u20ac6,000, as the IMF has long demanded, other measures would be taken to reduce the negative impact on vulnerable groups. But seven years into the crisis there was widespread cynicism that the vaunted change of policy mix, also announced at the eurogroup, would work. Across the board, political opponents accused the government of engaging in window-dressing and double speak. The so-called agreement did little more than prolong negotiations over the review, the former finance minister Evangelos Venizelos claimed. No decision had been taken as to what would happen when the current bailout programme expires in 2018, or how creditors would deal with the country\u2019s staggering debt pile or even when Greece would enter the ECB\u2019s QE programme, he said. \u201cThe negotiation will be prolonged for a few more months in expectation, presumably, of the next German government,\u201d said Venizelos. \u201cIn other words what was agreed was the extension of the negotiation until dramatic dilemmas appear,\u201d he added referring to the huge debt repayments Greece faces in July. Back in the UK, and here\u2019s our story on the Treasury select committee. Phillip Inman writes: The Bank of England is unlikely to predict the next financial crisis, according to one of the central bank\u2019s leading policymakers, who said economic models were unable to provide flawless forecasts for the UK economy. Monetary policy committee member, Gertjan Vlieghe, said it was impossible for the Bank to forecast a recession, let alone the next crash and no amount of fine-tuning models of the way the modern economy operates would change that harsh reality. Appearing before MPs, Vlieghe warned it was inevitable there would be forecasting errors, which could include missing a cataclysmic event such as the 2008 banking crisis. He said: \u201cWe are probably not going to forecast the next financial crisis, or forecast the next recession. Our models are just not that good.\u201d The Bank should continue trying to improve and refine its forecasting models, he said, but it was misguided for MPs to demand that economic forecasts offer a high degree of certainty about events that could happen several years from now. Vlieghe, a former City economist, was answering criticisms from MPs on the Treasury select committee over a series of forecasting errors in the run-up to the Brexit vote. The full story is here: The disappointing US data could dim some of the expectations of a forthcoming interest rate rise, analysts believe. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t had much reason to be concerned about the financial markets since arriving at the White House, but today\u2019s reports of a slowing in manufacturing growth could give the President a momentary headache. After figures went into overdrive after his election victory in November, Trump was keen to paint himself as the reason for the resurgence in American factory production \u2013 but this is a setback he won\u2019t be able to blame on another administration. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has already hinted at further interest rate hikes during 2017, but with uncertainty on the horizon, that may end up being later rather than sooner. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: The US manufacturing sector continues to operate at positive levels, although February\u2019s figure may be viewed as a small backwards step. Factories have been riding the crest of a wave since November\u2019s election, but today\u2019s drop could be a sign of things to come. Exports are likely to drop right off as a result of high inflation and uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy, and that will hit manufacturing hard. Until all aspects of the US economy are heading in the right direction, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is expected to hold fire on raising interest rates. The post-US election optimism could be running out of steam, says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit: The drop in the flash PMI numbers for February suggest that the post-election upturn has lost some momentum. Growth of business output, new orders and hiring all waned, as did inflationary pressures. February also saw a sharp pull-back in business optimism about the outlook over the next 12 months, which suggests companies have become more cautious about spending, investing and hiring. However, even with the February dip, the PMI remains at a level broadly consistent with the economy growing at a 2.5% annualized rate in the first quarter. The survey\u2019s employment index is meanwhile indicating that a respectable 165,000 jobs were added to the economy in February. The US service and manufacturing sectors have grown by less than expected so far in February, according to new figures. The initial Markit service sector PMI for the month came in at 53.9, compared to 55.6 in January and expectations of a figure of 55.8. Markit\u2019s preliminary manufacturing PMI for February was 54.3, down from 55 in January and lower than the forecast rise to 55.3. The composite index fell from 55.8 in January to 54.3. Over in the US, and stock markets have opened at record highs after Monday\u2019s holiday, lifted by positive reaction to results from retailers Wal-Mart and Home Depot, a rise in the oil price and a stronger dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to 20,688, up 64 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.23% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.17%. Oil prices have been boosted by comments from Opec that it was hopeful that members would comply with the deal to cut production. West Texas Intermediate is currently up 1.13% at $54.53 a barrel. The dollar is also higher after recent comments from Federal Reserve officials hinting at forthcoming interest rate rises. Over in Europe the picture was more mixed. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.7% with France\u2019s Cac up 0.39%. But the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.8% or 6%, with HSBC alone knocking 33 points off the index following its worse than expected results. The session looked like a win for MPs not the MPC, reckons Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe: Today, for once, the Monetary Policy Committee did not give as good as it got from the Treasury Select Committee. Long-time Carney baiters such as Steve Baker made some very good points about the BoE\u2019s lack of clarity in forward guidance and its recent patchy forecast history, yet ultimately we learned little about how the outlook for monetary policy has changed in recent months. This is mainly because inflation prospects are still surrounded by extraordinary amounts of uncertainty. Much of the BoE\u2019s willingness to look through the coming surge in inflation seems to rest on stability in long term expectations. But inflation expectations are rising, and with consumers on the verge of digesting more price increases, the BoE\u2019s commitment to look through inflation could become increasingly limited. As Ian McCafferty said, we\u2019re about to learn a lot more about how the costs of sterling\u2019s depreciation will be split between firms and consumers. How investment intentions and consumer spending change as a result of this adjustment could end up either completely upending the BoE\u2019s forecasts (again) or proving them right all along. With this much uncertainty, it\u2019s no wonder Carney stayed well clear of providing even vague guidance on the future direction of rates. Here\u2019s some reaction to the Bank of England hearing, from committee member Helen Goodman MP: And finally, Mark Carney warns against reading too much into the FTSE 100\u2019s rally since last summer, to record highs. The governor points out that the blue-chip index is packed with international firms who earn dollars overseas (which are now worth more in sterling terms). A better guide to Britain\u2019s economic health is the yield on 10-year UK debt, which has \u2018gone sideways\u2019 since the Brexit vote. That suggests that bond vigilante are cautious about longer-term growth prospects. And that\u2019s the end of a rather bruising session with the Treasury committee. Steve Baker MP (another non-fan of Mark Carney) has been cheekily checking his phone during the session. He admits that he\u2019s been following the \u2018highly amusing\u2019 commentary from twitter user @JediEconomist I\u2019m not sure the BoE will be as amused... Keep you eyes on the witnesses, Mr Baker... In a determined effort to get himself dis-invited from this year\u2019s Bank of England Christmas party, Kit Malthouse MP has asked Mark Carney about forward guidance! [This was Carney\u2019s great innovation when he joined the Bank; a promise that interest rates wouldn\u2019t rise until the unemployment rate fell to 7%, it was then fudged once the rate fell sharply below that level] Malthouse asks if the current forward guidance is that interest rates will rise twice over the forecast horizon, as the quarterly inflation report shows. Carney: The forecast is determined by the market curve at the time of the forecast -- the financial markets expected two rate rises, so there it is. So what\u2019s your forward guidance now? Is it that rates are going to go up, down, or is it neutral? Carney refuses to elaborate, arguing it would be wrong to go further than the MPC\u2019s own pronouncements. He looks irked that forward guidance was even brought up. On food inflation, Carney says consumers should expect fresh food prices to rise to counter the fall in the pound, which makes imports more expensive. Packaged goods producers have \u2018more leeway\u2019 to absorb the impact of sterling\u2019s depreciation, as they can look to save costs elsewhere. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse manages to rile Mark Carney by asking if the Bank of England is still locked into a pre-2008 mindset, and struggling to understand the modern world. Malthouse argues that we\u2019re now in a \u201csod it\u201d economy, where people are deciding to get on with their lives rather than waiting for conditions to improve. Carney gets into full rebuttal mode, says central banks have learned from what happened a decade ago, and adapted. He led the Bank of Canada though the financial crisis, so will \u2018bridle\u2019 at the assertion that policymakers don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. He agrees, though, that the world has changed -- the gig economy is changing the labour market, and the way wage bargaining works. Machine learning, and artificial intelligence, are making major changes to the way the economy runs. We were derided when Andy Haldane talked about the robot revolution a year ago, Carney says, but it\u2019s hugely important. The ageing population is another issue. In that case, Malthouse asks, why aren\u2019t you weaving more of this into your forecasts? Especially as Mr Vlieghe says he doesn\u2019t have confidence in them. [that\u2019s not exactly what Vlieghe meant, when he said the Bank wouldn\u2019t spot the next crisis coming...] Carney replies that the Bank is conducting research into all these issues, and considering whether it makes more \u2018tangible\u2019 forecasts about long-term risks. The danger, though, is that these risks are seen as predictions.... So, are the risks to household consumption more to the upside or the downside compared to the Bank\u2019s forecasts, Reeves continues? Just one word will do.... MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe won\u2019t be boxed into a single-word reply. The risks are to both sides, he insists. Consumption data at the end of last year was strong, but it\u2019s fallen off in the last few weeks. Carney and MCafferty agree that risks are to both sides. Haldane, though, plumps for downside. Labour MP Rachel Reeves clips the edge of the bullseye, by asking whether the Bank is worried about rising consumer borrowing. Mark Carney concedes that the Bank is \u2018a little concerned\u2019 that lending criteria are being relaxed, to allow riskier lending. We\u2019re concerned enough to look at it more closely..... He cites the fact that consumers can now transfer a credit balance and get up to 40 months of interest-free credit. The company taking on the loan can also bank some future earnings from this new customer straight away, Carney explains. Labour MP Helen Goodman turns to the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing stimulus programme. She says that Bank analysis, released in 2012, showed that the wealthiest 5% of the population had received \u00a3185,000 from QE, but this didn\u2019t get a lot of publicity until prime minister Theresa May criticised the Bank\u2019s action last year. She cites a speech that Andy Haldane gave last year in RedCar, on the consequences and limits of monetary policy. Q: Are you not a little bit concerned that the Bank has fed the housing bubble? Haldane says he has been trying to set out the distributional consequences of the financial crisis, and the way the burden has fallen differently across income levels, where people live, how old they are, and whether they own a house. But he insists that QE has benefited every section of the population (by supporting growth and employment). And he disputes that the Bank has distorted the housing market -- house prices have been going up over a long time, due to a disparity between supply and demand. Q: But your own numbers show that the richest 5% received \u00a3185,000 each. That\u2019s enough to buy a house in my constituency [Goodman represents Bishop Auckland, County Durham]. Haldane agrees that \u00a3185,000 is a significant amount, and that QE has pushed up house prices . But he is adamant that QE hasn\u2019t hurt the poor: Have the effects been felt equally across the economy, across regions, across households, no, they haven\u2019t. But does that mean that people been disadvantaged in absolute terms? There the evidence is very much to the contrary. [Explainer: The Bank has created \u00a3425bn of new money through QE, to buys government bonds from commercial banks, so they can buy riskier assets]. The weakening in the pound may lead to more \u2018animated\u2019 wage bargaining than we\u2019ve seen in the past, Ian McCafferty adds. Q: It is highly likely that there will be less immigration over the next few years; did you take this into account when you lowered your estimate of the equilibrium levels of unemployment to 4.5%, from 5%? Ian McCafferty says that an expectation of lower immigration is already build into the Bank\u2019s forecasts. But there are risks to that forecasts. Recent figures suggests immigration may fall faster than forecast. Alternatively, the UK may grow faster than other European countries, meaning we remain a \u2018magnet for immigration\u2019. Q: Isn\u2019t it striking and bizarre that the Bank of England haven\u2019t changed its economic assumptions since the government signalled the UK will leave the single market? Haldane says that the Bank feels this won\u2019t have a significant near term impact on its inflation and output projections over the forecast horizon, so no need to rip up the forecasting models yet. Q: When might UK interest rates start to rise? Ian McCafferty says there is \u201csome hope\u201d that interest rates could start to normalise in two or three years... Not for the first time, governor Mark Carney reminds the Treasury committee that the Bank took some significant decisions after the EU referendum that mitigated the impact of that vote. And yet.... I think we just have to accept that we\u2019re never going to get any credit for it. Jacob Rees-Mogg suggests the Bank should be more circumspect about its forecasts, rather than presenting them as \u201cHoly Writ\u201d, and then dismissing them six months later. Andy Haldane replies, saying the Bank does use fan charts to show the probability of the future path of growth and inflation. But he concedes that it\u2019s hard to convey this sense of uncertainty to the wider world. The Bank\u2019s chief economist says: We know that people find risk hard to understand, I find risk hard to understand. [This may explain why Haldane is prepared to compare the Bank\u2019s forecasting to dodgy weather forecasting - not, perhaps, a career-enhancing move] Now Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP and persistent thorn in the Bank of England\u2019s side, takes over the questioning. He congratulates Andy Haldane on his \u201cextraordinarily interesting\u201d \u2018speech and interview last month (on Michael Fish forecasting errors). But he\u2019s concerned that Haldane thinks that the Bank would have taken the same monetary policy decisions, even if it had better forecasting. Haldane says there are places where the Bank is doing its best to learn lessons and improve its models to reflect changes in the economy. But, as Vleighe explained earlier, that can\u2019t prevent \u201cthe occasional making of errors, not all of which are mistakes\u201d. Conservative MP Chris Phelp makes the Bank of England look a little silly... Q: Your chart on page 31 of the quarterly inflation report shows that long-term inflation expectations are around 3%, so doesn\u2019t that mean that the financial markets don\u2019t believe price rises are transitory? Carney tries to swat this away. These graphs measures the Retail Prices Index, not the Consumer Prices Index - and RPI is usually 1% higher than CPI, he says smoothly. That\u2019s not clear in the report, Phelp shoots back. He squints at his report...and spots that it says \u2018CPI\u2019 inflation in the subheading. See.... Dr Gertjan Vlieghe tries to help, saying that some of the surveys of inflation expectation specify beween CPI and RPI, and others don\u2019t. So is this chart measuring CPI, RPI, or a fudge, asks Phelp triumphantly. Haldane thinks the survey doesn\u2019t specify. Fudge it is, then! Onto inflation, which is poised to jump over the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Ian McCafferty says we are getting \u2018close\u2019 to the limit of how much inflation overshoot can be tolerated. Carney sounds less concerned, saying the overshoot is \u2018entirely\u2019 down to the currency factor, so the Bank must watch out for signs that inflation is pushing wages up. The Bank policymakers may be losing patience with the committee.... Carney points out that they\u2019ve spend an hour fielding questions about forecasting the past, and not touched on the issues facing the economy in the future. Tyrie agrees that the session is running behind schedule, and suggests that the BoE provide shorter answers! John Mann MP isn\u2019t impressed.... pointing out that the Bank of England hasn\u2019t changed its forecasting to address the massive changes in house ownership in the UK. Q: Aren\u2019t you behind the times when it comes to assessing consumer behaviour? Governor Mark Carney defends the Bank\u2019s forecasts after the Brexit vote - saying they were less pessimistic than other forecasters, just not optimistic enough. He agrees there has been a big structural change in UK home ownership, and \u201cMillennial attitudes to home ownership and rent\u201d... [\u201dAttitude\u201d is a funny word to use -- someone\u2019s attitude to buying a house is somewhat irrelevant if they simply can\u2019t afford one...] Chief economist Andy Haldane now hits back against the MPs\u2019 criticism. He says that his \u201cMichael Fish\u201d speech last month was meant to highlight that the forecast errors around the Brexit vote are much smaller than before the financial crisis in 2008. Ian McCafferty is also stung by the Committee\u2019s earlier criticism - the BoE is revising its models to try to improve its forecasting record, he points out robustly. Another MPC member, Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, criticises the idea that the Bank would deliver flawless forecasts for the UK economy if it could only improve its models. He tells the Treasury Committee that however good the models are, it is inevitable that there will be forecasting errors. Forecasts are, after all, only a measure of the probability of something happening. As Vlieghe puts it: We are probably not going to forecast the next financial crisis, or forecast the next recession. Our models are just not that good. Of course, the Bank should keep trying to improve and refine its forecasting models, Vlieghe continues...but it\u2019s simply wrong to think we will ever get certainty. MPC member Ian McCafferty argues that surveys of business activity are usually very helpful; but at times of major economic or political shock, they can give a misleading picture. For example, after the Brexit vote, surveys showed a very large fall in corporate and consumer confidence -- but things quickly returned to equilibrium, faster than you might expect. The Bank of England is now challenged over its decision to raise its growth forecasts this year from 1.4% to 2% Q: Would the Bank have done a better job of forecasting the UK economy if it had thought that voting for Brexit might be a good thing, not a bad one? Andy Haldane says there are several reasons why the Bank raised its growth forecasts, including the fiscal loosening in the autumn statement, a recovering global growth, and \u201csomewhat stronger\u201d consumer spending. A majority of consumers have looked through what we\u2019ve seen in the last six to nine months. Maybe that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, Haldane concedes, as they\u2019re still in employment. They\u2019re spending what is coming in. But people are going to face a squeeze in the months ahead as inflation rises. Back in December, Mark Carney generously invited the whole committee to the Bank\u2019s Christmas party. But there\u2019s no festive spirit this morning: Tyrie then asks Haldane to justify the Bank\u2019s confidence that the \u00a323bn productivity spending announced in last year\u2019s autumn statement will boost UK growth. Surely this is quite a small stimulus? Haldane says this fiscal loosening will help, but there is still a \u2018net headwind\u2019 from budget cuts in future years. When did the Bank last change its estimate of the equilibrium level of unemployment [before this month], chairman Tyrie asks. Ian McCafferty doesn\u2019t know. Nor does chief economist Andy Haldane. So governor Mark Carney rides to the team\u2019s rescue, with a long answer about how the Bank now holds comprehensive annual reviews of its economic measures .... Tyrie\u2019s heard enough - and wants the BoE to come back to him and say exactly when it was last changed, and whether it was ever voted on. He points out that, by cutting this rate from 5% to 4.5%, the Bank has given itself the green light to forecast higher growth without worrying about inflationary consequences. Carney comes back, saying the BoE has been over-estimating wage growth for some time, suggesting there is more slack in the labour market than thought. So it is right to examine its assumptions about the economy. You can watch the Treasury committee hearing here. Next question goes to Ian McCafferty -- does he support the Bank\u2019s decision to reduce the \u2018equilibrium level\u2019 of UK unemployment from 5% to 4.5%? [this measures how close Britain is to full employment]. McCafferty says he accepted the move, but would have favoured a smaller move to just 4.75%. He argues that Britain is actually closer to full employment than current weak wage growth suggests. Over at parliament, the Treasury committee is starting its session with Bank of England governor Mark Carney and senior colleagues. Chief economist Andy Haldane take the new ball, with a question about his recent claim that the financial crisis was a \u201cMichael Fish\u201d moment (a reference to the BBC weatherman who downplayed the UK\u2019s great storm of 1987.) Q: Is economics, in its nature, a Michael Fish operation? Haldane says that forecasting is an important part of economics, like weather forecasting. Economists did fail to spot the warning signs ahead of the 2008 crisis, and there was \u2018group think\u2019 about issues such as leveraging. \u201cGroup non-think\u201d, mutters committee chairman Andrew Tyrie Haldane says the important thing is to learn from forecasting errors -- he mentioned Michael Fish in 1987 because it has a happy ending. The same can be true of economics, Haldane insists. We can hope and aspire to do better, because we have learned lessons [from 2008]. Have improvement been made, yes? Are our forecasting methods better, yes? Is there room for further improvement, yes, he concludes. Scott Bowman of Capital Economics thinks the UK is on track to borrow \u201csignificantly less\u201d than the current forecast of \u00a368bn this year. Having read January\u2019s public finances, he says: Looking through some of the monthly volatility, receipts growth has been fairly steady since June \u2013 adding to the evidence that the economy has held up well following the vote to leave the EU Breaking! Britain has racked up its biggest surplus for a January in 17 years. The Office for National Statistics reports that the government achieved a surplus of \u00a39.4bn last month, the best since 2000, thanks to strong tax receipts. [confusingly, the ONS have also changed their methodology for handling corporation tax so it is recorded when the activity took place. So that forecast of a \u00a314bn surplus is no longer relevant]. So with two months to go, it appears that Britain will hit its deficit target this financial year. The big picture is that Britain now owes \u00a31,589.2bn, or around 80.5% of gross domestic product. The Treasury is taking a cautious approach, with a spokesperson saying: \u201cWe remain committed to returning the public finances to balance and building on our progress in reducing the deficit from 10% to 4% of GDP over the last six years. Next month the Chancellor will deliver his Spring Budget based on updated forecasts from the OBR.\u201d French government bonds are coming under renewed selling presure, as fears that far right politician Marine Le Pen could become the country\u2019s next president. Despite today\u2019s strong economic data, traders are piling out of French debt and into German bonds instead - fearing a political earthquake when the French head to the polls in late April and early May. This has driven the gap between French and German 10-year borrowing costs to a new four-year high: Investors are waking up to the possibility that Le Pen is on track to win the first round of voting, and could even triumph in the second-round playoff. Opinion polling last weekend put the Front National leader on 26% support, followed b right-winger Francois Fillon and centrist Emmanuel Macron on 20% each. For a while, people had felt confident that moderate voters would rally around her opponent, whether that was Macron or Fillon. But jitters are setting in, with recent surveys showing Le Pen gaining ground against both men. Emily Mansfield of the Economist Intelligence Unit is confident that Le Pen will not win in the second round. But if there is a shock result, it could make Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiations even tougher: \u201cIf she did come to power, suddenly the focus in Brussels would shift away from the UK to making sure that that there was no further ruptures,\u201d Mansfield told City AM. \u201cLe Pen would encourage the other European countries to close ranks and be even tougher on both France and the UK.\u201d The upshot of today\u2019s PMI reports is that the eurozone economy is picking up speed this month. Markit says: Job creation was the best seen for nine and a half years, order book growth picked up and business optimism moved higher, all boding well for the recovery to maintain strong momentum in coming months. Inflationary pressures meanwhile continued to intensify. Full details here. Boom! Company growth across the euro area has hit its fastest rate in almost six years, thanks to the pick-up in France (details) and Germany (details) Here\u2019s Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale on today\u2019s eurozone growth figures: France\u2019s composite flash PMI came in at 56.2 this month - and Germany\u2019s came in at 56.1 - providing further evidence of the European growth acceleration that will give the Euro wings when or if it can get free of its political shackles.... Greek bonds are strengthening this morning, following last night\u2019s agreement to talk about additional economic reforms in return for bailout cash. The yield on Greece\u2019s two-year debt has dropped to 8.8%, down from over 9.3% yesterday. That means it is seen as less risky, but still quite risky. More encouraging news! Germany\u2019s private sector is enjoying its best month in almost three years. German manufacturing growth rose to a 37-month high this month, says Markit, while service sector growth hit a 3-month high. And that\u2019s driven the Flash Germany PMI Composite Output Index up to its highest since April 2014 at 56.1, up from 54.8 in January. Anything over 50 shows growth. Firms a rise in new business, with manufacturing new order growth hitting a 37-month high, and new export orders rising at the fastest rate since January 2014. Trevor Balchin, Senior Economist at IHS Markit says: \u201cThe flash PMI results for February signalled the strongest growth of the German economy for just under three years, with manufacturing in particular expanding at a marked pace and services recovering the momentum lost at the start of the year. Moreover, the new Future Output Index is signalling strong confidence among firms, reaching a new high since its inception in mid-2012. Economist are applauding the news that French companies have reported such solid growth this month. Capital Economics are predicting that the wider economy is picking up pace: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi is also impressed: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says French companies aren\u2019t being distracted by the race to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Breaking: France\u2019s companies are growing at their fastest rate in over five years, despite the uncertainty created by this spring\u2019s presidential elections. The Flash France Composite Output Index, compiled by data firm Markit, has surged to 56.2 this month, up from January\u2019s reading of 54.1. That\u2019s the highest reading since May 2011. Service sector companies led the way with strong growth, while manufacturing firms also expanded. Firms across the economy reported solid growth this month, with new business picking up, meaning they hired more staff for the fourth month running. It\u2019s an encouraging sign that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy has made a decent start to 2017 Alex Gill of IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe latest PMI data highlighted a further marked improvement in private sector conditions in France. Output continued to rise in both monitored sectors. \u201cService providers remained the driver of overall growth, as evidenced by further sharp expansions in new orders and employment, the sharpest in five- and-a-half years in each case. \u201cThe picture was also positive for manufacturers, albeit slightly less rosy. Rates of increase in client demand and staffing numbers eased from January as the sector continues to be weighed down by marked cost pressures.\u201d Reaction to follow! Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be watching Greece, following yesterday\u2019s agreement to allow debt inspectors to return to Athens. Once there they\u2019ll be discussing a new round of tax, pensions and labour market reform, to possibly pave the way for Greece to receive more bailout loans (to repay its creditors with...). As we covered in last night\u2019s liveblog, eurozone officials are talking up the idea that the focus is moving from austerity to reforms (after almost seven years of pain). The Greece government has been defending the agreement, saying that it\u2019s \u2018fiscally neutral\u2019 (so any savings can be ploughed into tax cuts). But the opposition New Democracy party isn\u2019t impressed, declaring that \u201cThe government is celebrating the return of the institutions to Greece while the economy is sinking.\u201d Also coming up today.... Data firm Markit are releasing new \u2018flash\u2019 economic surveys, showing how private sector companies in Germany, France and the wider eurozone are faring this month. 8am: French manufacturing and services PMI 8.30am: German manufacturing and services PMI 9am: Eurozone manufacturing and services PMI At 9.30am, we get the latest UK public finances for January. They\u2019re likely to show a surplus of over \u00a314bn, thanks to a flurry of self-assessment tax payments. Then at 10am, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and colleagues will climb into the ring for another bout with MPs on parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee. They\u2019ll be discussing the latest Inflation Report, and the Bank\u2019s new forecasts for higher growth and inflation. Brexit will doubtless come up (again). And in the City, the big news overnight is that banking giant HSBC has posted a 62% slide in profits. My colleague Jill Treanor has been up extra-early to cover it; here\u2019s her story: Mining giants BHP Billiton and Anglo American, hotels group InterContinental, and plumbing and building materials firm Wolseley are also reporting results.",

      "bodyText": "The London television studio where some of the UK\u2019s most popular shows of the past 40 years have been filmed is to be closed by ITV. Programmes from Upstairs Downstairs to Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway have been shot at the London Studios on the capital\u2019s South Bank but it is to close as a result of plans to redevelop the broadcaster\u2019s headquarters on the same site. The closure is expected to lead to the loss of 140 jobs. In an email to staff announcing the move, ITV\u2019s chief executive, Adam Crozier, said there were plans to move back to the South Bank site once it was redeveloped but there would not be a place for the studio. \u201cWe\u2019ve given very careful consideration to what our plans mean for the London Studios (TLS), which would require significant investment to replicate within our proposed South Bank redevelopment,\u201d wrote Crozier. \u201cLooking ahead, we believe that this investment would not be core to the strategic priorities of the ITV Studios business and so we\u2019re proposing to close TLS and use studio capacity in the external market to meet our future business needs.\u201d An ITV spokesperson said the move was designed to create a \u201cpurpose-built HQ on our existing South Bank site, bringing together all of our London-based staff in one location for the first time\u201d. However, the union Bectu questioned whether the decision was driven by the possibility of a sale of the company. The fall in the value of sterling in recent months is thought to have made ITV, which also operates a large production business, a more attractive prospect for overseas bidders. The London Studios makes programmes for all the UK\u2019s main broadcasters, including Have I Got News for You and The Graham Norton Show on the BBC, and Channel 4\u2019s Sex Box. It also hosts ITV\u2019s daytime programming \u2013 Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women \u2013 but these will continue to be filmed in the redeveloped HQ. The site has a long history stretching to its original incarnation as the South Bank Television Centre, producing sitcoms such as On the Buses and Father Ted, as well as Blind Date. Bectu said the plans did not make sense and were a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of staff already reeling from 120 redundancies announced late last year. \u201cEven in the short term the proposal has no logic,\u201d said Bectu\u2019s head, Gerry Morrissey. \u201cWhy announce the studios\u2019 closure when planning permission has yet to be sought and when the redevelopment will not begin until 2018 at the earliest? \u201cWe\u2019ll be asking the questions which need to be asked to shine a light on the plans and to defend the interests of our members. We\u2019d also like to know whether the proposal to close the London Studios is motivated more by the prospect of a possible sale of the company than by sound industrial planning.\u201d The tower block in which the studio is housed was built in the 1970s for London Weekend Television, with ITV securing the freehold on the site in 2003 for \u00a356m. In December the Wembley studio where the ITV shows The X Factor and Pop Idol were shot was closed before a planned demolition.",

    "webTitle": "City watchdog investigating HSBC over potential financial crime, bank reveals", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City regulator is investigating HSBC over potential breaches of money laundering rules after concerns raised last year by the anti-crime monitor installed in Britain\u2019s biggest bank. The bank did not disclose the specific concerns raised by the American lawyer Michael Cherkasky, who was appointed as the monitor five years ago. He is reported to have raised concerns about clients with links to terrorism, including Isis. Chekraksy was appointed after the \u00a31.2bn fine imposed on HSBC in 2012 by the US for poor anti-money laundering controls and is overseeing attempts to improve its defences against financial crime. The Financial Conduct Authority did not comment but the bank said it was \u201cthe subject of an investigation by the FCA into its compliance with UK money laundering regulations and financial crime systems and controls requirements\u201d. As the bank reported a 62% slump in 2016 profits on Tuesday, its chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank was unearthing more regulatory problems due to higher-quality internal policing, adding the business had \u201cbeen able to identify more bad actors in our 37m customer base\u201d. He said it was \u201cquite normal\u201d to uncover such instances in a bank the size of HSBC which operates in 70 countries and has 240,000 staff. Gulliver said: \u201cOur monitor has raised certain concerns but we have continued to progress and our commitment remains unwavering. By the end of this year, we are on track to have our anti-money laundering and sanctions policy framework in place and to have introduced major compliance IT systems across the group.\u201d He described the FCA\u2019s investigation as a section 166 reportwhich means a review by an independent firm that could lead to fines if wrong doing is uncovered. Cherkasky\u2019s criticism that HSBC was too slow to improve its systems was taken into account when paying top staff: the part of Gulliver\u2019s pay measured against compliance with financial crime received a 65% rating from the remuneration committee, compared with 75% a year earlier. This was reported to amount to a 2.5% cut. Sam Laidlaw, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, said this followed \u201cfeedback received from the monitor, matters arising from risk and compliance incidents, and a number of unsatisfactory internal audits covering anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions-related issues\u201d. Even so Gulliver\u2019s overall pay is ising from \u00a37.3m to \u00a37.7m. Pay of \u201ccertain individuals\u201d was reduced by $12.1m (\u00a39.7m) to \u201creflect their involvement in certain notable events and individual transgressions\u201d while 245 were paid more than \u00a31m compared with 226 a year ago. One received \u20ac11m (\u00a38.8m). The overall bonus pool was cut by 12% \u2013 which will be closely watched as all the other major UK banks report in their results in the coming days. The monitor had also expressed concerns a year ago and on Tuesday HSBC highlighted concerns \u201cinstances of potential finance crime that the DoJ [department of justice] and HSBC are reviewing further and on-going systems and control deficiencies that in [the monitor\u2019s] view raised questions as to about whether HSBC is adhering to all its obligations under the US DPA\u201d. Gulliver has been pulling back from riskier operations, including its Swiss private bank and the 62% fall in profits \u2013 down to $7.1bn \u2013 was in part caused by a $3.2bn writedown on the total value of the takeover of the Safra private bank in 1999. In 2015, the Guardian and other publications revealed the Swiss arm of HSBC helped clients dodge tax and the bank revealed it had now set aside $773m aside for various tax investigations. Without the one-off hits, profits were flat at $19.3bn and the bank tried to please shareholders by buying back $1bn of shares, on top of $2.5bn announced in August. The dividend is held at 51 cents a share. But the bank\u2019s shares, which have risen 55% since the EU referendum, endured one of their biggest one day falls since the depths of the banking crisis. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec said, said the figures were a \u201cgrim reality\u201d while analysts at Bernstein said \u201cHSBC missed on income and capital\u201d. Revenue fell in 2016, a year which chairman Douglas Flint said would be \u201clong remembered for its significant and largely unexpected economic and political events\u201d. Investors looking for news about Flint\u2019s successor may have been left disappointed as he said an announcement would be made \u201cin due course\u201d. Gulliver indicated Flint could stay on until next year if a replacement was not found until later in 2017. Laidlaw, who is leading the search for Flint\u2019s replacement, is leaving at the annual meeting. Flint highlighted potential risks to the markets, including \u201cthe threat of populism impacting policy choices in upcoming European elections\u201d, while Gulliver talked about the end of globalisation. \u201cIf globalisation continues to retreat, as seems likely, we are in a strong position to capitalise on the regional opportunities that this will present, particularly in Asia and Europe,\u201d said Gulliver. Flint said the bank would need to relocate 1,000 staff from London to Paris \u201cprogressively over the next two years\u201d as a result of the Brexit vote but half of them were French.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is unlikely to predict the next financial crisis, according to one of the central bank\u2019s leading policymakers, who said economic models were unable to provide flawless forecasts for the UK economy. Monetary policy committee member Gertjan Vlieghe said it was impossible for the Bank to forecast a recession, let alone the next crash, and no amount of fine-tuning models of the way the modern economy operates would change that harsh reality. Appearing before MPs, Vlieghe warned it was inevitable there would be forecasting errors, which could include missing a cataclysmic event such as the 2008 banking crisis. He said: \u201cWe are probably not going to forecast the next financial crisis, or forecast the next recession. Our models are just not that good.\u201d The Bank should continue trying to improve and refine its forecasting models, he said, but it was misguided for MPs to demand that economic forecasts offer a high degree of certainty about events that could happen several years from now. Vlieghe, a former City economist, was answering criticisms from MPs on the Treasury select committee over a series of forecasting errors in the run-up to the Brexit vote. Like the Treasury, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Threadneedle Street predicted a sharp slowdown in the event of a vote to leave the EU. Official figures have shown that, far from slowing, the UK became one of the best-performing economies in the developed world and the fastest growing in the G7 in the second half of 2016. Governor Mark Carney said actions by the Bank itself, which cut interest rates weeks after the Brexit vote, and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who lifted constraints on public spending in November\u2019s autumn statement, had helped to boost the economy in the wake of the Brexit vote. Carney admitted the MPC had misjudged the resilience of consumer spending following a wobble after the referendum, but it could not include in its forecasts actions that policymakers might take to offset weaker confidence among consumers and businesses. MP Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested the Bank should be more circumspect about its forecasts, rather than presenting them as \u201choly writ\u201d, and then revising them six months later. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, said fan charts showed the probability of the future path of growth and inflation and in most cases the predictions were within a narrow range of the central forecast. However, he conceded that the economics industry and the Bank found it difficult to convey a sense of uncertainty to the wider world. He said: \u201cWe know that people find risk hard to understand; I find risk hard to understand.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK government surplus gives Philip Hammond pre-budget boost", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A boost in self-assessment tax receipts and a bumper flow of capital gains tax to the exchequer has sent the government\u2019s borrowing bill to its lowest January level in 17 years. The boost in January\u2019s tax receipts is expected to put the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in a position to ease some of the Treasury\u2019s planned austerity in the next financial year when he stands up to deliver his first full budget in a fortnight. The rise in tax income generated a surplus of \u00a39.4bn, the highest January gain since 1999, prompting the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster to say the government was on track to undershoot the \u00a368bn deficit target at the end of the financial year. The Office for Budget Responsibility said official figures showing the deficit had tumbled to \u00a349.3bn in the financial year so far and if the sequence of healthy figures continued could put it on course to hit \u00a356bn by the end of March. The OBR said the estimated \u00a312bn improvement was likely to give \u201ca reasonable sense of the extent to which borrowing is undershooting\u201d. But it also warned that tax receipts remained volatile as investors considered how much income to bring forward to avoid higher taxes next year and the banks agreed the size of annual bonus payments. However, the surplus for January 2017 nudged only \u00a3300m higher than the same month last year, which was less than City economists had expected. Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG, said the stronger January public finances figures could see government net borrowing well below the OBR\u2019s November figure, though it was unlikely to sink back to the \u00a355bn level foreseen in March last year. \u201cThis gives the chancellor a bit more room for manoeuvre in his final spring budget next month. If the UK economy remains stable over the transition period once article 50 is triggered, Hammond could meet his objective to reduce the budget deficit below 2% GDP by 2020-21, while offering a few small giveaways. \u201cThese could include alleviating the burden on some small businesses impacted by rising business rates, and providing additional support to public services that are under increasing strain, such as the NHS, social care and education. \u201cHowever, in these uncertain times, the chancellor is likely to hold some ammunition back, in case the economy proves weaker in the run-up to UK\u2019s departure from the European Union, so more significant policy announcements are not likely before the autumn budget in November.\u201d Suren Thiru, an economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, was also sceptical that Hammond would plan any major giveaways in the next budget. \u201cOver the long term, the task of restoring public finances remains significant. If UK growth becomes more sluggish, as we expect, the UK will find it increasingly challenging to generate the tax receipts needed to deliver real progress in cutting the deficit,\u201d he said. In November the OBR said the weaker economic outlook since the Brexit vote meant its March 2016 prediction of the public deficit was way off the mark and revised it to \u00a368bn for the current financial year. But a strong recovery in the months after the referendum put Britain in the front rank of developed world economies and forced many forecasters to revise up their predictions of growth for 2017. The Treasury, which has abandoned former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s target to create a surplus in the public finances in this parliament, said the deficit would continue to fall. A spokesman said: \u201cWe remain committed to returning the public finances to balance and building on our progress in reducing the deficit from 10% to 4% of GDP over the last six years. Next month the chancellor will deliver his spring budget based on updated forecasts from the OBR.\u201d The public finances were also bolstered by a rise in corporation tax receipts, though the effect was disguised by a switch in the way the ONS accounts for payments by firms.VAT receipts increased by 3.7% in January on the same month last year and corporation tax receipts rose 5%. The Office for National Statistics said self-assessed income tax and capital gains tax receipts increased by \u00a32bn to \u00a319.8bn in January compared with January 2016, pushing the total to the highest January since 1999, when records began.",

But it also warned that tax receipts remained volatile as investors considered how much income to bring forward to avoid higher taxes next year and the banks agreed the size of annual bonus payments.</p> <p>However, the surplus for January 2017 nudged only \u00a3300m higher than the same month last year, which was less than City economists had expected. </p> <p>Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG, said the stronger January public finances figures could see government net borrowing well below the OBR\u2019s November figure, though it was unlikely to sink back to the \u00a355bn level foreseen in March last year.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis gives the chancellor a bit more room for manoeuvre in his final spring budget next month. If the UK economy remains stable over the transition period once article 50 is triggered, Hammond could meet his objective to reduce the budget deficit below 2% GDP by 2020-21, while offering a few small giveaways. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/02/borrowing-zip/giv-39028iHDYjSBDY1e\" data-alt=\"public borrowing graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/02/borrowing-zip/giv-39028iHDYjSBDY1e\">public borrowing graph</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese could include alleviating the burden on some small businesses impacted by rising business rates, and providing additional support to public services that are under increasing strain, such as the NHS, social care and education.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, in these uncertain times, the chancellor is likely to hold some ammunition back, in case the economy proves weaker in the run-up to UK\u2019s departure from the European Union, so more significant policy announcements are not likely before the autumn budget in November.\u201d<br></p> <p>Suren Thiru, an economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, was also sceptical that Hammond would plan any major giveaways in the next budget.</p> <p>\u201cOver the long term, the task of restoring public finances remains significant. If UK growth becomes more sluggish, as we expect, the UK will find it increasingly challenging to generate the tax receipts needed to deliver real progress in cutting the deficit,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>In November the OBR said the weaker economic outlook since the Brexit vote meant its March 2016 prediction of the public deficit was way off the mark and revised it to \u00a368bn for the current financial year.</p> <p>But a strong recovery in the months after the referendum put Britain in the front rank of developed world economies and forced many forecasters to revise up their predictions of growth for 2017.</p> <p>The Treasury, which has abandoned former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s target to create a surplus in the public finances in this parliament, said the deficit would continue to fall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/07/ifs-warns-steep-cuts-tax-rises-40bn-black-hole-uk\">UK tax burden will soar to highest level for 30 years, warns IFS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesman said: \u201cWe remain committed to returning the public finances to balance and building on our progress in reducing the deficit from 10% to 4% of GDP over the last six years. Next month the chancellor will deliver his spring budget based on updated forecasts from the OBR.\u201d<br></p> <p>The public finances were also bolstered by a rise in corporation tax receipts, though the effect was disguised by a switch in the way the ONS accounts for payments by firms.VAT receipts increased by 3.7% in January on the same month last year and corporation tax receipts rose 5%.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said self-assessed income tax and capital gains tax receipts increased by \u00a32bn to \u00a319.8bn in January compared with January 2016, pushing the total to the highest January since 1999, when records began.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A fleet of blimps is bringing mobile phone and wireless broadband coverage to rural communities in the UK. Mobile network operator EE says the fleet will enable remote communities to maintain voice and data services when coverage is lost due to natural disasters such as flooding. EE expects to launch its first \u201chelikite\u201d \u2013 a mobile broadcast site tethered to helium balloons \u2013 later this year. EE is also preparing to deliver coverage via drones, although that project is not ready to launch. The balloons will allow a mobile signal to be beamed into the area below, allowing communities to make calls and access the internet when the traditional mobile phone mast system goes down or needs more capacity. Marc Allera, the chief executive of EE, said that the balloons \u2013 and ultimately the drones \u2013 could also be used to boost coverage at major events and venues such as Glastonbury or Wembley Stadium, where mobile phone users often struggle to connect to networks. \u201cI see innovations like this revolutionising the way people connect,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future, why couldn\u2019t an event organiser request temporary EE capacity increase in a rural area. Or a climber going up Ben Nevis order EE aerial coverage to follow them as they climb?\u201d However, the company added that airspace regulations could hamper wider use at football matches and music festivals. The company said the helikite balloons are best suited for ensuring coverage in the case of natural disasters and events, because they can stay airborne for up to a month and have a signal radius of up to 5km. The balloons are more weather-resistant than the drones, although the company said lightning strikes posed a risk. Because they are motor-powered the drones can only stay airborne for a few hours at a time, and only have a signal range of up to 2km, making them best suited for shorter usage such as search and rescue operations. Balloons and drones have been identified as a cheap solution to problems delivering mobile and broadband services to communities where it is expensive to build a traditional network of masts. Facebook has signed up almost half the countries in Africa to its free internet service and is exploring options including deploying solar-powered drones to reach remote communities. Last month, it emerged that Google had scrapped its project exploring the development of massive solar-powered drones to deliver internet to rural and remote parts of thew world a year ago. It is still investing in Project Loon, which sends balloons to the edge of space to beam internet signal to the land below it. Allera, who launched the scheme at London\u2019s Oval cricket ground on Tuesday, said EE\u2019s \u201cair mast\u201d solution, which the company is currently in the process of patenting, is primarily intended to be used for keeping rural communities connected in times of disaster and helping search and rescue missions. He said the balloons and drones are not being designed as a permanent solution to ensuring universal mobile and internet coverage across the UK. \u201cRural parts of the UK provide more challenges to mobile coverage than anywhere else,\u201d he said. EE expects that its 4G network will cover 92% of Britain geographically by the end of this year, excluding balloon and drone coverage. The mobile operator also has the contract for the UK\u2019s Emergency Services Network to supply communications to the police, fire and ambulance services. The fleet of helikites are not going to be used to support the ESN, at least initially.",

Councils and businesses can see how the revaluation is making bills fairer and is revenue-neutral. \u201cThis is yet more scaremongering, when in reality the revaluation will mean businesses in 80% of council areas will see an average fall in their business rates bills due to revaluation before inflation.\u201d After the meeting with Conservative MPs, Treasury sources said Hammond told them he was also aware of the challenges of the growing digital economy, amid warnings that smaller shops could go under as a result of increases, while the online retail giant Amazon would enjoy a cut in the tax bill paid for its warehouses. New rates will be set by the Valuation Office Agency in the coming weeks, and rates are due to rise unusually sharply in areas where property prices have increased rapidly in recent years. A source said: \u201cIt is a real challenge to the tax system when you have a specific tax based on property. It is very difficult and he told MPs that he was alive to this but that it isn\u2019t something that can be changed overnight.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said the calculations were \u201cpure misinformation and half-truths\u201d and called for a rethink. \u201cSmall businesses are panicking about the impact of these massive rate hikes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only people who gain are Sports Direct and Amazon. It is time for a U-turn. The government needs to make it soon.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prolonged closure of a major French atomic reactor after an explosion this month probably costs EDF at least \u00a31m a day, according to experts. The nuclear plant operator, which will spend \u00a318bn building the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station in a generation, shut unit 1 at its Flamanville plant after a fire broke out in the turbine hall. The company initially estimated it would switch on the reactor within a week, but later pushed the date to the end of March. Work begins this week on replacing damaged equipment. The unexpectedly long closure adds to the financial pressure on EDF, which last week reported a 6.7% decline in core earnings to \u20ac16.4bn (\u00a314bn) in 2016. Closures of its French nuclear plants last year, partly for safety checks, have already cost the 85% state-owned company an estimated \u20ac1.3bn. Prof Neil C Hyatt, head of nuclear materials chemistry at the University of Sheffield, said the lost revenue from the reactor closure in Normandy could be \u00a31m per day. \u201cBringing a nuclear power plant back online after an unscheduled outage is a complex task and EDF will want to ensure that all parts of the system are working safely and effectively. A short delay to complete the necessary checks is to be expected, given that the outage was unplanned,\u201d he said. Another expert said the cost of closure could be up to \u00a31.8m per day, depending on energy market prices, and questioned why there was a delay. \u201cIt took operator EDF almost a week to progressively correct the original outage estimate from one day to 50 days. EDF has provided no information as to why the outage time went from a few days to seven weeks,\u201d said Mycle Schneider, a nuclear energy consultant based in Paris. The 1.3GW reactor at Flamanville is one of a dozen of EDF\u2019s French nuclear fleet currently offline, which the company said was usual for this time of the year. It did not say why the restart date for the reactor had been revised four times, or why it had jumped from a few days to more than six weeks. John Large, a nuclear consultant who has advised the UK government, said initial reports that the fire was in a ventilator suggested the offline reactor would be back online within a week or two. Replacing such parts should be relatively straightforward, he said. He added that the plant\u2019s continued closure would also add to headaches at the French grid operator RTE, which warned of power cuts at the start of winter due to nuclear outages. \u201cThe continuing impact on the grid is likely to be significant, especially if a cold snap develops,\u201d Large said. A second reactor at the plant is still supplying electricity to the French grid. EDF said: \u201cWork on recommissioning the affected equipment has started this week and should last several weeks, with reconnection to the grid planned for the end of March.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Problem gambling experts have criticised rival factions of the betting industry for waging a \u201cselfish\u201d war of words to protect their own interests amid the threat of tighter regulation. The UK\u2019s leading gambling charity also warned that a \u201cnarrow\u201d focus on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), potentially ignoring online betting and fruit machines in pubs, amusement arcades and casinos, risks undermining efforts to help addicts. The government is conducting a review of gaming machines that industry figures fear will lead to tighter curbs on betting machines and reduced profits. The review has seen amusement arcades and casinos go on the offensive against bookmakers by highlighting the addictive nature of FOBTs, which make up more than half of bookies\u2019 revenues at about \u00a31.7bn last year. The machines have been publicly reviled as the \u201ccrack cocaine of gambling\u201d, a phrase thought to have been coined by President Donald Trump when he was running casinos to draw attention to video game bingo, which posed a threat to his business. GambleAware chief executive Marc Etches said that while attention should be paid to FOBTs, which allow punters to stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds, ignoring other types of gambling was a \u201cdisservice\u201d to problem gamblers. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular focus on machines in bookmakers but I\u2019ve observed the industry for the best part of two decades and in my experience it\u2019s always been the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the National Lottery was introduced, elements of the industry didn\u2019t care for that. \u201cWhen there was discussion of expanding casinos, there were businesses within the industry that campaigned against it. Such is the case around machines in bookmakers.\u201d He added that it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that a cross-party group of MPs, which has recommended slashing the maximum FOBT stake to \u00a32, is backed by firms that profit from rival forms of gambling. Groups that fund the MPs\u2019 efforts include amusement arcade body Bacta, pub chain JD Wetherspoon, which operates fruit machines, and Hippodrome casinos. The Association of British Bookmakers recently fought back against criticism of FOBTs, latching on to research published by industry regulator the Gambling Commission. Using data compiled from real betting sessions, the commission found there was \u201cno consistent evidence that particular gambling activities are predictive of problem gambling\u201d. The ABB also pointed to figures suggesting that on average gamblers lost more money and spent more time on amusement arcade-style games. ABB chief executive Malcolm George warned of the danger that \u201cadult gaming centres and other forms of gambling escape proper scrutiny.\u201d \u201cThe arcade industry and elements within the casino industry, which are commercial competitors of the bookmakers, have unfairly used FOBTs as the whipping boy for far too long when it comes to problem gambling. \u201cIn particular arcades, with vastly more machines, need to wake up to their responsibility to help problem gamblers, in the same way as the bookmaking industry has.\u201d Bacta accuses the ABB of cherry-picking data that suits its own argument, focusing on averages rather than the extreme losses that can affect higher-stakes FOBT players. The two sides have also drawn opposing conclusions about whether studies suggest that reducing the maximum stake on FOBTs would stem players\u2019 losses. Etches said the back-and-forth between competing firms in the same industry suggested that they were losing sight of the need to address problem gambling. \u201cThe industry needs to think more carefully about that bigger reputational issue and recognise that those who are thoughtful can see through some of this selfish behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have a problem so we need to have a better discourse. A narrow focus that gets very shouty between campaign groups puts people off having a more grown-up more mature discussion.\u201d The row over the role that FOBTs play in addiction reflects the limited amount of hard evidence on problem gambling. One of the most comprehensive studies, by research group NatCen, looked at whether people who hold loyalty cards with bookmakers changed their behaviour over time, in an attempt to show whether FOBTs coincide with a slide into addiction. It found a correlation between the use of machines in bookmakers and a descent into problem gambling, with the unemployed and ethnic minority groups worst affected. But NatCen associate research director Heather Wardle, who sits on the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board, is wary of drawing too many conclusions from this. \u201cIt shows an association, we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s driving that association. In all likelihood there are some people for whom the machines are causing them difficulties. \u201cOthers have immense problems with all types of gambling and happen to play machines.\u201d She points out that similar research has not been done into amusement arcades, fruit machines or online betting, so it is difficult to compare the risk of addiction. This raises the possibility that while FOBTs do pose a risk, a blinkered focus on them could allow other forms of betting \u2013 whether it\u2019s amusement arcades or online poker \u2013 to escape scrutiny. Like Etches, Wardle is concerned by the tendency of the warring factions to highlight data that suits their cause. \u201cThere is a lot of energy expended on different interest groups trying to make a case that one activity versus another is the most harmful thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou end up with a polarised debate that misses the complexity of what\u2019s causing people harm and what you do about it. \u201cI can perfectly understand why different stakeholders do that but it\u2019s not particularly helpful. I\u2019d like to see people combine their energies into really thinking about how we help people and stop the horrendous problems they experience.\u201d",

A narrow focus that gets very shouty between campaign groups puts people off having a more grown-up more mature discussion.\u201d</p> <p>The row over the role that FOBTs play in addiction reflects the limited amount of hard evidence on problem gambling.</p> <p>One of the most comprehensive studies, by research group NatCen, looked at whether <a href=\"http://about.gambleaware.org/media/1432/follow-up-study-of-loyalty-card-customers-report.pdf\">people who hold loyalty cards with bookmakers</a> changed their behaviour over time, in an attempt to show whether FOBTs coincide with a slide into addiction.</p> <p>It found a correlation between the use of machines in bookmakers and a descent into problem gambling, with the unemployed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/06/paddy-power-prefers-opening-shops-in-areas-of-greater-ethnic-mix\">ethnic minority groups worst affected</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa4eea8f86f43821b299f2960e0b3a733d88c207\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa4eea8f86f43821b299f2960e0b3a733d88c207/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses betting machines at a Paddy Power shop in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses betting machines at a Paddy Power shop in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But NatCen associate research director Heather Wardle, who sits on the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board, is wary of drawing too many conclusions from this.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows an association, we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s driving that association. In all likelihood there are some people for whom the machines are causing them difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cOthers have immense problems with all types of gambling and happen to play machines.\u201d</p> <p>She points out that similar research has not been done into amusement arcades, fruit machines or online betting, so it is difficult to compare the risk of addiction.</p> <p>This raises the possibility that while FOBTs do pose a risk, a blinkered focus on them could allow other forms of betting \u2013 whether it\u2019s amusement arcades or online poker \u2013 to escape scrutiny.</p> <p>Like Etches, Wardle is concerned by the tendency of the warring factions to highlight data that suits their cause.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of energy expended on different interest groups trying to make a case that one activity versus another is the most harmful thing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou end up with a polarised debate that misses the complexity of what\u2019s causing people harm and what you do about it.</p> <p>\u201cI can perfectly understand why different stakeholders do that but it\u2019s not particularly helpful. I\u2019d like to see people combine their energies into really thinking about how we help people and stop the horrendous problems they experience.\u201d</p>",
