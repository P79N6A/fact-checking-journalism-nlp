On Monday, Antony Jenkins, the new chief executive of Barclays, was talking about the bank's mistakes in the wake of the Libor scandal and pledging to put them right. On Tuesday, it was the turn of another top banker, also new to his job, to make promises. Anshu Jain, 100 days into his new role as chief executive of Deutsche Bank, a job he holds jointly with J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, said that, with returns to shareholders in decline, \"we can't expect our investors to allow us to pay the bonuses we have in the past\". \"Highly paid individuals are our biggest cost base\" and, in future, the most senior staff at the bank will have to wait for five years to get their bonuses, just to make sure that the performance on which they were based does not evaporate in the meantime. The Deutsche Bank pair made clear that bonuses were going to come down as they promised to set up a new \"compensation standards panel\" to look at pay in the current 2012 financial year. They made their pledge to put themselves at the \"forefront of cultural change in the industry\" after laying the ground in July for some sort of regulatory action following the Libor scandal, by admitting that some Deutsche staff had been involved in trying to rig the key interest rate. Barclays has already to set up its committee, chaired by the lawyer-cum-banker Anthony Salz (who is also a director of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian), to examine the bank's culture. However, it is clearly too early to know whether the words being uttered by bankers promising cultural change will translate into action \u2013 or, crucially, appease investors fed up with bankers taking too big a share of investment banking revenues.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The brief period in which go-go Burberry was worth more than dowdy Marks &amp; Spencer is over, at least for a while. Burberry's stock market fans have learned an uncomfortable fact: the rich aren't buying expensive frocks, coats and handbags like they used to. Same-store sales have been falling in recent weeks. Cue a 21% plunge in the share price. The fan club was warned but didn't listen. In her July update, chief executive Angela Ahrendts made all the usual boasts about strong \"brand momentum\" but also included the dreadful phrase \"a more challenging external environment.\" That should have caused the highl rated shares to stall. Instead, they climbed 15% higher over the course of the next month. Bizarre. Investors, it seems, are slow to let go of the happy notion that wealthy Chinese consumers are God's gift to European luxury goods retailers. As it happens, Burberry thinks the weakness in its sales extends well beyond China - the rest of Asia, Europe and the Americas are all affected. If anything, that's more alarming for immediate prospects since global trends are harder to buck than regional ones. If a proper storm now follows, there is a limit to how far Burberry can protect itself. Staff have been to told to curb their international travel and rein in publicity jollies (the poor dears). But the heavy corporate expenditure is on stores and it's too late now to cancel plans to expand space by 13% this year, including the addition of big new shops in London's Regent Street, Chicago and Hong Kong. But perhaps Ahrendts wouldn't wish to anyway. She's shifted sales from the fiddly wholesale channel to flagship retail shops, and the formula is clearly right for the long term. But it means there is little alternative but to ride out the storm. The company thinks it can still hit the low end of City forecasts for pre-tax profits of \u00a3407m this year (up from \u00a3376m a year ago). But it's the following two years, when the City is still expecting steady 10% profts increases, that now look a serious struggle. We're seen this plot before: when the luxury market turns, it tends to turn sharply.",

      "body": "<p>The brief period in which go-go Burberry was worth more than dowdy Marks &amp; Spencer is over, at least for a while. Burberry's stock market fans have learned an uncomfortable fact: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/burberry-warns-profits-sales-luxury-fashion\" title=\"\">the rich aren't buying expensive frocks, coats and handbags like they used to</a>. Same-store sales have been falling in recent weeks. Cue a 21% plunge in the share price.</p> <p>The fan club was warned but didn't listen. In her July update, chief executive Angela Ahrendts made all the usual boasts about strong \"brand momentum\" but also included the dreadful phrase \"a more challenging external environment.\" That should have caused the highl rated shares to stall. Instead, they climbed 15% higher over the course of the next month. Bizarre. Investors, it seems, are slow to let go of the happy notion that wealthy Chinese consumers are God's gift to European luxury goods retailers.</p> <p>As it happens, Burberry thinks the weakness in its sales extends well beyond China - the rest of Asia, Europe and the Americas are all affected. If anything, that's more alarming for immediate prospects since global trends are harder to buck than regional ones.</p> <p>If a proper storm now follows, there is a limit to how far Burberry can protect itself. Staff have been to told to curb their international travel and rein in publicity jollies (the poor dears). But the heavy corporate expenditure is on stores and it's too late now to cancel plans to expand space by 13% this year, including the addition of big new shops in London's Regent Street, Chicago and Hong Kong.</p> <p>But perhaps Ahrendts wouldn't wish to anyway. She's shifted sales from the fiddly wholesale channel to flagship retail shops, and the formula is clearly right for the long term. But it means there is little alternative but to ride out the storm. The company thinks it can still hit the low end of City forecasts for pre-tax profits of \u00a3407m this year (up from \u00a3376m a year ago). But it's the following two years, when the City is still expecting steady 10% profts increases, that now look a serious struggle. We're seen this plot before: when the luxury market turns, it tends to turn sharply.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ten minutes walk from Frankfurt's main railway station, through a warren of sex shops and seedy gambling dens, two dozen of the most powerful unelected people on the continent gather once a fortnight to try to save Europe from itself. Around a large circular table on the 36th floor of the Eurotower that soars over the city centre red-light district, Mario Draghi chairs the meetings of the governing council of the European Central Bank which have supplanted EU summits and finance ministers' sessions as the key events deciding the fate of the euro \u2014 testimony to the failures and fecklessness of the EU's elected leaders. The Italian central banker radiates understated gravitas and charm, has been in office not even a year, and has already been dubbed the euro's saviour, the most important central banker on the planet, the most powerful person in Europe with the possible exception of chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Draghi's expanding battery of weapons for combating the euro crisis is to be strengthened immensely on Wednesday when the European Commission unveils new draft legislation putting the ECB in charge of supervising the eurozone's 6,000 banks, with the power to grant and withdraw licences. Within a month of taking office last November, Draghi delivered a coup, launching a trillion-euro programme of cheap loans for Europe's banks. Last Thursday he went much further, announcing a new policy of limitless purchasing of eurozone government bonds known as OMT \u2014 outright monetary transactions. The markets went quiet, Spain, Italy, and Ireland rejoiced, as Draghi emphasised for the third time in six weeks that the euro is irreversible. He framed his bold intervention as solidly within his remit to defend the embattled currency. But German monetary purists erupted in howls of protest, although it was the German on the ECB's six-strong executive, J\u00f6rg Asmussen, who played a key role in drafting the new policy. \"Only a currency whose existence is out of the question can be stable,\" Asmussen told the Guardian in an interview. \"What for us is clearly within our mandate is to guarantee the stability of the euro.\" Extreme times generate extreme moves. There is no doubt that the eurozone's exhausted political leaders are quietly relieved that Draghi is taking some of the heat out of the crisis. While Merkel, the central actor in the euro drama, could never say so publicly, her aides have been known to concede that Draghi is the only person who can rescue the euro \u2013 so let him get on with it. And since the stakes could hardly be higher, for Asmussen the end would appear to justify the means. \"I see an incomplete currency area,\" he said. \"We're at a very decisive moment. We need to aim for more Europe, define our place on the globe in the 21st century. If we're not willing or able to embark on that route, all the achievements of the monetary union, and even of the single market, could be at risk. We don't know if we'll succeed, but we'll work for it.\" But the sweeping new banking supervisory powers, the bond market intervention, and the increasing influence the ECB wields over the fiscal and budgetary policies of the governments of the eurozone have many worried that the ECB president and the 22 others on the governing council \u2014 the 17 central bank chiefs of the eurozone plus the six-strong ECB executive, all men in suits, not a woman among them \u2014 are getting too big for their boots. \"The ECB is getting very powerful,\" said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels. \"It has emerged from the crisis as a strong institution. It deserves more powers, though this is a major challenge.\" Draghi's predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, played a key role behind the scenes in unseating Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister of Italy last year. Trichet's letters to the Irish government, some of them recently published by the Irish Times, show how he pressured Dublin into its eurozone bailout, arguing that the dire condition of the Irish banks was imperilling the entire European banking system. Through its involvement in the \"troika\" with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund, the ECB is dictating fiscal and economic policy to eurozone strugglers. And in Brussels, senior officials report that ECB staff are ubiquitous at crisis meetings, seeking to steer and influence policy-making by eurocrats and eurozone government officials. \"They're all over us, wanting to discuss legislation. We try to keep them at arm's length as it's none of their business,\" said one EU official. \"Now with the banking supervision, the buck will stop in Frankfurt. It seems the ECB's dream may be coming true.\" Asmussen dismisses the talk of an over-mighty central bank, indirectly describing the ECB's activism as a necessary response to the inadequacies of the eurozone's politicians. \"Nobody should think that the people in the ECB are megalomaniacs. We think we have an important mandate, but a limited one,\" he said. \"Some people say that the ECB was the only institution in the crisis able to act. That's crisis management. It cannot and it should not stay like this. We're slowly but surely working on empowering other institutions to be able to act.\" But the conditions Draghi says are needed to trigger the bout of bond-buying are frequently explicitly political demands of elected governments. \"The governing structure of the euro area has clear design flaws,\" said Asmussen. \"It should be clear to everyone that we stand ready to do our part, repairing the monetary transmission mechanism. But in order to be successful others must do their part. Member states must show fiscal discipline, regain competitiveness, and where needed clean up bank balance sheets. And the community of states in Europe must improve the institutional architecture of the incomplete monetary union.Only if these three elements are together can it work.\" Improving the euro's \"institutional architecture\" entails the 17 countries surrendering large chunks of sovereignty over budget and fiscal policy to a eurozone \"fiscal union\" seen as the logical successor to the \"banking union\" being proposed on Wednesday. While arguing that a common currency cannot function without common fiscal policies, the ECB is playing a much more overtly political role than it did before the crisis when, on the model of Germany's Bundesbank, it restricted itself to monetary policy-making, inflation-fighting, and jealously guarded its independence. Analysts say that that independence will be further eroded by the new powers over eurozone banks, resulting in a conflict of interest between different functions since the ECB will be responsible for supplying liquidity to the banks it is policing and because it will need to be politically accountable in supervising the banks while politically independent in setting monetary policy. \"Accountability is a potential problem,\" said Daniel Gros, a German economist who heads the Centre for European Policy Studies. \"You want the ECB independent of political pressure but to be accountable on banking supervision. How to square that circle?\" Asmussen is the first to agree and is calling for a \"Chinese wall\" to be erected at the ECB to avoid any overlap, conflict, or confusion. \"Monetary policy by definition is independent. Banking supervision by its very nature is not. It must be subject to parliamentary and judicial control. We're open to this request to show accountability to the European parliament and the council [of eurozone governments]. Accountability is needed. In the end it's about taxpayers money and this is the core competence of any parliament.\" Draghi has already shown himself to be much bolder than his predecessor, facing down the might of the Bundesbank \u2014 apparently with a wink and a nod from Berlin \u2014 and taking on a much more political role, always the aim of the French for the ECB and always resisted by the Germans. \"This is uncharted territory,\" said a senior EU official. \"Draghi is taking risks with his own authority. He's getting away with it because of the leadership vacuum he's stepping into. But this can't last. We know that the politicians will have to come back one day.\"",

It deserves more powers, though this is a major challenge.\"</p> <p>Draghi's predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, played a key role behind the scenes in unseating Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister of Italy last year. Trichet's letters to the Irish government, some of them recently published by the Irish Times, show how he pressured Dublin into its eurozone bailout, arguing that the dire condition of the Irish banks was imperilling the entire European banking system.</p> <p>Through its involvement in the \"troika\" with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund, the ECB is dictating fiscal and economic policy to eurozone strugglers. And in Brussels, senior officials report that ECB staff are ubiquitous at crisis meetings, seeking to steer and influence policy-making by eurocrats and eurozone government officials.</p> <p>\"They're all over us, wanting to discuss legislation. We try to keep them at arm's length as it's none of their business,\" said one EU official. \"Now with the banking supervision, the buck will stop in Frankfurt. It seems the ECB's dream may be coming true.\"</p> <p>Asmussen dismisses the talk of an over-mighty central bank, indirectly describing the ECB's activism as a necessary response to the inadequacies of the eurozone's politicians.</p> <p>\"Nobody should think that the people in the ECB are megalomaniacs. We think we have an important mandate, but a limited one,\" he said. \"Some people say that the ECB was the only institution in the crisis able to act. That's crisis management. It cannot and it should not stay like this. We're slowly but surely working on empowering other institutions to be able to act.\"</p> <p>But the conditions Draghi says are needed to trigger the bout of bond-buying are frequently explicitly political demands of elected governments.</p> <p>\"The governing structure of the euro area has clear design flaws,\" said Asmussen. \"It should be clear to everyone that we stand ready to do our part, repairing the monetary transmission mechanism. But in order to be successful others must do their part. Member states must show fiscal discipline, regain competitiveness, and where needed clean up bank balance sheets. And the community of states in Europe must improve the institutional architecture of the incomplete monetary union.Only if these three elements are together can it work.\"</p> <p>Improving the euro's \"institutional architecture\" entails the 17 countries surrendering large chunks of sovereignty over budget and fiscal policy to a eurozone \"fiscal union\" seen as the logical successor to the \"banking union\" being proposed on Wednesday.</p> <p>While arguing that a common currency cannot function without common fiscal policies, the ECB is playing a much more overtly political role than it did before the crisis when, on the model of Germany's Bundesbank, it restricted itself to monetary policy-making, inflation-fighting, and jealously guarded its independence.</p> <p>Analysts say that that independence will be further eroded by the new powers over eurozone banks, resulting in a conflict of interest between different functions since the ECB will be responsible for supplying liquidity to the banks it is policing and because it will need to be politically accountable in supervising the banks while politically independent in setting monetary policy.</p> <p>\"Accountability is a potential problem,\" said Daniel Gros, a German economist who heads the Centre for European Policy Studies. \"You want the ECB independent of political pressure but to be accountable on banking supervision. How to square that circle?\"</p> <p>Asmussen is the first to agree and is calling for a \"Chinese wall\" to be erected at the ECB to avoid any overlap, conflict, or confusion.</p> <p>\"Monetary policy by definition is independent. Banking supervision by its very nature is not. It must be subject to parliamentary and judicial control. We're open to this request to show accountability to the European parliament and the council [of eurozone governments]. Accountability is needed. In the end it's about taxpayers money and this is the core competence of any parliament.\"</p> <p>Draghi has already shown himself to be much bolder than his predecessor, facing down the might of the Bundesbank \u2014 apparently with a wink and a nod from Berlin \u2014 and taking on a much more political role, always the aim of the French for the ECB and always resisted by the Germans.</p> <p>\"This is uncharted territory,\" said a senior EU official. \"Draghi is taking risks with his own authority. He's getting away with it because of the leadership vacuum he's stepping into. But this can't last. We know that the politicians will have to come back one day.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Financial Services Authority has continued its post-Lehman Brothers crackdown on firms which fail to protect their clients' money by slapping a \u00a39.5m fine on fund management firm BlackRock. The fine, which would have been \u00a313.6m if the firm had not agreed to settle, is the latest attempt by the City regulator to prevent a rerun of the problems incurred when Lehman collapsed and where client money was not segregated from the firms' own money. The two are required to be kept separate to make it easier to hand money back to clients in the event that firms need to be wound up. The FSA found that the average daily balance of money market deposits at risk at BlackRock between 1 October 2006 and 31 March 2010 was over \u00a31.3bn. \"This is not the first time we have seen the impact on client money overlooked as part of a re-organisation. The fine imposed today should remind all firms of the critical importance we place on ensuring proper protection of client money at all times,\" said Tracey McDermott, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime. The fine is the second largest levied by the FSA for this offence following the \u00a333m fine JP Morgan paid after failing to protect clients for seven years. The FSA admitted that BlackRock's misconduct was not deliberate and took place after \"organisation and systems changes\" following the acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in September 2006. BlackRock had filed to obtain letters from banks with which it placed short-term deposits to ensure that client money was protected. Until May, Barclays held a 20% stake in BlackRock as a result of the sale of its Barclays Global Investors division to the US-based firm in 2009. \"Identifying and protecting client money should be at the top of every firm's agenda. We have repeatedly emphasised to firms that their systems and controls for ensuring this is the case must be robust and well designed and updated as circumstances change,\" said McDermott. \"Despite being part of one of the largest asset managers in the world, BlackRock's systems were simply not adequate, and the basic step of notifying banks that the money was held on trust for clients was not done.\" BlackRock said it had reported the matter to the FSA after an internal review: \"As the FSA itself noted, the situation that led to this settlement was not deliberate and no clients suffered any losses as a result of the error.

      "body": "<p>The United States is beset by four deficits: a fiscal deficit, a jobs deficit, a deficit in public investment, and an opportunity deficit. The budget proposals put forward by the presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, could reduce the fiscal deficit, but would exacerbate the other three.</p> <p>To be sure, Romney and Ryan have failed to provide specifics about how they would reduce the fiscal deficit, relying on \"trust me\" assertions. But the overarching direction of their proposals is clear: more tax cuts, disproportionately benefiting those at the top, coupled with significantly lower non-defence discretionary spending, disproportionately hurting everybody else \u2013 and weakening the economy's growth prospects.</p> <p>Despite 30 months of private-sector job growth, the US still confronts a large jobs deficit. The unemployment rate remains more than two percentage points above the \"normal\" rate (when the economy is operating near capacity). Moreover, the labour-force participation rate remains near historic lows.</p> <p>More than 11m additional jobs are needed to return the US to its pre-recession employment level. At the current pace of recovery, that is more than eight years away. In the meantime, persistent high unemployment reduces the economy's growth potential by robbing today's workers of skills and experience.</p> <p>When weak aggregate demand causes the economy to operate far below its potential, cuts in government spending enlarge the jobs deficit. Indeed, in his recent speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke warned that such cuts significantly inhibit job creation.</p> <p>Without revealing which programmes he would reduce, Romney promises to slash federal spending by more than $500bn in 2016, capping it at 20% of GDP thereafter. He also promises an immediate 5% cut in non-defence discretionary spending in 2013, on top of the huge cuts already scheduled to take effect. And he has ruled out additional temporary fiscal measures aimed at job creation, like President Barack Obama's proposals for additional grants to states and additional infrastructure spending.</p> <p>Romney acknowledges that large spending cuts, along with the scheduled expiration of tax cuts at the end of this year, could throw the economy back into recession in 2013. But he vows to steer the economy from the fiscal cliff by extending the tax cuts enacted under George W Bush, doubling down with a further 20% across-the-board cut in income-tax rates and cutting the corporate rate from 35% to 25%.</p> <p>With the possible exception of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, these changes would take considerable time to implement. Even when enacted, their near-term effects on job creation would be minimal. An across-the-board reduction in tax rates performs poorly in terms of budgetary effectiveness (the number of jobs created per dollar of foregone revenue). Payroll-tax relief and spending on programmes like food stamps and unemployment compensation are much more effective.</p> <p>Romney overstates his tax proposals' long-term growth effects as well. Reducing individual tax rates and taxes on savings and investment at best fosters modest increases in employment, work effort, and income. Despite the Bush-era tax cuts, the 2001-2007 expansion was the worst of the post-war period in terms of investment, employment, wage, and GDP growth. Job creation and growth were much stronger following President Bill Clinton's tax increases in the 1990s.</p> <p>Moreover, if all of Romney's additional tax cuts were financed in a revenue-neutral way, as he promises, only the composition of taxes would change; the overall tax share of GDP would not. There is no evidence that this would significantly boost growth, as Romney claims.</p> <p>Based on what Romney has told us, we can conclude that his plan would exacerbate the public-investment deficit as well. Romney's vow to cap federal spending at 20% of GDP by 2016, while maintaining defence spending at 4% of GDP and leaving both Social Security and Medicare unchanged for those 55 or older, implies exempting more than 50% of government spending from cuts for the next decade. So, to hit the 20% cap, spending on everything else would have to be slashed by an average of roughly 40% by 2016 and 57% by 2022.</p> <p>Everything else includes government investments in three major areas on which growth and high-wage jobs depend: education, infrastructure, and research. These areas account for less than 8% of federal spending, and their share has been declining steadily. Under Romney, it would plummet to new lows.</p> <p>Everything else also includes spending on programmes that help low-income families, like food stamps, student grants, and Medicaid. The Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities finds that almost two-thirds of the Ryan budget's spending cuts would come from such programmes. Romney offers few specifics, but simple arithmetic shows that his plan would require even deeper cuts in these programmes than Ryan's plan would.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney's plan would actually increase taxes on middle-income families. His plan would pay for lower income-tax rates by eliminating tax deductions like those for charitable giving and mortgages, while maintaining tax preferences for saving and investment. But there are not enough tax breaks for the rich to cover another 20% reduction in their income-tax rate. That is why the nonpartisan Tax Policy Centre found that Romney's plan would cut overall taxes for households with incomes above $200,000, but would require an average annual tax increase of at least $2,000 for households with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000.</p> <p>Romney's budget plan would also make the federal tax-and-transfer system considerably less progressive, thereby worsening income inequality, which is already at its highest level since the Great Depression. Rising income inequality fuels a growing opportunity deficit for children born into poor and middle-income families, reflected in disparities in educational attainment by family background, and a decline in intergenerational mobility. Under Romney, the opportunity deficit would widen, robbing the country of future talent and productivity.</p> <p>Romney has provided few details about his deficit-reduction plan.

The Great campaign, which has enlisted the support of Prince Harry and ministers from several departments, is an attempt to showcase the quality of British goods and services in countries where the UK has only a toe-hold of sales.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry has seemed to defy gravity for so long that an unexpected warning on profits was bound to send it crashing to earth.
