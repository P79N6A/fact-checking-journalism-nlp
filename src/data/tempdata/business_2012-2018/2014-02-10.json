    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ministers are free to pick fights whenever they wish, but this is a strange moment for the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey, to wonder aloud if British Gas ought to be broken up. Didn't the prime minster order an independent review \u2013 indeed, an annual competition test \u2013 to determine what action is needed in the energy market? And isn't that review, conducted by the Office of Fair Trading, Ofgem and the Competition &amp; Markets Authority, due to be published in about six weeks' time? Yes and yes. The timing of Davey's intervention looks, at best, like an act of party political positioning and, at worst, like an attempt to influence an independent inquiry. It's not as if Davey has unearthed new material that needs to be announced with great fanfare to emphasise its importance. The fact that British Gas's profit margin in gas was 11% in 2012 has been public knowledge since last June because the company had to make the disclosure in its segmental accounts submitted to Ofgem. Is 11% too high? Well, it certainly looks fat for the supply of a commodity. On the other hand, a long list of points should be analysed before one concludes that a breakup of British Gas would be a useful remedy. For example: is the company's combined margin in gas and electricity, which tends to be around the 5%-6% mark after tax, more relevant since most customers buy fuel from a single supplier? And is 5% fair? Second, as parent company Centrica points out, the company makes gas and power commitments of \u00a360bn a year, mostly in the form of gas contracts from Norway, Qatar and elsewhere. The none-too-subtle suggestion is that two mini-British Gases would not have the buying muscle of today's company, the UK's security of supply might be harmed and prices might go up faster. Centrica, it will be said, is talking its book. Of course it is. The point, though, is that these arguments are best tested by an independent inquiry. As almost everybody agrees, more transparency is needed to find out exactly what is happening in the energy market. Give the complexities, it would have been better if the government had ordered a full and in-depth competition study, which might have taken 18 months, rather than a rapid competition \"test\". But, if a quick review is the settled response to Ed Miliband and Labour's charge on energy prices, ministers ought to do the decent thing and wait for the findings. Clean sweep? The new banking standards body will have its work cut out It still seems slightly bizarre that the country's big banks think they need to pay an outside body to tell them how to behave properly. But, if that's the true state of affairs, it's probably best that the new organisation has something concrete to talk about on day one. Sir Richard Lambert, former director-general of the CBI, has at least passed that test. He may not have a name for the body he will chair, but he does intend to get involved in banks' training programmes. That ambition seems reasonable. If lawyers and accountants can organise themselves to set professional standards and ethical principles, bankers ought to be able to do the same. The open question is how long any of these well-meaning initiatives will take to bear fruit. The banking crisis struck in 2008 and the first pledges of good behaviour were issued from boardrooms soon afterwards. Half a decade later, banks still regularly find themselves apologising for post-crisis failings. Lloyds, for example, was fined \u00a328m last year for offences that included offering \"grand in the hand\" bonuses to those super-salesmen in its ranks who could stuff the customers with the most investment products. Those events happened in 2010 and 2011. If the new standards body is to be taken seriously by bank customers, it will have to condemn any failings of that type it encounters. There would be a credibility issue \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 if the Financial Conduct Authority were to unearth scandals galore while Lambert, or his successor, sang a hymn of progress beneath the surface. It's a tricky gig, in other words. At this point, one can only wish the new body luck and judge it on results.",

But the Bush and Obama administrations took the view that the collapse of two-thirds of the Detroit triumvirate \u2013 Ford came through relatively unscathed \u2013 would have ramifications that stretched far beyond Motor City, with hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk in the supply chain.</p> <p>State support has also played a crucial role in the UK and Bailey credits the UK's \"more intelligent industrial policy\" since the financial crisis in keeping car manufacturing in the country. He estimates that a state-sponsored programme to diversify the manufacturing base, into medical technology and car parts, helped to save 10-12,000 jobs in the West Midlands following the closure of MG Rover. By contrast, the Australian government, he says, has tended to fall back on the natural resources boom, rather than use a limited period of state support to adjust to changes in the world economy.</p> <p>In the UK, government support was key in the saving of the Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port on the Wirral in 2012, when business secretary Vince Cable and the Unite trade union thrashed out a deal with GM that kept the 50-year old plant open. This flexibility on the part of unions, underpinned by support from a government that understands the importance of car manufacturing albeit without the financial firepower to back it with a radical financial intervention, has persuaded Japanese manufacturers such as Nissan and Honda to stay in the UK. A spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the British industry had learned from poor industrial relations that characterised the 1970s, citing better links between carmakers and unions, as well as the government, as one of the reasons why British car manufacturing is thriving.</p> <p>The UK's heritage brands also help. As a hub for making luxury vehicles including the Mini, Bentley, Jaguar and Land Rover, Britain has also benefited from China and the emerging world's appetite for luxury cars. Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover flirted with a bailout during the credit crunch but has added thousands of British jobs since as demand for vehicles like the Evoque took off globally.</p> <p>\"We can do everything here and we have got a proven pedigree in developing what markets want all over the world,\" said the SMMT spokesman, citing the fact that 50% of vehicles produced in the UK are exported outside Europe. The SMMT expects that the UK will soon overtake France as Europe's third largest car market, behind Germany and Spain.</p> <p>In France, state support has been forthcoming too, but has until recently served to prop up factories that need trimming back. European car manufacturing remains predicated on a pre-2008 world and the French establishment's reluctant acceptance of the closure of Peugeot's Aulnay plant outside Paris was a sign that governments can no longer support the status quo. Carmakers have to get leaner without cutting back on investment in new, greener models. German car makers still dominate in the luxury market because they are underpinned by decades of government support for manufacturing as a broad sector covering products from white goods to factory machinery to cars, while a state-level banking system has helped maintain a thriving culture of small-to-medium sized suppliers, or <em>mittelstand</em>. Maintaining a car industry is a marathon, not a sprint. Something a sporting nation like Australia would appreciate.</p>",

He estimates that a state-sponsored programme to diversify the manufacturing base, into medical technology and car parts, helped to save 10-12,000 jobs in the West Midlands following the closure of MG Rover. By contrast, the Australian government, he says, has tended to fall back on the natural resources boom, rather than use a limited period of state support to adjust to changes in the world economy. In the UK, government support was key in the saving of the Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port on the Wirral in 2012, when business secretary Vince Cable and the Unite trade union thrashed out a deal with GM that kept the 50-year old plant open. This flexibility on the part of unions, underpinned by support from a government that understands the importance of car manufacturing albeit without the financial firepower to back it with a radical financial intervention, has persuaded Japanese manufacturers such as Nissan and Honda to stay in the UK. A spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the British industry had learned from poor industrial relations that characterised the 1970s, citing better links between carmakers and unions, as well as the government, as one of the reasons why British car manufacturing is thriving. The UK's heritage brands also help. As a hub for making luxury vehicles including the Mini, Bentley, Jaguar and Land Rover, Britain has also benefited from China and the emerging world's appetite for luxury cars. Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover flirted with a bailout during the credit crunch but has added thousands of British jobs since as demand for vehicles like the Evoque took off globally. \"We can do everything here and we have got a proven pedigree in developing what markets want all over the world,\" said the SMMT spokesman, citing the fact that 50% of vehicles produced in the UK are exported outside Europe. The SMMT expects that the UK will soon overtake France as Europe's third largest car market, behind Germany and Spain. In France, state support has been forthcoming too, but has until recently served to prop up factories that need trimming back. European car manufacturing remains predicated on a pre-2008 world and the French establishment's reluctant acceptance of the closure of Peugeot's Aulnay plant outside Paris was a sign that governments can no longer support the status quo. Carmakers have to get leaner without cutting back on investment in new, greener models. German car makers still dominate in the luxury market because they are underpinned by decades of government support for manufacturing as a broad sector covering products from white goods to factory machinery to cars, while a state-level banking system has helped maintain a thriving culture of small-to-medium sized suppliers, or mittelstand. Maintaining a car industry is a marathon, not a sprint. Something a sporting nation like Australia would appreciate.",

      "bodyText": "The head of a new body tasked with repairing the reputation of banking has set the industry a tough deadline to adopt new codes and turn the sector into a respectable profession. Sir Richard Lambert, a former editor of the Financial Times and ex-director general of the employers' body the CBI, said the new organisation also needed to be run by non-bankers and that banks needed to focus on their customers. Giving the industry three years to adopt his proposals, he said: \"This has to have momentum. So it will fail if in two or three years' time nothing has happened and people were saying we'll just have to wait for these lot [of bankers] to die.\" Lambert was asked in September by the chief executives of the UK's major banks to come up with proposals for a new body to improve banking's reputation in the wake of the Libor rigging and payment protection insurance mis-selling scandals. Lambert, who has been working out of serviced offices in the City in an attempt to demonstrate his independence from the banks which have been paying him, wants the institutions to commit to meeting new standards and publish annually how they are complying with the code. Speaking as he launched a consultation paper with 19 questions foe the industry, he said: \"Over time, the ambition would be to encourage the development of banking as a profession, along the lines of accountancy or the law.\" But Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, immediately warned it could take a generation for the banking standards body to win any credibility with the public and the industry. Lambert \u2013 who refused to commit himself to staying on to head the organisation \u2013 immediately provoked controversy with his proposal that the head of the standards body be called before the Treasury select committee to give evidence each year. Lambert said this idea was based on the way the General Medical Council appeared before the health select committee. Tyrie, who also chaired the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which reported last year, said: \"There is no parallel with the GMC. The banking commission specifically rejected statutory powers for a professional banking body.\" He added: \"This is a welcome start to a very long-term project. As the banking commission concluded, it could take at least a generation to create a credible, effective body,\" Tyrie said. Lambert said that the way bankers pay themselves \"shapes behaviour\", but the focus should be on the performance criteria behind bonus payments rather than their size. \"This body can't deal with quantum but it should be interested in construct.\" As banks such as Barclays prepare to announce ways to maintain pay levels to their staff following the introduction of the EU bonus cap, Lambert said the restriction on bankers' pay to 100% of salary was \"not the answer\". \"The danger is it just gives rise to perverse consequences,\" said Lambert. The body is not attempting to act as an \"advocate for banks\" and neither does he envisage \u2013 at least initially \u2013 individuals joining the standard body. It would not have powers to ban individuals or firms either and would be a voluntary organisation. \"If it's ever going to happen it's now. The leadership of these banks has [had]some pretty vigorous wake-up calls over the last couple of years. People understand the reputation of the UK and London as a place to do business has taken in a knock. It's in their interests to do something about it,\" said Lambert. Business secretary Vince Cable urged banks to join, with investment banks yet to sign up. \"A properly functioning, responsible banking sector which moves away from its bonus-driven culture is vital for our economic growth,\" said Cable. He published his consultation as the high street banks prepare to publish their 2013 results and make fresh commitments to being better \"corporate citizens\". Ross McEwan, the new boss of RBS, wrote in the Guardian that the bank intended to change its behaviour \"at every level\". \"RBS cannot start to claim to be a bank that always treats people fairly unless we stop doing those things that erode trust,\" said McEwan. His counterpart at Lloyds Banking Group, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has also been setting out pledges to help customers.",

      "body": "<p>The cost of clearing up after this winter's floods and storms could hit \u00a31bn if rain continues to fall on water-logged ground and causes damage to more homes and businesses, an insurance expert has warned.</p> <p>On Monday, accountancy firm PwC revised up its forecast for the cost of flooding in December and January to \u00a3630m, including a \u00a3500m bill for the insurance industry.

      "bodyText": "The cost of clearing up after this winter's floods and storms could hit \u00a31bn if rain continues to fall on water-logged ground and causes damage to more homes and businesses, an insurance expert has warned. On Monday, accountancy firm PwC revised up its forecast for the cost of flooding in December and January to \u00a3630m, including a \u00a3500m bill for the insurance industry. However, as the rain continued to fall in parts of the south-west, and swelling rivers reached the outskirts of London, one insurer said the cost could easily increase. \"Many parts of the country are now saturated, which means further flooding is inevitable as the rain continues to fall.

While currently even on the highest estimates the bill is some way off the \u00a33bn the insurance industry is thought to have paid out following the floods that devasted huge swathes of the country in 2007, Rakow said insurers could consider putting up premiums to cover the cost. \"Claims from the current floods and storms are at a level where insurers will be looking at their finances to see what they need to do,\" he said. \"After the 2010 freeze we saw premiums rise by around 5% to cover the cost.\" That kind of rise would add between \u00a310 and \u00a315 to the average annual household insurance policy.

    "webTitle": "Ed Davey calls on Ofgem to investigate energy firms' gas profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Gas has hit back at claims that it makes excess profits after the energy secretary, Ed Davey, warned the company could be broken up if it was found to have ripped off customers. Shares in British Gas's parent company Centrica were the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index on Monday, after Davey named British Gas in a letter to the energy regulator Ofgem in which he called for an investigation into the profits the Big Six energy companies make by supplying gas. The Liberal Democrat urged Ofgem to \"think radically\", and consider breaking up companies if they were found to have abused their market power. The energy secretary wants Ofgem to examine whether energy companies' profit margins \u2013 in some cases five times higher for gas than for supplying household electricity \u2013 should be the subject of a market investigation. But Chris Weston, managing director of British Gas, said that the UK had \"one of the most competitive energy markets in the world, with gas and electricity prices among the lowest in western Europe\". Noting that British Gas' profit margins were on average 5% after tax, he said: \"About two-thirds of British Gas customers are dual-fuel customers, taking both gas and electricity, and the price of the gas is the same for all customers whether they are a gas-only customer or on a dual-fuel tariff.\" Davey's intervention is the latest episode in the political storm over energy prices following Ed Miliband's pledge in September to freeze prices and reform the market if Labour wins the next election. The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the move, saying that the business energy market was in desperate need of reform. \"Over 40% of all small businesses are with British Gas and it simply cannot be right that one company has such a dominant share especially given the price of gas now accounts for between five to 10 per cent of total business costs for nearly one in ten of the UK's smallest businesses,\" said the FSB's chairman John Allan. Davey has suggested the worst overcharging was for gas, rather than electricity. His view was echoed by Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP who chairs the energy and climate change select committee. Yeo told the Guardian: \"We are now seeing a few more independents coming into the electricity market. In gas you have got 41% dominated by British Gas, that is a very big share for one company to hold.\" Yeo welcomed Davey's intervention, but said the timing was surprising. \"This is not new information; it does raise the issue, what has Ofgem been doing in the meantime.\" The Conservative MP said he did not agree with calls to abolish Ofgem \u2013 proposed by Labour's shadow energy minister Caroline Flint \u2013 but said the regulator's remit needed to be strengthened. The executive director of Which?, Richard Lloyd, said Davey's \"hugely significant intervention\" increased expectations on the regulator. \"The pressure is now on the regulators to announce next month that they are taking the first steps towards a more radical reform of the energy market, and to give consumers confidence that they are paying a fair price.\" British Gas said it was complying with an independent market assessment being conducted by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), Ofgem and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Weston said: \"The current assessment of the energy market will be essential to rebuilding trust in the sector. We strongly support a proper, thorough and independent examination of the issues during this process.\" But Yeo said MPs on his committee were not entirely convinced by energy bosses' arguments on competition and profits. \"We have continued to feel that greater transparency is desirable even now, we haven't got as much information about some of their operations that we would like,\" he said. \"Where you have got vertically integrated companies selling energy to consumers, we need to make sure there aren't other parts of their businesses where they are making larger profits than would be the case if it was an open and competitive market.\"",

      "body": "<p>Outsourcing companies had a mixed day, with <strong>G4S</strong> very much taking the wooden spoon.</p> <p>The company - fresh from the tagging scandal where, along with <strong>Serco</strong>, it charged the government for electronic surveillance of criminals who were not being monitored, were in prison or even dead - dropped 6.1p to 229p. The fall was partly due to rival Securitas reporting lower than expected quarterly earnings and saying that signs of economic recovery in Europe and the US had not fed through to the security market.</p> <p>At the same time Panmure Gordon issued a sell note ahead of G4S's results next month. Analyst Mike Allen said:</p> <blockquote> We have reviewed our forecast assumptions and are now 5-11% below consensus earnings per share from 2013 to 2015. Our target price also falls to 200p, which is based on a more realistic multiple of 12.5 times 2014 earnings per share with return on capital employed of 10% which appears more appropriate. With 17% potential downside we switch our recommendation from hold to sell. <br> G4S faces a number of headwinds across different fronts with concerns over slowing growth in developing markets and weaker foreign exchange, further margin pressure in the UK and US together with further disposals required to deleverage the balance sheet. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Serco shrugged off a negative note from Shore Capital, closing 7.8p higher at 404p. Shore's Robin Speakman said:</p> <blockquote> With Serco's shares now trading at very depressed levels, and ahead of the results for the full year to December 2013, we note that a number of contract announcements are due which may lead to a short term 'bounce' in the share price. Firstly an agreement to extend Serco's Northern Rail Franchise with joint venture partner Abellio, which is due to expire on 1 April this year, out to 2016; this is worth some \u00a3300m in revenue and around \u00a335m in profitability on our forecasts for Serco. Securing the roll-over of this contract would be welcome indeed. <br> Secondly, securing the roll-over of the asset support contract for the Ministry of Defence at RAF Fylingdales, a small but technically important infrastructure. Thirdly, we believe that the UK government is due to announce the winner of the contract to manage the Defence Infrastructure Organisation in the near future, Serco's consortia (including Bechtel) is now bidding on equal terms to another consortia involving Capita.  Clearly, failure on the above contracts would be disappointing in the context of Serco's ongoing issues and the further profits warning of 30 January. We expect some positive news from the above, however. Longer term we believe that Serco faces a number of strategic headwinds deferring growth in earnings likely out to 2016. We would see any recovery in the share price in the short term as an opportunity to reduce weightings further therefore [our] sell is retained. </blockquote> <p>Subsequently the RAF Fylingdales contract was in fact re-awarded to Serco, although a deal to run London's community payback scheme appeared to have been ended a couple of years early.</p> <p>Overall, the week started on a fairly calm note after recent volatility, as investors awaited this week's testimony on central bank forward guidance from both new Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and the Bank of England's Mark Carney. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 19.87 points higher at 6591.55, a two week high.</p> <p>But <strong>Centrica</strong> closed 5.3p at 308.9p. The slide followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/10/ed-davey-energy-companies-gas-profits-british-gas\" title=\"\">energy secretary Ed Davey asking regulator Ofgem to investigate gas prices and the profits being made by the big six suppliers. </a>He suggested companies could be broken up if they were deemed to be too dominant, with Centrica-owned British Gas singled out in particular. Fellow energy company <strong>SSE </strong>slipped 6p to \u00a313.51.</p> <p>But a rise in the gold price helped push up Mexican precious metal miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> up 70p to 862.5p, while <strong>African Barrick Gold</strong> added 14.9p to 238.5p, helped by HSBC raising its recommendation from underweight to neutral and its target from 160p to 230p.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> was steady at 222p after reports it had made a \u20ac7bn offer for Spanish cable company Ono. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs resumed coverage with a buy rating and 275p price target. The bank said the mobile phone group was potentially both an acquirer and a target:</p> <blockquote> We believe the current share price fails to reflect the opportunities for Vodafone to improve its structural position via accelerated investment (driving weaker competitors to consolidate) and via fixed line acquisitions, which in our view are a prerequisite to restore industry pricing power. <br> Additionally, Vodafone is one of the only substantial assets available to potential industry acquirers seeking to build global scale, with the added attraction of \u00a3106bn of long-lasting agreed tax losses.  We identify $2bn-$7bn of potential annual synergies should Vodafone combine with a leading global operator. </blockquote> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> ended 3.3p higher at 275p as it rushed out a profit announcement a day before it was due, showing a figure of \u00a35.2bn, just below forecasts of \u00a35.4bn.

      "bodyText": "Outsourcing companies had a mixed day, with G4S very much taking the wooden spoon. The company - fresh from the tagging scandal where, along with Serco, it charged the government for electronic surveillance of criminals who were not being monitored, were in prison or even dead - dropped 6.1p to 229p. The fall was partly due to rival Securitas reporting lower than expected quarterly earnings and saying that signs of economic recovery in Europe and the US had not fed through to the security market. At the same time Panmure Gordon issued a sell note ahead of G4S's results next month. Analyst Mike Allen said: We have reviewed our forecast assumptions and are now 5-11% below consensus earnings per share from 2013 to 2015. Our target price also falls to 200p, which is based on a more realistic multiple of 12.5 times 2014 earnings per share with return on capital employed of 10% which appears more appropriate. With 17% potential downside we switch our recommendation from hold to sell. G4S faces a number of headwinds across different fronts with concerns over slowing growth in developing markets and weaker foreign exchange, further margin pressure in the UK and US together with further disposals required to deleverage the balance sheet. Meanwhile Serco shrugged off a negative note from Shore Capital, closing 7.8p higher at 404p. Shore's Robin Speakman said: With Serco's shares now trading at very depressed levels, and ahead of the results for the full year to December 2013, we note that a number of contract announcements are due which may lead to a short term 'bounce' in the share price. Firstly an agreement to extend Serco's Northern Rail Franchise with joint venture partner Abellio, which is due to expire on 1 April this year, out to 2016; this is worth some \u00a3300m in revenue and around \u00a335m in profitability on our forecasts for Serco. Securing the roll-over of this contract would be welcome indeed. Secondly, securing the roll-over of the asset support contract for the Ministry of Defence at RAF Fylingdales, a small but technically important infrastructure. Thirdly, we believe that the UK government is due to announce the winner of the contract to manage the Defence Infrastructure Organisation in the near future, Serco's consortia (including Bechtel) is now bidding on equal terms to another consortia involving Capita. Clearly, failure on the above contracts would be disappointing in the context of Serco's ongoing issues and the further profits warning of 30 January. We expect some positive news from the above, however. Longer term we believe that Serco faces a number of strategic headwinds deferring growth in earnings likely out to 2016. We would see any recovery in the share price in the short term as an opportunity to reduce weightings further therefore [our] sell is retained. Subsequently the RAF Fylingdales contract was in fact re-awarded to Serco, although a deal to run London's community payback scheme appeared to have been ended a couple of years early. Overall, the week started on a fairly calm note after recent volatility, as investors awaited this week's testimony on central bank forward guidance from both new Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and the Bank of England's Mark Carney. The FTSE 100 finished 19.87 points higher at 6591.55, a two week high. But Centrica closed 5.3p at 308.9p. The slide followed energy secretary Ed Davey asking regulator Ofgem to investigate gas prices and the profits being made by the big six suppliers. He suggested companies could be broken up if they were deemed to be too dominant, with Centrica-owned British Gas singled out in particular. Fellow energy company SSE slipped 6p to \u00a313.51. But a rise in the gold price helped push up Mexican precious metal miner Fresnillo up 70p to 862.5p, while African Barrick Gold added 14.9p to 238.5p, helped by HSBC raising its recommendation from underweight to neutral and its target from 160p to 230p. Vodafone was steady at 222p after reports it had made a \u20ac7bn offer for Spanish cable company Ono. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs resumed coverage with a buy rating and 275p price target. The bank said the mobile phone group was potentially both an acquirer and a target: We believe the current share price fails to reflect the opportunities for Vodafone to improve its structural position via accelerated investment (driving weaker competitors to consolidate) and via fixed line acquisitions, which in our view are a prerequisite to restore industry pricing power. Additionally, Vodafone is one of the only substantial assets available to potential industry acquirers seeking to build global scale, with the added attraction of \u00a3106bn of long-lasting agreed tax losses. We identify $2bn-$7bn of potential annual synergies should Vodafone combine with a leading global operator. Barclays ended 3.3p higher at 275p as it rushed out a profit announcement a day before it was due, showing a figure of \u00a35.2bn, just below forecasts of \u00a35.4bn. The surprise statement, following a comment in the Financial Times and a Morgan Stanley note on Friday, came as the bank was already in the news for leaking customer information. The full details are still due on Tuesday. Analyst Ian Gordon at Investec kept his buy rating: Apparently due to a leak, Barclays has been bounced into an early announcement of tomorrow's 2013 results. Adjusted pretax profit of \u00a35.2bn is 1% ahead of us (\u00a35,148m) but 4% below company-compiled consensus (\u00a35,408m). So even if there is a small miss against more frothy sellside forecasts, we are reassured that the 2013 outturn was marginally better than we expected. Clear valuation support remains. Insurers were under pressure on worries about the cost of the continuing floods across the country. RSA Insurance, which could reportedly tap shareholders for \u00a3500m as new boss Stephen Hester attempts rebuild its balance sheets, dipped 1.7p to 102.5p, while Aviva was 0.4p lower at 455.9p. Mothercare slipped 2.5p to 251.5p despite weekend suggestions Asda could be interested in its Early Learning Centre business. Finally Manx Telecom rang up an 18p rise to 160p on its first day on Aim. The company placed 110.1m shares at 142p with major shareholders including Fidelity, Blackrock and Artemis.",

That\u2019s the message from a Reuters poll of economists. Twenty five out of 27 thought the Bank would overhaul forward guidance with 16 expecting Governor Mark Carney to make a strong verbal commitment to low interest rates. Beyond that, the economists were split, with some expecting the Bank to lower its unemployment threshold for a rate rise to 6.5% form 7%, others predicting the addition of new indicators and some thought it might start to publish policymakers\u2019 expectations for interest rates. Carney will spell out his new approach to forward guidance on Wednesday along with the Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee said in August it would consider a rate rise only when unemployment dropped to 7% but joblessness has fallen far quicker than expected, leaving Carney needing a new way to anchor expectations for low interest rates.

In his testimony inside Court 19 of Dublin\u2019s Central Criminal Court today, Quinn told the jury that Anglo Irish Bank executives arranged for a meeting with him in September 2008 in order to persuade him to halt legal action against the bank. Quinn said the bank informed him that Anglo Irish was still \u201cin rude health\u201d and that they should \u201ccome to a gentleman\u2019s agreement and we would all live happily ever after\u201d rather than him taking litigation against the bank. The cement and insurance tycoon, who once employed more than 6,000 people, told the court he once regarded Anglo Irish Bank as a \u201cmarvellous institution\u201d and even when its share price fell by 40% in September 2007 he still sought to buy more shares in the bank. But Quinn told the packed courthouse how by the following year relations had deteriorated with senior Anglo Irish Bank executives. They had refused to let him hold a full meeting of the bank\u2019s board at the end of March 2008 when the share price was collapsing. After this refusal Quinn asked the to bank: \u201cAre we being told the truth?\u201d Quinn told the trial that By July David Drumm, the bank\u2019s former CEO, had forced him to agree that some of his shares would be sold on to Middle Eastern investors. \u201cI was not very happy about that,\u201d Quinn said. He was also asked by a defence lawyer for the Anglo Irish trio if he could confirm that he was once among the top 200 richest people on the planet according to Forbes business magazine\u2019s rich list in 2006-2007. The now bankrupt Fermanagh born businessman provoked laughter in the courtroom when he replied: \u201cHow times have changed!\u201d The latest on Barclays\u2019 surprise profit announcement: The FT used Morgan Stanley estimates in its look-ahead results story this morning. It seems the numbers were so close to what Barclays expected to report tomorrow that it felt compelled to announce them to the stock exchange. There doesn\u2019t appear to have been any regulatory pressure to do so. The numbers were: statutory pretax profit \u00a32.86bn (Morgan Stanley)/\u00a32.9bn (Barclays) and operating profit \u00a35.17bn (Morgan Stanley)/\u00a35.2bn (Barclays). Anyway, hats off to Chris Manners and Huw van Steenis at Morgan Stanley for getting very close to the actual numbers and inadvertently triggering this curious event. The technical trouble we had this morning came back, hence the lack of posts for the last hour or so. We hope things are finally sorted out now. Apologies. Switerland\u2019s vote in favour of imposing quotas on immigrants from the EU hasn\u2019t gone down well with Europe\u2019s major powers. It\u2019s also unnerved Swiss business. The referendum vote, won with a majority of less than 20,000, threatens to overturn a 12-year-old agreement ensuring free movement between Switzerland and the EU. Switzerland is not a member of the EU but it relies on immigrants from the neighbouring trading bloc for almost a fifth of its workforce. Big Swiss companies include Nestle and the banks UBS and Credit Suisse. Here is some reaction from Reuters\u2019 story: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius described the vote, initiated by the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party (SVP) and opposed by the government in Berne, as a \u201cworrying\u201d move that showed Switzerland was withdrawing into itself. \u201cWe\u2019re going to review our relations with Switzerland,\u201d Fabius told RTL radio. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman said that while Berlin respected the result, it would create \u201cconsiderable problems\u201d for Switzerland\u2019s relationship with the EU. The European Commission said it went against the principle of free movement between the Alpine nation and the EU that has existed for over a decade. \u201cThe EU will examine the implications of this initiative on EU-Swiss relations as a whole,\u201d the Commission said. Switzerland is not a member of the 28-nation EU, but a pact with Brussels has ensured the free movement of citizens to and from the bloc since 2002. The vote to reintroduce immigration quotas, backed by a razor-thin margin of 19,526 voters on Sunday, threatens that pact, and with it a key pillar of the Swiss economy, which relies on the EU for nearly one-fifth of its workforce. Switzerland is home to food and beverage giant Nestle , drugmakers Novartis and Roche as well as a host of major commodities dealers such as Glencore Xtrata and Louis Dreyfus Commodities. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of investing in Switzerland, when in the end it\u2019s not certain whether you can get qualified staff to carry out your plans,\u201d Valentin Vogt, president of the Swiss Employers Association, told the NZZ newspaper. He said the vote created toxic uncertainty for Swiss businesses, which already face pressure amid a foreign crackdown on banking secrecy and an outcry over the favorable tax rates some Swiss cantons offers to multinationals. Swiss banks including and Credit Suisse are especially dependent on the flow of foreign workers, employing up to 25% of overall staff from the EU. \u201cWe fear that the pool of available workers will dwindle,\u201d said Sindy Schmiegel of the Swiss Banking Association. \u201cIt could become much more difficult for banks to meet their staffing needs.\u201d Our technical problems appear to be over so service should return to normal. Apologies again. We\u2019ve had some reaction to Barclays\u2019 surprise early profit announcement. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, reckons a small miss (4%) compared with \u201cmore frothy sellside forecasts\u201d doesn\u2019t obscure the case for buying Barclays shares (his recommendation). Here\u2019s more (it\u2019s quite technical stuff): We must wait until tomorrow for the detail, though we continue to assume that any marginal disappointment against wider sellside expectations will have come within Barclays Capital where our \u00a311.7bn revenue forecast was fractionally below consensus. It is also likely that Barcap will account for the bulk of what we see as a Q4 cost \u201coverrun\u201d \u2013 FY13 underlying group costs are still guided at \u00a318.5bn (excluding \u00a30.2bn IB legal costs disclosed on 29 Jan) \u2013 in line with Barclays\u2019 previous target and consistent prior guidance, though worse than what we believe the business could (and should) have delivered. It\u2019s a busy day for Barclays, which is dealing with the fallout from the revelation that thousands of its customers\u2019 data files were stolen for use by rogue brokers. Sorry for the long gap between posts. We\u2019re having a little technical trouble which is still going on. There will be a reduced service till it\u2019s sorted out. More on Barclays\u2019 profit announcement. The figure released today shows that Barclays\u2019 profits will be slightly below market forecasts. Adjusted pretax profit for 2013 was \u00a35.2bn compared with a consensus forecast of \u00a35.4bn available to view on the bank\u2019s investor relations page. There\u2019s puzzlement about why the bank felt the need to release its numbers. The trigger was supposedly some figures buried on page 26 of the FT in a fairly general lookahead to Barclays\u2019 and Lloyds\u2019 results this week. Is this all part of Barclays boss Antony Jenkins\u2019s by-the-book policy or is someone coming down hard on Barclays from above? Anyway, the shares, which started the day up slightly, have gained a little after the announcement. They are up 1.05% to 247.5p. Barclays has just published its annual profit figure the day before its full-year results are due. The bank said adjusted pretax profit would be \u00a35.2bn, down from \u00a37bn last year, and statutory pretax profit would rise from \u00a3246m to \u00a32.9bn. Apparently numbers on the FT\u2019s week ahead page today were too close for comfort and Barclays had to release the figures for the sake of clarity. It\u2019s the second time in just over a week that Barclays has had to release figures that would normally have been in tomorrow\u2019s results. On 29 January the bank said it would take \u00a3330m of charges to cover the costs of regulatory and legal matters. With the main PBT number now out, there may not be much left to discuss tomorrow. Italy\u2019s industrial output fell for the first time in four months in December. Output fell a seasonally adjusted 9% from the previous month. The figure was worse than the predictions of all the 14 economists surveyed by Reuters before the announcement. However, Markit economist Chris Williamson points out that over the final quarter of 2013 Italy had its best growth for two and a half years. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is preparing to examine its own failings in economic forecasting during the financial crisis. In the OECD\u2019s words: Projections repeatedly over-estimated growth, failing to properly assess the extent of the slowdown and the weak pace of the recovery. It\u2019s releasing a report tomorrow, OECD forecasts during and after the financial crisis: a post-mortem, which examines its forecasting from 2007 to 2012. OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan will present the report in London. The OECD said: It looks back at the forecasting errors, identifies the key economic factors behind these errors and looks forward to how economic modelling and forecasting practices can be improved... By looking at past forecast errors, Mr Padoan will shed light on the evolution of the crisis while contributing to the debate on the role of austerity, the financial system and structural factors in explaining the prolonged downturn, notably in the euro area. Australia will have no car production in three years after Toyota announced it was closing its factory on the outskirts of Melbourne with the loss of 2,500 jobs. Toyota blamed the strong Australian dollar and competition but the Labor opposition and the unions said Tony Abbott\u2019s government had refused to provide long-term support to the industry. Here\u2019s an excerpt from our story, written by Lenore Taylor, Gabrielle Chan and Bridie Jabour: Coming after last year\u2019s announcements that Ford will cease production in October 2016 and Holden in 2017, the decision also means the end of a car components industry that employs more than 30,000. The company blamed the high Australian dollar and a fiercely competitive market for the decision, which it described as \u201cpainful\u201d. In a statement handed out to workers at the company\u2019s factory in Altona on the outskirts of Melbourne, Toyota president Akio Toyoda said: \u201cWe believed that we should continue producing vehicles in Australia, and Toyota and its workforce here made every effort. \u201cHowever, various negative factors such as an extremely competitive market and a strong Australian dollar, together with forecasts of a reduction in the total scale of vehicle production in Australia, have forced us to make this painful decision.\u201d The Abbott government insisted on Monday that unspecified new jobs will be created to help Victoria and South Australia recover from the job losses. But Labor and the unions blamed the closure on the Abbott government\u2019s refusal to guarantee long-term car industry assistance, paving the way for a bitter political contest over job losses and industry assistance as the parliamentary year begins on Tuesday. Prime minister Tony Abbott, who was announcing a royal commission into union corruption as Toyota was trying to reach him to tell him about the decision to close, said that while it was \u201cdevastating news\u201d the \u201cconstant focus of the Coalition government is to ensure a strong economy where the number of new jobs outweighs the number of jobs closing down\u201d. \u201cI am not in any way trying to avoid my own responsibility, but that responsibility is fundamentally to ensure we have a strong economy with taxes as low as possible, regulation as light as possible and productivity as high as possible.\u201d Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Abbott did \u201cnot give a stuff about jobs in Australia\u201d. \u201cWhile Tony Abbott was playing his political stunts today 2,500 workers lost their jobs \u2026 in five months we have seen the death of the Australian car industry and 5,000 manufacturing jobs lost \u2013 that\u2019s1,000 jobs a month,\u201d Shorten said. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has asked Ofgem to investigate household gas prices. He said the furore over energy costs had focused on electricity when evidence suggested the worst overcharging was for gas. Davey didn\u2019t mince his words. He called for a \u201cfull-scale market investigation\u201d and said the regulator should consider breaking up companies if they had abused customers. In his letter to Ofgem, Davey singled out British Gas, which evidence suggested had charged \u201cone of the highest prices over the past three years, and has been on average the most profitable\u201d. Shares in British Gas owner Centrica were down 2.9% at 305.25p at 08:30am, making the company the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. Fellow energy supplier SSE\u2019s shares were down 1.2% at \u00a313.40. Davey told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI want them [Ofgem] to think radically... There could be a number of remedies, including the breakup of some of these companies if they have abused their market power.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the main events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Growth in business activity in emerging markets slowed in January, according to a survey by HSBC released overnight. Markets have been volatile in recent weeks as investors have worried about a slowdown in China and other developing economies. Here\u2019s a clip from Reuters\u2019 story: HSBC\u2019s composite emerging markets index of manufacturing and services purchasing managers\u2019 surveys slipped for the second month running to 51.4 in January. It stayed under the 2013 average of 51.7 and well below the score of 64.1 posted last January. But the monthly index remained above the 50 threshold which marks the difference between expansion and contraction. Based on data from purchasing managers at about 8,000 firms in 17 countries, the survey showed signs of manufacturing and export revival in some countries but Chinese factory output fell below the 50 mark, Brazilian manufacturing growth slowed and output fell in Russia and Indonesia. Growth was stronger in India, Poland, Taiwan and Mexico. January services activity in the biggest emerging markets was at a six-month low. India and Brazil both posted declines, while growth rates in China and Russia were weak, HSBC said. HSBC\u2019s global head of emerging markets research, Pablo Goldberg, said the data showed a clear divergence in recovery pattern between emerging economies. \u201cAmong the winners, we have countries in a clear cyclical recovery that are being lifted by the improvement in the developed markets: Mexico, Poland and the Czech Republic,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cBy contrast, PMIs decelerated in Turkey, Brazil, Russia and Indonesia. These are among the countries where deteriorating external balances have prevented monetary easing or forced tightening.\u201d",

Given that 92% of $19b increased deficit for 2015-16 predicted in the MYEFO was also due to revising down expected growth figures, this increased expectation of growth when applied to the budget will alone see a huge improvement in the projected budget deficit. Coupled with the prediction for stronger inflation than was expected in November, the picture suggests treasurer Joe Hockey will be able to deliver a very much stronger budget position in May, all without having to do have done anything much more than take another swing in the hammock.

    "webTitle": "City bonus row reignites with Barclays to admit \u00a32bn in payments", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Controversy over City bonuses will be reignited this week when Barclays admits it paid its staff more than last year, fuelling predictions that the amount of bonuses paid out across the Square Mile since the 2008 crisis could soon hit \u00a380bn. Barclays is expected to reveal on Tuesday that its bonus pot topped \u00a32bn last year \u2013 more than it paid out in the previous 12 months \u2013 despite a pledge by its boss Antony Jenkins to show restraint on pay. Starting the reporting season for the high-street banks, Barclays will be followed in the coming fortnight by bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, as well as HSBC, in disclosing how much each has paid in bonuses for 2013. The payouts will come on top of the \u00a367bn that the Robin Hood tax campaigners calculate has been paid since the onset of the financial crisis. If the 2013 bonuses match the average of \u00a313.5bn paid each year, the total will top \u00a380bn by the end of 2014. This is more than \u00a31,000 for every man, woman and child in the UK and three times the \u00a320bn of revenue HMRC collected from the banks in corporation tax, the bank levy and the bonus tax combined during the same period, according to the campaigners for a tax on financial transactions. The Robin Hood tax campaign said: \"This level of handout in the state-supported financial sector is a national scandal. As the rest of us live through austerity, the City's age of affluence carries on regardless. \"This year's bonus season is set to be another stark reminder of just how obscene bankers' pay packets have become.\" According to calculations by the campaigners the bonuses being paid out could reverse all the \u00a311.5bn additional public spending cuts announced at the 2013 spending review, or eliminate 10% of the 2012-2013 budgetary deficit, or pay for the disability living allowance with enough left over to scrap the bedroom tax. This year's payouts will be the last before the European Union enforces a cap, limiting bonuses to 100% of salaries or 200% if shareholders give their support. Most banks are expected to ask their investors to back the higher proportion, including 81% taxpayer-owned RBS, and also to find ways to protect high earnings by devising third payments which count as neither salary nor bonuses. Barclays has starting telling those staff affected by the bonus cap \u2013 the most senior staff likely to be earning more than \u20ac750,000 (\u00a3622,000) \u2013 that they will receive a monthly role-based allowance. \"The UK government should stop cosying up to their friends in the City and stem the problem at source by ensuring the Square Mile pays more in tax. Current levies simply aren't doing the job,\" the Robin Hood tax campaign said. which It argues a levy on financial transactions would bring in \u00a330bn a year for the 11 nations about to introduce it in Europe. In the UK, which is not introducing the levy, it would raise as much as \u00a320bn, campaigners say. In December the Corporation of London, the local authority for the financial district, said the financial services industry had contributed \u00a365bn of tax in the 2012-13 financial year and that 1.1 million worked in the sector \u2013 nearly 4% of the total UK workforce. Barclays' 2013 profits are forecast at \u00a35.4bn, down on a year ago when Jenkins set out his \"transform\" plan to pull out of businesses that risked damaging its reputation and axe 3,700 jobs. This year further job losses are expected as the bank adopts new technology and cuts back its investment bank following last year's \u00a35.8bn cash call. It may also extend its plans to shrink the size of its investment bank; it has already pledged to cut its balance sheet by between \u00a365bn and \u00a380bn. Jenkins also said last year that he would set out eight commitments for the bank which would not necessarily be based on financial targets. His counterpart at Lloyds Banking Group, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has also begun to make pledges intended to \"help Britain prosper\". On Thursday, when the bank reports its 2013 results, he will set out the case for privatisation of the government's remaining 33% stake in the bank after he received a \u00a32.3m bonus on the back of the rise in share price last year. Last week he had to admit the bank's provision for payment protection insurance was rising again, to almost \u00a310bn. Banking standards will also be in the spotlight this week when Sir Richard Lambert, former director-general of the CBI, releases his draft report into banking ethics and standards.",

      "body": "<p>Controversy over City bonuses will be reignited this week when Barclays admits it paid its staff more than last year, fuelling predictions that the amount of bonuses paid out across the Square Mile since the 2008 crisis could soon hit \u00a380bn.</p> <p>Barclays is expected to reveal on Tuesday that its bonus pot topped \u00a32bn last year \u2013 more than it paid out in the previous 12 months \u2013 despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/feb/07/barclays-antony-jenkins-bonuses-revenues-fell\" title=\"\">a pledge by its boss Antony Jenkins to show restraint on pay</a>.</p> <p>Starting the reporting season for the high-street banks, Barclays will be followed in the coming fortnight by bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, as well as HSBC, in disclosing how much each has paid in bonuses for 2013.</p> <p>The payouts will come on top of <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-317190\" title=\"\">the \u00a367bn that the Robin Hood tax campaigners calculate has been paid since the onset of the financial crisis</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-429312819\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391958153653/Bonuspayments.png\" alt=\"Bonus payments\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bonus payments in billions of pounds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the 2013 bonuses match the average of \u00a313.5bn paid each year, the total will top \u00a380bn by the end of 2014.</p> <p>This is more than \u00a31,000 for every man, woman and child in the UK and three times the \u00a320bn of revenue HMRC collected from the banks in corporation tax, the bank levy and the bonus tax combined during the same period, according to the campaigners for a tax on financial transactions.</p> <p>The Robin Hood tax campaign said: \"This level of handout in the state-supported financial sector is a national scandal. As the rest of us live through austerity, the City's age of affluence carries on regardless.</p> <p>\"This year's bonus season is set to be another stark reminder of just how obscene bankers' pay packets have become.\"</p> <p>According to calculations by the campaigners the bonuses being paid out could reverse all the \u00a311.5bn additional public spending cuts announced at the 2013 spending review, or eliminate 10% of the 2012-2013 budgetary deficit, or pay for the disability living allowance with enough left over to scrap the bedroom tax.</p> <p>This year's payouts will be the last before the European Union enforces a cap, limiting bonuses to 100% of salaries or 200% if shareholders give their support. Most banks are expected to ask their investors to back the higher proportion, including 81% taxpayer-owned RBS, and also to find ways to protect high earnings by devising third payments which count as neither salary nor bonuses.</p> <p>Barclays has starting telling those staff affected by the bonus cap \u2013 the most senior staff likely to be earning more than \u20ac750,000 (\u00a3622,000) \u2013 that they will receive a monthly role-based allowance.</p> <p>\"The UK government should stop cosying up to their friends in the City and stem the problem at source by ensuring the Square Mile pays more in tax. Current levies simply aren't doing the job,\" the Robin Hood tax campaign said. which It argues a levy on financial transactions would bring in \u00a330bn a year for the 11 nations about to introduce it in Europe. In the UK, which is not introducing the levy, it would raise as much as \u00a320bn, campaigners say.</p> <p>In December the Corporation of London, the local authority for the financial district, said the financial services industry had contributed \u00a365bn of tax in the 2012-13 financial year and that 1.1 million worked in the sector \u2013 nearly 4% of the total UK workforce.</p> <p>Barclays' 2013 profits are forecast at \u00a35.4bn, down on a year ago when Jenkins set out his \"transform\" plan to pull out of businesses that risked damaging its reputation and axe 3,700 jobs. This year further job losses are expected as the bank adopts new technology and cuts back its investment bank following last year's \u00a35.8bn cash call. It may also extend its plans to shrink the size of its investment bank; it has already pledged to cut its balance sheet by between \u00a365bn and \u00a380bn.</p> <p>Jenkins also said last year that he would set out eight commitments for the bank which would not necessarily be based on financial targets.</p> <p>His counterpart at Lloyds Banking Group, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has also begun to make pledges intended to \"help Britain prosper\". On Thursday, when the bank reports its 2013 results, he will set out the case for privatisation of the government's remaining 33% stake in the bank after he received a \u00a32.3m bonus on the back of the rise in share price last year. Last week he had to admit the bank's provision for payment protection insurance was rising again, to almost \u00a310bn.</p> <p>Banking standards will also be in the spotlight this week when Sir Richard Lambert, former director-general of the CBI, releases his draft report into banking ethics and standards.</p>",
