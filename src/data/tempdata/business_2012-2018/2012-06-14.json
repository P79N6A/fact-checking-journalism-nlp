Thus ringfencing of retail operations within banks, rather than full separation, was judged to offer the best solution from a cost/benefit perspective.</p> <p>Second, Sir John Vickers, who chaired the panel, said the recommendations were not a menu of options for the government \u2013 they were intended to be adopted in full.</p> <p>It is alarming, therefore, to see further compromises slipping into the reforms after nine months of contemplation by the government. Leverage ratios for big banks will be lower than Vickers advised \u2013 instead of a 4% ratio of pure equity to gross assets, 3% will be allowed. Why? Well, 3% is the international norm, as determined by the Basel regulators.</p> <p>The dilution of Vickers' idea looks to be a lobbying victory for the big banks, especially HSBC and Standard Chartered, who play primarily on foreign fields and were grumbling most loudly about the threat to their ability to compete.</p> <p>But remember the specific nature of the UK banking crisis: it was so acute because the banks were so large in relation to the size of the UK economy. There should be a sound reason, then, for going further than international standards \u2013 the little old UK needs extra protection from the risks presented by so many giant banks.</p> <p>Vickers made the point in his response to the government's plan. \"The white paper proposals are far-reaching, but on some points \u2013 such as limits on the leverage of big banks \u2013 we believe they should go further.\"</p> <p>He's right.</p>",

Second, Sir John Vickers, who chaired the panel, said the recommendations were not a menu of options for the government \u2013 they were intended to be adopted in full. It is alarming, therefore, to see further compromises slipping into the reforms after nine months of contemplation by the government. Leverage ratios for big banks will be lower than Vickers advised \u2013 instead of a 4% ratio of pure equity to gross assets, 3% will be allowed. Why? Well, 3% is the international norm, as determined by the Basel regulators. The dilution of Vickers' idea looks to be a lobbying victory for the big banks, especially HSBC and Standard Chartered, who play primarily on foreign fields and were grumbling most loudly about the threat to their ability to compete. But remember the specific nature of the UK banking crisis: it was so acute because the banks were so large in relation to the size of the UK economy. There should be a sound reason, then, for going further than international standards \u2013 the little old UK needs extra protection from the risks presented by so many giant banks. Vickers made the point in his response to the government's plan. \"The white paper proposals are far-reaching, but on some points \u2013 such as limits on the leverage of big banks \u2013 we believe they should go further.\" He's right.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King has announced emergency measures to help banks and boost business lending after a warning from George Osborne that the \"debt storm\" raging on the continent had left the UK and the rest of Europe facing their most serious economic crisis outside wartime. In a joint proposal between the Bank of England and the Treasury, banks will receive cut-price funds provided they pass on the benefits to their business customers. This new \"funding for lending\" scheme could provide an \u00a380bn boost to loans to the private sector within weeks and alleviate growing fears of a second slump since the start of the financial crisis in 2007. In a second scheme the Bank will begin pumping a minimum of \u00a35bn a month within the next few days into City institutions to improve their liquidity. With one Spanish minister warning that the future of Europe could be decided within hours, both the governor and the chancellor used the backdrop of another day of financial and economic turbulence in the eurozone to express deep concern about the threat to Britain posed by Europe. As interest rates on Spain's 10-year borrowing hit the 7% level and Angela Merkel insisted she was running out of patience with her fellow eurozone policymakers, King told a City audience at the Mansion House, London, that there was a \"large black cloud of uncertainty hanging over not only the euro area but our economy too, and indeed the world economy as a whole\".

So much for allowing market forces to operate. The government is intervening directly to ensure that credit does not dry up.

Project Merlin, the scheme that was supposed to ensure commercial banks lent to businesses has now officially been branded a failure, and the descent of the economy into a double-dip recession has forced George Osborne to adopt more robust measures to get the economy moving. Better late than never. Perhaps even more worrying was lthe other initiative. This was King's announcement that the Bank will flood the banking system with unlimited amounts of cheap funding to see UK institutions through the \"turbulence ahead\". Threadneedle Street will start holding auctions of sterling liquidity with a maturity of six months, under which a commercial bank will able to park assets at the Bank of England and get short-term cash in return. What does all this mean? It means that the government fears that the crisis in the eurozone is coming to a head. It means that the government is worried about an event on a par, perhaps even more serious, than the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. And it means that it is convinced that immediate emergency action is needed to spare an already battered UK economy from a second deep slump within four years.",

      "bodyText": "A panicky Spanish government issued dramatic messages of impending doom for the eurozone on Thursday as its borrowing costs reached unsustainable levels and foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo claimed that the EU may need to act within hours. \"The future of the European Union will be played out in the next few days, perhaps in the coming hours,\" he said, according to Spanish press reports. The foreign minister, who was speaking as Spain's long-term borrowing costs hit an unsustainable 7%, warned that other European countries would suffer dreadfully if they let Spain fall. ''If the Titanic sinks, it takes everyone with it, even those travelling in first class,'' he said, in a warning clearly aimed at Germany and other eurozone countries. The interest rate on the country's benchmark 10-year bonds briefly hit 7% on Thursday, its highest level since the country joined the euro in 1999, after the ratings agency Moody's downgraded Spain's sovereign debt to just one grade above ''junk\" status. Moody's said the downgrade was due to the offer from eurozone leaders of up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a381bn) to Spain to prop up its failing banking sector adding considerably to the government's debt burden. Garc\u00eda-Margallo's comments contrasted with those of finance minister Luis de Guindos, who called for calm during an inevitably volatile period while Europe prepares to make key decisions on its future and waits to see how Greece votes on Sunday. \"It is not a situation that can be maintained over time \u2026 and I am convinced that we will continue to take more measures in the coming days and weeks to help bring it down,\" De Guindos told reporters, referring to Spain's borrowing costs, after senior cabinet members had met prime minister Mariano Rajoy. Government sources said that the EU president Herman von Rompuy was set to meet Rajoy, Germany's Angela Merkel, Italy's Mario Monti and Frrance's Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in a five-way meeting during the G20 meeting in Mexico on Monday. Barack Obama, who has been pressuring eurozone countries to act quickly in order to sort out the debt crisis, was also expected to meet the five leaders in Mexico. David Cameron may also join the meeting. The EU competition commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, was expected to get a chilly reception in Madrid on Friday when he flies in to meet Rajoy to discuss the bailout of the country's banks. Rajoy's conservative People's party (PP) has called for Almunia, a Spanish socialist, to resign after he warned that some Spanish banks may have to be liquidated. \"Rajoy is head of the People's party but, most importantly, he is the prime minister and in that role he will not be asking for Almunia's resignation,\" a government source said.

Spain will next week be able to say how much of the \u20ac100bn its banks really need. Rajoy has said he will wait for the results of two independent valuations of Spanish bank assets before deciding on a final sum. Those reports are due by 21 June, but Reuters reported that officials in Madrid already knew the contents of the reports and that Rajoy would have the figures with him when he travelled to Mexico. The final figure was likely to be between \u20ac60bn and \u20ac70bn, according to Reuters, though officials in Madrid refused to confirm the amount. Officials said that Spain wanted the banking loans to be delivered as soon as possible. \"\"No one is more interested than us in there being absolute clarity in our banking sector, and as soon as possible,\" a government source said.

      "bodyText": "Switzerland's central bank warned on Thursday that it was battling twin threats to stability of its economy from a weaker than expected banking sector and a rising currency that threatens to make its exports unaffordable. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) urged Credit Suisse, the country's second largest bank, to boost its reserves ahead of a potentially disastrous escalation in the eurozone banking crisis. The SNB said Credit Suisse should \"take all action necessary to expand its loss-absorbing capital base significantly during the current year\", by curtailing risky investments, suspending dividend payments or raising capital by issuing shares. The SNB also said rival UBS, which had to be bailed out by the Swiss government in 2008, should boost its capital buffers by limiting dividend payments. \"The SNB considers that the big banks' loss-absorbing capital is still below the level needed to ensure sufficient resilience,\" vice chairman Jean-Pierre Danthine said. Switzerland has come under seige during the euro crisis from foreign investors seeking a safe haven. An influx of funds has put intense pressure on the currency, leading the central bank to say last year that it would peg the Swiss franc against the euro to cap further rises. Funds, however, have continued to pour in, especially to Geneva, various ski resorts and the hedge fund managers' favourite destination, the canton of Zug. The SNB said it was determined to defend the cap of 1.20 francs to \u20ac1 and was ready to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities. \"Even at the current rate, the Swiss franc is still high. Another appreciation would have a serious impact on both prices and the economy in Switzerland,\" said chairman Thomas Jordan. \"The SNB will not tolerate this.

In a buy note, David Jeary at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The third quarter update saw an improvement in group like for like performance (-3%) compared with the first half (-5%). This was driven by the high street division despite a tougher comparative last year, and underlines both the resilience of the format and the strength of operational management.

Petropavlovsk is hosting a site visit this weekend, which could boost commentary after analysts eyeball the progress. A positive update has also lifted WH Smith by 12.9p to 484.6p despite the newsagent group saying like for like sales had dropped 3% in the first 15 weeks of the second half. But gross margins continued to climb, and despite the current uncertain economic outlook, the company said it was confident in the full year outcome. In a buy note, David Jeary at Investec said: The third quarter update saw an improvement in group like for like performance (-3%) compared with the first half (-5%). This was driven by the high street division despite a tougher comparative last year, and underlines both the resilience of the format and the strength of operational management. This will see us increase high street and group profits by \u00a31m. Recent share price weakness offers a good entry point for a more defensive format, with consistently high free cash flow and the added bonus of growth potential from the travel division. Brewing group Young &amp; Co lost 10p to 605p after activist investor Guinness Peat - which is gradually disposing of its portfolio of shareholdings - sold its stake for \u00a354m. It had previously held 15.39% of Young's A shares and 34.16% of the non-voting shares. Finally Oxford Advanced Surfaces added 19% to 10p on news of a joint venture with a global manufacturer to fund development of its anti-reflective coatings for use in electronic displays.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The author of the blueprint for banking sector reforms has criticised the government's decision to water down some of the main proposals contained in the report by the Independent Commission on Banking. Less than an hour after the government published a white paper intended to overhaul the banking sector, Sir John Vickers, who chaired the ICB, said the government should have gone further in adopting his committee's proposals to make the banking system safer by ringfencing Britain's high street banks from their riskier investment banking arms. He stressed that the tensions in the eurozone meant the government should press ahead with the proposals, and urged the coalition to resist any further pressure to backtrack on the reforms, which must be implemented by 2019. As much as a third of bank assets, or about \u00a32.3tn, will be inside the ringfenced banks in an effort to avoid another taxpayer bailout of the system. \"International events keep underlining the need for fundamental reform to make banks safer and to shield taxpayers from future risk of loss,\" Vickers said. He highlighted the government's decision to backtrack on the ICB's proposal to limit the risks big banks run, measured through what is known as a leverage ratio: \"The white paper proposals are far-reaching, but on some points \u2013 such as limits on the leverage of big banks \u2013 we believe they should go further. We welcome that the ICB proposals have been accepted in large part, but urge the government to resist pressure to weaken their effectiveness.\" Vince Cable, the business secretary, who campaigned hard for banking reform, said the reforms were \"pioneering\" and the crucial aim of a \"proper separation of the casinos from the ordinary banking businesses\" would be achieved. Vickers's intervention came after a rowdy session in the Commons during which Treasury minister Mark Hoban heralded the white paper as the government's move to ensure \"British banks will be resilient, stable and competitive, and so attractive to investors at home and abroad\". The government believed the proposals would cost the economy in the region of \u00a3600m to \u00a31.4bn a year for 30 years but that this would be outweighed by the benefits. \"Compare that to the estimate that the 2007-2009 crisis has already cost the UK economy \u00a3140bn, one hundred times the maximum cost estimate,\" he said. They will also knock between \u00a36bn and \u00a39bn off the taxpayer stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, although it is argued that this impact is largely priced in. RBS shares rose 3%, while Barclays was 2% higher after the white paper was published. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls criticised the government's approach. \"Why is the chancellor not making a statement?\" he asked. International regulations are setting a leverage ratio of 3%, but the ICB had called for the biggest banks to have a ratio of 4% in an attempt to limit the risks they take. This has been rejected by the government after lobbying by building societies. But banks will also need to hold 17% of their assets in loss-absorbing capital \u2013 a mixture of equity and debt \u2013 although in a major concession to big banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered this will not apply to international operations. Cable said: \"There is no overwhelming reasons why they should operate out of London. When you have good, well run players there is no point putting them at a disadvantage.\" In other signs of lobbying by the industry, operations inside the ringfence will be allowed to sell some derivatives products \u2013 already the subject of controversy \u2013 to small business customers. And in an indication of the complexity of what lies ahead for the banks \u2013 which face a bill of up to \u00a37bn to implement the reforms \u2013 banks will have until 2025 to split up their pension funds between their ringfenced and non-ringfenced activities. In a foreword to the white paper, Cable and George Osborne write: \"A zero-failure financial system is not our aim, nor should it be.\" Former investment banker Ken Costa said: \"Capital requirements, loan ratios, buffers, and ringfencing are important but not sufficient to restore confidence in our banking system. We also need a fresh approach from the banks themselves.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carphone Warehouse has warned that it expects the consumer environment in Europe to remain difficult as it forecast a decline in new sales due to weak demand for pay-as-you-go handsets. The mobile phone retailer said revenues at its European high street business fell by 5.5% to \u00a33.3bn in the year to 31 March, caused by an overhaul of its German arm and a drop in pay-as-you-go sales of up to 40% in some markets. Pay-as-you-go users are a low-margin business for Carphone Warehouse, which posted a small rise in pre-tax profit, but they are a significant customer base for the retailer. Carphone Warehouse said a lack of attractively priced smartphone products had contributed to the dearth of customers in the low-end pre-pay market. The company, founded by the retail entrepreneur Charles Dunstone, generates its revenues from signing customers up to mobile phone networks, reaping a commission and then a share of the subsequent revenues. The UK is its largest retail market, accounting for 800 of its 2,400 stores, but the retailer is something of a bellwether for the European consumer, with stores in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, the Netherlands, France and its second biggest market \u2013 Spain. A general shortage of household cash and confidence among consumers has hit the business, which has coincided with mobile phone operators cutting back on subsidies for pay-as-you-go customers because of a European Union crackdown on charges such as termination rates \u2013 levied on customers when they switch networks \u2013 and roaming charges that are imposed when travelling abroad. As a consequence connection volumes, or new sales, fell by 14% to 9.8m. About half the group's revenue decline was caused by the shift of its German business to a straightforward retail model after it ended its approach of acting as the front for a mobile network by carrying out billing, call centre work and other tasks. That move cost \u00a3100m in lost revenues last year. Predicting the current year for its European business, Carphone Warehouse said: \"We expect the consumer environment in Europe to remain challenging in the year ahead along with the continued effect of regulation and competition in the mobile market.\" Stripping out the one-off gain from the \u00a3838m sale of its stake in a mobile-phone joint venture with the US retailer Best Buy, Carphone Warehouse reported a 4% rise in pre-tax profit to \u00a358.3m, reflecting the low-margin value of its pay-as-you-go customers, in contrast with the more profitable customers who sign long-term contracts with mobile phone groups but make up a smaller part of the company's customer base. The other significant element in Carphone Warehouse, Virgin Mobile France, saw revenues climb 19% to \u00a3390m. Carphone Warehouse also demerged its TalkTalk broadband operation in 2010. Analysts at Singer Capital Markets predicted a positive response to the figures. \"The stock has fallen by 23% over the last 3 months but held up better in the last month, falling less than 5%. The shares could go better today given the recent slump,\" they said.",

The proposals are the culmination of two Unilever takeovers in 2010, when the group acquired the Alberto Culver business, the home of Tresemm\u00e9, for $3.7bn (\u00a32.4bn), and the Sara Lee personal care and laundry business.</p> <p>Tim Munden, vice-president of human resources for Unilever UK and Ireland, said: \"Unilever is a company doing well in the UK and around the world, and this is about how we continue to do well.

About 250 will be lost at Slough, which makes products including Radox, and 25 at the distribution site in Bridgend, which distributes personal care products. Unilever hopes to move 400 of its 600 IT employees at Ewloe to Port Sunlight, which will see its workforce rise by 500 to 2,000. However, 100 Ewloe jobs will go to Bangalore and a further 100 will be made redundant. The company said its plans would transform Port Sunlight, the home of laundry products such as Persil, into a \"significant centre of excellence\" for the manufacture of shampoo and shower gel, with growth potential for the next decade. The proposals are the culmination of two Unilever takeovers in 2010, when the group acquired the Alberto Culver business, the home of Tresemm\u00e9, for $3.7bn (\u00a32.4bn), and the Sara Lee personal care and laundry business. Tim Munden, vice-president of human resources for Unilever UK and Ireland, said: \"Unilever is a company doing well in the UK and around the world, and this is about how we continue to do well. If we were to do nothing we would not be able to grow. We realise this decision will have difficult consequences, but Unilever is committed to the UK.\" The move comes months after a dispute over pension changes with the Unite, GMB and Usdaw trade unions ended. Staff at Unilever's 12 UK sites had staged 12 days of strikes since last December in a row over Unilever's decision to close its final-salary pension scheme to existing members. The walkouts hit production of Marmite in Burton upon Trent, Pot Noodles in Crumlin, south Wales, and PG Tips in Manchester. Other products made by Unilever in the UK include Hellman's mayonnaise and, on the non-food side, Lynx, Sure, Persil and Comfort. Unilever said staff at the Slough and Swansea sites did not join the strikes.",

      "bodyText": "Spain's rightwing government came under pressure on Thursday to apply for rescue funds from Brussels after it became clear that the estimated \u20ac100bn (\u00a380bn) bailout of the country's banks had failed to prevent Madrid's borrowing costs from hitting new highs. The interest rate on Spain's benchmark 10-year bonds rose as much as 25 basis points to a euro-era high of 7.02%, breaching the level that triggered a collapse in confidence in Portugal, Ireland and Greece. Italy's flagging economy was also under the microscope after panic among international lenders at an auction of three-year bonds pushed the price of borrowing to 5.3%, up from 3.91% last month. Rome has succeeded until recently in convincing investors that a mix of austerity and economic reforms have put the country in a better position to weather the eurozone crisis, but political stalemate over deregulation of several markets and resistance to labour reforms, coupled with the longest double dip recession among the major eurozone countries has undermined the confidence of many investors. Stock markets fell on the news, with the FTSE 100 index dropping 26 points to 5457 at lunchtime. The German Dax was down 22 points at 6130 and the French Dax slipped 9 points to 3020. The jump in Spain's borrowing costs followed a downgrade by the ratings agency Moody's of three notches from A3 to Baa3. The cut in Spain's sovereign debt puts its credit status alongside Croatia and Azerbaijan with a rating just above \"junk\". Moody's said the downgrade followed the offer from eurozone leaders of up to \u20ac100bn to prop up its failing banking sector, which the ratings agency believes will add considerably to the government's debt burden. The downgrade will hurt Spain because organisations such as pension funds are mandated not to invest in assets with such a low score. Moody's said the Spanish government's ability to raise finance on the world's markets was being hindered by high interest rates, a situation which had led it to accept funds to recapitalise its debt-burdened banks. Some details of what the bailout might look like have emerged after European officials said they were considering selling off bank assets as part of the plan to prop up the Spanish banking sector. Brussels also sought to make it clear that Spain was likely to pay an interest rate nearer 8.5% on the loans under one plan under discussion, which is much higher than the 3% outlined in initial reports of the deal.

It is up 38.9p at 449.8p as it said its target for 2012 was now 700,000 ounces, up from 680,000, and it had commissioned two new processing lines at its Pioneer and Albyn projects. Analyst Peter Mallin-Jones at Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote> Better-than-targeted grades and recoveries at Pioneer in the first five months of 2012, coupled with earlier-than-expected capacity expansions at Pioneer and Albyn that were previously excluded from guidance, have given management the confidence to increase the production target by 3% this year. <br> We believe continued delivery of operational targets and smooth commissioning and ramp up should provide catalysts for the stock. Petropavlovsk is hosting a site visit this weekend, which could boost commentary after analysts eyeball the progress. </blockquote> <p>A positive update has also lifted consultancy group <strong>WS Atkins</strong> by 25.5p to 703p, while <strong>WH Smith</strong> is 12.8p better at 484.5p despite the newsagent group saying like for like sales had dropped 3% in the first 15 weeks of the second half. But gross margins continued to climb, and despite the current uncertain economic outlook, the company said it was confident in the full year outcome. In a buy note, David Jeary at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The third quarter update saw an improvement in group like for like performance (-3%) compared with the first half (-5%). This was driven by the high street division despite a tougher comparative last year, and underlines both the resilience of the format and the strength of operational management. This will see us increase high street and group profits by \u00a31m. Recent share price weakness offers a good entry point for a more defensive format, with consistently high free cash flow and the added bonus of growth potential from the travel division. </blockquote>",

It is up 38.9p at 449.8p as it said its target for 2012 was now 700,000 ounces, up from 680,000, and it had commissioned two new processing lines at its Pioneer and Albyn projects. Analyst Peter Mallin-Jones at Canaccord Genuity said: Better-than-targeted grades and recoveries at Pioneer in the first five months of 2012, coupled with earlier-than-expected capacity expansions at Pioneer and Albyn that were previously excluded from guidance, have given management the confidence to increase the production target by 3% this year. We believe continued delivery of operational targets and smooth commissioning and ramp up should provide catalysts for the stock. Petropavlovsk is hosting a site visit this weekend, which could boost commentary after analysts eyeball the progress. A positive update has also lifted consultancy group WS Atkins by 25.5p to 703p, while WH Smith is 12.8p better at 484.5p despite the newsagent group saying like for like sales had dropped 3% in the first 15 weeks of the second half. But gross margins continued to climb, and despite the current uncertain economic outlook, the company said it was confident in the full year outcome. In a buy note, David Jeary at Investec said: The third quarter update saw an improvement in group like for like performance (-3%) compared with the first half (-5%). This was driven by the high street division despite a tougher comparative last year, and underlines both the resilience of the format and the strength of operational management. This will see us increase high street and group profits by \u00a31m. Recent share price weakness offers a good entry point for a more defensive format, with consistently high free cash flow and the added bonus of growth potential from the travel division.",
