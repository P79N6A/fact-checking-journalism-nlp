    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Most of the world runs on oil, and the dramatic fall in the price of crude should provide the global economy with a huge boost. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has put a number on it, estimating that each $10 a barrel fall in the price lifts world growth by 0.2%. Since last June a barrel of Brent crude has more than halved in value, dropping by more than $60 \u2013 that\u2019s a shot in the arm for global GDP of 1.2 percentage points, or $800bn (\u00a3528bn) more economic activity in the world \u2013 as it slumped to below $50 this week, including a renewed tumble to less than $49 on Friday. Oil is still an essential ingredient in most manufactured goods, as well as powering their transfer from factory to shopfloor. But George Osborne demanded this week that suppliers pass on the benefit to consumers if the economy is to get the lift it desperately needs. The chancellor made clear that petrol retailers are in his sights, along with energy firms and airlines. He knows that petrol is a major cost for Britain\u2019s voters, who may be more forgiving of his austerity measures if their incomes can be made to stretch a bit further. With petrol prices falling below \u00a31.10 a litre since the New Year, the \u00a31 litre is edging closer. However, given that tax accounts for around two-thirds of the price of a litre, a steep fall in crude will not be matched exactly on forecourts. Still, a sudden collapse foreseen by few in the oil business or the financial community also creates losers. Producers, exploration companies and oil speculators have all suffered. One report found that 46 US oil and gas businesses had seen $1.6tn wiped off their values since last summer. Scotland is facing thousands of job losses, from riggers in Aberdeen to oil consultants in Edinburgh. Jim Murphy, leader of the Scottish Labour party, has said he would set up a \u201cresilience fund\u201d to help communities hit by the falling oil price, as Aberdeen city council warned the city faced \u201cserious issues with the falling oil price\u201d. The Saudi Arabian government, like most producers, must tap its financial reserves for billions of dollars to maintain public spending. The Saudis have the benefit of a $400bn stash to draw on, but Venezuela and Nigeria are among the spendthrift oil producing countries that have squandered their savings and must now consider making spending cuts because their state budgets require an oil price of more than $100 a barrel. Major oil companies are also facing challenges from the oil price, with BP cutting hundreds of jobs and its rivals suffering share price declines in recent months. It was clear to most analysts that the decline in Brent crude from its 2014 peak was the result of a slowdown in global growth, in part the result of unusually high oil prices. China\u2019s manufacturing engine has shifted down a gear while the eurozone battles to avoid recession and deflation. But as oil prices have tumbled, another factor has appeared as a more plausible explanation. Much of the money used to buy oil on the international markets is borrowed. This has proved a lucrative trade while interest rates are low. Markets are now betting 2015 is the year US interest rates will go up, which will make those oil trades more expensive. The US central bank is the one to watch because traders buy in dollars and pay interest in dollars. For a while they have been dumping oil contracts and sending the price spiralling downwards. So while supply has increased in the US and demand has decreased, especially in China, the changing mood of financial speculators is having the biggest impact.",

He knows that petrol is a major cost for Britain\u2019s voters, who may be more forgiving of his austerity measures if their incomes can be made to stretch a bit further.</p> <p>With petrol prices falling below \u00a31.10 a litre since the New Year, the \u00a31 litre is edging closer. However, given that tax accounts for around two-thirds of the price of a litre, a steep fall in crude will not be matched exactly on forecourts.</p> <p>Still, a sudden collapse foreseen by few in the oil business or the financial community also creates losers. Producers, exploration companies and oil speculators have all suffered.</p> <p>One report found that 46 US oil and gas businesses had seen $1.6tn wiped off their values since last summer. Scotland is facing thousands of job losses, from riggers in Aberdeen to oil consultants in Edinburgh. Jim Murphy, leader of the Scottish Labour party, has said he would set up a \u201cresilience fund\u201d to help communities hit by the falling oil price, as Aberdeen city council warned the city faced \u201cserious issues with the falling oil price\u201d.</p> <p>The Saudi Arabian government, like most producers, must tap its financial reserves for billions of dollars to maintain public spending. The Saudis have the benefit of a $400bn stash to draw on, but Venezuela and Nigeria are among the spendthrift oil producing countries that have squandered their savings and must now consider making spending cuts because their state budgets require an oil price of more than $100 a barrel. Major oil companies are also facing challenges from the oil price, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/10/bp-to-make-hundreds-of-job-cuts\" title=\"\">BP cutting hundreds of jobs</a> and its rivals suffering share price declines in recent months.</p> <p>It was clear to most analysts that the decline in Brent crude from its 2014 peak was the result of a slowdown in global growth, in part the result of unusually high oil prices. China\u2019s manufacturing engine has shifted down a gear while the eurozone battles to avoid recession and deflation. But as oil prices have tumbled, another factor has appeared as a more plausible explanation.</p> <p>Much of the money used to buy oil on the international markets is borrowed. This has proved a lucrative trade while interest rates are low. Markets are now betting 2015 is the year US interest rates will go up, which will make those oil trades more expensive. The US central bank is the one to watch because traders buy in dollars and pay interest in dollars. For a while they have been dumping oil contracts and sending the price spiralling downwards.</p> <p>So while supply has increased in the US and demand has decreased, especially in China, the changing mood of financial speculators is having the biggest impact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1420822213201/Brent-crude-oil-prices.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "European stock market have just closed, with chunky losses across the board. The French CAC and German DAX both fell by 2.2%, with traders worrying about this morning\u2019s weak industrial production data from both countries and the drop in German exports. The Spanish IBEX tumbled over 5%, partly due to Santander dropping 10% after a capital raising exercise last night. The Italian FTSE MIB lost 3.4%, in a nervous end to the week. There\u2019s also disappointment that the ECB is reportedly only considering a \u20ac500bn stimulus programme. In London, the FTSE 100 shed 68 points or 1.05% to 6501. And that\u2019s probably all for today, although I may pop back if any big news breaks this evening (assuming I can get online). Otherwise, good night, and have a good weekend. GW The oil price is falling too. Brent crude just fell below the $49 per barrel mark for the first time since mid-2009. Stock markets are ending the week in the red. The European indices are all down, led by France where the CAC has shed 1.75%. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 60 points or 0.9%, and shares are down on Wall Street too: From New York, my colleague Jana Kasperkevic has the full story on America\u2019s jobs report: The US economy appeared to be improving as the country added 252,000 jobs in December, with the unemployment rate dropping to 5.6%. The number of unemployed Americans declined by 383,000, which still leaves about 8.7 million people out of work. December\u2019s job report exceeded expectations. Economists expected the Bureau of Labor statistics to report growth of 240,000 in December, making the 2014 gains largest since 1999. Over the year, the job growth averaged 246,000 jobs a month \u2013 a significant jump compared to 194,000 in 2013. The \u201cunusual warm-yet-snowy December\u201d meant that weather did not have much impact on the jobs numbers, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. While job growth saw positive gains, pay is not improving. Average hourly earnings took a hit, decreasing by 5 cents in December, following a 6 cent increase in November. More here: US adds 252,000 jobs in December amid improving employment outlook Reaction to the US jobs report keeps flooding in. David Lamb, senior dealer at the foreign exchange specialists FEXCO, says America is outpacing the rest of the global economy: \u201dIf this recovery doesn\u2019t run out of steam, the Fed will come under increasing pressure to hike interest rates sooner rather than later. \u201cIt may only be concerns over the global picture that stops it from considering imminent rate rises.\u201d Kully Samra at Charles Schwab in London agrees: \u201cAt the moment the U.S. is the only party on the street. Where else are you going to go for growth.\u201d Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at McGladrey, suggests wages will pick up soon. Over in Greece, the left-wing Syriza party is holding a steady lead in the opinion polls, with just over two weeks to go to the general election. A new poll, being published by the Parapolitika newspaper, shows Syriza leading with 34.1% of support followed by the (currently) ruling New Democracy party with 30%. Back in Britain, the NIESR thinktank has just estimated that UK GDP grew by 0.6% in the final three months of 2014. That\u2019s a slight slowdown, but still pretty solid. That would mean that the UK economy grew by 2.6% during the last year - the best year since 2007. It could also be the fastest growth in the G8. In theory, wages should rise as the unemployment rate falls, as employers are pushed to offer higher earnings to attract and retain staff. But this isn\u2019t happening, either in the US or in Britain. Economists are struggling to adapt to this new environment, as Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital, explains: \u201cWages going into reverse while the economy and job levels improve is verging on the freakonomic. \u201cThe mixed signals in this data make it really difficult for the markets to digest. \u201cMore jobs than expected in December, and big upward revisions in October and November, but pay packets remain under pressure. \u201c2014 may have been the best year for jobs since 1999, but it\u2019s also the year in which the employment market went off-piste. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an economics that few economists recognise. \u201cWage anomalies aside, this is nevertheless a solid figure that we can at least enjoy without worrying about an interest rate rise.\u201cAll in all, this is as good a start to 2015 as we could probably have hoped for.\u201d Paul Dales of Capital Economics reckons the Federal Reserve could ignore the weak wage growth, given the steady job creation: Overall, there has been a clear acceleration in job growth since last summer, a faster decline in the unemployment rate, but few signs of faster wage growth. If the activity data continue to improve, as we expect, then the Fed may not wait for wage growth to rise and could still raise rates as soon as March. It\u2019s certainly possible. But don\u2019t forget that America\u2019s inflation rate has just fallen by the most in six years. Not the best environment to be tightening monetary policy.... Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, is optimistic that wages will rise in the months ahead as the US economy improves. If you ignore the monthly fall in wages, then this is a great jobs report, says Marketwatch. Not that simple, alas, for millions of lower-paid Americans. Tanweer Akram of Voya Investment Management reckons the Federal Reserve is still on track to raise interest rates in the middle of this year. He says: Job gains were fairly widespread and occurred in professional and business services, construction, food services, health care, and manufacturing industries. Akram also explains that wage growth was low because \u201cmost jobs growth is still occurring in low wage industries\u201d. That means earnings are barely outstripping inflation. Average hourly earnings rose just 1.7% over the past 12 months, while CPI-U inflation increased by 1.3% between Nov 2013 and Nov 2014. There\u2019s something for everyone in today\u2019s jobs report, says Rob Carnell of ING. On the upside: more people than expected were hired in December, and revisions to old date added another 50,000 new jobs. On the downside, the 0.2% drop in hourly earnings is \u201ca real disappointment\u201d, Carnell explains: If you want to raise rates, these numbers provide the ammunition you need in terms of payrolls and the unemployment rate. Historically, the Fed always thought full employment was at about a 5.3% rate. So we are insignificantly higher than that now. The rate of payrolls jobs growth is also lending weight to the \u201chikers\u201d arguments. Against this, with even less wage inflation than was apparent last month, the doves can argue that the unemployment figures are biased and giving a misleading steer, and argue against any near-term increase in rates. The US dollar has been volatile, as traders try to interpret today\u2019s jobs report. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s early take on the non-farm payroll: The U.S. capped its best year for hiring in 15 years with a healthy job gain in December and the unemployment rate falling to a six-year low. The data adds to signs of strength that contrast with sputtering global growth. The Labor Department says employers added 252,000 jobs last month and 50,000 more in October and November combined than previously estimated. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent and is at the lowest level since June 2008. Yet wage growth remains weak. Average hourly pay slipped 5 cents. And the unemployment rate fell partly because many of the unemployed gave up looking for work. The government doesn\u2019t count people as unemployed if they aren\u2019t searching for jobs. Bloomberg economist Carl Riccadonna points out that the fall in the jobless rate is partly because more Americans quit the labour force: Professor Justin Wolfers is worried by the lack of wage growth: City Index\u2019s Ashraf Laidi suggests the Federal Reserve won\u2019t feel more pressure to raise interest rates. And Michael Strain of American Enterprise Institute sees more spare capacity in the US economy: Healthcare, manufacturing, transportation and food services firms all expanded their workforces last month: Today\u2019s non-farm payroll shows that America has created more jobs in 2014 than in any year since 1999. This isn\u2019t a good sign. The labour force participation rate has dropped, to 62.7%, from 62.9% in November. That means more many working age Americans dropped out of the workforce. But there\u2019s some bad news too. Average earnings paid to US workers fell by 0.2% in December, dashing hopes of a 0.2% rise. Year-on-year, wages are only up by 1.7%. That\u2019s disappointing, showing that the recovery isn\u2019t feeding into workers\u2019 wallets. More people are getting jobs, but they\u2019re not getting the pay rises needed. More jobs were created in November than expected. The Bureau of Labor Statistics now says that 353,000 new employees were taken on, up from 321,000 initially expected. And October\u2019s reading has been revised up to 261,000, up from 243,000. The US unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6%, the lowest rate since June 2008. Breaking: The US economy created 252,000 new jobs in December. More than expected, showing American firms continue to hire staff. Nearly time for the last major economic news of the week - America\u2019s employment report for December. The Non-Farm Payroll will show the latest US unemployment rate, how many new jobs were created last month, and whether wages rose during the month. Economists reckon the NFP will rise by around 240,000. But there\u2019s also the possibility that November and October\u2019s data will be revised. A strong reading would be good news for the US economy, but might raise the chance of an early interest rate rise. That, though, would also be dependent on rising earnings..... It\u2019s due at 8.30am Washington time, or 1.30pm in the UK.... A quick recap. The European Central Bank is inching closer to launching a new stimulus programme. Staff have presented various options to the ECB\u2019s governing council, ahead of the meeting in two weeks time. According to Bloomberg, the programme could expand the ECB\u2019s balance sheet by \u20ac500bn. Financial analysts are sceptical that this would be enough, though. ECB sources have told Reuters that there\u2019s a stronger consensus that a quantitative easing programme is needed. The latest economic data have shown the need for fresh stimulus. German exports and industrial production both fell in November, and France also suffered a decline in factory output. And the UK\u2019s trade gap has narrowed, thanks to cheaper oil. There\u2019s a possibility that Russia could be downgraded later today, to junk status. As it\u2019s Friday, the main credit rating agencies will be publishing their latest decisions on several countries, including Germany, Portugal and Russia. Olga Budovnits, credit analyst at Union Bancaire Privee, reckons a downgrade is highly likely given Russia\u2019s currency crierir.. Budovnits told Bloomberg that: \u201cThere were massive and rapid changes to Russia\u2019s economic outlook in the last three months, driven by oil prices. This has caused a massive ruble devaluation, inflation and reduced access to credit.\u201d The WSJ has a handy calendar of rating decisions here. Reuters has just published its own report on the ECB\u2019s meeting this week, with a different take than Bloomberg. Here\u2019s the top lines: The European Central Bank is considering a dual approach to government bond purchases which would involve both it buying debt and sharing the risk across the euro zone and, in a nod to German qualms, separate purchases by national central banks. Sources familiar with the discussions said such a bond-buying option, also known as quantitative easing (QE), is among the tools the ECB is preparing ahead of its Jan. 22 policy meeting should it decide to act to address falling consumer prices and a growing risk of deflation in the euro zone. Several QE plans are under discussion and nothing has been decided so far. But the debate reflects the ECB\u2019s efforts to build a robust programme that meets German concerns about how much it would take of the risk yet convinces investors anticipating an unlimited money-printing pledge. Markets and many economists believe anything short of an unlimited money-printing pledge will fail to revive a moribund euro zone economy. The ECB Governing Council discussed the situation at a dinner on Wednesday night as it gathered for a regular non-policy meeting. One central bank source said there was \u201cclearly more of a consensus than before\u201d that QE might be necessary. \u201cOn the rest, there are still pretty much divergent views on the whole range of issues - volume, open-ended or closed, risk sharing or not, whether there are contingencies and which ones. It\u2019s still very open,\u201d the source said. Another central bank source said one of the options that was discussed was one where the ECB would buy a certain share of the total programme and in case of default the risk would be shared among national central banks depending on their capital share. The remaining part of the programme\u2019s volume would be bought by national central banks, but at their own risk. \u201cThere was no fundamental opposition against this option on Wednesday,\u201d said the source. \u201cThis could be an option, which the Bundesbank could go along with.\u201d But the source said there was no decision yet and the discussion remained very much open. \u201cThis is one option that is being discussed and it may go in this direction, but nothing has been decided,\u201d the source said. European stock markets have dropped since Bloomberg reported that the ECB is considering launching a \u20ac500bn stimulus programme. The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all down around 0.5%. Another sign that the plan might underwhelm investors. Bloomberg has also concluded that a \u20ac500bn stimulus programme wouldn\u2019t be enough to drag the eurozone away from deflation: Portuguese government debt could also be excluded from the ECB\u2019s new QE programme if it decides to only buy investment-grade bonds, as it has a \u2018junk\u2019 rating. A \u20ac500bn QE programme would not be enough, on its own, to swell the ECB\u2019s balance sheet towards its levels in 2012 when it topped \u20ac3trillion. That\u2019s Mario Draghi\u2019s stated goal -- although several members of the ECB\u2019s executive council refused to back him last month. Worth noting that many investors are dubious that a QE programme would do much good. Some analysts are cautioning that a \u20ac500bn quantitative easing programme wouldn\u2019t give Europe\u2019s economy enough of a jolt: The European Central Bank is considering a new \u20ac500bn quantitative easing programme to stimulate the ailing European economy, according to a story just published by Bloomberg. It says that staff at the ECB presented the proposal to the Governing Council this week. No decision has been taken yet. Under the plan, the ECB would buy \u2018investment grade\u2019 assets only, which would rule out sovereign debt issued by Greece, for example. That might allow the ECB to unveil the plan at its January 22 meeting, even though the Greek general election is three days later. The story is online here: ECB Said to Study Bond-Purchase Models Up to 500 Billion Euros Here\u2019s a flavour: European Central Bank staff presented policy makers with models for buying as much as \u20ac500bn ($591bn) of investment-grade assets, according to a person who attended a meeting of the Governing Council. Various quantitative-easing options were shown to governors on January 7 in Frankfurt, including buying only AAA-rated debt or bonds rated at least BBB-, the euro-area central bank official said. Governors took no decision on the design or implementation of any package after the presentation, according to the person and another official who attended the meeting. The people asked not to be identified because the deliberations were private. A 500 billion-euro purchase program would take the ECB halfway toward its goal of boosting its balance sheet to avert a deflationary spiral in the euro area. The institution is also buying asset-backed securities and covered bonds, and government bond-buying would be part of fresh stimulus to be considered at the Governing Council\u2019s January 22 meeting. Reaction to follow.... Here\u2019s an interesting factoid from today\u2019s trade data. The UK has recorded its largest ever trade in goods deficit with Germany, at \u00a37.8bn in the September-November quarter. That is due to a drop in exports, and a slight increase in imports, the ONS said. The report (online here) also shows that the UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods with non-EU countries shrank by \u00a3900m. The deficit with EU countries only fell by \u00a3100m, though. Britain\u2019s trade gap has shrunk, mainly thanks to the recent tumble in the oil price. The UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services with the rest of the world fell to \u00a31.4bn in November 2014, down from \u00a32.2 billion in October 2014. Britain imported \u00a38.8bn more goods than it exported, but also made a \u00a37.4bn surplus on services. The amount of oil imported fell by \u00a3700m during the month, the ONS said, meaning the drop in the cost of crude oil is having a beneficial effect. Britain\u2019s manufacturers have just posted their strongest monthly growth since April. Manufacturing output across the UK rose by 0.7% in November, and was 2.7% higher than a year ago. The Office for National Statistics says transport equipment, and basic metals &amp; metal product manufacturing, drove the increase. But the wider measure of industrial output fell, by 0.1%, due to a big drop in oil and gas production as North Sea oil rigs went offline for maintenance. This chart from German stats body Destatis shows how the country has steadily run a trade surplus over the last two years. There are more details here. The financial markets have not been spooked by the German and French data. The FTSE, DAX and CAC indices are all broadly flat, while the euro is hovering just over $1.18, near a nine-year low. The markets are still being driven by expectations that the European Central Bank will launch a new quantitative easing programme, perhaps this month. Today\u2019s signs of factory weakness shouldn\u2019t make that any less likely. The Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned by the French economy: This chart, from stats body INSEE, also shows how France\u2019s factories have been lagging for several years: The drop in French industrial production may indicate that the economy shrank at the end of last year, warns analysts at BNP Paribas bank. The big UK business news this morning is that healthcare company Circle has announced plans to pull out of its contract to manage Britain\u2019s first privately run NHS hospital. Circle blamed funding cuts, and a surge in demand for A&amp;E services, for the decision to walk away. The move comes as Britain\u2019s hospitals are gripped by the biggest emergency care crisis in years; the future of the UK health service will be a major issue in the run-up to May\u2019s general election: Here\u2019s Sean Farrell\u2019s full story: Circle in talks to exit private contract to run Hinchingbrooke Some reaction: Today\u2019s data highlights a broader trend; the eurozone\u2019s factories are producing rather less than before the financial crisis struck more than six years ago. This chart from Nordea Markets\u2019 euro economist Holger Sande plots the industrial production of the major eurozone countries, (where 100 is their respective level in 2008): On an annual basis, French industrial production was 2.6% lower in November than a year earlier. Oh dear. France has matched Germany with its own drop in factory output. French industrial production shrank by 0.3% month-on-month in November, dashing hopes of a 0.3% rise. The narrower measure of manufacturing output was worse, dropping by 0.6% It suggests France\u2019s economy continues to struggle, after several years of meagre growth or stagnation have pushed unemployment to record highs. Carsten Brzeski of ING has blamed geopolitical tensions and Eurozone stagnation for the drop in Germany exports and industrial production. Today\u2019s data provides further evidence that the German economy has not yet fully recovered from the soft spell of the summer. In fact, the German economy still counts its bruises. Nevertheless, in our view, the economy should gain more momentum in the coming months, benefitting from its very special stimulus package which almost came for free. The sharp drop in energy prices and the weaker euro exchange rate are without any doubt a blessing for the economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. The day has begun with some downbeat economic news from Germany. Industrial output across Europe\u2019s largest economy fell by 0.1% in November, rather weaker than the 0.4% increase expected by economists. Germany\u2019s finance ministry blamed weaker construction activity, down 0.6%, and a 2.5% tumble in energy production. On the upside, October\u2019s figure was revised up. BUT, it still means Germany\u2019s factories are producing 0.5% less than a year ago. And in a second blow, separate data shows German exports fell for the second month running, down 2.1% in November. Imports were up 1.5%, helping to narrow Germany\u2019s trade surplus. That indicates Germany is feeling the impact of the weak European economy, hitting demand for its products. I\u2019ll pull some expert reaction together now. Did Britain\u2019s factories do better? We find out at 9.30am, when the latest UK industrial production and trade data is released. French industrial production is due soon. The main economic data of the day, the US Non-Farm Payroll, is due at 1.30pm GMT. It is expected to show that another 240,000 or so new jobs were created across the American economy in December. While the stock markets are expected to be calm, after yesterday\u2019s burst of optimism sent shares rallying across Europe. Traders are still anticipating fresh stimulus measures from the European Central Bank, while fretting about the Greek election in a couple of week\u2019s time. Then at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank publishes its estimate of UK growth in the last three months of 2014. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

But the debate reflects the ECB\u2019s efforts to build a robust programme that meets German concerns about how much it would take of the risk yet convinces investors anticipating an unlimited money-printing pledge.</p> <p>Markets and many economists believe anything short of an unlimited money-printing pledge will fail to revive a moribund euro zone economy. </p> <p>The ECB Governing Council discussed the situation at a dinner on Wednesday night as it gathered for a regular non-policy meeting.

It\u2019s still very open,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>Another central bank source said one of the options that was discussed was one where the ECB would buy a certain share of the total programme and in case of default the risk would be shared among national central banks depending on their capital share.</p> <p>The remaining part of the programme\u2019s volume would be bought by national central banks, but at their own risk.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no fundamental opposition against this option on Wednesday,\u201d said the source. \u201cThis could be an option, which the Bundesbank could go along with.\u201d But the source said there was no decision yet and the discussion remained very much open.</p> <p>\u201cThis is one option that is being discussed and it may go in this direction, but nothing has been decided,\u201d the source said.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/moved_average/statuses/553519464210518016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Reuters turn... <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECB?src=hash\">#ECB</a> CONSIDERS DUAL QE APPROACH THAT INVOLVES ECB BUYING GOVT BONDS W/EZ RISK-SHARING AND NCBs BUYING AT OWN RISK -SOURCES</p>&mdash; Ioan Smith (@moved_average) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moved_average/status/553519464210518016\">January 9, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54afbaa9e4b0461a99f13a07\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-09T11:37:48.900Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Shares dip after QE report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets have dropped since Bloomberg reported that the ECB is considering launching a \u20ac500bn stimulus programme.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all down around 0.5%.

      "bodyText": "Further evidence of a slowing British economy came on Friday as official figures showed a surprise drop in construction in November and falling industrial output as oil and gas output declined sharply. But the data showed a bounceback in factory output that buoyed hopes for the manufacturing sector and good news on exports suggested UK companies could weather troubles in their biggest trading partner, the eurozone. Financial markets focused on the more downbeat indicators, taking them as the latest evidence the economy lost steam in the final months of 2014. The pound lost ground against the dollar as traders bet the Bank of England would be in no hurry to raise interest rates from their record low, given the mixed signals on the economy. \u201cDisappointing official data are adding to survey evidence which indicate that the rate of UK economic growth slowed towards the end of last year,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data analysts Markit. \u201cLooking at all of the official statistics and survey evidence currently available, the data collectively point to the economy growing 0.5% in the fourth quarter, down from 0.7% in the third quarter,\u201d he added. While economists said it was too soon to say whether the slowdown at the end of the year continued into 2015, the latest figures will be unwelcome to the Conservatives as they seek to convince voters that the recovery remains on track. \u201cOn balance, there is further evidence that UK growth is slowing as we head towards the general election,\u201d said Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC. Among the bright spots for the economy in a clutch of reports from the Office for National Statistics was the news that manufacturing output rose by 0.7% in November, reversing October\u2019s fall and beating economists\u2019 expectations for growth of just 0.3%. On the year, output was up 2.7%. But the wider industrial sector which also includes utilities, mining and oil and gas production, fell 0.1%. That drop was driven largely by a 5.5% fall in oil and gas output. The ONS said the weakness was partly down to maintenance work at two North Sea oil fields. Respected thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said following the latest industrial production numbers it estimated growth slowed to 0.6% in the final three months of last year, after 0.7% in the three months to November 2014. Separate official figures from the construction sector showed output fell by 2.0% on the month in November, defying economists\u2019 forecasts for growth and contrasting with surveys of the sector. The news on trade was more encouraging, however, as the ONS reported the narrowest trade deficit since June 2013. The manufacturing sector is still not back to its pre-crisis strength and exports have not grown as fast as the government would have hoped. Progress has been slow in the government\u2019s push to rebalance the economy away from overdependence on domestic demand, but some economists are predicting a strong 2015 for manufacturing. A drop in oil prices to their lowest level in more than five years has buoyed hopes for the sector. Maeve Johnston at the thinktank Capital Economics cautioned it was far from certain oil prices will remain so low, but the fall should help \u201creinvigorate the recovery\u201d. \u201cIndeed, if low oil prices are sustained, it should greatly reduce costs for the manufacturing sector, providing some welcome support over 2015. And sustained low oil prices would also ensure that the improvement in the trade deficit proves to be more than a flash in the pan,\u201d she said. The trade numbers beat expectations as the ONS reported the goods trade gap narrowed by \u00a31bn to \u00a38.8bn in November, as exports edged down but imports fell faster. Economists had forecast a \u00a39.4bn gap. The less erratic figures for the three months to November showed exports grew by \u00a32bn and imports shrank by \u00a30.5bn. The details showed exporters continued to benefit from targeting markets beyond the deflation-hit eurozone. Exports to countries outside the European Union increased by \u00a32.1bn, or 6.0%, in the three months to November from the previous three months. Exports to the EU decreased by \u00a30.1bn, or 0.3%. At the same time, the UK recorded its largest ever deficit with Germany, reflecting a decrease in exports and a slight increase in imports. The trade gap for goods and services taken together fell to its lowest since June 2013, at \u00a31.4bn in November.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy appeared to be improving as the country added 252,000 jobs in December, with the unemployment rate dropping to 5.6%. The number of unemployed Americans declined by 383,000, which still leaves about 8.7 million people out of work. December\u2019s job report exceeded expectations. Economists expected the Bureau of Labor statistics to report growth of 240,000 in December, making the 2014 gains largest since 1999. Over the year, the job growth averaged 246,000 jobs a month \u2013 a significant jump compared to 194,000 in 2013. The \u201cunusual warm-yet-snowy December\u201d meant that weather did not have much impact on the jobs numbers, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. While job growth saw positive gains, pay is not improving. Average hourly earnings took a hit, decreasing by 5 cents in December, following a 6-cent increase in November. Goldman analysts predicted gains of 230,000 jobs and average hourly earning going up by 0.1%. Overall, the average hourly earnings for all workers rose 1.7% in 2014, which according to Goldman is \u201cstill below the 3% - 4% rate that Fed chair Janet Yellen identified as normal\u201d. Without the 3% to 4% wage growth, average workers will not benefit from the economic growth, the Economic Policy Institute said. The number of American workers who wanted a full-time job but were only able to find a part-time job remained unchanged at 6.8 million. About 7.3 million Americans held more than one job. That\u2019s means about 374,000 more people who took on a second job since 2013. About 3.9 million of them had one full-time job and one part-time job. The number of Americans participating in the labor force in December declined by 776,000, causing the labor participation rate to drop to 62.5% from 62.8%. Participation rate for black Americans was even lower, at 61.3%. Their unemployment rate was 10.4%, which more than double the white unemployment rate of 4.8%. The job gains of the past few months have not gone unnoticed and as both Democrats and Republicans prepare for 2016, they look to take credit for the improving economy. \u201c2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. We\u2019ve had 57 straight months of private sector job growth, created nearly 11 million new jobs,\u201d Barack Obama said on Thursday while visiting Phoenix, Arizona. \u201cSince 2010, we\u2019ve put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every advanced economy combined.\u201d Earlier this week while visiting Ford assembly plant in Detroit, the president especially lauded job creation in manufacturing. Car sales jumped 6% last year to the highest level since 2006, according to Autodata Corp. Analysts forecast that sales will reach 17m this year, near the record of 17.3m set in 2000. That should lead to more jobs at automakers, parts suppliers and dealers. \u201cDemand for autos remains robust. Low interest rates, falling gasoline prices and pent-up demand [are] driving sales,\u201d Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at McGladrey, said in a presentation on Wednesday. Brusuelas expects the jobs growth to continue into 2015, but pointed out that long-term underemployment and unemployment remain a challenge. In December the number Americans who were unemployed for over 27 weeks \u201cwas essentially unchanged at 2.8 million\u201d, reported the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That accounts for 31.9% of the unemployed. Not everyone is sure that the growth will continue. \u201cIt is doubtful that hiring will be sustained at this pace for much longer,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. According to Markit\u2019s research, the economy is losing momentum as companies grow more concerned about the economic outlook at home and abroad. Those fears are not unfounded. Europe is barely growing, and its unemployment rate is nearly double the US level. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is in recession. Russia\u2019s economy is cratering as oil prices plummet. China is straining to manage a slowdown. Brazil and others in Latin America are struggling. Fears about significantly cheaper oil spooked investors earlier this week before financial markets recovered. But most economists remain optimistic that lower energy prices will benefit US consumers and many businesses and give the American economy a further boost.",
