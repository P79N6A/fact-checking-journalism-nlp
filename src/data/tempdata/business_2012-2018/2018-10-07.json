      "bodyText": "Reading Jim O\u2019Neill\u2019s piece (I\u2019m an ex-Tory minister: only Labour grasps the public mood, 5 October), one might initially wonder what he was doing in the Tory party. He notes that austerity has \u201cbecome an end in itself\u201d without \u201csome broader purpose\u201d, apparently failing to grasp that ongoing cuts lead to the Tory nirvana of a smaller state. But what still reveals his Conservatism is his veiled attack, at odds with the facts, on Labour\u2019s fiscal and monetary credibility. Larry Elliott recently exploded the myth that overspending governments were to blame for the crash: public sector debt played no causal role. And after the 2008 banking crisis, Labour\u2019s stimulus initiatives gave Britain four successive quarters of growth, a success still not achieved by any Tory-led government since 2010. David Murray Wallington, Surrey \u2022 Jim O\u2019Neill provides a balanced commentary on the financial policies of both Labour and the Tories. One thing worth remembering is that, in a modern trading economy, all wealth derives from the consumer. When the consumer has too little money to spend, an economy, national or international, will decay. Austerity, Brexit, changes in taxation, budget deficits \u2013 all will create a dependence that is difficult to reverse in a democracy. The greater a nation\u2019s inequality, the greater the pain of any reversal. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire \u2022 Jim O\u2019Neill suggests that \u201cTheresa May needs to follow through on her claim that austerity is nearly over\u201d. He would do well to ask the question, as would we all: \u201cJust how have you been affected by austerity, Theresa?\u201d The same could be asked of any of those rightwing commentators smugly telling us that austerity was necessary. Brian Woolland Salisbury, Wiltshire \u2022 Nicholas Shaxson\u2019s piece (The finance curse, 5 October) is a warning to the country as a whole against nurturing a finance industry which is sucking the lifeblood out of our economy. But reading it where I live, Thanet in east Kent, it feels like a piece of sickening surrealism. We are just 80 miles from the City of London, the so-called financial powerhouse of Britain, the key to our national prosperity \u2013 but we are one of the poorest communities in the country. Over a third of our children live below the poverty line; in one ward it is over half. Our services are being run down. Despite being an area of breathtaking coastal beauty and plentiful human creative talent, the majority of our people face spiralling decline. Our only hope is regime change in the shape of Corbyn and co \u2013 but will it come soon enough? Norman Thomas Save Our NHS In Kent \u2022 Nicholas Shaxson\u2019s case that the City of London is harmful to the UK\u2019s economy can be summarised briefly by going back to first principles. Money has no value in itself. Its primary function is to facilitate trade, exchange of goods and services to mutual benefit. But the vast majority of the money that flows around the world today has no such purpose. Buying and selling money for its own sake is parasitic on the real economy. Thatcher\u2019s abolition of controls on capital led directly to the present situation. Frank Jackson Harlow, Essex \u2022 Has James Walsh, Liberal Democrat group leader of West Sussex county council, attacking the Tories for \u201cthe savage cuts of the past few years\u201d (Letter, 5 October), forgotten that between 2010 and 2015 his party was in coalition with the Tories and happily pushing through the cuts? We haven\u2019t. Dr Harry Harmer Shrewsbury, Shropshire \u2022 \u201cBack me on Brexit and I will end decade of austerity, pledges May\u201d (4 October)?

      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, has called for the introduction of an \u201cAmazon tax\u201d on online sales to prevent more high street chains from going to the wall. The boss of the UK\u2019s largest retailer said the chancellor, Philip Hammond, should impose a 2% charge on goods sold online and said the failure to tax digital firms properly was now an \u201cindustry\u201d issue. \u201cThree years ago I talked about a potential lethal cocktail of pressures in the retail industry and now you are seeing that come to fruition,\u201d Lewis said in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. \u201cThe tax burden has reached the point where companies are going bust. Has the government thought through what happens when retail starts to decline and if the job losses start to become significant?\u201d Lewis said it is time to \u201cshift the burden of raising the country\u2019s income\u201d away from store chains. At last week\u2019s Tory conference, Hammond conceded the time was approaching when the government would need to tax internet companies such as Amazon and Google. \u201cThe global internet giants must contribute fairly to funding our public services,\u201d he said. The best way to tax international companies was through global agreements, Hammond said but added: \u201cThe time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a digital services tax of its own.\u201d The government has previously said it was considering taxing the revenues of internet firms such as Facebook and Google until international tax rules are changed to cope with digital firms that can shift sales and profits between jurisdictions. There have been a series of high-profile retail failures this year, including House of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us, while household names such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Carpetright and Mothercare have together announced hundreds of store closures. Lewis said traditional retailers are caught in a stranglehold of rising costs, taxes, higher wages and competition from aggressive online firms. Last year\u2019s business rates revaluation, which added \u00a3226m to the retail sector\u2019s burden, has been the final straw for some retailers.",

However, the party\u2019s over and 2018 will be the last summer of love for Club 18-30: its owner Thomas Cook is retiring a brand that once attracted hundreds of complaints after using the advertising slogan \u201cBeaver Espana\u201d to attract bookings. The tour operator had put the name, which has been going since the 60s, up for sale in the spring but has decided to axe it after offers fell short of its expectations. \u201cWe are increasingly focused on our core own-brand hotel portfolio and feel that the Club 18-30 brand no longer fits in with our wider programme,\u201d said Ingo Burmester, the UK chief executive of the high street tour operator. \u201cHaving taken the summer to explore our options we have, in the absence of a viable alternative that makes sense for Thomas Cook or the brand, decided that Club 18-30 will close at the end of this season.\u201d The decision means that holidaymakers booked to fly from Manchester to Magaluf on Mallorca on 27 October will be on the last Club 18-30 trip. The company said the small number of permanent Thomas Cook staff working on the brand would be offered alternative roles, while its reps were employed on seasonal contracts and could apply for other work next year. The rise of low-cost airlines and online travel agents has forced a rethink at Thomas Cook. The company made its name selling package holidays but now finds cost-conscious holidaymakers are increasingly happy to use the web to plan their own itineraries. Thomas Cook\u2019s shares plunged 25% last month when it issued a profit warning after the European summer heatwave led to a fall in demand for last-minute foreign trips. Annual profits are expected to come in at \u00a3280m, down from previous estimates of \u00a3323m. The shares have lost more than half of their value this year and last week hit their lowest level since the 2016 EU referendum. Thomas Cook has already moved on from Club 18-30 with the recent launch of the more upmarket brand Cook\u2019s Club, which is aimed at millennials. Rather than sex and sangria, the trendy advertising blurb for Cook\u2019s Club promises holidays where you can sample a \u201cmelting pot of cultures\u201d and fill up on affordable \u201cvegan delights\u201d.",

Steven Day, a co-founder of Pure Planet, an app-based renewable energy supplier, warned that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU was the biggest political issue facing the energy sector at the moment. \u201cThe very short-term stuff is the fog of Brexit. That is causing a major problem in terms of what costs consumers will face in 2019. If the pound gets devalued further, energy prices will go up again. That is unequivocal,\u201d he said. The UK only imports a small amount of electricity, around 6% of supplies, but imports more than half its gas, meaning the country pays more for the fuel when sterling weakens. The pound has repeatedly fallen at signs that a no-deal Brexit is more likely. Day, a former telecoms executive, said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d the pound\u2019s devaluation was a key factor behind a series of price increases that have hit millions of households this year, as suppliers blamed rising wholesale prices. Further increases in wholesale costs were likely, he said, which would prove a challenge for the government\u2019s price cap that takes effect at the end of the year. The co-founder said the market was very different from when he launched his green energy supplier a year ago because the cost of energy was now a \u201cbig barrier\u201d for anyone considering joining the market\u2019s 60-plus suppliers. \u201cThe days of the independent sector expanding are over, at least temporarily, while the market consolidates a little bit,\u201d he said. Day said he was concerned that an exemption in the price cap, which allows green tariffs to breach the limit, could hold back the UK\u2019s switch to renewables. It is not yet clear if any firms will apply for the exemption but if they did it could affect the perception of green energy, he suggested. \u201cIt reinforces the idea that green has to be more expensive \u2026 and that will slow down the shift to green energy.\u201d BP holds a 24% stake in Pure Planet, which is on track to hit more than 75,000 customers by the end of the year.",

      "bodyText": "The quack doctors rolled into town just as the global economy had come off the critical list. It was 2009 and the message from the austerity medicine show was simple: the only way back to full health was a course of heavy-duty cuts. Expert opinion was divided. There were other diagnoses available. There were economists who said austerity was the equivalent of going back to the days of blood-letting \u2013 but they lost the argument. The prescription, though it varied a bit from country to country, was pretty much the same across the developed world: get those budget deficits down. The upshot was that the global economy had a relapse and has never fully recovered. Officials at the International Monetary Fund, which meets for its annual meeting in Bali this week, eventually admitted that they had underestimated the power of fiscal policy \u2013 taxes and spending \u2013 to boost growth when every country was struggling and interest rates were already at rock-bottom levels. What\u2019s more, because austerity choked off growth it took longer than expected to bring budget deficits under control. Voters who had initially been seduced by the idea that everybody needed to do a bit of belt-tightening grew sick of austerity as the consequences of year after year of austerity became increasingly visible. Even so, the argument between the practitioners of austerity and their opponents continues. It is going on between Theresa May, who says austerity is over, and the UK Treasury, which says it isn\u2019t. It is going on between the EU and Italy. And it is going on in academia, between those who think every pound spent by the public sector is a pound unavailable for the private sector, and those who think the idea that you can expand the economy through cuts when it is struggling is a contradiction in terms. Nor is this a debate exclusive to economists. Eyebrows were raised among health professionals last month at the news that UK life expectancy in 2015 to 2017 had remained virtually unchanged on the previous three years \u2013 the first time this had happened since the early 1980s. Given that the early 1980s was also a time of deep economic recession, there has inevitably been speculation that austerity is to blame for the stalling of life expectancy. In truth, it is too early to draw that conclusion but it is certainly the case that pressures on the NHS have been mounting, even with a ring-fenced budget. Health spending has been flat in real terms since 2010, once a rising population is taken into account \u2013 easily the least generous settlement in its 70-year life. Better examples of the impact of austerity on health are provided by other countries. The shock treatment handed to Russia after the end of communism in the early 1990s resulted in life expectancy plunging, particularly among men. More recently, an article in the Lancet by researchers from the University of Washington has analysed the impact of austerity on life expectancy in Greece. The findings make grim reading. Greece, which endured a slump longer and deeper than the Great Depression in the US, was forced by the so-called troika of the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank to cut health expenditure at a time when other European countries were raising theirs. Under Greece\u2019s bailout, health spending fell from 9.8% of GDP in 2008 to 8.1% in 2014, a time when national output was contracting rapidly. The country\u2019s death rate had risen by about 5.6% in the decade running up to the first bailout in 2010 but then jumped by 17.6% in the six years that followed. The rate rose three times faster than the rate in Western Europe overall. Much of the increase in all-age mortality was concentrated in adults, while the Lancet article notes: \u201cMany of the causes of death that increased in Greece are potentially responsive to care, including HIV, neoplasms, cirrhosis, neurological disorders, chronic kidney disease, and most types of cardiovascular disease. Improvements in child mortality in Greece have also stagnated since 2000, with increases in deaths due to neonatal haemolytic disease and neonatal sepsis since 2010, both of which might also reflect reduced health system performance.\u201d One reason for rising mortality rates could be an ageing population, which is affecting many other countries as well as Greece. This has been exacerbated by the brain drain of younger workers looking for a better life. However, the Lancet article says the rise in mortality is not solely down to demographics because there have been increases in deaths of children under the age of five, suicides among adolescents and younger adults and several treatable cancers in younger adults. The troika\u2019s austerity programme helped French and German banks avoid losses on their loans but at the expense of a rising Greek death rate. That has resulted in 50% less public hospital funding in 2015 than 2009, hospitals being left without basic supplies, the long-term unemployed stripped of their health insurance and those on low pay finding drugs more expensive because of a 20% cut in the minimum wage. The number of individuals with unmet healthcare needs has nearly doubled since 2010, with a considerable fraction reporting cost as the main reason for not receiving the recommended healthcare services. Greece is not short of healthcare expertise. It has the second highest number of doctors per 1,000 people in the EU but that medical workforce has been forced to watch impotently as the health system has descended into chaos and people have died when they could have been saved. For the past eight years, Greece has been used in a laboratory experiment to test out a theory. The evidence from the report in the Lancet could hardly be clearer. Austerity kills.",

It has the second highest number of doctors per 1,000 people in the EU but that medical workforce has been forced to watch impotently as the health system has descended into chaos and people have died when they could have been saved.</p> <p>For the past eight years, Greece has been used in a laboratory experiment to test out a theory. The evidence from the report in the Lancet could hardly be clearer. Austerity kills.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I know that Theresa May is beleaguered on all sides \u2013 not least her own \u2013 but did she realise what she was saying when she \u201cwarned\u201d the Conservative conference that divisions over Brexit \u201ccould stop the UK leaving entirely\u201d? Since stopping the UK leaving entirely is just what we Remainers wish to achieve, one can but marvel at the prime minister\u2019s pronouncement. I am tempted to add \u201clong live the divisions\u201d, but the truth is that the sooner this Brexit fantasy is put to rest, the better. My old friend Sir Mike Rake, the former president of the CBI, recently warned a City audience that we were on the verge of an economic and constitutional crisis. He is not given to hyperbole, and speaks for many businesspeople who live in the real world, and not on the Planet Fantasy occupied by Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and their ilk. It was bad enough when the chancellor, Philip Hammond, held out the prospect last week of a \u201cdeal dividend\u201d the Treasury cannot possibly believe in. There is hardly a respected economic institution that concludes, after rigorous analysis, that Brexit would do anything other than reduce the British economy\u2019s underlying growth rate. Far from there being a prospective dividend from Brexit, the government\u2019s own analysis earlier this year concluded that any form of Brexit would in effect be an own goal. Over a 15-year period the so-called Canada-type free-trade deal could result in a loss of almost 5% of GDP, and Theresa May\u2019s \u201cno deal\u2019s better than a bad deal\u201d, relying on WTO rules, would be likely to result in a loss of almost 8%. Even the much-discussed Norway option \u2013 continued membership of the European Economic Area \u2013 would involve a loss of 1.6%, as well as a loss of influence over EU decisions. There is no such thing as a Brexit dividend. The only possible dividend would result from the abandonment of the entire Brexit project so that investment which has been held up during this period of dreadful uncertainty can be implemented. As for those markets outside the EU, all the evidence from trade experts is that proximity of markets is what really matters. Sir Brian Unwin, honorary president of the European Investment Bank, pointed out in a recent lecture: \u201cIronically, in view of the fanciful talk of switching from Europe to become a more global trading nation \u2026 over the past year exports and imports to and from the EU have increased faster than those goods to and from non-EU countries.\u201d Another Brexit dividend, we are told, is that it would herald the end of austerity. Older readers will know that I regard the austerity policy as having been misconceived from the start. Indeed, it has contributed to the reduction in the UK\u2019s underlying growth rate, as well as to the erosion of public services. We don\u2019t need Brexit to end austerity. In which context I think the leaders of both main parties should take note of an article earlier this year in the journal of the Royal Economic Society by the veteran British economist Robert Neild. In To Tax or Not to Tax? The Truth about Taxation, Professor Neild tells it as it is: \u201cIn Britain public services are falling apart. Our health and social care services are deteriorating; crime rates are soaring, and so are violence and suicide in prisons; the quality of our schools is uneven and unfair; state pensions are miserly; poverty and homelessness are increasing \u2026 On all sides we are confronted by social injustice and economic neglect.\u201d Everyone, including my old Brexiter friend Lord Lawson, knows public services are much better on the continent. Why, Lawson has even taken up residence in France. Neild pinpoints the explanation: a preparedness to pay for public services. The tax take as a percentage of GDP is 40% on average in the EU and 47% in France. You get what you pay for! In the UK it is 35%. Now, in his \u201cdeal dividend\u201d, Hammond talked of \u201ca balanced approach \u2026 between keeping taxes low, supporting public services, reducing the deficit, and investing in Britain\u2019s future.\u201d Neild points out that since public expenditure is about one third of GDP, an increase in taxation of 1% of GDP makes possible approximately a 3% increase in public expenditure. Thus a 5% increase in the tax take, from 35% to 40%, would pay for an increase in public spending of almost 15%. The Tories are obsessed by lower taxes, and Labour by higher taxes provided the money comes from the rich and tightening loopholes. Neild\u2019s message is that to bring services up to scratch, there needs to be a general increase in the willingness to cough up. We need to stop Brexit and come to grips with the many economic and social problems that have been sidelined during this terrible diversion.",

      "bodyText": "The alarms bells have already started to sound. And this week it is expected to be announced formally that the global economy is running out of steam. As finance ministers, central bankers, academics and other delegates prepare to travel to Bali for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), optimism about the future is at a low ebb. On Tuesday, the fund will update its World Economic Outlook \u2013 a healthcheck on the world economy \u2013 and has already warned that the effects of rising debt and trade wars are affecting the global projections. Last week, the IMF\u2019s head, Christine Lagarde, said the outlook \u201chas become less bright\u201d, despite projections during the summer that there would be 3.9% growth for 2018 and 2019. It will be a different atmosphere in Bali this week compared to the last annual meeting in Washington, when the world was experiencing the strongest period of economic growth since the crash. Adding to Lagarde\u2019s comments, there were warnings last week in the IMF\u2019s global financial stability report, which said there was a risk of another financial meltdown because both governments and regulators have failed to put in place needed reforms to protect the system. Lagarde said that while expansion of the global economy was running at its fastest rate in seven years, there were signs of slowdown. In September, factory activity dropped as a result of changes in trading with the US \u2013 and Donald Trump did not escape (admittedly veiled) criticism. The growing use of trade barriers had resulted in a drop in imports and exports, Lagarde said, and investment and manufacturing output had also been hit. Trump has consistently championed unilateral trade deals in an effort to further his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. \u201cHistory shows that, while it is tempting to sail alone, countries must resist the siren call of self-sufficiency \u2013 because as the Greek legends tell us, that leads to shipwreck,\u201d said Lagarde. Last month, Trump intensified his trade war with China by imposing new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods arriving in the US. Beijing responded with retaliatory tariffs on $60bn worth of US products. The two countries already exchanged tariffs on $50bn worth of each other\u2019s goods earlier this year. Also central to the concerns about the future of the global economy are debt levels, currently well above those seen at the time of the 2008 crash. The IMF warned that there was a risk that unregulated parts of the financial system could trigger a panic. The rise of unregulated \u201cshadow banks\u201d and the lack of restrictions on insurers and asset managers were pinpointed as concerns \u2013 as was the growth of global banks to a scale larger than 2008 and the fear that they are again \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. Lagarde has said she is concerned that the total value of global debt has risen by 60% in the last 10 years to reach an all-time high of \u00a3139tn. As central banks in more advanced economies raised interest rates, attracting investors back to them, she said, developing countries were suffering. \u201cThat process could become even more challenging if it were to accelerate suddenly. It could lead to market corrections, sharp exchange rate movements, and further weakening of capital flows.\u201d It is under these gathering storm clouds that the finance ministers from the 189 member states of the IMF will meet at the end of this week as, once again, turbulence threatens the global economy.",
