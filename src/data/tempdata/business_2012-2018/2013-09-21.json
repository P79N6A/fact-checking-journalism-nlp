      "bodyText": "At the beginning of the year, Ian Hodgkinson's main aim was to keep his business alive. But in the last four months he has gone from ticking over to overwhelmed. His bricklaying firm has been inundated with demands as Britain's building industry has begun to boom, boosted by the government's Help to Buy scheme for first-time house buyers. The scheme, announced in April, has started a chain reaction that has seen the construction industry facing labour and materials shortages that have pushed up prices and lengthened supply delays. Bricklayers can now earn more than \u00a340,000 a year and brick deliveries that were being fulfilled in two days can now take 10 weeks. Hodgkinson, a director of a Derby-based brickwork contractor, said: \"It's gone phenomenal. At the beginning of the year we were scratching around. Now people call and just ask: 'Can you deliver the bricklayers?' Prices are no longer important. For years we have barely survived, we have been paid late, underpaid and not paid at all by contractors. They will now be paying through the nose or getting nothing. I could double my business if I could get the finance.\" The property industry is one of the few booming parts of the economy. A report last week from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that house prices were rising at their fastest pace for seven years. The number of estate agents is the highest since records began in 1978 \u2013 562,000 people are employed in real estate in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics, with 77,000 joining the industry over the last year \u2013 figures which stoke fears that the country is heading for a house-price bubble. New orders in the construction sector rose by nearly 20% in the April-June period compared with the previous three months, to show their biggest rise in four years. Annual growth of 32.8% in construction orders was the biggest since 2005. However, further growth is being held back by a severe shortage of construction workers. Maria Commane, managing director of Sitemasters, a London-based construction recruitment company, said she had never seen demand for labour outstrip supply in her 26 years in the business. \"There are shortages in all areas, from labouring to skilled work. Pay rates are going up across the board. Bricklayers are looking for \u00a319 an hour, which is up from around \u00a315. Workers are negotiating rates upwards all the time,\" she said. The main reason for the lack of supply of construction workers is the absence of workers from the European Union, many of whom have returned home or found work in other industries since 2008, and a historic shortage of skilled British workers. John Kelsey, a lecturer in construction economics at University College London, said: \"The problem for the last decade has been that we depend on importing labour to make up shortages here and we no longer have an efficient system for training apprentices.\" Builders may have been having difficulties getting their work done, but house prices are already taking off. Between April and June, British house prices rose by 6.8 % while, according to some reports, prices in London rose by 10%. According to the Home Builders Federation, there was a 49% year-on-year increase in the number of planning approvals for new homes between April and June this year. In the first six months of the year, 77,686 permissions were granted, a 26% year-on-year increase. The federation estimated that Britain needs 220,000 homes to be built each year to meet demand. The rise in the value of property triggered by government-supported easy credit to first-time buyers has begun to ring alarm bells. Adair Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, told BBC2's Newsnight last week that the government could be overdoing stimulus to the housing market, which may cause future problems. \"We have had a whacking great hangover after a debt-fuelled housing boom. Our policy seems to focus on a bit of the hair of the dog that bit us,\" he said. The building supply industry has also been taken by surprise. David Weeks of Hanson, Britain's biggest brick manufacturer, said his company had invested \u00a3500,000 in reviving a brick plant in Claughton, Lancashire, and was recruiting 34 workers for it. \"The upturn took us by surprise. We were expecting an improvement towards the end of the year. We then had to be confident that it wasn't just a spike and then we could respond. We have to match capacity to demand. We are meeting demand, but it is now taking eight to 10 weeks to supply orders, as opposed to 48 hours at the beginning of the year,\" he said. Ibstock, another brick manufacturer, opened a modernised brickworks in Chesterton, Newscastle-under-Lyme, this month and revived a plant in Ibstock, Leicestershire, to meet demand. The transformation in the construction industry this year has been dramatic, but it will take some time before pe-2008 levels of activity are achieved. Hodgkinson said he was now employing 50 bricklayers compared with 20 in January \u2013 but in 2008 he employed 260. Weeks said that in 2008 Hanson produced 1.5bn bricks, but last year it made 800 million. \"It's still a bit early to be talking about a recovery,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The choice of the person to govern a central bank is one politicians and financial markets take very seriously. Chancellor George Osborne devoted a fair proportion of 2012 to the pursuit of his ideal candidate, and eventually persuaded the Canadian Mark Carney to accept the governorship of the Bank of England. Although there was a formal interview process, there was little doubt who was going to get the job. A key factor in these matters is that candidates should not have too many enemies. Nobody in high places wanted to veto Carney, whereas in the past the road to the governor's parlours has been littered with the bodies of outstanding candidates who incurred black marks. The big international news in these matters last week was that Lawrence Summers, President Obama's favoured candidate to succeed Ben Bernanke as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, withdrew from the race because it had become clear that he had too many enemies on Capitol Hill, and the confirmation (or not) process threatened to become an embarrassment. Although people speak very highly of others in the running, such as Bernanke's deputy, Janet Yellen, it is nevertheless sad that someone of Summers's outstanding ability and experience \u2013 he is a formidable economist, was treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and, more recently, a key economic adviser to Obama \u2013 should have felt it necessary to withdraw his candidacy for the most important central banking job in the world. One objection was his championship of deregulation in the 1990s. But he was not the only one: there was an international consensus in favour of such moves at the time, and Summers has undoubtedly learned from experience. The consequences of deregulation and blind faith in the all-too-invisible benefits of financial engineering have been with us since 2007 and the onset of the financial crisis \u2013 which did not, as some appear to believe, begin with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, but was most certainly aggravated by that fiasco. But Summers learned the hard way, and was a powerful force for good in Obama's White House when it came to rescuing the system, in the face of Neanderthals who opposed the worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus of 2008-09 and the rescue of the banks. Summers's US critics were evidently worried he would be \"too hawkish\". Clearly, they were not acquainted with, or chose to ignore, the impressive series of articles he has written over the past few years for the Financial Times, one consistent theme being the dangers of withdrawing the stimulus when sustained economic recovery is far from assured, as Bernanke re-emphasised last week. Which brings us back to the UK and the debate about economic recovery here. The chancellor \u2013 endorsed, laughably, by deputy prime minister Nick Clegg \u2013 maintains that the recovery we are experiencing is the result of his policies of austerity and indeed caused by them. (I'm not making this up.) To the chancellor, critics of his policy have been proved wrong, simply because there are the beginnings of a recovery. The emphasis, by the way, must still be on \"the beginnings\", because with average incomes barely rising, and at a rate markedly below the rate of inflation, it is difficult to see how a broadly based recovery can be sustained. Hence the chancellor's stoking-up of a housing bubble, with all the familiar dangers that entails. With characteristic hyperbole, Osborne maintains that his critics argued that, in the face of his austerity policy, there could be no recovery. It would be more accurate to say that what we were all concerned about was the way the fiscal squeeze was inhibiting the chances of recovery, and that an awful lot of output was being lost meanwhile, and an awful lot of unnecessary damage inflicted, especially on the most vulnerable members of society. (See your local newspaper passim.) Output in the UK is still some 3% below its level in 2007-08, and some 17% below what might have been expected from historical trends. Just think of all the business investment opportunities that have been missed! Now, the effect of the banking crisis on the availability of credit had a major impact, as did attempts by businesses and individuals to cut back \u2013 \"deleveraging\", as it is known in the trade. And, no, we were not helped by the depressed condition of our important markets in the eurozone. But these were all reasons for the government to counteract the impact of the depression by continuing with the stimulus it inherited from Labour, instead of raising VAT and inflicting harmful and unnecessary cuts. When, amid all the razzmatazz surrounding Carney's arrival at the Bank in August, he held his first press conference, your correspondent asked him to what extent the fiscal squeeze was counteracting the Bank's attempts to encourage recovery. With great aplomb, the new governor ducked the question and answered a completely different one. But during his recent testimony to the Treasury select committee, Carney made a very important statement, and went way off message as far as his patron Osborne was concerned. \"The fiscal adjustment,\" said the governor, \"has been a drag on growth.\" I shall repeat that: the fiscal adjustment has been a drag on growth \u2013 not, as the chancellor would have it, the cause of the recovery.",

So it's acceptable to fantasise how the minister might receive a fierce slapping from the game show panel, as he pitches his current investment opportunity (first question: why would I want to invest in a firm where staff are threatening a mass strike?). Bannatyne might also ask if investors are being coaxed into falling for fashionable lines about a return of Margaret Thatcher's old \"share owning democracy\", and we will be reminded about what a myth that supposed revolution was this week, as the Office for National Statistics publishes its biennial survey into share ownership. That research has been showing for years how individual investors own less and less of the UK stock market, with private punters holding 64% of shares by value in 1963, 38% in 1975, and 28% in 1981 \u2013 while the figure has barely got above 20% since.
