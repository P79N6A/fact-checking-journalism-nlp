    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Economic forecasting is a mug's game. Experts find it next to impossible to predict the next set of quarterly growth figures or the length of the dole queues in the latest month. Most forecasts are made by extrapolating recent trends and tweaking them a bit, which is why they tend to be wrong when economies are subjected to powerful shocks. Last week, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development bravely tried to envisage what the world will look like in 2062. But, as the UK's recent experience shows, even imagining how things will pan out in 2013 is hard enough. This time five years ago, the economy was still growing and Gordon Brown contemplated holding a snap general election, before eventually getting cold feet. The Royal Bank of Scotland had just bought ABN Amro in the biggest bank takeover in history. The official cost of borrowing set by the Bank of England was 5.75%. Only economic geeks had heard of quantitative easing. It would have taken a brave forecaster to say back then that in late 2012 RBS would be largely owned by the British taxpayer, that interest rates would have been at 0.5% for the best part of four years and that the Bank would be sitting on \u00a3375bn of gilts bought from the private sector in an attempt to get the economy moving after a deep recession. It was assumed at the time that all these measures were temporary expedients to deal with what was expected to be a short-lived crisis. Yet there is no immediate likelihood of RBS returning to the private sector, the City thinks that interest rates will remain at 0.5% until at least 2014 and the Bank will not start selling the gilts it bought under the quantitative easing programme until the economy can cope with dearer borrowing. These forecasts could also prove to be wide of the mark. Although it currently looks unlikely, there is a possibility that all the stimulants pumped into the economy since late 2008 will finally work and that activity will accelerate rapidly. David Cameron may be right when he says that the good news will keep on coming. In truth, nobody knows what is going to happen over short periods of time, let alone decades. Let's take the UK as an example. The economy's performance since the slump of 2008-09 has broken with recent historical precedent, with recovery much slower than was the case after the downturns of the early 1980s and early 1990s. The first quarter of 2013 will be the fifth anniversary of the pre-recession peak in UK output and the economy will still be around 3% smaller than it was in the first quarter of 2008. In 1986, five years after the trough of the recession of the early 1980s recession, the UK was humming. The pattern repeated itself in the 1990s. It's tempting to say that the problems of the economy are the fault of the government, either the current one for being too austere or the previous one for being too spendthrift. Tempting but wrong. Something more profound has been going on. As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research noted last week, the UK has been the fastest-growing major economy in Europe over the past decade, even after its double-dip recession. The reason for that, though, was simple: Britain went on a borrowing binge. At the start of the 1990s, the UK's combined private and public sector debt amounted to 165% of GDP. By 2000, this had climbed to 200% of GDP. Over the next decade it rocketed to 295% of GDP. It was this acceleration in the rate of growth of indebtedness, Joshi says, that provided the strong tailwind for the economy in the years before the financial crisis. The problem, he adds, is that last decade's tailwind has become this decade's headwind. To receive the same boost from credit again, the UK's debt-to-GDP ratio would need to accelerate again over the next decade, to 450% of GDP. That looks utterly implausible since the private sector is debt-sated and the government is aiming to cut its borrowing. Seen in this light, the recent performance of the economy looks a lot more comprehensible. Deprived of the impulse it got from credit, the UK's growth rate has fallen. There is nothing abnormal about quarter after quarter of virtual stagnation; the abnormal period was the pseudo-Ponzi scheme that went before. Yet the Joshi analysis should be cause for sober reflection rather than deep depression. Let's try out a few assumptions. The first is that a return to the pre-2007 business as usual model is both desirable and possible; this is fast becoming a minority view, although it does have its adherents. The second assumption is that a stagnant economy is indeed the new normal but that we should welcome it as it will prevent us from burning up the planet. Greens would argue that Britain could thrive and be happy in a steady-state world provided work, income, wealth, and opportunity were shared more equitably. The third assumption is that a new growth model will emerge from the wreckage of the old. Historically, this is the most likely scenario and it has often been periods of crisis in the past that have provided the catalyst for change. For example, the 1920s were a troubled decade for Britain with low growth, high unemployment and industrial unrest. Yet in the two decades after the end of the first world war there was a gradual shift in the economy away from the staple industries of cotton, coal and shipbuilding towards light engineering. Then, as now, the world was being changed by technology. Then, as now, the global balance of power was changing. The crisis has been so powerful and so long-lasting it is easy to believe that the economy is like frozen Narnia under the White Witch. But humans are ingenious and adaptive: a thaw will eventually set in. On past form, this structural transformation will take time and patience will be needed, particularly given Britain's misshapen economy. It will be driven primarily by the private sector, although government has the capacity to help or hinder the process. Decisions taken on skills, education, welfare, infrastructure, public procurement, industrial strategy and banking will be crucial in this process and will matter far more than whether George Osborne tweaks fiscal policy in his pre-budget report next month. The PBR is unlikely to be a bundle of laughs. The chancellor is going to have to admit that growth is weaker and borrowing higher than he had hoped. But it would be unwise and needlessly gloomy to assume Britain in 2022 or 2032 will still be today's recession-mired basket case.",

      "bodyText": "There are still 43 shopping days to go until Christmas but the battle for hearts and minds has already begun as retailers go into battle with multimillion pound adverts designed to tug the heart and purse strings. Store bosses usually wait until after Armistice day to deck the halls but this year major high-street names have already launched their festive campaigns, albeit with mixed results. John Lewis was trending on Twitter on Friday as the twitterati debated new ad \"The Journey\", a gentle tale of an animated snowman's quest to find the perfect gift (in John Lewis, of course) for his snow lady. Meanwhile, Asda faced a different kind of social media reaction to its ad, which features a stressed-out mum preparing for Christmas. Within 24 hours, more than 1,000 comments were posted on Mumsnet about the ad which has been labelled \"sexist\" and is now being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority after it received more than 160 complaints. With many households under financial pressure, as higher living costs bite into households' spending power, retailers have been desperate to strike the right tone with their festive ads. Many stores, including Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco, have dropped celebrities in favour of family Christmas campaigns to convey the emotion of the festive season and buoy the spirits of customers tired of austerity messages. \"This is the golden quarter,\" says Steve Sharp, M&amp;S's head of marketing. \"It's make or break for most retailers and the spend on the ads is in proportion to the commercial importance of the season.\" For M&amp;S, the absence of celebrities ends 12 years of glitzy campaigns that have featured David Beckham, Helen Mirren, Twiggy, Peter Kay and X Factor finalists, among others. This year's offers an alternative star in the shape of four-year-old Seb White, who has Down's syndrome and is one of the dancing children featured in the ad. Tesco is targeting hearts rather than wallets with marketing and digital officer Matt Atkinson saying the pared-down ads treat Christmas \"as a feeling, not a season\". The retailer is also in the process of casting members of the public to star in series of spots that are to be filmed in their own homes. High street chemist Boots has taken a similar approach, casting real-life couples and their relatives to capture their chemistry. But while some retailers, including sister chain John Lewis, have spent millions on their ads, Waitrose has taken the opposite approach. There is no snow machine or family gathered around a table piled with turkey and all the trimmings, instead Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal are standing in an empty studio explaining that instead of making a \"fancy TV advert\", the supermarket would give an extra \u00a31m to good causes. The Asda ad follows a busy \"mum\" juggling a long list of Christmas tasks from writing Christmas cards to wrapping presents and peeling a mountain of veg for Christmas lunch, only for her partner to pipe up: \"What's for tea, love?\" when she finally sits down. On Mumsnet, comments ranged from \"sexist crap\" and \"something from the 1950s\", to \"with three small children, Christmas does feel like that and I can really identify with the woman\". The grocer has apologised to \"any mums and dads\" upset by its ad, insisting its content was based on interviews with thousands of \"Asda mums\". \"It feels like a lot of retailers are trying to show their customers how much they understand them,\" says Damon Collins, of advertising firm Joint, who was behind Boots's Here Come the Girls campaign. \"It may be true but people may not want to hear it.\" With John Lewis it's different, he says: \"People are looking for reasons to love it.\" So what of the John Lewis \u00a36m ad? The retailer, which did not advertise on television until 2007, has earned a reputation for creating memorable adverts, not least 2010's \"Always A Woman\" ad which some viewers said moved them to tears. Last year's tale of a boy desperately waiting for the big day so he could give a present to his parents also won plaudits, and helped the employee-owned department store achieve record Christmas sales, as well as chart success. Covers of songs featured in John Lewis TV commercials since 2009 have already sold more than 1m units and big things are expected of this year's cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's anthem, The Power of Love, sung by folk singer Gabrielle Aplin, which by yesterday was already among the top 20 most popular songs on iTunes.",

    "webTitle": "Vince Cable convinced that Britain's car industry needs its foreign friends", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Car manufacturers love a glitzy product launch, but the ceremony to welcome a new model at Toyota's Derby plant last week was modest by industry standards. Nonetheless, the obligatory dry ice, flashing lights and thumping music struck a rare celebratory note during a difficult year for automotive groups. \"I think this is the best product we have ever had,\" says Tony Walker, Toyota's deputy head of UK production, gesturing towards two new Toyota Auris cars that have just received an approving inspection from guest of honour, business secretary Vince Cable. One of the vehicles is an inadvertent reminder of the industry's difficulties. It is a left-hand drive model, ready to be exported to a continental market in freefall. While the homegrown likes of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) are still enjoying massive sales increases, it is the big producers such as the Japanese triumvirate of Toyota, Nissan and Honda \u2013 and US-owned Vauxhall \u2013 that underpin one of the UK's most successful export industries. \"We rejoice in the success of the premium carmakers, but the UK has to have volume carmakers or the suppliers cannot survive,\" says Walker. \"They need the volume to have a business.\" Yet at the moment it's widely agreed that Europe's carmakers have too many factories geared to high demand and not enough customers buying what they produce. Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne has called it \"carmageddon\". Sales in Europe have fallen for 12 consecutive months, exacerbating the financial strain for automotive groups whose manufacturing operations are tailored to a pre-credit crunch market. Western European factories churned out just under 16m cars and vans in 2007, but the total this year will be 12.5m, according to analyst IHS Automotive. Against this backdrop, Ford announced the closure of three European sites last month, including a Transit van plant in Southampton and a panel-stamping operation in Dagenham, with the loss of up to 1,400 jobs. Peugeot has announced plans to shut a plant in Paris, while General Motors is expected to close a site in Bochum, Germany. Toyota's European operations are not on the critical list, says Walker, because the company took its medicine in 2010, shedding 800 jobs: \"We took a lot of our countermeasures earlier. We have already restructured to that low level.\" And, Southampton and Dagenham aside, UK-based car manufacturers are set for a good year. The Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port in north-west England escaped closure after securing work to build the next generation of Astra cars, while JLR has moved to a 24-hour production line in nearby Halewood in order to cope with demand. According to AutoAnalysis, a research company, Britain will produce 1.6m cars this year \u2013 an increase of 19% on 2011. Walker, a UK car industry veteran who started his career at Ford in 1977, says the British environment has been transformed. \"We have got the main things right, like quality, productivity, flexibility,\" he says. \"All the issues of bad equipment, bad industrial relations, bad management got swept away. Those who could not modernise closed.\" Car manufacturers are also more responsive to demand, tailoring cars to customers' needs before construction begins. \"That sort of thing was unheard- of. As a country we used to churn them out, stick them in fields and discount them to get rid of them,\" Walker says. But some experts wonder whether the UK can remain immune to the eurozone crisis. About half of all exported, UK-made cars go to the eurozone. David Bailey, a professor at Coventry University business school, says that signs are already emerging of some impact on manufacturing activity: a temporary one-week closure at Ellesmere Port; the looming redundancies at Southampton and Dagenham; the introduction of a four-day week for some staff at Honda's Swindon plant. \"The state of the European market will catch up with us at some point, as it has already with Ford, Honda and [Ellesmere Port owner] General Motors,\" says Bailey. \"Given that 45% of UK car exports go to the eurozone, it will have an impact.\" Bailey adds, however, that manufacturers such as JLR have made shrewd moves in targeting developing markets such as China, providing a sales outlet when Europe began to suffer: \"What is benefiting the UK is that British producers have looked beyond the eurozone.\" David Raistrick, a manufacturing expert at Deloitte, predicts that British sites will overcome the eurozone crisis, with new workforce deals at Honda and Vauxhall underlining the flexibility of British car workers. \"The UK is not a cheap place to build cars,\" he says. \"It is far cheaper to go and build in a low-wage economy than in the UK, you would think. But you need fewer people to build a car if you have efficient production facilities, so the UK ticks all the right boxes.\" He adds: \"The industry will go from strength to strength here. The 1.6m [UK production total for 2012] will keep rising because a lot of the world's biggest carmakers are realising that the UK is a smart place to build cars.\" Cable, who played a role in the negotiations that took the next-generation Astra to Ellesmere Port, believes the long-term future is bright. A Vauxhall owner himself, he reels off the UK investments that have been announced by car manufacturers over the past 12 months, from Ellesmere Port to the Toyota plant in Burnaston, south of Derby. \"All the big car producers have found the UK a good place to do business, with a flexible and co-operative labour force,\" he says. Alluding to the French government's plans to rescue Peugeot with a \u20ac7bn state package, he adds: \"The government is supporting the industry in the right kind of way, not making open-ended subsidies and investments of the kind that you get in France.\" That support includes backing for suppliers, investment in low-carbon vehicles, a new tax credit for research and development and a \u00a3341m investment in automotive companies from the government's Regional Growth Fund. After the Derby launch, Cable admits that Ford's closure of the Southampton van plant is \"unambiguously bad news\", but welcomed the announcement that its Dagenham site will build a next-generation diesel engine, with associated design work for its technical centre in Basildon and extra investment at the Bridgend investment plant in north Wales. \"It was good news in the long term for Ford's future in the UK,\" he says. Cable acknowledges that the downturn in the eurozone could cause problems for an industry that is one of the foot soldiers in the government's \"march of the makers\", which is seeking to generate more economic growth from export-led manufacturing. \"We keep a weather eye on all of these things,\" he says. Like Walker, Cable was a ringside witness of the British car industry in its more troubled days, as a special advisor to then industry secretary, the late John Smith, in the 1970s. Drawing on that period, he says he is unconcerned by the fact that Britain's car factories are foreign-controlled, from Indian-owned JLR to Volkswagen's Bentley brand. \"I am most emphatically not nationalistic about ownership,\" he says. \"We need to cast our minds back to the car industry in the 1970s when we had more indigenous ownership through British Leyland. It was seriously dysfunctional and in danger of becoming a joke.\" Having spent the morning with Toyota executives, Cable brings the argument full circle, describing the establishment of a Nissan plant in Sunderland in 1986 as turning point: \"What restored credibility was investment from the Japanese.\" Another reason for British manufacturers to look beyond Europe.",

      "body": "<p>Car manufacturers love a glitzy product launch, but the ceremony to welcome a new model at Toyota's Derby plant last week was modest by industry standards. Nonetheless, the obligatory dry ice, flashing lights and thumping music struck a rare celebratory note during a difficult year for automotive groups.</p> <p>\"I think this is the best product we have ever had,\" says Tony Walker, Toyota's deputy head of UK production, gesturing towards two new Toyota Auris cars that have just received an approving inspection from guest of honour, business secretary Vince Cable.</p> <p>One of the vehicles is an inadvertent reminder of the industry's difficulties. It is a left-hand drive model, ready to be exported to a continental market in freefall. While the homegrown likes of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) are still enjoying massive sales increases, it is the big producers such as the Japanese triumvirate of Toyota, Nissan and Honda \u2013 and US-owned Vauxhall \u2013 that underpin one of the UK's most successful export industries.</p> <p>\"We rejoice in the success of the premium carmakers, but the UK has to have volume carmakers or the suppliers cannot survive,\" says Walker. \"They need the volume to have a business.\"</p> <p>Yet at the moment it's widely agreed that Europe's carmakers have too many factories geared to high demand and not enough customers buying what they produce. Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne has called it \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/general-motors-european-losses-widen\" title=\"\">carmageddon</a>\". Sales in Europe have fallen for 12 consecutive months, exacerbating the financial strain for automotive groups whose manufacturing operations are tailored to a pre-credit crunch market.</p> <p>Western European factories churned out just under 16m cars and vans in 2007, but the total this year will be 12.5m, according to analyst IHS Automotive. Against this backdrop, Ford announced the closure of three European sites last month, including a Transit van plant in Southampton and a panel-stamping operation in Dagenham, with the loss of up to 1,400 jobs. Peugeot has announced plans to shut a plant in Paris, while General Motors is expected to close a site in Bochum, Germany.</p> <p>Toyota's European operations are not on the critical list, says Walker, because the company took its medicine in 2010, shedding 800 jobs: \"We took a lot of our countermeasures earlier. We have already restructured to that low level.\"</p> <p>And, Southampton and Dagenham aside, UK-based car manufacturers are set for a good year. The Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port in north-west England escaped closure after securing work to build the next generation of Astra cars, while JLR has moved to a 24-hour production line in nearby Halewood in order to cope with demand. According to AutoAnalysis, a research company, Britain will produce 1.6m cars this year \u2013 an increase of 19% on 2011. Walker, a UK car industry veteran who started his career at Ford in 1977, says the British environment has been transformed. \"We have got the main things right, like quality, productivity, flexibility,\" he says. \"All the issues of bad equipment, bad industrial relations, bad management got swept away. Those who could not modernise closed.\"</p> <p>Car manufacturers are also more responsive to demand, tailoring cars to customers' needs before construction begins. \"That sort of thing was unheard- of. As a country we used to churn them out, stick them in fields and discount them to get rid of them,\" Walker says.</p> <p>But some experts wonder whether the UK can remain immune to the eurozone crisis. About half of all exported, UK-made cars go to the eurozone. David Bailey, a professor at Coventry University business school, says that signs are already emerging of some impact on manufacturing activity: a temporary one-week closure at Ellesmere Port; the looming redundancies at Southampton and Dagenham; the introduction of a four-day week for some staff at Honda's Swindon plant.</p> <p>\"The state of the European market will catch up with us at some point, as it has already with Ford, Honda and [Ellesmere Port owner] General Motors,\" says Bailey. \"Given that 45% of UK car exports go to the eurozone, it will have an impact.\"</p> <p>Bailey adds, however, that manufacturers such as JLR have made shrewd moves in targeting developing markets such as China, providing a sales outlet when Europe began to suffer: \"What is benefiting the UK is that British producers have looked beyond the eurozone.\"</p> <p>David Raistrick, a manufacturing expert at Deloitte, predicts that British sites will overcome the eurozone crisis, with new workforce deals at Honda and Vauxhall underlining the flexibility of British car workers. \"The UK is not a cheap place to build cars,\" he says. \"It is far cheaper to go and build in a low-wage economy than in the UK, you would think. But you need fewer people to build a car if you have efficient production facilities, so the UK ticks all the right boxes.\" He adds: \"The industry will go from strength to strength here. The 1.6m [UK production total for 2012] will keep rising because a lot of the world's biggest carmakers are realising that the UK is a smart place to build cars.\"</p> <p>Cable, who played a role in the negotiations that took the next-generation Astra to Ellesmere Port, believes the long-term future is bright.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who, like me, grew up in the 1980s, will remember Japanese technology as being at the height of hi-tech fashion. Panasonic, Sony and Sharp all symbolised the cutting edge of innovation and style, perhaps most thrillingly when Sony introduced the Walkman \u2013 imagine, a stereo you could listen to on the move! Despite the catastrophic Japanese economic collapse in the late 1980s that led to the so-called Lost Decade (which has lasted far longer than 10 years), many of these firms managed to hold on to their position as export powerhouses. And while their country dipped in and out of recession, Japanese carmakers once written off as purveyors of cheap-but-clunky boneshakers (not least when Alan Partridge called the Lexus a \"Japanese Volvo\"), have moved up the value chain to turn out sleek, desirable vehicles. But it's many years since Japan's corporate giants were setting the pace. From Silicon Valley, where Apple designs one whizzy must-have after another, to South Korea, where nimble Samsung is throwing billions of dollars at innovation, Japan's firms have been outflanked. China is cheaper \u2013 and itself following the same path, from undercutting rivals on cost, to designing its own technology \u2013 while Korea, Taiwan and the US continue to innovate. Japan's giants are struggling to maintain their dominance. Sharp was forced to warn recently that it has \"serious doubts\" about its ability to continue as a going concern. President Takashi Okuda said: \"We have a lot of great technology which we want to tap to revive and generate profit, but the company does not have that vitality.\" Panasonic and Sony have issued grim profit warnings. Official figures to be published tomorrow are likely to show that the Japanese economy as a whole slid into the red in the third quarter of 2012, once the momentum of post-tsunami reconstruction began to subside; and many analysts are expecting a second negative quarter at the end of the year, which would mark (yet another) recession. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted last week that a declining working-age population and the rise of powers such as China and India mean Japan will contribute just 2% of global GDP in 2060; in 2011, it was 7% . There are plenty of reasons for the woes of the Japanese industrial sector, not least that independent directors are few and far between, and cross-shareholdings \u2013 one company owning a chunky stake in another \u2013 remain common. Briton Michael Woodford discovered the perils of trying to impose western corporate values on a Japanese firm when he exposed a financial scandal at camera-maker Olympus, which he had been brought in to run, but was duly dumped and later excoriated by its chairman for showing \"dislike of Japan\". But as John Plender pointed out in the Financial Times last week, there's another explanation for the country's flagging performance: its economy has been wrenched out of shape by many years of rock-bottom borrowing costs. Quantitative easing, the drastic policy of pumping electronically-created money into the economy, was part of the Bank of Japan's armoury long before it was unleashed in the UK in the teeth of the credit crisis. Driving down the cost of borrowing to bolster demand and staunch the flow of bankruptcies and job losses is the textbook response of a central bank facing an economy in crisis. Once growth returns, the argument goes, debt levels can be brought down and necessary restructuring take place at a less painful pace. But over time, as cut-price loans become the norm, the corporate sector can become crystallised in its existing shape, too insulated from the cold winds of competition and progress that might have swept many firms away, or forced them to adapt to a different world, in a process the economist Joseph Schumpeter described as \"creative destruction\". By delaying the reckoning, and keeping \"zombie companies\" alive, there is a risk that when it eventually comes, the correction is even more dramatic. Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King is well aware of this dilemma: keeping the economy afloat in the short term (or in the UK's case, preventing a deep recession becoming an even deeper one) may delay a much-needed economic adjustment in the long term. But the problem is that, as MPC members can't fail to notice if they've a moment to glance at the portents from Japan, if the return to \"normal\" never comes, a short-term sticking plaster can become a long-term crutch. That will no doubt have been just one of their concerns last week when they opted not to increase QE. The comparison with Japan's case is not exact: here, it's the banks and heavily indebted households that are being kept alive by cheap debt, rather than our exporters, many of which have healthier balance sheets. But in a recent speech King gave just one alarming example of how low interest rates may be distorting the world. No one yet knows whether rocketing house prices in the late 1990s and early 2000s reflected a sensible adjustment to a fall in long-term borrowing costs or a drastic misjudgment on the part of Britain's householders about their future earnings potential. \"Since long-term interest rates in financial markets are, if anything, even lower today, the question of sustainability has not yet been resolved,\" he warned. Housing may still be overvalued; but we can't tell, because cut-price mortgages have (rightly) helped to avoid the wave of repossessions that might have followed if the Bank had been less aggressive in cutting rates, and keeping them there. Eventually, King insisted, fiscal policy would have to tighten to something more like normal. But as Sharp's plight in Japan shows, even without a radical rise in interest rates, a long period of bumping along the bottom may reveal that the answer to King's \"question of sustainability\" is not the one homeowners had hoped for.",

Briton Michael Woodford discovered the perils of trying to impose western corporate values on a Japanese firm when he exposed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/26/olympus-chairman-quits\" title=\"\">financial scandal at camera-maker Olympus,</a> which he had been brought in to run, but was duly dumped and later excoriated by its chairman for showing \"dislike of Japan\".</p> <p>But as John Plender pointed out <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/012b2f68-282b-11e2-a335-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2BX7tBTed\" title=\"\">in the <em>Financial Times</em> last week</a>, there's another explanation for the country's flagging performance: its economy has been wrenched out of shape by many years of rock-bottom borrowing costs.</p> <p>Quantitative easing, the drastic policy of pumping electronically-created money into the economy, was part of the Bank of Japan's armoury long before it was unleashed in the UK in the teeth of the credit crisis.</p> <p>Driving down the cost of borrowing to bolster demand and staunch the flow of bankruptcies and job losses is the textbook response of a central bank facing an economy in crisis. Once growth returns, the argument goes, debt levels can be brought down and necessary restructuring take place at a less painful pace.</p> <p>But over time, as cut-price loans become the norm, the corporate sector can become crystallised in its existing shape, too insulated from the cold winds of competition and progress that might have swept many firms away, or forced them to adapt to a different world, in a process the economist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter\" title=\"\">Joseph Schumpeter</a> described as \"creative destruction\". By delaying the reckoning, and keeping \"zombie companies\" alive, there is a risk that when it eventually comes, the correction is even more dramatic.</p> <p>Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King is well aware of this dilemma: keeping the economy afloat in the short term (or in the UK's case, preventing a deep recession becoming an even deeper one) may delay a much-needed economic adjustment in the long term. But the problem is that, as MPC members can't fail to notice if they've a moment to glance at the portents from Japan, if the return to \"normal\" never comes, a short-term sticking plaster can become a long-term crutch. That will no doubt have been just one of their concerns last week when they opted not to increase QE.</p> <p>The comparison with Japan's case is not exact: here, it's the banks and heavily indebted households that are being kept alive by cheap debt, rather than our exporters, many of which have healthier balance sheets.</p> <p>But in a recent speech King gave just one alarming example of how low interest rates may be distorting the world. No one yet knows whether rocketing house prices in the late 1990s and early 2000s reflected a sensible adjustment to a fall in long-term borrowing costs or a drastic misjudgment on the part of Britain's householders about their future earnings potential. \"Since long-term interest rates in financial markets are, if anything, even lower today, the question of sustainability has not yet been resolved,\" he warned. Housing may still be overvalued; but we can't tell, because cut-price mortgages have (rightly) helped to avoid the wave of repossessions that might have followed if the Bank had been less aggressive in cutting rates, and keeping them there.</p> <p>Eventually, King insisted, fiscal policy would have to tighten to something more like normal. But as Sharp's plight in Japan shows, even without a radical rise in interest rates, a long period of bumping along the bottom may reveal that the answer to King's \"question of sustainability\" is not the one homeowners had hoped for.</p>",
