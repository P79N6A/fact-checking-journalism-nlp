Greene, who moved from Canada to take up the post, voluntarily agreed to repay the money after she heard of Cable's concerns.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "E.ON is to shut one gas-fired power station and expects to reduce output at three others despite continued warnings from the National Grid and others that Britain faces a capacity crunch and potential blackouts. The German-owned gas and electricity provider said it planned to end power supplies from Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands and scale back operations at Castleford, Sandbach and Thornhill in the north of the country. E.ON recently closed the Kingsnorth coal-burning power station in Kent while another big six supplier, RWE, has closed Tilbury on the Thames. The huge Eggborough facility in North Yorkshire, owned by private equity firms, is also under threat of closure while Centrica, the owner of British Gas, and SSE have mothballed gas-fired stations. Power companies argue that while coal-fired stations are being hit by tougher pollution regulations emanating from Europe, the economics of gas ones are also being hit by a combination of factors including relatively high wholesale gas prices when compared with cheap coal supplies exported from the US \u2013 where it has become surplus to requirements thanks to the country's shale gas boom. \"Over the last five years, E.ON has invested \u00a36bn in the UK's infrastructure, but there is no doubt that the operational environment remains very challenging, particularly for CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine) power stations, which in many areas are continuing to fight for survival in the current market, providing increasing uncertainty around future generating capacity planning,\" said Richard Pennells, a director at E.ON UK. E.ON, like German-owned RWE, is also suffering from wider financial problems in its domestic market, which led to a prediction in November that it could be forced to close more than 11,000 megawatts of capacity around Europe. The decision by the Berlin government to run down its country's nuclear power stations after Japan's Fukushima disaster has cost German utilities billions in writedowns. The Stoke plant produces only 56 MW, but its closure and the moves at the three other plants will still shake a government that has been told by energy regulator Ofgem that power companies may have to be paid to keep old power stations on standby to meet power shortages that some have claimed could hit at any time. But E.ON said the four power stations that are affected by its plans are all around 10 years old, are not built to be easily switched on and off, and are in need of potentially costly maintenance or refits to keep them running in the longer term. \"You don't buy new tyres for an old car,\" said one E.ON source, who added that it was important to take commercial decisions for the sake of the group and the customer who could end up paying. The risk of blackouts \u2013 including ones this winter \u2013 has been at its highest level for almost a decade, the Grid warned two months ago. Ofgem has also said that with old and polluting power stations closing, the spare generating capacity on the power system was likely to fall to 4% in 2015/16. The now dismantled state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board at one time used to argue that a minimum capacity to cope with peak demand should not be less than 25%. The gas and coal power station shutdowns in Britain come just as many old nuclear plants go offline as they end their natural life. New wind farms have not been built as fast as expected either. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 January 2014 to remove a reference to E.ON in the photo caption.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Antony Jenkins, the boss of Barclays, warned yesterday that there would be another financial crisis once the current crop of bankers, who bore the scars of 2008, had retired or died. \"I don't think we're going to have another crisis like this in the next five years, but we will have another problem when all the people like us \u2026 have retired or died.\" Jenkins said the only alternative was \"to find a way to box in the animal spirits (of bankers) through profound change\". As the bonus season begins \u2013 and banks such as Barclays seek ways to avoid the EU bonus cap \u2013 Jenkins insisted there is now more pay restraint among bankers, but said banks also had a responsibility to shareholders to attract the best employees. Speaking at Davos on whether the markets are now safe again, he was forced to defend the use of complex financial derivatives, which were described by a fellow speaker as a \"net negative to society\". Hedge fund boss Paul Singer, who runs Elliott Associates, said he traded derivatives, but added: \"On balance (there is a) net negative to society from this type of invention. The hedging benefits have been exaggerated and are outweighed by growing complexity and leverage.\" Jenkins, however, insisted that derivatives helped customers ranging from pension funds to airlines, which use them to hedge fuel costs. Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, said the \"single most important thing\" making the financial system safer was the use of so-called central counter parties to stand behind derivatives trades, which do not take place on an exchange but privatively between banks. But Singer and Anat Admati, the Stanford school of business professor who has written a hard-hitting book attacking bankers, insisted that five years on from the crisis, the risks remained. \"Where we are is not where were need to be. It's a very scary situation,\" said Admati. Singer was concerned about the opacity in the financial system where he said banks were running at higher leverage \u2013 borrowing \u2013 than they were before the crisis.Jenkins said that financial stability was not just about banks, but other parts of the financial system, and warned about the impact of rules requiring banks to hold more capital: \"Society needs to decide how we balance safety and soundness with capacity in the system.\" Flint said that while new rules for unwinding troubled banks by requiring bond holders to step in to cushion losses should let taxpayers off the hook in the future \u2013 although \"the man on the street\" would still be required to bail out banks through holdings of bonds in pension funds and other savings.",

      "body": "<p>Antony Jenkins, the boss of Barclays, warned yesterday that there would be another financial crisis once the current crop of bankers, who bore the scars of 2008, had retired or died. \"I don't think we're going to have another crisis like this in the next five years, but we will have another problem when all the people like us \u2026 have retired or died.\"</p> <p>Jenkins said the only alternative was \"to find a way to box in the animal spirits (of bankers) through profound change\".</p> <p>As the bonus season begins \u2013 and banks such as Barclays seek ways to avoid the EU bonus cap \u2013 Jenkins insisted there is now more pay restraint among bankers, but said banks also had a responsibility to shareholders to attract the best employees.</p> <p>Speaking at Davos on whether the markets are now safe again, he was forced to defend the use of complex financial derivatives, which were described by a fellow speaker as a \"net negative to society\". Hedge fund boss Paul Singer, who runs Elliott Associates, said he traded derivatives, but added: \"On balance (there is a) net negative to society from this type of invention. The hedging benefits have been exaggerated and are outweighed by growing complexity and leverage.\" Jenkins, however, insisted that derivatives helped customers ranging from pension funds to airlines, which use them to hedge fuel costs.</p> <p>Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, said the \"single most important thing\" making the financial system safer was the use of so-called central counter parties to stand behind derivatives trades, which do not take place on an exchange but privatively between banks.</p> <p>But Singer and Anat Admati, the Stanford school of business professor who has written a hard-hitting book attacking bankers, insisted that five years on from the crisis, the risks remained. \"Where we are is not where were need to be. It's a very scary situation,\" said Admati.</p> <p>Singer was concerned about the opacity in the financial system where he said banks were running at higher leverage \u2013 borrowing \u2013 than they were before the crisis.Jenkins said that financial stability was not just about banks, but other parts of the financial system, and warned about the impact of rules requiring banks to hold more capital: \"Society needs to decide how we balance safety and soundness with capacity in the system.\"</p> <p>Flint said that while new rules for unwinding troubled banks by requiring bond holders to step in to cushion losses should let taxpayers off the hook in the future \u2013 although \"the man on the street\" would still be required to bail out banks through holdings of bonds in pension funds and other savings.</p>",

Sales at stores open more than a year fell 4% in the 20 weeks to 18 January despite an improvement in trading at the group's shops in travel hubs which benefited from a pickup in air traffic at airports. Analysts said underlying sales at these travel stores were flat to slightly up in the second half of the period, the best performance in five years, as like-for-like sales fell by 6% in high street locations. Clarke said: \"High street footfall was challenging in November and December. It's wise for us to plan cautiously as high street consumer spending is still constrained by disposable income being squeezed.\" Underlying sales of books were particularly poor, down 7% to 8% according to analysts, amid severe price deflation after a weak year for biographies \u2013 apart from former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson's book \u2013 while sales of stationery and newspapers all fell. The poor book sales are in contrast with the privately-owned retailer Waterstones, which said its sales of hardbacks and paperbacks were up over Christmas. However, WH Smith shares rose 2.7% to \u00a310.43 amid the glimpse of sales improvement and as the company said it had found a further \u00a32m of cost savings through trimming staff and marketing budgets. \"Consistency is the hallmark of WH Smith and management has again delivered,\" said analyst Kate Calvert of Investec. Profit margins also improved, partly as a result of a switch to more profitable goods, but also because the retailer got stocks of its festive goods right and was not forced to discount leftovers heavily. Clarke said: \"There is still lots we can do to drive margin and more work on cost savings if like-for-like sales continue on these trends.\" He insisted that customers were \"comfortable\" with the introduction of more self-service tills in stores and that most of the company's cost savings were in behind-the-scenes efficiencies which most shoppers would not notice \u2013 despite a Twitter account devoted to identifying grubby WH Smith carpets. \"What is important is that the product is on the shelf at a decent price and they can get in and out of the store quickly.

      "bodyText": "Well, that was quite a dramatic speech from Shinzo Abe to the WEF -- delivered in pretty excellent English too (he switched to Japanese for a brief Q&amp;A afterwards). The key points are. The Japanese PM called for restraint over military spending in Asia, where the ongoing dispute between Tokypo and Beijing over ownership of the Senkaku/Diaoyu uninhabited islands close to Taiwan, which are under Japan's control. Abe's warning that military expansion could go unchecked appears to be an appeal to leaders at Davos to support Japan over the dispute. Abe also announced new measures to get more women involved in the labour force, saying Japan could not afford not to. He will bring in legislation soon to set a target that 30% of leadership positions would be held by women by 2020. On economics, Abe said that Japan would soon emerge from deflation, with rising real wages feeding into the economy and stimulating productivity. He also pledged to keep fighting special interests, to deregulate the energy market and to cut corporation taxes again to encourage firms to invest.c BIG NEWS: Shinzo Abe concludes his speech to the World Economic Forum by calling for military restraint in Asia. The move comes after rising tension in the area with China over islands in the East China Sea. The Japanese PM says: We must restrain military expansion in Asia, which otherwise could go unchecked. Military spending must be transparent, and able to be verified. We must create a process for crisis management and lay down rules that enforce the international control of the sea, he continues. Only then can we get growth and prosperity in Asia. Japan has sworn an oath, never again to wage a war. We continue to wish the world will remain in peace. And he sincerely hope that through Abenomics we can create economic growth, which will result in lasting peace in the region. Japan was touched by support of the world following the Fukishima disaster, Abe says - and the challenge of rebuilding and recovering is not over. Shinzo Abe declares that he will bring forward legislation soon, setting targets to get many more women into senior positions in Japanese companies. He says Japan will have 30% of top positions filled by women by 2020 -- that's a challenging target, but one which Abe says can deliver big benefits. He cites Arianna Huffington's quote about how Lehman Brothers would have survived if it had been Brothers and Sisters. And adds that Hilary Clinton has told him that Japan's economy could grow 16% faster if women were fully engaged in it. Abe declares: Japan must become a place where women shine. The Japanese PM is gunning for special interests, saying that \"I am willing to act like a drill bit to break through the solid rock of vested interests.\" Abe also pledges to keep shaking up the tax system. Abe begins by joking that he doesn't know who coined the term Abenomics, but he'll have to use his own name to describe his policiesfor a bit longer. He then declares that Japan is poised to break free from the chronic deflation that has gripped it for so many years, declaring: High wages, long overdue will lead to increased productivity. Japan is now getting on track for fiscal consolidation, he adds. Our growth rate has changed dramatically, from negative to positive, he continues, pointing to g to the Olympics and Paralympics coming soon. A new dawn is breaking over Japan Abe continues - we will liberalise the energy markets, and we will allow private firms to break into farming. Shinzo Abe is being introduced at Davos now, with WEF founder Klaus Schwab declaring that, thanks to his bold economic and monetary reforms, he can say that Japan is Back. We need more bold ideas like Abenomics, Schwab adds. Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua has tweeted a great photo showing the aeroplanes on which the Israeli and Iranian delegations flew in for WEF -- side by side. It's nearly time for the big set-piece event of the day - a special address by Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe. The congress hall is filling up.... Philip Jennings of UNI Global Union also believes some Davos delegates have woken up to the scale of the inequality problem gripping the global economy, saying: They're now worried about social tensions, unemployment, and the unfair distribution of wealth. The other important issue, he adds, is that the public have a complete lack of confidence that this generation's political classes understand the life of an ordinary worker. Just grabbed a few minute with Davos veteran Philip Jennings, general secretary of the UNI Global Union. He's delighted that the Pope shook up Davos with a hard-hitting message last night to reflect on the causes of the economic crisis, and to help build a new economic order where wealth serves the people not the other way round (Larry Elliott has blogged about the Pope's 'leftie message' here). It's Pope Francis's latest interjection into the debate on reforming capitalism - and Jennings reckons it has really made an impact on WEF this year, right at the start of the Forum, joking: Our new Argentinian striker has delivered - he's scored a goal in the second minute of the game. This year's Davos theme is all about reshaping the global economy -- and the Pope has thrown down the challenge to actually deliver, not just talk. Jennings explained: If WEF were looking for a Papal blessing, then they didn't get it. They didn't get absolution either -- the message they got from the Pope was 'Do better, I'm watching'. UK banking chiefs are telling Davos that the financial markets are safer than back in 2009, but not everyone is convinced they they've learned their lessons. At a debate called \"Are markets safer now\", HSBC's chairman Douglas Flint said his bank had thrown much more resources at ensuring it is complying with the law. Barclays boss Antony Jenkins argued that the issue goes beyond just banks. Jill tweets the key points: Paul Singer, CEO and co-chief investment officer of fund manager Elliott Management, is also on the panel -- and cautioned that banks are still involved in exotic products that could rebound on them: Jenkins argues that the key is to keep bankers' animal spirits in check: Alpha Cond\u00e9, president of Guinea, spoke at a session on mineral extraction a few minute ago, and accused Western lawyers of using trickery to steal natural resources from his country in the past. He said the corrupt theft of natural resources was aided by the west, and its lawyers expertise in terms of legal tricks. Conde said: A lot of the transparency that was not present, was made possibly by legal tricks and the use of financial havens where people were able to hide their funds. But he said the situation was now improving, as Guinea was getting support from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and a number of western countries including the UK, the US, France and switzerland. I am more optimistic about the situation, he concluded. (via Larry Elliott) 3D printing has captured the attention of WEF delegates, with a large crowd forming to watch a demonstration of how the modelling and fabrication process works. Neil Gershenfeld of the Fab Lab drew a cube on a screen, then a sphere, and used one to manipulate the shape of the other. He then niftily reshaped them, using a tool that was 'resisted' by the shapes to make a more intricate design. The gathering even attracted Sir Tim Berner-Lee, the father of the web, who positioned himself in front of the screen and took copious notes. Now there's a man who can spot an important technology.... Bill Browder, the veteran hedge fund boss, has predicted that Vladimir Putin's government would collapse within a year if the price of oil fell to $60 a barrel. A barrel of Brent Crude is \u00a3107 a barrel, somewhat below the $117 figure oil-dependent Russia relies on to balance its budget. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph in Davos, Browder described himself as \"Putin's no 1 enemy\". He has led a global campaign to bring to punish the top Kremlin officials he sees as responsible for the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. (Background here). All it will take is a fall in the price of oil to $60 a barrel and Putin will be gone within a year. You'd be surprised how brittle the system really is. Browder also had a warning for investors piling into other fast-growing markets, the BRICs or Mints. Lot of ill-informed money went into these countries during the credit boom. The next big thing coming is that some of these countries will start to close their capital accounts. We're already seeing it in Egypt and Brazil in different ways. This could start a chain-reaction, he said. People will start asking themselves which country is next. Once this start people may find they can't get their money out again. JR More on Vince Cable, with an intriguing report from Sky News that the business secretary plans to block a pay increase for the chief executive of the newly-privatised Royal Mail. The row over pay has been simmering since last weekend, reports Sky, when Donald Brydon, Royal Mail's chairman, told the Sunday Telegraph that increasing Moya Greene's pay was necessary if the company wanted to keep her. Describing her as the \u201clowest paid chief executive in the FTSE100\u201d, he said: I think it\u2019s only fair to pay Moya the right market rate for her job. Now Cable is said to be ready to use his vote to block any increase. This comes after Greene was forced to hand back a \u00a3250,000 housing allowance last year, prompting her to bemoan \"the hopelessly broken\" system for setting executive pay. JR Democratic dividend\u201d, at least so far, is the catchiest phrase of the session on Africa in reference to the improved democracy across the continent (writes Jill Treanor). Even so Oxfam's Winnie Byanyima took the opportunity to remind participants of the research put out the charity just as the WEF was beginning, that people are being trapped in a cycle of poverty. \u201cThe 85 wealthiest people in the world own the same wealth as half the population of the world, there is something wrong with that because it is immoral.\" Julian Roberts, boss of London-listed insurer Old Mutual, was sporting what looked to be a South African flag scarf, said he wouldn't be investing in Africa if there were not opportunities \u2013 50% of the people are under 20. But there were problems \u2013 one infrastructure project Old Mutual funded was subsequently nationalised. \u201cAfrica cannot exist without a handshake between private enterprise and the public sector,\u201d said Roberts. He also called for changes in visa requirements and import controls -pointing to the month it can take to get goods and services out of west Africa. Aliko Dangote, a leading Nigerian businessman through his Dangote Group, lamented the lack of trade within Africa, currently just 11% of the total trade. As a Nigerian he said he needed 38 visas to move around the continent making it easier for Americans to move around and do business. The president of Nigeria, Goodluck Elebe Jonathan, who was asked about the oil that \u201cdisappears\u201d each year from the oil-rich Niger Delta. He insisted was not due to corruption. Vince Cable has said the UK is seeing \"spectacular improvements\" to productivity in key manufacturing sectors, but faces \"serious problem\" if this was not spread more broadly across the economy. Speaking at the House of Common's business, innovation and skills select committee, the business secretary said productivity had to improve. We have a serious problem if it continues but actually the poor productivity performance is a flipside of having a relatively favourable performance on employment. We are working with some of the key industries - aerospace, cars, biosciences, supply chains for energy and others - and lot of the work around innovation and skill training and supply chain rebuilding is about improving British productivity. You are now seeing spectacular improvements in productivity in some of those key manufacturing sectors. It hasn't happened through the rest of the economy. I've taken quotes from the Press Association. A couple more photos from this morning's sessions The Office for Budget Responsibility has issued its comment on figures showing a drop in government borrowing. The implicit message for the chancellor is 'don't celebrate too soon'. The 2013-14 PSNB [Public Sector Net Borrowing] forecast remains uncertain. Tax receipts will depend in part on the performance of the economy over the remainder of the year, but there are additional uncertainties, such as the tax expected from financial sector bonuses and the extent to which receipts from self-assessment (SA) income tax are affected by the reduction in the additional rate of income tax to 45p. And on the spending side, much will depend on departments\u2019 surrenders of underspends in their supplementary estimates (usually published in February) and the extent to which those estimates are in turn underspent. Central and local government monthly expenditure outturns are also prone to revision well after the end of the financial year. Worth bearing in mind, because the ONS figures are estimates subject to revision. JR Sir Richard Branson has been taking part at another lunch event, on the 2030 agenda for progress in the developing world. It was billed as a private lunch, but some details are being tweeted -- with the Telegraph's Kamal Ahmed reporting that Branson called for penalties for drugs offences to be relaxed: Oxfam's Greenpeace International Executive Director, Kumi Naidoo, was also on the panel and reports that Branson called on Davos attendees to \"replace dirty business with clean business\". Matt Damon and Gary White of Water.org were also attending-- last night, Damon explained that they hope to raise money in Davos today to fund more micro loans to people in the developing world who need a supply of clean water. Gilt yields have continued to climb after the big fall in UK unemployment. At 12:30 they were up six basis points at 2.895%. The rise took the spread between British and German interest rates to its widest in more than eight years, Reuters reported. Investors are betting on a rate rise in the UK whereas talk in the eurozone is of whether the ECB will loosen monetary policy. Hence the widening gap between the rate investors will accept to buy UK and German government bonds in the market. Sterling rose to a one-year high against the euro, too. Economists at Citi have moved their target date for a UK rate rise to the final quarter of this year from their earlier forecast of the second quarter of 2015. Plenty there for the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to ponder. SF There wasn't much jubilation among the Davos panel at the session on the Global Financial Outlook this morning. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, said the US economy has hit a dull rut, and also predicted that emerging markets will suffer as capital continues to flow out. Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider tweeted the key points: And Standard Chartered CEO Peter Sands echoed a point being made in the session on the European recovery - May's elections could change the picture: Jennifer has handed over to me, Sean Farrell, for a while. I wrote the Greece post just now. Greece's highest administrative court has overruled pay cuts for the police and armed forces imposed by the government in 2012, Reuters reports. The decision could create a \u20ac500m gap in the country's finances, causing further complications for talks between Greece and its lenders over more rescue loans, the report said. The ruling hasn't been made public but was confirmed by officials, Reuters said. The 10% cut was judged unconstitutional because as a core part of the state they warrant protection, an official told the agency. SF Even the powerbrokers of Davos stop for lunch, and today they're tucking into a buffet feast hosted by the government of Nigeria (writes GW, on a laptop propped up on a pile of mangos and pineapples). Much bantering is taking place between delegates, while a looped video hails Nigeria's many economic opportunities (a growing middle class, big oil reserves etc). No mention of human rights concerns, alas. Shrugging off the latest fall in unemployment, the FTSE 100 index is down 0.08% at 6828 points. According to Reuters, this marks a step back from an 8-month peak, with companies unsettled about rate rises. JR Nouriel Roubini, the economist who forecast that a housing slump would cause an economic crash, is making more eye-catching predictions at Davos. JR That session on whether Europe was \"back\" from the brink of crisis ended with Accenture's top man in France, Pierre Nanterme, criticising Europe's leaders for fueling extremist political groups. Nanterme said he was \"extremely concerned\" about the European elections, given the rise of extreme parties in Europe riding on the back of record unemployment. He said European leaders and policymakers were to blame for failing to address people's fears over inequality and employment, issues that are \"entirely absent\" from the technical debate about Europe. People \"want a job, they want inclusion and diversity within Europe\", Nanterme said. Trade Union leaders have welcomed the fall in UK unemployment, but sounded notes of caution. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, described the big fall in unemployment as encouraging. But while headline unemployment is within a whisker of the Bank\u2019s forward guidance threshold, an early interest rate rise would clobber mortgage holders and businesses \u2013 jeopardising our economic recovery. Patchy levels of jobs growth in parts of the north and the continuing squeeze on living standards should make the Bank of England think twice before considering a rate raise. The TUC\u2019s latest economic report found that the likelihood of being in work has fallen in the North East, North West, West Midlands and South West since mid-2010, despite the number of people in work increasing by around 780,000 across the UK. Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, had a message for the Low Pay Commission, soon to issue its recommendations on the minimum wage. Britain\u2019s workers need a decent pay rise so that wages are not continually eroded by inflation. Unite has repeatedly called for the national minimum wage to be raised by \u00a31.50 an hour from the current \u00a36.31 \u2013 and we urge the Low Pay Commission to make that recommendation. To put in it perspective, the UK has one of the highest rates of personal debt in Europe, millions are working for poverty wages and thousands of people rely on food banks to put a meal on the table for their family, yet the stock market is performing well. Companies can well afford to be more generous when it comes to paying more to their workers. JR The former Cabinet secretary Lord Gus O'Donnell is in Davos trying to raise awareness about mental health. O'Donnell heads the WEF's council on well being and mental health, and says policy makers and business need to tackle the issue. He told Larry Elliott that: \"One in four members of the workforce suffers from some of mental health problem and the benefits of picking up problems early are considerable. Problems are treatable.\" O'Donnell says there are three big benefits of early action: a much-smaller NHS bill for anti-depressants; fewer people on disability benefits and preventing people from losing precious employment skills. \"This is a big issue, but nobody talks about it\", he added. Over in Brussels, the EU executive has called on Europe to cut its carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The 40% target still has to be written into law, a lengthy process that involves the EU's 28 member states and the European Parliament. The European Commission has also called for a 27% of Europe's energy to come from renewable energy by 2030, and for energy savings of 25%. For full coverage go to the Guardian's environment blog. JR The politics of interest-rate decisions... JR Amid all the drama over the unemployment data, let's not overlook an improvement in the UK public finances. Government borrowing fell to \u00a312.1bn in December, down \u00a32.1bn from last year. The figure excludes bank bailouts. You can see the full Office for National Statistics data set here. JR Sir Tim Berners-Lee made a surprise intervention \"from the floor\" into a Davos debate about Big Brother and a conversation about haystacks \u2013 bundles of data being collected by the governments, reports Jill Treanor. \"When you are operating at this level you have no idea if these people are American citizens or been suspected of committing some sort of crime,\u201d the father of the web said. Lots of the data isn't used and Berners-Lee called for a discussion about what the information is used for. We need to talk about even if you do get the data what can you use it for. Is it data you could use for someone taking out an insurance policy, what types of things... Larry Elliott, the Guardian's economics editor, thinks the Bank of England will be re-writing its forward guidance policy, after unemployment fell faster than expected. Here is a sneak preview of his analysis. Unemployment is falling fast. In the quarter ending in November, the jobless total saw its biggest drop since modern records began. The jobless rate is currently 7.1% and will hit the Bank of England\u2019s threshold for contemplating an interest rate rise next month. Does this mean that Threadneedle Street seriously underestimated the strength of the labour market? Yes it does. Will Mark Carney have to announce a change to the Bank\u2019s forward guidance strategy next month? Yes he will. Is an increase in the cost of borrowing imminent? No it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s take those points one by one. Back in August, when Carney announced forward guidance, the Bank said that by early 2016 there was still a 50% chance that unemployment would be above 7%. By November, the Bank thought the jobless rate would get to 7% by 2015. Now it looks like it will do so before the end of 2013. That, to put it mildly, is a big forecasting error, albeit not the first the Bank has been guilty of in recent years. The minutes of the December meetings of the monetary policy committee shows that the latest figure came as little surprise to Threadneedle Street, noting that the 7% threshold would be reached \u201cmaterially earlier\u201d than expected in the Bank\u2019s November inflation report. As to what Carney does now, it would be daft to expect the governor to junk the big policy change he initiated after taking over from Mervyn King back in the summer. Nor does it seem all that likely that after just six months, Carney will move to the much looser form of forward guidance used by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, where policy makers gauge whether the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates. Instead, the most likely outcome is that the 7% threshold will be dropped to 6.5%. That would leave the principle of forward guidance intact while adjusting to changed circumstances. More to follow here JR Harvard professor Ken Rogoff does pay credit to Europe's politicians for being \"light years\" ahead of Washington in realising the scale of the problem in inequality,and the labour force's shrinking share of the pie. More progressive taxation will be needed to rebalance the situation, he suggests. And if Europe takes too long to tackle its problems, it may wake up from its slumbers to find it's a lot smaller in globaal terms. Following a larger than expected fall in unemployment, economists are not expecting a change to interest rates anytime soon. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency company World First, thinks the odds are against a rate rise, for \"three good reasons\". The Bank of England has been eager in these minutes to emphasise that productivity growth has been \u2018disappointing\u2019. They will likely use this as a reason for keeping policy very loose despite unemployment falling below the 7% threshold alongside. Wages \u2013 despite the recent anecdotal data from PMIs and some companies, especially in the services sector, that wage pressure is building we are still waiting for the 3m average to get back above 1.0% let alone CPI at 2.0%. Rate hikes are unlikely to be popular in an environment of falling real wages. Lastly, we\u2019re looking at the pound. The Bank of England has expressed concerns of late in the run higher of GBP. Moves to raise rates and tighten policy will be a shot in the arm for an already overvalued currency; a killer for any \u2018export-driven-march-of-the-makers\u2019. In a killer line, he adds: As it stands at the moment forward guidance is proving to be exactly what everyone believes it to be; a policy that allows for further loose monetary policy and reflation of a credit bubble. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics, agrees there will be no rate rise. We think that there is a strong chance that the Committee will alter its forward guidance alongside next month\u2019s inflation report in order to provide the recovery with more support. Howard Archer at IHS, thinks unemployment is unlikely to improve at such a fast pace in future. The recent rate of improvement in the labour market has been both impressive and surprising, but we are dubious that unemployment will keep falling at such a rapid rate... We also anticipate that employment growth will increasingly be limited by increasing productivity as many companies are able to make greater use of the workers they already have. The fall in the unemployment is also likely to be limited by an expanding labour pool and by further job losses in the public sector. The workforce is expected to be lifted by some people returning to the jobs market as the overall improved economic environment makes them more optimistic about getting jobs. It may also be that a significant number of more confident companies are now taking on workers earlier than they really need them \u2013 in anticipation that the UK really is set for a period of sustained, healthy growth, and to ensure that they get potentially the best staff available. If this a significant factor, it would also suggest that the growth in employment will moderate over the coming months. He also thinks interest rates will stay unchanged at 0.5% until mid 2015. JR Axel Weber hammers home his point about Europe's weak recovery, saying that the speed at which it's now growing \"still feels like a crisis\". He told a packed room at Davos (highlights start here) that: The economy is too weak to sustain the kind of growth in jobs we need to get out of this crisis. Europe is also vulnerable to cutting-edge technologies such as 3D printing, Sorrell warns, which allow companies to cut their workforces. The Bank of England is getting a fair bit of stick for its dodgy economic forecasting. The shifting economic data puts the bank's forward guidance policy under strain - a pledge to hold interest rates until unemployment falls to 7%. The bank now says there is no immediate need to raise interest rates, even if unemployment falls to 7%. From the minutes of the monetary policy committee: Looking beyond the immediate policy decision, the Committee noted that while the recovery was becoming more firmly entrenched, productivity growth had been disappointing, and unemployment had fallen faster than expected. Inflation had returned to the 2% target, however, and cost pressures were subdued. Members therefore saw no immediate need to raise Bank Rate even if the 7% unemployment threshold were to be reached in the near future. Moreover, it was likely that the headwinds to growth associated with the aftermath of the financial crisis would persist for some time yet and that inflationary pressures would remain contained. Consequently when the time did come to raise Bank Rate, it would be appropriate to do so only gradually. The MPC also points out that weak pay growth \"pointed to the continued existence of slack in the labour market\". So unemployment has some way further to fall. JR Axel Weber of UBS (ex-Bundesbank) says the risks facing Europe have receded, but the region could face new upheaval this year. European growth rates are too weak, he warns, saying: The mood in financial markets may have improved, but the economic situation in many European countries will not improve. Weber says there are two threats -- May's European elections which could see more extremist parties enter the European Parliament, and possibly act like the US Tea Party.... ...and Europe's upcoming asset quality review (stress-testing eurozone banks). That test is meant to be an exam, and to be a credible exam someone needs to fail it, argues Weber. That could lead to market turbulence as speculators try to bet which banks will be winners or losers. Ken Rogoff tells Davos that the easing of the eurozone crisis is the single biggest reason for the pick-up in the global economy. But the \"really horrific\" youth unemployment stats are a big worry - Europe is an aging society, and it's losing the valuable resource of its youth. Sir Martin Sorrell and Ken Rogoff have agreed that Europe is stronger than a year ago, but still faces deep problems -- particularly its youth unemployment crisis. Sorrell told the \"Is Europe Back?\" session that he was \"very bullish\" about Germany and Poland, and also Russia. The IMF's new forecasts (yesterday) also give hope to George Osborne and David Cameron ahead of next year's election. \"The bookends of Europe\", UK and Germany, are doing well, says Sorrell. But three countries worry him - France (still on the downstroke of the U, says Sorrell), Italy (bumping on the bottom) and Spain (on the upturn, but with unacceptably high levels of unemployment). Sorrell adds: You cannot have a situation where 50% of your young people are out of work... it is politically and socially unacceptable. The social implications of unemployment are extremely critical, he adds. UK workers continue to see their wages lag behind prices. While inflation is running at 2.1%, average pay (excluding bonuses) had gone up 0.9%. But this masks a disparity between public and private sector workers. Private sector pay was up 1.1%, compared to 0.3% in the public sector. JR The jobs story in a bar chart. JR Here is some of the chatter on Twitter on the UK unemployment figures and BoE minutes: And from Treasury secretary Danny Alexander: JR So what does the Bank of England do now? UK unemployment has fallen faster than expected, good news for the economy (and chancellor George Osborne), but raising questions over the BoE's commitment to freeze interest rates, until unemployment falls below 7%. More details: The UK's unemployment rate has dropped to 7.1% in the three months to November 2013, a total of 2.32m jobless compared to 2.48m for the preceding quarter (ILO measures). Average weekly earnings were up 0.9% in the period The claimant count fell by 24,000 in December. The Bank of England's monetary committee policy has said unemployment will hit the 7% threshold \"materially earlier\" than forecast. The MPC minutes also show that the bank voted 9.0 to keep bond buying programme at 375 bn. In response Sterling is up against the dollar to $1.6553 UK 10-yr gilt yields have risen to 2.854% JR Back in Davos, a group including Axel Weber (former Bundesbank president and current chairman of UBS), economist Ken Rogoff and advertising chief Sir Martin Sorrell are holding a debate titled: Is Europe Back? (that's back from the brink of eurozone calamity and recession woes). It's being streamed here. Breaking news: UK unemployment falls to 7.1%, significantly better than expected. JR As promised - here's the story of how several technology CEOs have told Davos that fundamental legal changes need to be made in the light of the Edward Snowden/NSA revelations. Jill Treanor reports from this morning's session on \"The New Digital Context\" The boss of BT admitted on Wednesday that customers could not be guaranteed 100% privacy when using the internet or mobile devices and called for changes to \u201cmurky\u201d laws on data collection. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gavin Patterson addressed the issues throw into open by the Guardian's investigation into the NSA through the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Asked if he wanted more laws, Patterson, who became the boss of BT recently, said: \u201cExactly, making it clear. It's just too murky at the moment it needs to be transparent and needs to be clear guidelines about what's acceptable and what isn't, Paterson said. \u201cThe legislation has to catch up . This is a challenge for the many different parts of our business models, it's often several years behind. It's not fit for purpose today. Everybody recognises the internet plays a role in protection us and we've got to make sure it's not intrusive and also protects the rights to the individual. I don't think the legislation has managed to keep up\u201d. Could there be 100% privacy? \u201cI think that's unlikely and I think that's [would mean] zero security,\u201d Patterson. President Barack Obama on Friday announced reforms to the NSA, ending government storage of phone data and sparking fresh debate about the way data is collected. Marissa Mayer, the boss of Yahoo, told attendees in Davos it should be clear what data is being disclosed. She said: \u201cWhat's murky about some of what is happing today is people don't necessary know what data is being collected and about what is being used.\". She added that \u201c2014 will be a tipping point.... it will change everyone's daily routines very fundamentally\". The chairman and chief executive of Cisco, John Chambers, called for co-operation. He said: \u201cWe're not a service provider...we don't share our code with anyone. We come at it from a different perspective. We need rules of the road that everyone can live with... We need all companies to come up with general guidelines.... Countries need to work together to solve these issues, he said. Bill Gates, who is expected to be at Davos, has been making some big predictions. The billionaire philanthropist thinks there will be almost no poor countries left in the world by 2035. More than 70% of countries will have a higher income than China does today, while child mortality in developing countries will fall sharply. In the Gates Foundation's annual letter, he and his wife Melinda, tackle head on \"the myth that poor countries are doomed to stay poor. I am optimistic enough about this that I am willing to make a prediction. By 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world. (I mean by our current definition of poor*). Almost all countries will be what we now call lower-middle income or richer. Countries will learn from their most productive neighbours and benefit from innovations like new vaccines, better seeds, and the digital revolution. Their labour forces, buoyed by expanded education, will attract new investments. *Specifically, I mean that by 2035, almost no country will be as poor as any of the 35 countries that the World Bank classifies as low-income today, even after adjusting for inflation. A few countries will be held back by war, politics (North Korea, barring a big change there), or geography (landlocked nations in central Africa). And inequality will still be a problem: There will be poor people in every region. But most of them will live in countries that are self-sufficient. Every nation in South America, Asia, and Central America (with the possible exception of Haiti), and most in coastal Africa, will have joined the ranks of today\u2019s middle-income nations. More than 70% of countries will have a higher per-person income than China does today. Nearly 90% will have a higher income than India does today. It will be a remarkable achievement. When I was born, most countries in the world were poor. In the next two decades, desperately poor countries will become the exception rather than the rule. Billions of people will have been lifted out of extreme poverty. The idea that this will happen within my lifetime is simply amazing to me. The Gates couple also identify two other myths about poverty. Bill Gates is concerned that the notion that \u201cforeign aid is a waste of money\u201d, which he says is often based on anecdotal evidence, and gives governments an excuse to slash aid budgets. [Aid] saves and improves lives very effectively, laying the groundwork for the kind of long-term economic progress The third myth the couple identify is that \"saving lives leads to overpopulation\". \"This kind of thinking has gotten the world into a lot of trouble,\" writes Melinda Gates. JR Union leader Philip Jennings, who heads up UNI Global Union, has been criticising the sinners of the world economy in CNBC's TV studio. He tweets his best lines: CNBC is excited by Marissa Mayer's declaration that mobile traffic will have overtaken PC traffic by the end of the year. Mayer (who's one of the co-chairs of Davos this year) has been talking enthusiastically about how mobile innovation will help to make this a crucial year for the tech sector. The technology chief executives on this morning's panel are being quizzed about the National Security agency spying scandal. John Chambers of Cisco is arguing that there needs to be \"co-operation\" beween tech firms and the NSA, while BT's Gavin Patterson says that the existing laws are too murky. This follows revelations, in the documents leaked by Edward Snowden, that the NSA had access to the data collected by some of the world's biggest technology companies. We should have the quotes shortly: By the end of 2014, Yahoo! will be handling more traffic from mobile devices than from desktops, says Mayer - an example of why \"the world's biggest start-up\" needs to keep innovating. An interesting story from the Financial Times, which reports that Britain's banks have warned against a loss of UK influence in the European Union. In a submission to the government, the British Bankers\u2019 Association said the balance of competence between the EU and UK was \u201cbroadly appropriate\u201d. In a separate intervention, Jim Cowles, Citi Bank's chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Asia, told the FT of \u201cmounting concern\u201d among clients about their ability to continue using the UK as a regional hub if the country were to exit. It\u2019s not that international companies will stop investing in Britain, but their investment just won\u2019t be at the scale we have become accustomed to. Almost on cue, the boss of Unilever, the consumer goods giant that makes PG Tips tea and Magnum ice cream, warns that it could cut its investment in the UK in the event of an EU exit. Paul Polman, chief executive of the Anglo Dutch conglomerate, said: We tend to forget all the good things that the common market has brought, also to Britain, and take that for granted and then only focus on the things that need to be changed and portraying that as bad. EU exit could see Unilever cut investment in UK JR Good morning from London, where we have a packed day of economic news. Official statistics out at 9.30 are expected to show a fall in UK unemployment, to around 7.3%, or even 7.2%, from 7.4%. Good news for everyone, but a headache for the Bank of England. If as expected, unemployment continues to fall, this will put pressure on the Bank to change or even abandon, its forward guidance policy, under which interest rates are frozen until unemployment has fallen to 7%. UK unemployment challenge for Carney as jobless rate expected to fall We are also looking out for the Bank of England minutes and UK borrowing figures for December. Elsewhere, the UK energy regulator has issued a stinging rebuke to RWE NPower for getting its figures wrong. Ofgem accused NPower of publishing \u201cmisleading\u201d figures about the cost of transporting its energy. From the BBC In its analysis, Npower said the cost of transporting gas and electricity - so-called network costs - was likely to rise by 74% by 2020, pushing up household bills. Between 2015 and 2020, it claimed network costs would increase from \u00a3295 per customer to \u00a3314. But Ofgem, which regulates that side of the industry - and sets the price controls - said those figures were wrong. It said that after this year network costs per household \"are expected to remain broadly flat in real terms\". JR 2014 will be the \"tipping point\" year for digital technologies, Mayer adds. The session on the digital future is quite lively -- it began with the crowd of CEOs being asked to name a gadget that changed their life. No points for BT's Gavin Patterson, who couldn't name one. But Marissa Mayer cited her smartphone, while Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com named his FitBit exercise device. If (unlike RBS) you couldn't make it to Davos this week, you can track a lot of the action on the World Economic Forum's own website: WEF Live. Trudging through the snow last night, we were slightly surprised to spot that Royal Bank of Scotland (the bank saved from oblivion by the UK taxpayer) has set up a home-from-home in the heart of Davos. Complete with computer screens, comfy-looking sofas, and a counter groaning under fruit juices and pastries. That sort of operation doesn't come cheap at WEF. RBS, though, insists that it's a good investment: RBS is the biggest backer of UK businesses and plays a key role in helping corporates access international markets. That is why the bank needs to have a presence at events like Davos that are important for our clients. Cow bells are ringing across the Congress Centre (heck, this is Switzerland), which means the first sessions are underway -- there's quite a scrum to hear what Marissa Mayer et all have to say about the Digital World. Lots on in Davos today - here's a few highlights to watch out for. 9am Davos time (8am GMT): Tech CEOs including Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, BT's Gavin Patterson and Salesforce.com's Marc Benioff debate \"The New Digital Context\". 10.45am: A discussion on \"Is Europe Back?\" including Axel Weber, Kenneth Rogoff, and Sir Martin Sorrell 1.45pm: \"Africa's next billion\", with Oxfam's Winnie Byanyima, Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan, and Nigeria's billionaire businessman Aliko Dangote. 5.45pm: Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe gives a special address on \"The reshaping of the world: Vision from Japan\". Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the 44th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Around 2,500 delegates, including scores of world leaders, are attending WEF over the next four days, to discuss and debate a wide range of issues - from risks to the global economy to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria. The overarching theme of the meeting, which will take place until 25 January, is: 'The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business' A bold title, recognising the seismic changes that have rattled the global economy over the last six years.... ....but can those attending the temple of globalisation actually deliver results, given their role in creating the situation we face today? Last night, at the welcome ceremony, Davos founder Klaus Schwab urged delegates to bring their brains, souls, hearts and good nerves to make progress. The congress hall then rang to the stern words of Pope Francis who (through an envoy) urged Davosites to deliver \"a new, profound, sense of responsibility\", adding: The growth of equality \u2026 calls for decisions, mechanisms and processes directed to a better distribution of wealth, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor, which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality. (see last night's liveblog for the details). I'm here with my colleagues Larry Elliott and Jill Treanor, and between us we'll try to cover as much of the event as possible. Jennifer Rankin back in London will cover other important breaking news through the day too.",

In the quarter ending in November, the jobless total saw its biggest drop since modern records began. The jobless rate is currently 7.1% and will hit the Bank of England\u2019s threshold for contemplating an interest rate rise next month.</p> <p>&#xa0;Does this mean that Threadneedle Street seriously underestimated the strength of the labour market? Yes it does. Will Mark Carney have to announce a change to the Bank\u2019s forward guidance strategy next month? Yes he will. Is an increase in the cost of borrowing imminent? No it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>&#xa0;Let\u2019s take those points one by one. Back in August, when Carney announced forward guidance, the Bank said that by early 2016 there was still a 50% chance that unemployment would be above 7%. By November, the Bank thought the jobless rate would get to 7% by 2015. Now it looks like it will do so before the end of 2013.</p> <p>&#xa0;That, to put it mildly, is a big forecasting error, albeit not the first the Bank has been guilty of in recent years. The minutes of the December meetings of the monetary policy committee shows that the latest figure came as little surprise to Threadneedle Street, noting that the 7% threshold would be reached \u201cmaterially earlier\u201d than expected in the Bank\u2019s November inflation report.</p> <p>&#xa0;As to what Carney does now, it would be daft to expect the governor to junk the big policy change he initiated after taking over from Mervyn King back in the summer. Nor does it seem all that likely that after just six months, Carney will move to the much looser form of forward guidance used by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, where policy makers gauge whether the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates.</p> <p>&#xa0;Instead, the most likely outcome is that the 7% threshold will be dropped to 6.5%. That would leave the principle of forward guidance intact while adjusting to changed circumstances.</p> </blockquote> <p>&#xa0;<em>More to follow </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/business\">here</a></p> <p><strong>JR</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-22T11:33:44.016Z\">at 11.33am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52dfa115e4b0f7ffe46e716f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-22T10:50:31.770Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Harvard professor Ken Rogoff does pay credit to Europe's politicians for being \"light years\" ahead of Washington in realising the scale of the problem in inequality,and the labour force's shrinking share of the pie.</p> <p>More progressive taxation will be needed to rebalance the situation, he suggests.

The workforce is expected to be lifted by some people returning to the jobs market as the overall improved economic environment makes them more optimistic about getting jobs.</p> <p>It may also be that a significant number of more confident companies are now taking on workers earlier than they really need them&#xa0;\u2013 in anticipation that the UK really is set for a period of sustained, healthy growth, and to ensure that they get potentially the best staff available.

It's just too murky at the moment it needs to be transparent and needs to be clear guidelines about what's acceptable and what isn't, Paterson said.</p> <p>\u201cThe legislation has to catch up . This is a challenge for the many different parts of our business models, it's often several years behind. It's not fit for purpose today.

By 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world. (I mean by our current definition of poor*). Almost all countries will be what we now call lower-middle income or richer. Countries will learn from their most productive neighbours and benefit from innovations like new vaccines, better seeds, and the digital revolution. Their labour forces, buoyed by expanded education, will attract new investments.</p> <p>*<em>Specifically, I mean that by 2035, almost no country will be as poor as any of the 35 countries that the World Bank classifies as low-income today, even after adjusting for inflation.</em></p> <p>A few countries will be held back by war, politics (North Korea, barring a big change there), or geography (landlocked nations in central Africa). And inequality will still be a problem: There will be poor people in every region.</p> <p>But most of them will live in countries that are self-sufficient. Every nation in South America, Asia, and Central America (with the possible exception of Haiti), and most in coastal Africa, will have joined the ranks of today\u2019s middle-income nations. More than 70% of countries will have a higher per-person income than China does today. Nearly 90% will have a higher income than India does today.</p> <p>It will be a remarkable achievement. When I was born, most countries in the world were poor. In the next two decades, desperately poor countries will become the exception rather than the rule. Billions of people will have been lifted out of extreme poverty. The idea that this will happen within my lifetime is simply amazing to me.</p> </blockquote> <p>&#xa0;The Gates couple also identify two other myths about poverty.</p> <p>Bill Gates is concerned that the notion that \u201cforeign aid is a waste of money\u201d, which he says is often based on anecdotal evidence, and gives governments an excuse to slash aid budgets. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Aid] saves and improves lives very effectively, laying the groundwork for the kind of long-term economic progress</p> </blockquote> <p>The third myth the couple identify is that \"saving lives leads to overpopulation\". \"This kind of thinking has gotten the world into a lot of trouble,\" writes Melinda Gates.</p> <p><strong>JR</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52df8a0ee4b064c8346ec1c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-22T09:08:21.800Z\">9.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Union leader Philip Jennings, who heads up&#xa0;UNI Global Union, has been criticising the sinners of the world economy in CNBC's TV studio.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England sent a clear message that it has no immediate plans to raise interest rates, despite a shock fall in the unemployment rate close to the level at which the Bank said it would consider a hike. Policymakers sought to ease fears of a rise after Britain's jobless rate fell sharply to 7.1% in the three months to November from 7.4%. It was a far bigger drop than economists were expecting, with most forecasting a modest fall to 7.3%. Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank's rate setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), said that although economic recovery was underway and unemployment was falling, inflation was back at the Bank's 2% target, easing the pressure to raise rates. \"It is therefore worth restating that the 7% unemployment level is only a threshold, not a trigger, and that the MPC sees no immediate need to increase interest rates even if 7% were to be hit in the near future,\" he said in a speech in Nottingham on Wednesday evening. His comments reiterated those in the minutes of the MPC's January policy meeting, which showed there would be no rush to raise rates. The committee said that when the time did come to raise rates, it would do so \"only gradually\". It suggested it would not raise rates until the Bank it had seen a pick up in wages growth and a more established recovery. Economists including those at the EY Item Club are not expecting a hike before mid 2015. Interest rates have been at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. \"By then, we expect the recovery to have broadened out into exports and investment and real wages should be growing again. The consumer needs that time to get its breath back following all the heavy lifting undertaken in recent quarters,\" said Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the Item Club. When the Bank's governor Mark Carney announced the introduction of so-called \"forward guidance\" on rates last summer, he was not expecting the jobless rate to fall to 7% until 2016. The Bank has since updated its view, but its most recent forecast suggested the rate would not be reached until the second half of 2015. In reality it now looks possible it will fall to that level next month. Economists said the Bank's next move would most likely be to announce a change to its forward guidance policy when it next updates its forecasts in the February inflation report, possibly by lowering the threshold to 6.5% unemployment and introducing a supplementary wage rise measure. \"Overall we gain the impression that the MPC does not want to raise rates soon and that (perhaps) it will bring its unemployment threshold down, possibly next month,\" said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. The total number of people out of work in Britain fell by 167,000 to 2.32 million in the three months to November according to the Office for National Statistics data. The number of people claiming jobless benefits in the UK also fell by 24,000 to a near five-year low of 1.25 million in December. The employment minister, Esther McVey, said: \"It's clear that the government's long-term economic plan to get people off benefits and into work so they can secure their future is proving successful.\" Employment meanwhile jumped by 280,000 to 30.15 million \u2013 the biggest quarterly rise since records began in 1971 \u2013 driven mainly by a rise in people with full-time work. Commenting on the increase, David Cameron said: \"More jobs means more security, peace of mind and opportunity for the British people.\" Despite the rise in employment, wage growth was flat at 0.9% between September and November, less than half the current 2% rate of inflation. People in the UK earned \u00a3447 a week on average in November, before tax and excluding bonuses. People worked an average 32.2 hour week over the three months, compared with 31.1hours in the previous quarter. MPC members said the slow pace of wage growth in the UK appeared to reflect weak growth in productivity, the January minutes showed.",

Phil Lachowycz of Fathom Financial Consulting: Households are still very indebted, and we don't need much of a rate rise to tip the housing market into reverse. Andrew Smith, Chief Economist at KPMG: Given that inflation has finally come down to target and that the economic recovery is still in its early stages, it would be perverse to do [raise rates] and as unemployment falls through 7%, the committee is more likely to change its guidance than raise interest rates. Andy Scott, currency dealers HiFX: Expectations of a hike next year will continue to make sterling look attractive, particularly against the euro, which could still see monetary policy eased due to very low inflation.

That will restrain the Bank's impulse to raise interest rates, but for how much longer when the economy is growing with a fresh army of new workers each month increasing the demand for goods and services and potentially pushing up inflation. As an aside, the figures also show that the vast majority of jobs in the three months to the end of November were taken by UK nationals. The number of people in employment increased by 280,000 to reach 30.15 million while the number of unemployed people fell by 167,000 to reach 2.32 million. That means 113,000 people got a job who were not on the unemployment register. Of these, only 26,000 were non-UK nationals.",

      "bodyText": "Europe's fragile recovery could be rattled this year by the upcoming European parliamentary elections and bank stress tests, the World Economic Forum was warned on Wednesday. Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, told an audience at Davos that \"there may be risk coming back\" into Europe which could undermine recent progress by governments and the European Central Bank to stabilise the situation. Weber said that May's European elections could lead to more extreme, or anti-European, parties gaining influence in the parliament. He cited the US Tea Party as an example of how such a group can stymie political process. Pierre Nanterme, chairman and CEO of Accenture, said he was \"extremely concerned\" about the European elections, given the rise of extreme parties in Europe riding on the back of record unemployment. He criticised European leaders and policymakers for failing to address people's fears over inequality and employment, issues that are \"entirely absent\" from the technical debate about Europe. People \"want a job, they want inclusion and diversity within Europe\", Nanterme said. Weber explained that the Asset Quality Review could also raise fresh concerns in the financial markets over the strength of Europe's banks. Those stress tests are meant to be an exam, he pointed out, and an exam is only credible if some candidates fail it. \"Despite pressure from politics, some will not pass,\" predicted Weber. He fears that speculators will try to guess the outcome of the stress tests, by buying winners and selling losers before the results come out. Europe's new rules on bailing in bond-holders means bank bonds, and insurance on them, will be targets. Banks which fail the tests will require additional capital \u2013 and Weber says this will \"put governments back into the game\" and put pressure on sovereigns to help their banks. Weber and Nanterme were speaking on a panel alongside Harvard professor Kenneth Rogoff, who said that the easing of the eurozone crisis was the single biggest reason for the pickup in the world economy last year. And there was broad agreement that Europe's youth unemployment crisis is a major threat to its long-term prospects, and to social and political unity across the region. Rogoff dubbed Europe's jobless rates \"really horrific\", warning that its ageing society risks destroying the valuable asset of its young people. Europe is \"severely growth challenged, and a region that really isn't taking care of its future,\" Rogoff added. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, cited Spain's \"unacceptably high\" youth unemployment rates as an example of Europe's problems. \"You cannot have a situation where 50% of your young people are out of work \u2026 it's politically and socially unacceptable,\" said Sorrell. On growth, Sorrell said that \"the bookends of Europe, the UK and Germany,\" are performing well, but that the countries in between are struggling. France is still on the downturn, he said, while Italy is bumping along the bottom. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2014.

      "bodyText": "Falling unemployment and higher tax receipts helped the government cut the annual deficit in December, according to the latest official figures. The Office for National Statistics said net borrowing, excluding the temporary effects of bank rescues and the Royal Mail pension fund transfer, was \u00a312.1bn in December, \u00a32.1bn lower than the figure recorded a year ago. In the eight months to December the total annual spending deficit was \u00a396.1bn, which was \u00a34.8bn lower than the same period in 2012/13. Analysts said the government was being rewarded for overseeing a growing economy, though the major benefits from rising income tax and national insurance receipts will be felt as the year progresses. The gentle decline in the UK government's annual overspend contrasts with most continental European countries where cuts have been deeper and annual deficits reduced at a faster pace. Under pressure from Brussels, Spain, Ireland and Greece have implemented steep cuts to meet Maastricht commitments limiting annual overspends to below 3% of GDP. Spain is scrabbling to meet a deficit target of 3.7% by the end of the financial year while the UK's is likely to still be above 6%. The total level of public sector net debt was \u00a31.25tn at the end of December 2013, equivalent to 75.7% of GDP. Some economists have welcomed the government's reticence to make steeper cuts in response to the higher welfare spending and reduced tax receipts that followed flatlining growth since 2010. Capital Economics said the government's deficit cutting plan was on target after three years of false starts. \"December's deficit takes underlying borrowing in the fiscal year to date to \u00a396.1bn, almost 5% down on the same period in 2012/13. Given that the OBR forecast underlying borrowing to fall by 3% this year, the fiscal squeeze is on track, for now,\" it said.

The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury's independent forecaster, said that with three months left of the financial year it was still uncertain whether the government would hit its borrowing targets. It said: \"Even at this relatively late point in the year, the 2013-14 public sector net borrowing forecast remains uncertain.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unemployment is falling fast. In the quarter ending in November, the jobless total saw its biggest drop since modern records began. The jobless rate is currently 7.1% and will hit the Bank of England's threshold for contemplating an interest rate rise next month. Does this mean that Threadneedle Street seriously underestimated the strength of the labour market? Yes it does. Will Mark Carney have to announce a change to the Bank's forward guidance strategy next month? Yes he will. Is an increase in the cost of borrowing imminent? No it isn't. Let's take those points one by one. Back in August, when Carney announced forward guidance, the Bank said that by early 2016 there was still a 50% chance that unemployment would be above 7%. By November, the Bank thought the jobless rate would get to 7% by 2015. Now it looks like it will do so imminently. It was, to put it mildly, is a big forecasting error, albeit not the first the Bank has been guilty of in recent years. The minutes of the January meeting of the monetary policy committee show that the latest figure came as little surprise to Threadneedle Street, noting that the 7% threshold would be reached \"materially earlier\" than expected in the Bank's November inflation report. As to what Carney does now, it would be daft to expect the governor to junk the big policy change he initiated after taking over from Mervyn King back in the summer. Nor does it seem all that likely that after just six months, Carney will move to the much looser form of forward guidance used by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, where policymakers gauge whether the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates. Instead, the most likely outcome is that the 7% threshold will be dropped to 6.5%. That would leave the principle of forward guidance intact while adjusting to changed circumstances. The final issue is whether interest rates will rise in the near future. Certainly, the strength of job creation has led to speculation in the financial markets that the Bank will move before the end of 2014, but for now the MPC will hold rates at 0.5%. There are two big reasons for this. The first is that rising employment has so far had no impact on inflation. Annual average earnings growth is still running at less than 1%, while the government's preferred measure of the cost of living has just fallen to its 2% target. Unless and until there is evidence that falling unemployment is affecting the outlook for inflation, the Bank will see no need to risk jeopardising what it believes to be a still fledgling recovery. The second issue is that none of the other major central banks \u2013 the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of Japan \u2013 is thinking about raising borrowing costs. If Threadneedle Street led the pack, it would risk driving up the value of sterling, making UK exports less competitive. Given that the recovery has started with Britain running a current account deficit of 5% of GDP, a stronger pound would not be welcome.",

In the words of the WEF's founder and chairman, Klaus Schwab: \"The slowdown is taking place against the backdrop of rising economic inequality, owing to the declining share of national income going to labour, a worldwide phenomenon \u2013 resulting from globalisation and technological progress \u2013 that poses a serious challenge to policymakers. Systems that propagate inequality, or that seem unable to stem its rise, contain the seeds of their own destruction.\" The map above shows inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient for the 34 OECD countries (Source: OECD) and the five Brics \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Source: World Bank). The higher the score, the more unequal the economy. A coefficient above 0.4 is generally regarded as the warning level for dangerous levels of inequality. 2: GDP growth The worst economic slump since the 1930s has been followed by the weakest recovery on record. Five years after the financial crisis sparked recession, growth is still weak in many countries \u2013 and negative in others. Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott says attention this year will focus on four issues: \"Can the US \"taper\" away its QE stimulus without aborting its tepid recovery and triggering a fresh crisis in one of the \"fragile five\" emerging countries (India, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey and Brazil)? Can China switch to a more liberalised model without a hard landing? Will the eurozone be able to avoid Japanese-style deflation? And will 2014 be the year when Japan emerges from two decades of slow growth and falling prices? Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will give a keynote speech on 22 January, and insiders are expecting an optimistic tone following signs that his stimulus package is working.\" The line chart above shows annual GDP growth rates from 2007 to 2012 for selected OECD and Brics countries. Fuller World Bank data is available in the table below. 3: Unemployment Unemployment is at near record levels of 12.1% in the eurozone \u2013 with around a quarter of the working-age population out of a job in Spain and Greece. Youth unemployment is much higher. \"Can a crisis really be over when 12% of the labour force is without a job,\" asked IMF managing director Christine Lagarde last month. \"When unemployment among the youth is in very high double digits, reaching more than 50% in Greece and Spain? And when there is no sign that it is becoming easier for people to pay down their debts?\" 4: Government debt PricewaterhouseCoopers' annual survey of chief executives found that the ability of debt-laden governments to rein in their deficits was cited as a concern by 71% of those surveyed \u2013 up from 61% in 2011. The chart above shows government debt as a percentage of GDP for selected countries. 5: Climate change and CO2 emissions The WEF is also concerned that governments are so caught up with trying to deal with economic problems that they were not properly addressing the long-term threat of climate change.

      "bodyText": "A survey revealing a jump in new orders at Britain's factories and figures showing booming mortgage lending were the latest signs of UK economic recovery, as the International Monetary Fund confirmed it had upgraded its UK growth forecast. New manufacturing orders grew at the strongest rate in almost three years in the three months to January, the CBI said; 34% of manufacturers reported an increase in new orders over the period, while 21% reported a fall, the business group reported in its latest industrial trends survey. The subsequent balance of +13% was the highest since April 2011. A pickup in the broader economy, with growth of 0.8% in both the second and third quarters of 2013, has helped to boost confidence among consumers and businesses in recent months. The IMF confirmed that it had upgraded its UK growth forecast to 2.4% for this year, from a previous forecast of 1.9%. The new forecast put Britain well ahead of Germany, which the IMF expects to grow by 1.6%, and France, which is forecast to grow by 0.9%. David Cameron took to Twitter to say the IMF upgrade was \"an encouraging sign of more jobs and security\".

A strengthening housing market has helped to underpin rising optimism about the UK's prospects, with house prices rising 8.4% in 2013, according to lender Nationwide. Mortgage lending increased by 23.8% in 2013 to \u00a3177bn, according to figures published on Tuesday by the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

Britain's car industry has been another bright spot for the economy, with new car sales up 10.8% in 2013 and figures published on Thursday expected to show an increase in UK manufacturing last year. The industry has been hailed by the government as a success story for British manufacturing, as companies including Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan continue to invest in the UK. Nissan, the UK's largest car manufacturer, has started production of the new Qashqai at its Sunderland factory, where more than 7,000 people are now employed. The Japanese company, which has operated in Sunderland for 28 years, has invested \u00a3534m in the UK development and production of the Qashqai, which supports 224 suppliers in 22 countries. The vast majority \u2013 81% \u2013 of cars made by Nissan in the UK are exported to more than 132 markets, but UK exports overall have failed to take off as much as policymakers hoped in recent years. The CBI's January industrial trends survey showed that although orders rose over the three-month period, the picture was less positive for January's survey alone.
