      "bodyText": "The desire for reform is ever strong from all sides of the political spectrum, and invariably it involves people advocating for things they like and demanding others agree with them all in the name of bipartisanship or \u201cworking together\u201d. In reality most reforms worth that name are rarely uncontroversial and almost never bipartisan. It is not true that we have lost the spirit of reform over the past decade. Anyone who argues that politicians cannot enact reform in the current era due to increased partisanship, or the 24 hour news cycle, or social media, or any other malady they believe is holding the nation back, should remember that not long ago we had a government that lacked a majority in both houses and yet introduced a price on carbon. That was an actual reform of the economy \u2013 it set it up for the next century as the world shifts away from fossil fuels use. So reform can be done, but invariably such changes need to be in place for some time otherwise they are susceptible to removal. It may seem the Abbott government rescinding the carbon price is a perfect example of how we are now unable to stomach reform, but in reality it was just another case of a conservative party doing its best to turn back the clock. All those who look with longing to the 1980s and 1990s when they would have you believe a spirit of bipartisan was in full flower should remember that the Liberal party would have abolished the capital gains tax had it won either the 1987 or 1990 elections. As it was, John Howard kept that desire buried in his heart and in 1999 changed the rules of indexation and introduced a 50% discount on capital gains tax that help set fire to the housing market and made negative gearing so lucrative. At the 1984 election, Andrew Peacock proposed allowing people to \u201copt out\u201d of Medicare and argued that \u201csocialised medicine is not the way\u201d. In 1987 Howard called Medicare \u201ca complete disaster\u201d and sought to replace it with a policy where people paid the first $250 of any medical and hospital bills in any one year. Abbott was thus not an indicator that things have changed, rather he was just representing the standard operating procedure of the Liberal party. The shock with Abbott\u2019s policy of rescinding the carbon price was not that he was seeking to undo a reform, but that he was rejecting scientific opinion as well. But then it is easier to take such a retrograde step when your government contains people such as our new deputy prime minster, Michael McCormack, who in his maiden speech in 2010 argued that just because there might be a drought \u201cdoes not mean we all need to listen to a government grant-seeking academic sprouting doom and gloom about climate changing irreversibly\u201d. The main problem with any reform is that if it is an actual policy which changes the economy or our society \u2013 such as the Family Law Act, the Native Title Act, Medicare, maternity leave, or any other number of measures \u2013 it will face supreme opposition and often needs a long period in place before opposition dies down. And even then the opposition will never fully die. Another problem is those arguing for things they call \u201creform\u201d generally have a vested interest in such reforms. The former secretary of the Treasury, Dr Ken Henry, may well have been a very capable public servant who offered great advice during the global financial crisis, but he is now the chair of NAB, so he is not exactly coming from a neutral position when giving a speech that argued for a shared purpose that includes a company tax cut \u2013 even if he did advocate for it in his tax review in 2010. Henry talked of the need for businesses to \u201caccept responsibility for the social and environmental outcomes of our activities\u201d, and he boasted of how NAB has \u201cbacked the not-for-profit Good Shepherd Microfinance\u201d and that it also has partnered with the CSIRO \u201cto identify some of the ways we, as a nation, can respond to the challenges and opportunities facing us out to 2060\u201d. All good community stuff, but it is also worth noting that one of the ways NAB identified it could respond to challenges was to reduce its staff by 4,000 employees over the next three years while also announcing a $5.3bn profit. Henry also called on governments to act with a \u201cshared purpose\u201d, arguing that \u201cwhen business commits to improving community wellbeing, it creates room for government to pursue a higher ambition. We should want our political leaders to be motivated to ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to choose lives of real value, and that future generations have no lesser opportunity.\u201d That\u2019s all lovely, but currently we have a government that has pursued a policy of attacking people on welfare for no social good, but because it plays well to their conservative base. This week it was revealed that a crackdown on Disability Support Pension \u201crorters\u201d which has so far subjected 30,056 people to medical assessments, had led to just 135 people having their pensions cancelled \u2013 just 0.45%. How\u2019s that for pursuing a higher ambition? It\u2019s hard to argue for a higher ambition when what one party believes is higher, the other thinks is lower. And do we want more agreement, or do we want just better advocacy for changes the public wishes, or perhaps needs? Henry argued that \u201cthe country needs a 10-year plan built on a unifying proposition\u201d. Really? Fine, get the Liberal party to agree we need a price on carbon and we\u2019ll talk. We mostly have a unifying position on how we treat asylum seekers, has that worked well? How about we all be unified on the issue of public health care and education? Does anyone have a picture of what that would look like in any real sense other than vague motherhood statements? We can argue forever on the need for reform, but it will be achieved as it always is \u2013 not through bipartisanship, but by one party advocating for it, generally off the back of grassroots support (especially in the case of social change), and then fighting hard to ensure it remains in place.

    "webTitle": "Pandering to baby boomers\u2019 mania for saving is economic madness | Phillip Inman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The greatest threat to our economy comes from its ageing population. With the baby-boomer generation making up a large proportion of society, we find ourselves in a situation where public policy is mostly geared towards shoring up the gains made by boomers over the past 40 years, and industrial disputes are driven by an ageing union membership most worried about its pension entitlements. It is a problem that Britain shares with its continental cousins, the US and Japan, now that all are struggling with a situation where a fifth of their populations is aged over 65 and the proportion is rising fast. Ageing populations have many effects on an economy, not least the desire among those nearing retirement age to save excessively. Each country\u2019s baby boomers pursue the holy grail of wealth slightly differently, but in the main, property and pensions are the twin pillars supporting decades of retirement. When wealth is your goal, there is one evil monster that needs slaying, and that is inflation. This is one of the main reasons that since the 1990s the Bank of England is under instruction to keep inflation anchored around 2%. A recent blog by economists at the Bank has caused a stir by arguing that far from the baby-boomer savings glut being a passing phase \u2013 or at least a situation that will fade as the boomers die off \u2013 it will be with us for decades to come. They argue that boomers have shown that they want to keep saving even as they move into their 80s and 90s, to fund possible extra health and care costs, and to pass on the maximum amount of wealth they can to their heirs. Some academics have argued that boomers will be forced to spend more than they save in later life to pay for health and long-term care, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be happening. The $100 trillion of savings sloshing round the global financial system just keeps growing. This is not just because people in young nations such as Indonesia and India are starting to build up savings, but because older Brits, Germans and Swedes are doing the same when there had been an expectation that they would switch to spending. You could see this trend in public policy changes under the ever-astute \u2013 and cravenly vote-seeking \u2013 chancellorship of George Osborne, who pledged to increase the inheritance tax threshold for couples to \u00a31m as a sweetener for older boomers. He also introduced changes that gave better-off pension savers the flexibility they craved to maximise their gains. This blew away the last vestiges of welfarism in private pension saving, and was a huge vote winner. An example of wealthy boomer behaviour could be seen in the Yorkshire Dales last week, where a plan to impose a 500% rise in council tax on second homes was defeated. The Dales Homeowners Action Group, set up to fight the proposal, said the planned increase, which would raise the average band D charge to \u00a38,500 a year, would have caused a house price crash as property flooded the market. When an estimated 3.4 million people in Britain own a holiday property, and with most of these owners likely to be over 50, it is not hard to see this as a powerful lobby of baby boomers acting to protect their gains. The Bank of England blog argues that the persistent glut of savings in stocks, bonds and property will maintain the trend of the past 30 years \u2013 of an excess of money chasing too few investment opportunities. And if older savers resist spending some of their pension, demand for goods is lower than expected, and inflation stays low. Central banks, in seeking to maintain a 2% inflation target, are the agents of baby boomers. It is their savings and wealth that are protected, not those of the young, who have much less, if any. Like most central bankers, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has acted to spur the economy with cheap borrowing, to howls of protest from savers. But his remit stops government from going any further. For instance, there are several past and present members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee who believe it was in the interests of the economy, if not of savers, to push interest rates even lower in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. There is an argument for a Treasury takeover of the Bank, ending its independence, to allow for higher inflation. With the politicians in charge, a 4% inflation target would allow interest rates to stay lower for longer, increase borrowing and discourage savings. But when the Treasury is enslaved to the boomers, unable to increase taxes, what would be the point? It\u2019s the boomers who need to see the light and vote for policies that share wealth. While they hoard it, they kill the chances of helping younger generations.",

      "bodyText": "The unwinding of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, via the sale to Bob Iger\u2019s Disney of his stake in Sky and his prime entertainment assets in 21st Century Fox, was never likely to be a trouble-free affair for the media tycoon. And so it proved last week when Comcast, the US cable giant led by Brian Roberts that owns the NBC broadcasting network, launched a \u00a322bn takeover bid for Sky, seemingly out of nowhere. The $66bn Disney deal is complicated as it is, because wrapped within it is Murdoch\u2019s ongoing attempt to buy the 61% of Sky that he doesn\u2019t already own. If the regulators approve both transactions, the 86-year-old will get to hand over 100% of Sky to Disney as an extra gift. But if Comcast gets its way and snaps up a majority stake from Sky\u2019s independent shareholders, the plan could unravel. Here are the answers to questions posed by the deal. Why is Sky so attractive? For all the competitive threats posed by Netflix, Amazon and Apple, Sky is Europe\u2019s largest pay-TV operator: with 22 million customers, it\u2019s a money-making machine, producing almost \u00a32bn in annual profits. As the UK market reached saturation, Sky\u2019s move in 2014 to buy its sister companies in Germany, Austria and Italy has given it that most attractive of draw cards: scope for significant growth. Sky has also been successful in launching on-demand services, such as Now TV, that go beyond the constraints of the satellite dish and meet the challenges of the Netflix era. Since changing the face of British pay-TV by acquiring the rights to Premier League football almost three decades ago, Sky has also become a major entertainment player, spending more than \u00a32bn annually on dramas such as Riviera and Fortitude, doing licensing deals for shows including Game of Thrones and Billions, and buying production companies, among them the maker of The Great British Bake Off. \u201cSky has persuaded households across Europe not just to pay significant money to watch TV, but also to buy broadband, telephony and more recently mobile,\u201d says Alex DeGroote of stockbroker Cenkos. \u201cIt is a one-off opportunity to buy a clear strategic asset in the European media landscape. It will go for a big price.\u201d Why are media giants Comcast and Disney so keen? US media groups are seeing growth slow dramatically in their home market and searching abroad for a more dynamic bottom line. For Comcast, a Sky deal would make it the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator, and increase its non-US revenues from 9% of the total to 25%. Then there is the need to meet the global digital threat from deep-pocketed Silicon Valley rivals. \u201cThe arrival of Netflix and players like Amazon and Apple puts US companies like Disney, Comcast and Fox up against powerful new competitors,\u201d said Jerry Dellis of investment bank Jefferies. \u201cTo compete, these formerly US-centric businesses need more global reach. Sky provides a direct route to customers in more countries.\u201d The reason Murdoch is selling most of 21st Century Fox, and Sky with it, is because his empire hasn\u2019t been able to grow fast enough to fight the tech threat after his $80bn bid for Time Warner failed in 2014. Disney, which is withdrawing its content from Netflix in the US in order to launch its own streaming service, has spied a chance to build its content and distribution power further with the Fox deal. Disney would add franchises including X-Men, Avatar, Ice Age and Deadpool from Fox\u2019s film studio, as well as TV shows such as The Simpsons and Modern Family, to its universe of superhero films and its Star Wars properties. And Sky\u2019s burgeoning streaming service, Now TV, would be a valuable platform for taking on Netflix and Amazon outside the US. Comcast, which owns the makers of Downton Abbey and Made in Chelsea, made a play for Fox but was rebuffed by Murdoch. Now it is aiming to take out the Sky part of his media empire directly. What would being owned by Comcast mean to Sky and the Murdochs? Comcast is seeking to buy 51% of Sky, and has said it could live with the Murdochs or Disney as minority shareholders, but it hopes to engineer a full takeover. The Murdochs have already decided to sell Sky to Disney \u2013 either Fox\u2019s 39% stake, or all of it if they can get their \u00a311.2bn deal to buy the rest of it past UK regulators. So on the face of it, selling to higher bidder Comcast might seem attractive. If the aim is to focus on newspapers and Fox News, why shouldn\u2019t Murdoch seek the highest price possible for his Sky stake? \u201cI don\u2019t think Murdoch wants to sell his shares to Comcast, but I assume he will,\u201d says Alice Enders of Enders Analysis. \u201cHe wants to secure 100% of Sky, and then sell to Disney. He has sold 39% of Sky to Disney already. The key point is what Disney is going to do.\u201d Whoever triumphs, Sky\u2019s fate is sealed. After being one of the UK\u2019s biggest media companies for three decades, it will move into full foreign ownership. \u201cIf Comcast were the buyer, we think Sky would still be very much in control of what it is doing in the UK, given Comcast has no pay-TV expertise in this market,\u201d said Sarah Simon of investment bank Berenberg. \u201cWe\u2019d expect Sky\u2019s small content production assets to be folded into Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal though, and for close collaboration between that business and the Sky commissioning department.\u201d Can Murdoch still win and hand over Sky to Disney? \u201cOf course he can win, if he offers more,\u201d says Berenberg\u2019s Simon. \u201cWe think he would need to offer a decent premium to the Comcast price, given that shareholders in Sky also have to assess the regulatory risk associated with the Fox bid. We don\u2019t see any regulatory issue with the Comcast deal.\u201d Murdoch is committed to Disney, so if he wants to raise his offer for Sky he would have to effectively get permission to do so. Disney has called the pay-TV broadcaster a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d among the $66bn of Fox assets it is buying. \u201cWhatever happens, for the Murdochs this should be seen as a chance to get a cash exit,\u201d says DeGroote at Cenkos. \u201cComcast can\u2019t believe it will get Sky at the price offered. We should see Comcast as an opportunistic opening salvo.\u201d If Murdoch misses out on taking over Sky, and then US regulators block the Disney/Fox deal, the media mogul would suddenly find himself with a \u201csub-scale collection of mainly US assets\u201d. What does it all mean for investors and TV viewers? A looming bidding war is good news for Sky investors. Sky shares were was trading at 769p the day before Murdoch made his offer in December 2016. Now the most bullish prediction is that Sky might be taken out at \u00a316. For viewers, there will be little change, and with Netflix and Amazon vying for consumers, a takeover is unlikely to see major price rises for Sky subscriptions. Comcast has pledged to increase original TV and film content, and Disney would probably do the same, which means more shows like Riviera, Fortitude and The Tunnel. The intrigue may lie in the Premier League TV rights auction in two years\u2019 time. Sky has just secured prime TV packages for the 2019-2022 seasons at a discount of \u00a3200m annually over its current deal. This surprised analysts, who had expected higher bids and modelled a hefty increase in costs into Sky\u2019s outlook as a result. The deal also prompted Comcast to break cover. The question is if Comcast, or Disney, becomes Sky\u2019s new owner, what will be the appetite for more Premier League football? Especially if a digital player like Amazon, which is still involved in bidding for two smaller unsold packages of games, decides to become a force in British football broadcasting next time. The speculation over Sky\u2019s future will rumble on, regardless of who emerges as its owner.",

      "bodyText": "The menu at Culford\u2019s on Dovehouse Green will be extraordinarily expensive, even for the restaurant\u2019s location on the King\u2019s Road in Chelsea, west London. Alongside grilled seabass and steak au poivre are a selection of caviars, including 50g of beluga for \u00a3250. The restaurant will also offer a good selection of the menu in pureed form \u2013 because Culford\u2019s will be the dining hall of the world\u2019s most expensive retirement home. Apartments in the Auriens residence, which is being built on the site of what was Kensington and Chelsea council\u2019s only local authority care home, cost a minimum of \u00a33m for a 900 sq ft one bedroom flat rising to \u00a310.5m for two bedroom \u201cpenthouses\u201d. Residents will also be charged a minimum annual service charge of \u00a316,344 \u2013 about double the state pension. Emma Dent-Coad, Labour MP for Kensington, said the council\u2019s decision to sell off the nursing home that stood on the site, was an act of \u201csocial cleansing of the elderly\u201d. \u201cThamesbrook [extra care home] was a place for everyone \u2013 those who had no money and those who had lots of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very good and happy home, but it is being replaced by a beyond luxury complex that very few people can afford.\u201d Dent-Coad, whose constituency includes the Grenfell Tower site, said the project was indicative of Kensington council\u2019s wider disregard for poor residents. \u201cThere is a crying need for more social and affordable housing in the borough, but what we\u2019re getting is more homes for the super rich,\u201d she said. Local councillor Linda Wade said it was the \u201cmost appalling outrage\u201d that the council sold off an \u201cexcellent home available for everyone regardless of funds [to replace it with] a home that only ageing oligarchs could afford\u201d. \u201cJust as with Grenfell tower, it is another example of Kensington and Chelsea council\u2019s crazy management not recognising or serving the needs of its residents,\u201d said Wade, a Liberal Democrat councillor. Wade said that if Thamesbrook had stayed open some of the older and most vulnerable Grenfell residents \u2013 who are still living in hotel rooms \u2013 could have been looked after in the home. For the few who are able to afford it, residents of the 55 Auriens apartments are promised \u201cthe most luxurious of retirements\u201d, with valet parking, pilates classes, a 15m swimming pool and separate \u201cvitality pool\u201d, and a private cinema. There is also a reading room designed by David Linley (the furniture designer and nephew to the Queen) and gardens created by Chelsea Flower Show winner Andy Sturgeon. The rooms, which cost about \u00a33,000 per sq to buy (more than the cost of some apartments in the Candy Brothers luxury One Hyde Park development), are designed by the company that fitted out Langham\u2019s hotel. Then there are the extras not included in the service fee, such as the in-house pet grooming salon which promises to cater \u201cfor every need from taking the dogs for daily walks in nearby parks such as Kensington Gardens or Battersea Park to providing a dog washing service if they return home with muddy paws\u201d. Also not included are nurses, who will be provided by Draycott Nursing at a cost of \u00a340 per hour. Karen Mulville, co-founder of Auriens, conceded that the home is \u201cvery expensive\u201d but said choosing to move into the development could be much more economical than staying at the family home and forking out for live-in carers. \u201cWe are clear it is for a very niche market,\u201d said Mulville, the wife of comedian Jimmy Mulville whose Hat Trick TV production company created Father Ted and Have I Got News For You? \u201cIt is a very small group, but we have had a huge amount of interest.\u201d Ten of the apartments, which are due to open in late 2019, have already been sold. Auriens has converted the former showroom of Bellville Sassoon, the couture label that dressed Diana Princess of Wales, near Sloane Square, into a mock apartment complete with circadian rhythm lighting and carefully positioned Fortnum &amp; Mason groceries. It is about as far removed from as one can imagine from Thamesbrook, the squat three-storey local authority care home that occupied the Dovehouse Street site until Kensington and Chelsea council sold it for development last spring. The council, which had reserves of more than \u00a3270m when the Grenfell fire tragedy happened last summer, said the \u00a370m it made from the sale of Thamesbrook would be used to build 150 new homes for older residents. The council did not answer questions about how many of the new old people homes had been built or how much of the windfall from the Thamesbrook sale had been spent on the project. The council had already committed to build 100 rooms for older people before it sold Thamesbrook, which was closed following an outbreak of Legionnaires disease in 2014. The council said all Thamesbrook residents were rehoused, but did not respond to questions about where they were sent. Many of Thamesbrook residents had been moved there when the council closed another of its care homes, Edenham in the north of the borough. Dent-Coad said Edenham residents were \u201ccruelly decanted\u201d into Thamesbrook only to be shunted on again to care homes miles away when it closed. Dent-Coad said dissenting councillors were unable to stop the development and instead residents \u201cwill get a huge lump of ugly building occupied by the super-rich\u201d. Mulville\u2019s partner in the Auriens, which is being bankrolled by investment bank Investec, is Johnny Sanderson, a wealthy property developer who specialises in luxury homes for the super-rich. Sanderson\u2019s latest scheme for 13 huge multimillion-pound homes overlooking Regent\u2019s Park was rejected by Westminster council who told him to \u201cwake-up\u201d and realise that Londoners don\u2019t need \u201coligarch mansions\u201d. The council said four of the homes Sanderson planned for York Terrace East \u2013 built by Regency architect John Nash \u2013 were \u201calmost nine times bigger than a normal six-bedroom home\u201d. The council\u2019s planning chief, Richard Beddoe, said: \u201cOur cities golden postcodes must not be used for Monopoly board-style investments to cater only for oligarchs and the most wealthy.\u201d",

But for Kevin Rountree it\u2019s just another day at the office. The low-profile accountant, who never gives interviews, runs fantasy figure seller Games Workshop which this week emerged as the sleeper success story of the UK\u2019s bombed-out retail industry, thanks to the enduring success of its tabletop game franchise Warhammer. The Nottingham retailer and model manufacturer was catapulted into the FTSE 250 after pulling off a battle plan that Roboute Guilliman \u2013 the avenging son of the Emperor of Mankind in sci-fi spinoff Warhammer 40,000 \u2013 would be proud of. The shares have risen more than 160% in the past year, giving the company a market value of \u00a3770m, more than breakdown specialist AA \u2013 one of the companies booted outed of the 250 index in the reshuffle \u2013 and the retailers Card Factory and Jacamo owner N Brown. Its current share price of \u00a322.95 compares with \u00a35 two years ago. \u201cGames Workshop fans act very much like those of Lego, as almost a cult following,\u201d says GlobalRetail analyst Zoe Mills. \u201cIt is not cheap however, with great craftsmanship in its range, this is a hobby consumers are willing to invest in. It appeals to an older demographic than Lego, with detailed painting involved in the process. This is not for young children.\u201d Games Workshop shuns the press but on its website 47-year-old Rountree, who has been with the company for 20 years, sets out a simple stall: \u201cWe make the best fantasy miniatures in the world and sell them globally at a profit and we intend to do this forever.\u201d Although it has more than 460 stores around the world, Games Workshop insists it is a manufacturer first with its factory in Lenton, Nottingham, producing more than 30m toy solders a year. One of its financial strengths is ownership of the Warhammer franchise and it defends this intellectual property vigorously. The Lenton complex is also home to Warhammer World, an events centre that pulls in visitors from all over the world. Rather than just being places to buy model kits or pick up the latest copy of White Dwarf magazine, Games Workshop views its stores as recruiting grounds for people it describes as having \u201cour particular hobby gene\u201d. Someone with that trait is Dimitri, who has just bought a \u00a395 kit to build an imperial knight. With more than 220 parts to glue together, the model will take hours of work to complete but the prison officer is no stranger to the task as he owns a shed filled with thousands of miniatures. Players collect forces of miniature plastic models, all with different stats and abilities, and use them to play out clashes on a tabletop battlefield. \u201cIt\u2019s very strategic,\u201d says Dimitri of Warhammer \u201c40K\u201d, which is his game of choice. \u201cIt\u2019s 10-fold more complicated than chess.\u201d He adds: \u201cI got into gaming as a kid but as an adult I enjoy reading the lore. If you think of Lord of the Rings and the universe created by three books imagine what you can do with 50.\u201d In January Games Workshop announced record sales and profits for the first six months of a financial year that runs until the end of May. Sales were up more than 50% at \u00a3108.9m while profits more than doubled to \u00a338.8m as its UK manufacturing base protected it from currency depreciation. Most of the growth is coming from outside the UK with international sales accounting for nearly 70% of turnover thanks to expansion into markets like Asia. Games Workshop was founded more than 40 years ago by three school friends: John Peake, Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. The gaming fanatics shared a flat in west London where they started out selling handmade, classic wooden games before going on to open stores. Following a management buyout in the 90s the company listed on the stock exchange in 1994. Games Workshop is better run now than in previous years, says Dimitri who spends \u00a3100 a month in its stores. \u201cBefore you could spend \u00a3200 and have an army but then it would stagnate for two years. Now there are new releases all the time and they have tapped into the love of lore.\u201d In the Warhammer shop on Tottenham Court Road, shoppers are greeted by a dramatic snowy battle scene featuring two model armies, dragons and all, advancing on either side of an imposing fortress. A display cabinet in the corner groups figurines by army with the shelves labelled destruction, chaos and death. Other shelves are replete with battlefield scenery props with esoteric names like ferratonic incinerator and promethium relay pipes. Although the central London store has several employees, more than 360 of them have just one person to do everything. The company monitors the success of its shops carefully and if those with several staff dip into the red they are replaced with one man stores. The shops have playtables where staff give lessons on strategy and painting techniques like shading so enthusiasts can create give their models the perfect finish. Staff are expected to be immersed in games lore as customers quiz them about the nuances of orcs, ogres and obliterators. In a world where so much free time is spent online, tabletop gaming is refreshingly analogue although the company encourages fans to share pictures of their finished figures on Facebook and Instagram. Games are played between people in the same room in venues ranging from schools to the former Olympic stadium in Stratford, where in May hundreds will gather for a Warhammer 40,000 convention. \u201cIf someone said I was sad for playing with toys I\u2019d say \u2018what do you do\u2019?\u201d says Dimitri, who now in his early 30s has dedicated two decades to marshalling his fantastical troops. \u201cGo down the pub?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2018. An earlier version misspelled Roboute Guilliman as Raboute Gulliman and included a reference to Warhammer 10K where 40K was meant.",

With more than 220 parts to glue together, the model will take hours of work to complete but the prison officer is no stranger to the task as he owns a shed filled with thousands of miniatures.</p> <p>Players collect forces of miniature plastic models, all with different stats and abilities, and use them to play out clashes on a tabletop battlefield. \u201cIt\u2019s very strategic,\u201d says Dimitri of Warhammer \u201c40K\u201d, which is his game of choice. \u201cIt\u2019s 10-fold more complicated than chess.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cI got into gaming as a kid but as an adult I enjoy reading the lore. If you think of Lord of the Rings and the universe created by three books imagine what you can do with 50.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January Games Workshop announced record sales and profits for the first six months of a financial year that runs until the end of May. Sales were up more than 50% at \u00a3108.9m while profits more than doubled to \u00a338.8m as its UK manufacturing base protected it from currency depreciation. Most of the growth is coming from outside the UK with international sales accounting for nearly 70% of turnover thanks to expansion into markets like Asia.</p> <p>Games Workshop was founded more than 40 years ago by three school friends: John Peake, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/06/lara-croft-free-school-gaming-magnate-ian-livingstone\">Ian Livingstone </a>and Steve Jackson. The gaming fanatics shared a flat in west London where they started out selling handmade, classic wooden games before going on to open stores. Following a management buyout in the 90s the company listed on the stock exchange in 1994.</p> <p>Games Workshop is better run now than in previous years, says Dimitri who spends \u00a3100 a month in its stores. \u201cBefore you could spend \u00a3200 and have an army but then it would stagnate for two years. Now there are new releases all the time and they have tapped into the love of lore.\u201d</p> <p>In the Warhammer shop on Tottenham Court Road, shoppers are greeted by a dramatic snowy battle scene featuring two model armies, dragons and all, advancing on either side of an imposing fortress. A display cabinet in the corner groups figurines by army with the shelves labelled destruction, chaos and death. Other shelves are replete with battlefield scenery props with esoteric names like ferratonic incinerator and promethium relay pipes.</p> <p>Although the central London store has several employees, more than 360 of them have just one person to do everything. The company monitors the success of its shops carefully and if those with several staff dip into the red they are replaced with one man stores.</p> <p>The shops have playtables where staff give lessons on strategy and painting techniques like shading so enthusiasts can create give their models the perfect finish. Staff are expected to be immersed in games lore as customers quiz them about the nuances of orcs, ogres and obliterators.</p> <p>In a world where so much free time is spent online, tabletop gaming is refreshingly analogue although the company encourages fans to share pictures of their finished figures on Facebook and Instagram. Games are played between people in the same room in venues ranging from schools to the former Olympic stadium in Stratford, where in May hundreds will gather for a Warhammer 40,000 convention. </p> <p>\u201cIf someone said I was sad for playing with toys I\u2019d say \u2018what do you do\u2019?\u201d says Dimitri, who now in his early 30s has dedicated two decades to marshalling his fantastical troops. \u201cGo down the pub?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2018. An earlier version misspelled Roboute Guilliman as Raboute Gulliman and included a reference to Warhammer 10K where 40K was meant.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Europe has warned Donald Trump to expect retaliatory strikes against American icons like Harley-Davidson, Levi\u2019s jeans and Kentucky bourbon, if he sparks a trade war by going ahead with punitive US tariffs on foreign steel. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned there would be consequences for the US if Trump\u2019s threat of a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports takes effect. \u201cIf the Americans impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, then we must treat American products the same way,\u201d Juncker told German television stations. \u201cWe must show that we can also take measures. This cannot be a unilateral transatlantic action by the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we have to shoot back, but we must take action. \u201cWe will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans \u2013 Levi\u2019s,\u201d he added. His warning came as the International Monetary Fund said that Donald Trump\u2019s plan would cause international damage \u2013 and also harm America\u2019s own economy. \u201cThe import restrictions announced by the US President are likely to cause damage not only outside the US, but also to the US economy itself, including to its manufacturing and construction sectors, which are major users of aluminium and steel,\u201d the IMF said. Other world leaders also threatened retaliation. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said US tariffs would be \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d and China too expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over the plans. Japan\u2019s steel industry also urged Trump not to impose steep tariffs on imports, warning it would have \u201cserious harmful effects\u201d on trade worldwide. Meanwhile, the US president breezily asserted that \u201ctrade wars are good\u201d. In a morning tweet Trump wrote: \u201cWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don\u2019t trade anymore-we win big. It\u2019s easy!\u201d Trump\u2019s announcement sent stock markets around the world tumbling and could prompt other countries to take action. \u201cThe Chinese side expresses grave concern,\u201d the ministry of commerce said. The statement did not mention any retaliatory steps but encouraged Washington to solve disputes through negotiation. Chinese officials have previously said they would take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to defend national interests. \u201cThe imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,\u201d said the Australian trade minister, Steven Ciobo. \u201cMy concern remains that on the back of actions like this we could see retaliatory measures that are put in place by other major economies. That is in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d The news met with mixed reaction in the US too. The Business Roundtable, one of Washington\u2019s most powerful lobby groups, said it \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the decision \u201cbecause it will hurt the US economy and American companies, workers and consumers by raising prices and resulting in foreign retaliation against US exporters\u201d. But Robert Scott, senior economist at the left-leaning Economics Policy Institute said tariffs were \u201clong overdue\u201d. \u201cTrump promised quick action after announcing investigations of the national security threats imposed by steel and aluminum imports nearly a year ago. Delays worsened the import crisis for thousands of US steel and aluminum workers, many of whom are facing layoffs and plant closing announcements,\u201d he said. Trump frequently singled out China for criticism during his election campaign, saying the trade relationship was \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world\u201d and comparing it to \u201crape\u201d. He also pledged to protect the US steel industry but this is the first major step in fulfilling those promises. Canada has the largest share of steel imports to the US at 16%, according to data from the Department of Commerce. That is followed by Brazil and South Korea, with steel imports from China down 5% in the most recent period.",
