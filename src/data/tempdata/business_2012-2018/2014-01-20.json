    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial crises come round every seven years on average. There was the stock market crash of 1987, the emerging market meltdown in the mid-1990s, the popping of the dotcom bubble in 2001 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. If history is any guide, the next crisis should be coming along some time soon. The fact that the financial markets are betting on global recovery becoming more firmly established over the next two years doesn't really signify much. Investors refused to heed warnings that tech stocks were wildly over-valued around the turn of the millennium. Ben Bernanke rubbished the idea that the US sub-prime mortgage market was an accident waiting to happen, and refused to countenance the idea that a problem in American real estate might have global ramifications. So let's conduct a thought experiment. Assume that the IMF, the World Bank and the financial markets are all wrong when they say the US is now set for a period of robust growth, that Europe is on the mend and that China can make the transition to a less centrally planned economy without a hard landing. There are reasons (cash-rich companies, more than half a decade of ultra-stimulative economic policies, the plentiful supply of new scientific breakthroughs) for thinking that the consensus is right, and that the outlook for several years is of steady, sustained growth. But imagine for a moment that the consensus is wrong and that the global economy remains subject to the familiar seven-year rhythm. In those circumstances, three questions need to be asked. The first is where the crisis is likely to originate, and here the smart money is on the emerging markets. China's economic data is not always 100% reliable, but it is clear the curbs on credit are having an impact. The world's second biggest economy is slowing down and probably a bit faster than the official figures would suggest. Other emerging markets \u2013 India, Brazil, Turkey \u2013 if anything look even more vulnerable if markets respond negatively to policy moves in the US. The speed at which the Federal Reserve tapers away its monthly stimulus will depend on conditions in the US, not the rest of the world, and the potential for capital flight from countries with big current account deficits is real. The second question is how policy would respond if a second shock occurred well before the global economy had recovered from the first. Traditionally, central banks and finance ministries use upswings to restock their arsenals. They raise interest rates so that they can be lowered when times get tough, and they reduce budget deficits so that they can support demand through tax cuts or public spending increases. A renewed bout of turbulence would start with interest rates already at historically low levels, budget deficits high and central banks stuffed full of the bonds they have bought in their quantitative easing programmes. Conventional monetary policy is pretty much maxed out, and there seems little appetite for a co-ordinated fiscal expansion, so the choice would be unconventional monetary policy in the form either of more QE or helicopter drops of cash. A Bank of England working paper co-authored by David Miles, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee, suggests that QE can be effective when financial markets are dysfunctional, as they almost certainly would be in the event of a second leg to the most serious crisis in the past 100 years. Miles also predicts, somewhat heroically, that the unwinding of QE will have little or no impact on the real economy because it will occur when markets are no longer dysfunctional. When that blessed day will arrive remains to be seen. The final question, highlighted by yesterday's study of the global jobs market from the International Labour Organisation, is what sort of impact a second recession would have on already stretched social fabrics. Unemployment is rising, insufficient jobs are being created to cope with the demands of a rising world population, and the improvement in working poverty has stalled. All the ingredients are there for social unrest, which is why the ILO's Guy Ryder is right to call on businesses to use rising profits for productive investment rather than share buy-backs.",

      "bodyText": "Accounting regulators have added to the list of investigations into the Co-operative Bank by announcing a formal review of the accounts that were audited by KPMG. The investigation by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is likely to go back as far as 2008 \u2013 subjecting the role of the auditors during the financial crisis to fresh scrutiny, and may also increase pressure on John Griffith-Jones, the former boss of KMPG who is now chairman of the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. The FRC is latest body to launch an inquiry into the bank or its former owner, the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, which now owns just 30% of the bank following last year's \u00a31.5bn rescue fundraising. The other 70% of the bank \u2013 also being investigated by the FCA and the Bank of England \u2013 is owned by bondholders, including US hedge funds, and due to be floated on the stock market this year. The FRC announcement came just minutes after Co-op Group \u2013 which is conducting its own investigations into what went wrong \u2013 announced it would no longer sell off the insurance business originally put on the block in a scramble to raise cash to plug the capital shortfall in the bank. The FRC said it had begun an \"investigation under the Accountancy Scheme into the preparation, approval and audit of the financial statements of The Co-operative Bank plc, up to and including the year ended 31 December 2012\". The potential for an investigation by the FRC was flagged in the risk warnings during the bank's capital raising last year.

    "webTitle": "IMF set to upgrade UK growth forecasts as global economy expands", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund is widely expected to raise its outlook for the UK on Tuesday, pushing up the country's growth forecasts by more than for any other major economy. The Washington-based fund has been a critic of the UK's over-dependence on consumers as well as the government's Help to Buy housing market scheme. But it will bring a welcome boost to chancellor George Osborne when it updates its World Economic Outlook from last October's forecasts. Back then it predicted UK national output would rise 1.9% in 2014 but is now expected to predict growth of 2.4%, according to a Sky News report. The IMF said it did not comment on leaks. The fund is also expected to upgrade its outlook for the global economy, which in October it said would expand by 3.6% this year. That would reflect the cautiously optimistic tone in a New Year's speech from its managing director, Christine Lagarde, last week. \"This crisis still lingers. Yet optimism is in the air: the deep freeze is behind, and the horizon is brighter. My great hope is that 2014 will prove momentous \u2026 the year in which the seven weak years, economically speaking, slide into seven strong years,\" she said. If confirmed, the substantial upgrade to the UK is likely to be seized on by Osborne as further proof the coalition's \"economic plan is working\" \u2013 an oft-used phrase in recent weeks as indicators have largely pointed to growth picking up. The fund has in the past been highly critical of the coalition's austerity drive. In a damning indictment of the British chancellor's economic policies last year, the IMF's chief economist Olivier Blanchard warned Osborne would be \"playing with fire\" unless he eased the pace of budget cuts. The IMF has also echoed other economists, including experts at the UK's own Office for Budget Responsibility, who said that the UK remains over-dependent on debt-fulled household spending to grow. The latest crop of official data underscored those concerns, with weaker outturns for construction and manufacturing and a jump in Christmas retail sales. Economists generally feel, however, that overall growth will pick up this year and the IMF is just the latest of a string of forecasters to raise the UK's outlook. The business group CBI has pencilled in 2014 growth of 2.4%, the British Chambers of Commerce expects 2.7% and the OBR forecasts 2.4%. A report from EY Item Club on Monday forecast UK economic growth would pick up to 2.7% this year from 1.9% in 2013. It too warned the recovery was not built on solid foundations, however, due largely to the pressure on household incomes. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club said: \"It is hard to find another episode in time where employment has been rising and real wages falling for any significant period of time. The weakness of real earnings is proving to be the government's Achilles heel and could prove to be the weak spot in the recovery. \"Consumers have reduced the amount they save to fund their spending sprees. But they cannot continue to drive growth for much longer without an accompanying recovery in real wages or a rise in their debt to income ratio.\" There have also been warnings that the recovery is not being felt throughout the UK, and is instead largely benefiting London and the south-east. A study by the TUC trade unions group on Monday said the recent recovery in jobs had failed to reach the north-east, the north-west, Wales and the south-west, leaving them in the same situation or worse at providing jobs than they were 20 years ago. The overall unemployment rate for the UK has been coming down faster than policymakers and most other forecasters had expected. Official data on Wednesday are expected to give a jobless rate of 7.3% for November, down from 7.4% the previous month. Many economists expect the continuing drop in unemployment will prompt the Bank of England to tweak its forward guidance. At the moment, the BoE's guidance is that, barring various exceptions, it will not consider raising interest rates from their current 0.5% until a threshold of 7% unemployment is reached. The Bank may well lower that threshold for considering a hike to 6.5% unemployment, economists say.",

For Wolfers, it is a coincidence that what earns him the most money, economics, is also what he most enjoys doing. Such reasoning crystallises opposing views of the world, one in which time is a cost, and the other in which it is a benefit. The first sees time spent on enjoyment as a missed opportunity; the second as part of the good life. We should be clear about what is at stake in the choice between the two.

      "bodyText": "With no guidance from Wall Street - closed for Martin Luther King day - European markets were left to their own devices, and a flat GDP performance from China and a profit warning from Deutsche Bank put investors on the back foot. Overall it was a mixed performance, with the German market putting in one of the worst performances, inevitably, after the Deutsche Bank news. Here are the final standings: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 7.43 points or 0.11% higher at 6836.73 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.28% at 9715.90 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.11% lower at 4322.86 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB edged up 0.02% to 19,973.45 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended down 0.11% at 10,454.1 On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow. There may be signs of recovery in the global economy, but unemployment is set to continue rising and will stay at high levels for some time, with young people the hardest hit. This is the depressing conclusion of a report from the International Labour Organisation, released ahead of the Davos gathering this week. My colleague Katie Allen writes: As the World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss town of Davos on Wednesday with a focus on rising inequality, the ILO has highlighted a \"potentially dangerous gap between profits and people\". The UN agency forecasts millions more people will join the ranks of the unemployed as companies choose to increase payouts to shareholders rather than invest their burgeoning profits in new workers. The ILO's Global Employment Trends report forecasts that world unemployment will rise to 6.1% this year from 6% in 2013 and will remain well above its pre-crisis rate of 5.5% for several years. It puts the youth unemployment rate at 13.1%, more than double that for the whole workforce and almost three times the adult rate of 4.6% \u2013 putting the ratio of youth to adult unemployment at an all-time record. Katie's full story is here: ILO warns young hit hardest as global unemployment continues to rise On Ireland's bond rally, following Moody's upgrade last Friday, Jamie McGeever of Reuters tweets: More positive signs for the eurozone: In corporate news, the hedge fund which is the biggest private investor in Royal Mail has trimmed its stake in the business again. The Children's Investment Fund has cut its stake from 5.04% to 4.58%. It proved controversial back in October when it was revealed the fund had taken a 5.8% shareholding, making it the biggest investor in the privatised business behind the UK government. Here's a flavour of our story at the time: A hedge fund known for its aggressive investment strategy has become the largest private shareholder in Royal Mail, re-igniting anger over Vince Cable's controversial privatisation of the postal service. The Children's Investment Fund owns a 5.8% stake in the 500-year-old postal service, making it the largest shareholder behind the government, which has a 38% stake. TCI is controlled by publicity-shy Chris Hohn, who pressed for the sale of ABN Amro, which ended in the Dutch bank's disastrous takeover by the Royal Bank of Scotland, and has been dubbed a \"locust\" in Germany for its investment style. Royal Mail shares have dipped 5p to 599.5p on today's news. Still a tidy premium on the 330p sale price, of course. Speaking of Greece, the Kathimerini newspaper flagged up yesterday that more households and companies are falling behind with their electricity bills as wage cuts and record unemployment bites. Public Power Corporation (PPC) data illustrate that Greek households and corporations are finding it increasingly difficult to pay their electricity bills. Total debts to the power utility from unpaid bills currently total some 1.3 billion euros, an amount which is growing at an average rate of 4 million euros per day. The lion\u2019s share of that debt is owed by low- and medium-voltage consumers \u2013 households and very small enterprises. The total arrears of these categories amount to an estimated 600 million euros, of which some 65 percent concerns households. The debts of the broader public sector amount to 190 million euros. The arrears of corporations connected to the medium-voltage network total some 130 million euros, while mining company Larco alone has run up debts of more than 135 million euros. Around 35,000 households are thought to have illegally reconnected their power supply after being cut off, according to official figures. The Athens government recently agreed to keep supplying power to the poorest households, so around 7,500 have been officially reconnected. And on that note, I'm getting ready to go to Davos so I'll leave you in the hands of my colleague Nick Fletcher. Over in Athens, protests took place this morning against layoffs across the Greek public sector, and also against cuts to healthcare spending. Here's a few photos. Speculation is rife that the International Monetary Fund will hike its estimate for UK growth when it publishes its new forecasts on Tuesday. Sky News is reporting that the IMF will predict that the British economy expands by 2.4% this year, up from the 1.9% rate predicted three months ago. That would match last month's forecast from Britain's fiscal watchdog, the OBR. My colleague Katie Allen reports: The IMF is also expected to upgrade its outlook for the global economy, which in October it predicted as expanding by 3.6% this year. That would reflect the cautiously optimistic tone in a New Year's speech from its managing director, Christine Lagarde, last week. \"This crisis still lingers. Yet, optimism is in the air: the deep freeze is behind, and the horizon is brighter. My great hope is that 2014 will prove momentous ... the year in which the seven weak years, economically speaking, slide into seven strong years,\" she said. If confirmed, the substantial upgrade to the UK will be a welcome boost to chancellor George Osborne and his much repeated assertion that the coalition's \"economic plan is working\". But in the past the IMF has echoed other economists, including experts at the UK's own Office for Budget Responsibility, that the UK remains over-dependent on consumer spending to grow. More here: IMF upgrades UK economic growth as forecasts for global economy expands Back on China, and Saxo Bank has provided a handy graph showing how its growth rate has slowed as Beijing wound in its stimulus spending. As explained in the opening post, China's GDP rose by 7.7% annually in the last three months of 2013, a slight slowdown on the 7.8% recorded in the third quarter of the year. Mads Koefoed, head of macro strategy at Saxo Bank, warns that a 'prolonged slowdown' would be a problem for Beijing, but also reckons that the slow pace of the government's rebalancing means growth shouldn't falter. Koefoed said: Should the slowdown in the economy continue over the coming quarters, the (relatively) new leadership will be tested, but the GDP report actually revealed that some of the necessary adjustments needed in the Chinese economy are starting to take place, albeit only very gradually. The credit-fuelled investment binge in China continues, but did slow down slightly in the fourth quarter to 20.3 percent year-on-year from 20.5 percent in Q3 and even more in the first half of 2013. The very modest slowdown in investment and credit \u2014 new yuan loans rose 8.% in 2013 vs. 11.9% in 2012 \u2014 is not enough to either quickly rebalance the economy or send growth substantially lower. Furthermore, some smallish public-sector stimulus programmes will aid economic growth in the shorter term, which is why I only expect a slight slowdown overall this year to somewhere in the range of 7 to 7.5% from 7.7% in 2013. Development charity Oxfam has raised the pressure on world leaders as they prepare for Davos this week by reporting that the richest 85 people now control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world population. Staggeringly, that means you could cram \u00a31tn of wealth into a single double-decker bus -- a reminder of how concentrated income and assets have become. Winnie Byanyima, the Oxfam executive director who will attend the Davos meetings, said: \"It is staggering that in the 21st Century, half of the world's population \u2013 that's three and a half billion people \u2013 own no more than a tiny elite whose numbers could all fit comfortably on a double-decker bus.\" Oxfam's report also flags up that almost 50% of the world's wealth is now owned by the richest 1%. Here's the full story: Oxfam: 85 richest people as wealthy as poorest half of the world More twists and turns at the Co-op over its troubled banking arm this morning. Its auditors, KPMG, is to be investigated over its performance in checking and approving its accounts by the Financial Reporting Council. KPMG has audited Co-op's financial arm for three decades, but is under scrutiny after the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn black hole in its accounts which sunk its bid to take over 600 Lloyds branches. Co-op Group has also decided not to sell its general insurance business, which had been on the auction block to raise funds to patch up that capital hole. Co-op is now keeping it, as the revised capital-raising plan (under which it loses majority control of its Bank) requires it to contribute less funding. David Madden, market analyst at IG, says the Chinese GDP data has left the City a little flummoxed: Mixed reports from China overnight have left traders perplexed; the headline GDP figures exceeded expectations, but this was offset by the lower-than-expected industrial production and fixed asset investment numbers. The mining sector had a good run last week on the back of bargain hunting and broker upgrades, and after the Chinese numbers today it doesn\u2019t know which way to turn . Back in the UK, the group treasurer and head of tax at supermarket chain Morrisons is under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority over allegations relating to the trading of Ocado shares before the two firms announced a tie-up. Paul Coyle was arrested in December in Harrogate, Yorkshire, and was taken in for questioning in connection with alleged insider dealing and market abuse. Here's my colleague Sean Farrell's take: Morrisons' executive arrested in insider trading investigation And a hat-tip to the Daily Telegraph's Graham Ruddick for breaking the story overnight: Telegraph: Morrisons treasurer held over alleged Ocado 'insider deal' (paywalled) Encouraging economic news out of Italy this morning -- seasonally adjusted industrial orders rose by 2.3% month-on-month in November, reversing October's 2.3% slide. Domestic orders jumped 4.1%, compared to a 0.4% drop in foreign business, suggesting internal demand picked up as the long Italian recession eased. European stock markets dipped this morning as investors took stock of China's GDP data, showing growth came in at the joint-slowest rate in 14 years. Mining stocks are down, following those predictions that growth could be slower this year. Copper producer Antofagasta has dropped 1.5%, while Rio Tinto has shed 0.75%. Germany's DAX is the worst performer, dragged down by Deutsche Bank's profit warning last night. Earlier, the Shanghai composite index of leading Chinese shares had closed below the 2,000 mark for the first time since last July -- continuing a recent trend, as this graph shows. Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart &amp; Co, said the markets remain concerned by the consequences of the clampdown on China's shadow banking sector, adding: It is not surprising that share prices on the mainland remain generally depressed and those in Hong Kong subdued. Here's the European prices: German DAX: down 40 points at 9701, -0.4% FTSE 100: down 5 points at 6824, - 0.06% French CAC: down 5 points at 4321, -0.13% Italian FTSE MIB: down 43 points at 19,924, -0.24% Spanish IBEX: down 22 points at 10,442, -0.2% Irish five-year debt is also rallying after Moody's raised Ireland's credit rating back to investment grade. That has pushed the yield on five-year bonds down below 1.62% -- meaning Dublin can borrow money until 2019 at a slightly cheaper rate than Washington (US five-year Treasury bills are yielding just over 1.62%). No surprise that Deutsche Bank shares have tumbled in the opening moments of trading in Frankfurt, dropping over 4% after last night's profit warning (details here). Other bank shares are suffering too, following fears that Deutsche's shock announcement heralds wider problems in the sector. In London, Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 1.2%, and Barclays down almost 1%. Much of DB's \u20ac1.2bn loss was blamed on legal woes and restructuring, but the bank also reported a drop in revenues from bond trading by its fixed income arm. That dragged it down to a net loss of \u20ac965m in the final quarter of 2013, compared to forecasts of a \u20ac700m net profit. Traders say Deutche's announcement has cast a pall over the City, especially as this month's corporate results have been rather unimpressive: As Michael Hewson of CMC Market explains: European markets appeared to stall towards the end of last week, as more and more earnings announcements started to come out on the weaker side of estimates. The early release of Deutsche Bank\u2019s earnings late last night, which showed a \u20ac1.2bn Q4 loss, could well reinforce this negative tone today, particularly in the absence of US markets today, due to Martin Luther King Day. Ireland's sovereign debt has jumped in value this morning, after Moody's removed the stigma of a 'Junk' credit rating. An early morning rally has send the yield, or interest rate, on Irish 10-year bonds sliding to just over 3.3%. That's sharply down on Friday night's reading of 3.45%, before Moody's announced its move. For comparison, UK 10-year bonds are yielding 2.82% this morning, while Spain's are changing hands for 3.7% (a lower yield = a higher priced bond, ie a more safer investment) Over in Japan, Nintendo's share price took a kicking as Tokyo investors gave their verdict on last Friday's profit warning. The stock didn't even trade when the Tokyo bourse opened, as traders flooded the market with sell orders. Eventually some buyers emerged, sending Nintendo's share price plunging by almost a fifth. It later clawed back some losses, ending the day down 6%. On Friday, Nintendo admitted it would probably make an operating loss of 35 billion yen, and slashed its global sales forecasts for the Wii U console this year, from 9m to just 2.8m. Let's not be too gloomy, though. Louis Kuijs, chief China economist at RBS, reckons the Chinese economy will spring back in 2014 with a growth rate of 8.2%. Kuijs told clients: \"We expect China to benefit from improved global growth this year. Faster world trade growth should support China's growth via stronger exports and corporate investment.\" (that's via CNBC) Several economists are warning that China's growth rate will slow further in 2014, from the 7.7% expansion racked up in 2013. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt pointed to the detail of today's GDP data: Investment growth is slowing, to +19.6% YoY in December, while industrial output growth also moderated to +9.7% YoY as overseas demand cooled. Retail sales grew by +13.6% YoY. A rebalancing economy and a neutral policy stance point to the deceleration continuing through 2014. Nomura economists agreed, warning: The data reinforce our view that growth is on a downtrend and we continue to expect GDP growth to slow [this year]. Ditto Dariusz Kowalczyk of Credit Agricole CIB, who said: The economy is slowing quite rapidly. The slowdown has accelerated during the quarter,\" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. China has kicked off the week by reporting growth figures that beat forecasts, but also showed the joint-weakest expansion rate since 1999. Gross domestic product across the Chinese economy increased by 7.7% year-on-year in the final three months of 2013, slightly down on the 7.8% growth seen in the third quarter. Growth for 2013 as a whole was also recorded at 7.7% --matching 2012's annual growth reading. The data confirms that China's economic boom has cooled somewhat as Beijing strive to implement economic reforms, rein back the shadow banking sector, and nurture more domestic demand to replace the investment-driven growth of the last decade. Chinese officials warned that the task of rebalancing the country's economy wasn't over. Commissioner of the government statistics bureau, Ma Jiantang, told reporters that: \"A long-term accumulation of problems has yet to ease and the foundation for economic stabilisation and recovery is still consolidating.\" Here's AP's early take: China's economy grows by 7.7%, equalling worst year since 1999 Industrial production growth over the last year also dipped, to 9.7% from 10% previously. At 7.7%, annual growth did beat the Chinese government's official target of 7.5%. But there was no rally in the Shanghai stock market, where shares dropped to their lowest level since last July Economists cautioned that the data showed the Chinese economy was cooling, and unlikely to post stronger growth in 2014 (I'll pull together some reaction next). Also coming up today, Deutsche Bank is under scrutiny after rushing out a profit warning last night. The German bank made a shock pre-tax loss of \u20ac1.153bn, which it blamed on legal expenses and restructuring costs. And I'll have an eye on the snowy heights of Davos as world leaders prepare to jet in for the World Economic Forum (which starts officially on Wednesday).",

      "body": "<p>The casual fashion chain Fat Face is set for a stock market flotation in the first half of this year after appointing two advisers.</p> <p>The retailer, which is chaired by former Marks &amp; Spencer boss Stuart Rose, has hired Citi and Jefferies to sound out potential investors as it seeks a London listing, with March the earliest likely date.</p> <p>Lazard, the investment bank, has been advising Fat Face on its flotation hopes since early last month. The retailer has decided to move ahead after enjoying a steady Christmas. Sales rose 5% in the five weeks to 4 January after a 15% rise to \u00a399m in the six months to 30 November. Underlying earnings rose 57% to \u00a319.6m as online sales rose 55%, six new stores were opened and the company cut its debts by \u00a319.7m to \u00a3111.5m.</p> <p>Founded by \"ski bums\" Jules Leaver and Tim Slade, who began selling printed T-shirts out of their rucksacks in the French Alps in 1988, Fat Face opened its first store, in Fulham, south-west London, in 1992. The founders sold up in 2005 to private equity firm Advent International, which sold the company on to another private equity group, Bridgepoint, at the peak of the buyout market in 2007 for \u00a3360m.

      "bodyText": "The casual fashion chain Fat Face is set for a stock market flotation in the first half of this year after appointing two advisers. The retailer, which is chaired by former Marks &amp; Spencer boss Stuart Rose, has hired Citi and Jefferies to sound out potential investors as it seeks a London listing, with March the earliest likely date. Lazard, the investment bank, has been advising Fat Face on its flotation hopes since early last month. The retailer has decided to move ahead after enjoying a steady Christmas. Sales rose 5% in the five weeks to 4 January after a 15% rise to \u00a399m in the six months to 30 November. Underlying earnings rose 57% to \u00a319.6m as online sales rose 55%, six new stores were opened and the company cut its debts by \u00a319.7m to \u00a3111.5m. Founded by \"ski bums\" Jules Leaver and Tim Slade, who began selling printed T-shirts out of their rucksacks in the French Alps in 1988, Fat Face opened its first store, in Fulham, south-west London, in 1992. The founders sold up in 2005 to private equity firm Advent International, which sold the company on to another private equity group, Bridgepoint, at the peak of the buyout market in 2007 for \u00a3360m. The business had a difficult few years as the credit crunch hit, with Bridgepoint forced to inject more money to keep it going, but has seen a revival since hiring former M&amp;S retail director and George at Asda boss Anthony Thompson in 2010. This month, Thompson, the chief executive, said: \"The further expansion of our UK store portfolio and the rapid development of our multi-channel offer has led to another half-year of double-digit sales and profit growth.\" His plans include the launch of three stores and a dedicated US website within the next 18 months. Although the company made underlying profits of \u00a331.2m in the year to June and is on track to make close to \u00a340m this year, one analyst, who declined to be named, suggested that Bridgepoint might struggle to float Fat Face at a premium to the price it paid six years ago. The analyst said: \"There is a good management team and the brand still has growth to come in the UK, which investors love, but the question is, do people get the brand proposition?\" John Stevenson, an analyst at KBC Peel Hunt, said that after the rounds of private equity ownership Fat Face might have a way to go to convince investors of its growth potential, particularly in the US, where it was up against a plethora of lifestyle brands. \"There is a raft of companies coming to the market so investors can afford to be a bit more careful,\" he said. A string of retailers are due to try their luck on the London stock market this year as interest in consumer-facing companies rises ahead of a hoped-for economic recovery. Online fashion brand Boohoo.com is thought likely to come to the market in the first quarter after a first attempt in the autumn failed to get off the ground. Appliances Online, Poundland, Pets at Home and Card Factory have also been tipped to join the public markets in the first half of 2014 after appointing advisers, although, unlike Fat Face, none of these stores has released information about their Christmas trading. Department store House of Fraser, which is also considering a listing, released a very upbeat Christmas trading statement, but some analysts believe its flotation hopes could be hit by the trials of fellow department store Debenhams, which issued a profits warning after indulging in heavy discounting over the festive season.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world could face years of jobless economic recovery, with young people set to be hit hardest as global unemployment continues to rise this year, a report from the International Labour Organisation warns. As the World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss town of Davos on Wednesday with a focus on growing inequality, the ILO has highlighted a \"potentially dangerous gap between profits and people\". The UN agency forecasts millions more people will join the ranks of the unemployed as companies choose to increase payouts to shareholders rather than invest their burgeoning profits in new workers. The ILO's Global Employment Trends report forecasts that world unemployment will rise to 6.1% this year from 6% in 2013 and will remain well above its pre-crisis rate of 5.5% for several years. It puts the youth unemployment rate at 13.1%, more than double that for the whole workforce and almost three times the adult rate of 4.6% \u2013 a record for the ratio of youth to adult unemployment. Guy Ryder, the ILO's director-general also highlighted rising inequality as wages fail to pick up, long-term unemployment problems intensify and progress stalls on cutting working poverty. \"Corporate profits are up and global equity markets are looking forward to another year of plenty, while at the same time unemployment and household incomes stand still,\" he said. \"The modest economic recovery has not translated into an improvement in the labour market in most countries. Businesses have been sitting on cash or buying back their own stocks, rather than investing in productive capacity and job creation.\" His comments follow a report by Oxfam that the world's richest 85 people control as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population put together. Released on the eve of the Davos meeting of political and business big-hitters, the charity's report found the world's richest 85 share a combined wealth of \u00a31tn, as much as the poorest 3.5 billion. Ryder warned of the economic and social consequences of rising inequality, with labour market problems expected to worsen this year. \"If we fail to act, if we fail to tackle the youth jobs crisis, long-term unemployment, high drop-out rates and other pressing labour market issues, we will be destroying hopes for sustainable growth \u2013 and sowing the seeds of further, and perhaps deeper social unrest,\" he said. The ILO said 5 million more people became unemployed last year, taking the global total to 202 million. That is forecast to rise to 215 million jobseekers by 2018 as employment growth, at 40 million net new jobs a year, fails to keep pace with the 42.6 million people expected to enter the labour market every year. Young people will continue to be particularly affected by what the ILO describes as a \"weak and uneven recovery\". The proportion of young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) continues to rise. Some of the worst rates are in those countries hit by the eurozone crisis. In Spain and Ireland more than one in five young people are NEETs. The ILO also painted a gloomy outlook for the long-term unemployed. \"The average length of spells of unemployment has increased considerably, a further sign of feeble job creation,\" the report said. \"In many advanced economies, the duration of unemployment has doubled in comparison with the pre-crisis situation.\" The average duration of unemployment has hit nine months in Greece and eight months in Spain. The findings on so-called working poverty are mixed. The ILO said the number of working poor continues to decline globally, albeit at a slower rate than in previous decades. In 2013, an estimated 375 million workers \u2013 or 11.9% of the world's workforce\u2013 lived on less than $1.25 (76p) a day, while 839 million \u2013 26.7% \u2013 had to cope with $2 a day or less. That compares with much higher numbers in the early 2000s, of 600 million and more than 1.1 billion, respectively. The ILO said emerging economies would continue to enjoy the lowest combined unemployment rate this year. It forecasts a jobless rate of 5.1% for the emerging economy members of the G20 group of nations, compared with 8.4% for the advanced economy members. But it notes that growth in emerging markets has slowed markedly in the past two years. That was underscored by official data from China showing the joint-weakest growth rate since 1999. GDP was up by 7.7% in the final three months of 2013, slightly down on the 7.8% growth seen in the third quarter. In the previous decade, China grew at 10.5% annually, but growth in 2012 and 2013 was 7.7%. The ILO said China's rapid growth had been reflected in a stark change in its workforce, as agricultural workers moved to take jobs in the fast expanding manufacturing sector. The share of the workforce employed in agriculture nearly halved, from around 70% at the beginning of the 1980s to 35% more recently. But now China needs to press ahead with moves to improve productivity, as the supply of workers will not grow boundlessly, the ILO warned. \"The absolute number of people aged 15\u201364 in China is expected to decline in the years to come. As a consequence, China's potential pool of workers for the manufacturing sector is not growing any more,\" the report said.",

      "body": "<p>When it comes to finding women leaders in business, Canaan Partners are making it look like a piece of cake. Currently, 30% of the firm\u2019s portfolio is female-led, one of the most accurate depictions of the US business world where <a href=\"http://www.womenable.com/userfiles/downloads/2013_State_of_Women-Owned_Businesses_Report_FINAL.pdf\">about 29% of businesses are owned by women</a>.</p> <p>Even as the number of women-led businesses is on the rise, female entrepreneurs still struggle to gain access to venture capital. According to <a href=\"http://blog.pitchbook.com/women-taking-a-growing-share-of-venture-capital/\">recent research by PitchBook</a>, companies led by women represented just 13% of VC deals in the first six months of 2013 \u2013 that's a record high. In 2009, the number of venture deals going to women was 6%.</p> <p>Some of Canaan\u2019s success with female leaders can be attributed to <a href=\"http://www.canaan.com/team/partner/maha-ibrahim\">Maha Ibrahim</a>, one of the firm's general partners who has been with the company for the past 13 years. Ibrahim is known for her investments in cloud and digital media companies, as well as social games startups such as PicksPal and Kabam. Ibrahim currently sits on the boards of five companies, three of which \u2013&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.cuyana.com/\">Cuyana</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kabam.com/\">Kabam</a>&#xa0;and <a href=\"http://www.therealreal.com/\">The RealReal</a>&#xa0;\u2013 have been found by women.</p> <p>We caught up with Ibrahim to pick her brain about what VCs look for when investing, the relationship between investors and founders and why keeping your business idea under wraps might be the biggest mistake you can make.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>What do you consider when choosing a company to invest in? Is there a leadership component that you are look for?</strong></p> <p>The first characteristic of a company we look for is one with a big market. It's a company that might not be in a big market today, but one where we feel like the market is going to emerge in the next couple of years and allow the company to really grow into something substantial. That's first.</p> <p>When it comes to leadership, we are looking for people who are driven, passionate, committed, highly intelligent and, at the same time, highly nimble, because most of these companies end up moving some number of degrees within the first year or two, and we want to make sure we have people who understand that how companies start out is not how they end, and [who] can move with the company.</p> <p><strong>You work with a number of female founders. Would you say there is a difference in their leadership?</strong></p> <p>I can't say that there is a difference in terms of the approach, because every person, whether they are a man or a woman, has a different leadership style. I have one female CEO who is very direct and driven and represents the customer and a supplier. At the same time, I have another female CEO who is focused on high level strategy and tends to orient the company [with] high-level vision as opposed to getting really deep down into the weeds. I can't ascribe characteristics to a particular gender.</p> <p><strong>Do you think that leadership is pigeonholed when it comes to gender?</strong></p> <p>Oh, totally. We are all very individual and how I influence and persuade, how I do that as a VC might be very different from another female VC down the street. It's very individual.</p> <p><strong>What would your advice be then to an aspiring female entrepreneur? Would it be to just follow their own leadership style?&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>What's most important as a leader is that they are effective \u2013 communicating effectively, effective in getting people to follow their own vision. And however someone chooses to communicate that in a way that makes them effective is what works for them.</p> <p>That said, in startups in particular, the dogmatic, autocratic leadership style happens not to work, because they tend to be much more collaborative. Also, as I mentioned before, you have to be nimble and you have to take input from outside. You have to be driven and have conviction. But at the same time, your effectiveness can come from being open-minded.</p> <p><strong>How important is networking in your job? In finding companies to invest in and vice versa \u2013 for companies looking for investors?</strong></p> <p>Interpersonal skills in my job as a venture capitalist are so, so important. It's vital that I connect with people and leave the impression that I'm not only interested in what they're doing but am kind of captivated by it. It's vital that I'm not insulting people, while at the same time being critical.</p> <p>Networking is kind of everything in terms of getting my name out there and making sure that I know as many people as I can in the specific sector [in which]&#xa0;I'm interested in investing. But at the same time, it's important that they come away from any conversation with me feeling like I engaged with them, that I am listening to them, that I am not dictating to them.</p> <p><strong>Often we hear these stories about tension between VCs and founders of various companies. What is the true relationship between the VCs and their companies? </strong></p> <p>My job is to make sure that the companies that we have invested in have the best shot of becoming significant enterprises. And in so doing, I have to trust the management team I've hired, or the management team of the company's founders, [and that they] have what it takes to get from here to there. A big part of that is the realization that, in terms of nuts and bolts of the business, they see it in much greater detail and specificity than I do. So I can provide high level guidance, but my first inclination almost always is to trust what they say because they've seen it. I'm involved, engaged, helping and making introductions. But they are living it.</p> <p>For instance, my company <a href=\"https://www.kabam.com/\">Kabam</a>&#xa0;went through many iterations before it became a mobile gaming company. They're now a really significant company. But in so doing, they changed business models three times. They rode the wave of Facebook social gaming, and then dove into mobile game and became one of the biggest players there. Those are big shifts in a business model, and ones I guided and helped, but the big part of actually doing it, I entrust the management team to do that.</p> <p><strong>How important is mentorship to your companies?</strong></p> <p>A critical part of my role is to help surround my companies with the best people possible. Whether that [means] employees, board members, advisors, whatever. And really no company can be built in a vacuum. It really does take the input of a lot of people to shape, promote and substantialize a company. A kind of friends-and-family network of companies is crucial.</p> <p>That's why I really don't like the concept of stealth, right? A lot of companies, several years ago, were incredibly stealthy and they would never tell you what they were doing, because they believed somebody was going to come and steal the idea. I am not a huge fan of that, I think it's very important that companies get as much feedback from the outside as possible. Not to make them change direction, but to help them shape a direction in a more refined way.</p> <p><strong>What do you think is one of the biggest mistakes that some entrepreneurs make?</strong></p> <p>Exactly that. It's just keeping quiet for too long. And I'll tell you, I think I have said this before. When we fail as VCs and entrepreneurs, it's not only because of execution, it's because we got the timing and the size of the market wrong. It's because, for whatever reason, outside variables weren't there that allowed the company to grow and flourish. I think it's less about execution and it's more about: 'Is the soil good enough and healthy enough to allow the plan to grow?\u2019</p> <p><strong>Speaking of failure, many entrepreneurs say it\u2019s part of the startup process and that you just have to pick yourself up and try again, maybe pivot and change direction. How do you want your companies to approach failure? Do you want them to embrace failure, learn from it?</strong></p> <p>They should be scared of failure, right? For the bigger companies, there is this kind of paranoia about continuing to succeed. \u2018We have climbed this mountain, but we have to climb the next one and the next one and the next one.' There's always that sense that we have to keep going and keep going.</p> <p>I don't think embracing failure is how I would phrase it. I want my companies to be paranoid. I want them to say it's not OK to fail. And in short, it's OK to fail, but internally I don't want them thinking that. Failure isn't an option. And yeah, you need time to grow. You learn from your mistakes, but certainly when you are going into starting a company, I want the mindset to be: \u2018I'm driven, failure is not an option and I'm going to find a way to succeed.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a38cddca-dc91-45e8-bb12-f74753917a25\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/12/1384268908494/40fe21b8-2803-4a44-8638-42207183071d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Maha Ibrahim Canaan Partners\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maha Ibrahim judging at The Pitch in Israel. Photograph: Courtesy of Canaan Partners</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Some founders say that allowing for failure to be an acceptable option lets them try out ideas without worrying about success, which allows for disruption.</strong></p> <p>I think that's so overused. We do want companies to pivot, to course correct and to refine and \u2013 all of that terminology. I don't consider that failure. I consider that drive. It's work. 'Are you ready to get on the horse again and keep going?' I want entrepreneurs who are like that, who say 'Okay, if something didn't work, that's fine. Let's continue and move forward. Let's just not sit here.' Yes, they failed, but they won't accept that they are failures.</p> <p><strong>Let's go back to the topic of stealth. Some entrepreneurs try to keep their projects under wraps until their idea is perfect because they can\u2019t imagine pitching an incomplete idea or an imperfect project. Would you advise them to put themselves out there even if their idea is not 100% formed?</strong></p> <p>Totally, because that's how you form it. I want entrepreneurs to be driven and passionate about their ideas, but at the same time they need to be taking in [thoughts] from the outside to help refine the idea. Because you are not going to know the market perfectly. There are other people who can help guide you during on marketing, how to access your customer base, how to build a product. You need to be connecting all these touch points to really refine the idea as much as possible.</p> <p>And we do that at Canaan partners. We have done that many, many times. We have had a number of companies that we started with three people and a business plan. Kabam was one of them. I love to do it. I think it's probably the most fun part of my job.</p> <p><strong>Is it important for the founders to enjoy what they are doing, enjoy the company and to just have fun?</strong></p> <p>These founders, they're dedicating their lives to these companies and don't want just the nine to five. They want 24 hours a day, and that's very stressful. It can be very, very stressful to face with big and small challenges. I want people who want to do this because they love it \u2013 some love it more than others. But, and this is a general rule, we want this kind of passion, where they say \u2018I really believe in it. I really want to do this. I really want to sacrifice other parts of my life to push forward on this idea and the company.'</p> <p>So the fun part of it is really important because it's just very stressful building a business and not knowing whether in the next year or so customers will come, or whether you are going to get financing, or whether you'll be able to pay your employees. This is non-trivial stuff. You have to like what you are doing.</p> <p><strong>VC companies usually have an exit strategy when it comes to their companies, their investments. How does it work when it comes to the relationship between you and your founders? Does it end?</strong></p> <p>No, the relationship does not come to an end. The companies move on. The company is acquired or goes public, and when they go public there's all the regulations and restrictions of being a public company. So absolutely, we continue to interact with them, and I would say that several of our entrepreneurs are repeat entrepreneurs. They are people who had great experiences and come back, and come back, and come back to start the next company, and the company after that.</p> <p>Or we have entrepreneurs that we bring in to sit on boards of other companies down the road. We try to be as connected with our entrepreneurial community as possible. These are people why have done right by us and we want to do right by them.</p>",

It can be very, very stressful to face with big and small challenges. I want people who want to do this because they love it \u2013 some love it more than others. But, and this is a general rule, we want this kind of passion, where they say \u2018I really believe in it. I really want to do this. I really want to sacrifice other parts of my life to push forward on this idea and the company.' So the fun part of it is really important because it's just very stressful building a business and not knowing whether in the next year or so customers will come, or whether you are going to get financing, or whether you'll be able to pay your employees. This is non-trivial stuff. You have to like what you are doing. VC companies usually have an exit strategy when it comes to their companies, their investments. How does it work when it comes to the relationship between you and your founders? Does it end? No, the relationship does not come to an end. The companies move on. The company is acquired or goes public, and when they go public there's all the regulations and restrictions of being a public company. So absolutely, we continue to interact with them, and I would say that several of our entrepreneurs are repeat entrepreneurs. They are people who had great experiences and come back, and come back, and come back to start the next company, and the company after that. Or we have entrepreneurs that we bring in to sit on boards of other companies down the road. We try to be as connected with our entrepreneurial community as possible. These are people why have done right by us and we want to do right by them.",

      "bodyText": "The recent recovery in jobs is skewed to London and the south-east, according to a study by the TUC that mirrors recent reports highlighting a growing north/south divide in income, wealth and property prices. According to the report the UK's economic recovery has failed to reach the north-east, the north-west, Wales and the south-west, leaving them in the same situation or worse at providing jobs than they were 20 years ago. Even areas of the country that have seen a strong pick-up in jobs during the last year, such as the West Midlands, have suffered over the longer term and are worse off than they were in the early 1990s at providing employment for the local population. The decline in the north and west contrasts with the picture in London and the south-east, which have managed to increase the likelihood of employment despite an influx of foreign labour over recent years. The study comes ahead of official jobs figures this week that are expected to show another fall in unemployment. Last month the jobless count fell by 99,000 to 2.39 million, which pushed the unemployment rate down from 7.6% to 7.4%. Analysts believe it could fall to 7.2% when figures are released on Wednesday. Bank of England officials will be studying the figures closely after they agreed to review their low interest rate policy when unemployment reaches 7%. The Treasury's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said last year that unemployment would stay above 7% this year, but economists expect the target to be met as early as the summer. Threadneedle Street is understood to be concerned that the recovery is restricted to London and the south-east and leaving the north and west behind. A separate study by the CBI and accountants PwC of the financial services sector showed that after a couple of years of moderate growth, employment grew at the fastest pace since 2007, with an increase of 10,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. A further rise of 15,000 is expected in the first three months of this year, taking employment in the sector to 1.16 million. The industry, which is heavily skewed to London and the City, is still providing 52,000 fewer jobs than at the end of 2008, but is expected to join the capital's boom in commercial activity over the last year. Matthew Fell, the CBI's director for competitive markets, said: \"The recovery is beginning to feed through to financial services firms. Things are starting to look more 'normal' after five years of volatility. \"All the key indicators \u2013 optimism, business volumes and profitability \u2013 are up. But it's particularly encouraging to see longer term confidence indicators like marketing spend, employment and investment spend also rising strongly. \"It's also telling that financial services firms are now less worried by levels of demand and regulation and are instead concerned about a skills crunch, their systems capacity and stronger competition.\" The TUC findings show that since the election there are 780,000 more people in work across Britain and the likelihood of having a job has increased one percentage point. Despite this national increase, people's chances of having a job have fallen in the West Midlands, which is down 0.8 percentage points and down by 0.7 percentage points in the north-west. Over the same period, employment rates have increased outside London in areas that have grown and experienced only moderate increases in population. The list is headed by Yorkshire and the Humber, which saw employment rates rise 2.4 percentage points. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Britain's growing population has meant record levels of employment for much of the last two decades. But despite the return of growth the chance of having a job has actually fallen in much of England since 2010. \"The City of London may have caused the crash but the capital's job market has been the most resilient over the last five years. Instead, areas like the West Midlands have borne the brunt of recession, with people's chances of being in work barely any better today than they were after the last recession in the early 90s. \"Whilst it's great that jobs are being created in London and the south-east, stronger job creation is needed throughout the country. We need more well paid jobs, as well as better wage rises for those already in work, if the UK's 30 million-strong workforce is to get a fair share of the benefits of recovery.\" Interest rates should be kept on hold until squeezed real-term wages finally begin to grow to avoid choking off the fragile recovery, according to a leading economic forecasting group. A report from the EY Item Club called on the Bank of England to maintain low interest rates despite the recovery in jobs, which it said had failed to lift wage rates above inflation. EY said the 7% threshold is expected to be met in the first half of this year, two years earlier than expected. But wages remain subdued, growing at half the rate of inflation \u2013 even though this has slowed recently to 2% \u2013 and the report calls for consideration of this factor to be added to the Bank's policy pledge. Slow wages growth means they are falling in real terms and represent what the report says is an Achilles heel for the coalition \u2013 which is under pressure over what Labour calls a cost of living crisis. The Item Club report predicts that UK economic growth will surge to 2.7% in 2014 but that wages will only grow by 1.8%, before picking up to 2.7% in 2015 and 3.5% in 2016.",
