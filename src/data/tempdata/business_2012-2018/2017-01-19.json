      "bodyText": "Here are some of the key quotes from George Soros, for those who missed his interview here in Davos tonight (delegates are now polishing off the pudding and wine in the Seehof Hotel) In my opinion is is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament.And I think she will not last. At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted, and they live in hope.But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they\u2019ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won\u2019t rise as fast as the cost of living. The divorce is going to take a very long time. Its much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning. Hmmmm, maybe George. And on Europe, the billionaire who broke the Bank of England on Black Wednesday said: \u201cOne has to recognize that the European Union has become too complicated and people are alienated. The anti-European parties are gathering force.\u201d And that\u2019s all from Davos. Goodnight!! GW Soros also took a swipe at Hungary\u2019s government, which is threatening to crack down on the non-government agencies he funds. He reads out a statement, saying that these threats against civil society are an affront to European values. Before anyone mistakes George Soros for Cassandra, lets remember that he predicted a year ago that Europe would disintegrate. He now says it won\u2019t - because neither Vladimir Putin nor China want it to fail. This session is being streamed live on Bloomberg TV, for anyone who hasn\u2019t made it to the Seehof hotel in Davos. Soros is taking questions from the room now -- and accepting them by email too, at sorosdavos2017@gmail.com Onto China....and Soros says Beijing would have no choice but to retaliate if Donald Trump labelled it a currency manipulator. It\u2019s much harder to get divorced than to get married, Soros continues, explaining why the Brexit process will take a long time. And he even suggests that Britain could quit the EU on a Friday, and rejoin on the Monday (!) George Soros now declares that it is unlikely that prime minister Theresa May will remain in power for long. She has already got a divided cabinet and a small majority in parliament....I think she will not last, Soros tells his audience of Davos delegates. The people in the UK are in denial, Soros continues. The current economic situation is not as bad as expected, so they live in hope, but as the currency depreciates, inflation will lead to a decline in living standards. It will take time, but when it happens they will realise they are not as well off as before, Soros concludes. If Europe breaks down, the consequences will be very dire, Soros concludes. And currently it is going in the wrong direction. Q: How will Brexit play out? I hope that both sides realise they must find some common ground. A bitter divorce would hurt both sides - And the divorce will be a long process. But when people realise they are going in the wrong direction, they will come together. Soros cites the Guardian\u2019s recent story that Michel Barnier was pushing for a special deal for the City. Last year was a disaster for Europe, Soros continues, with the Brexit vote and the Italian election. Europe has become too complicated, and people are alienated - the anti-European parties are gathering force and the future looks very bleak Hello again from the Seehof hotel in Davos, where veteran billionaire investor/philantropist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. On Donald Trump, Soros says he has described Trump as an imposter, a conman and a would-be dictator. But he is confident that the constitution of the US and division of power will hold sway. He would be a dictator if he could get away with it..but he won\u2019t. When Trump oversteps the mark, they will fight back, Soros predicts. He believes that Trump was surprised to win the November election.....he was engaged in building his brand and his success in attracting crowds. Soros says he\u2019s convinced that Trump will fail - not because people want him to, but because the ideas that drive him are essentially contradictory. For example, he has three chiefs of staff instead of one, and there will be tensions within his cabinet - meaning a lot of infighting in future. And that means that the markets won\u2019t maintain recent gains, Soros predicts: Right now, uncertainty is at its peak, and uncertainty is the enemy of long-term investment. It\u2019s all winding down in the WEF conference centre now; but we\u2019ll hoping to cover an interview/dinner with George Soros at around 8.30pm local time (7.30pm GMT) Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish comments at the latest European Central Bank meeting sent the euro lower and also helped push European markets marginally into the red. And with the dollar also weaker against the pound, the FTSE 100 also fell back - unsurprising given much of its recent gains have been due to the weakness of sterling boosting overseas earners. After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019. This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter... In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u2019t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning. Ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u2019s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%. As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u20ac1.1590. Here\u2019s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u2019s interview with Bloomberg TV. On bank jobs leaving London: Well I\u2019ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u2019ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that. On the customs union: Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK. On globalisation: I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone. On the pound\u2019s weakness: Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom. And on technology and jobs: Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. And here is Bloomberg\u2019s write-up of the interview. Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace. Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future. This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy. She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reckons that European leaders won\u2019t be scared by Philip Hammond\u2019s threat to slash taxes and regulation if Britain doesn\u2019t get a good Brexit deal. May and Hammond had two aims in Davos. The first was to convince UK business leaders they had a plan, an objective largely achieved even among those that think tough times lie ahead. The second was to smooth things over with businesses and politicians in the rest of Europe, which has been far less successful. May and Hammond seem oblivious to the current level of hostility towards the UK. Nor is the May-Hammond \u201ciron fist in the velvet glove\u201d routine likely to make the rest of Europe soften its hard line in the negotiations. Why? Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u2019s Hong Kong. The EU 27 will see scorched earth as an empty threat. Which it is. Here\u2019s his full analysis: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the new head of the United Nations, has singled out youth unemployment as a major threat to global security. In a keynote speech, Guterres says that: The scourge of youth unemployment is probably the worst problem we are facing today, with consequences for the wellbeing of the people involved, societies, and global security too. Young unemployment people in several parts of the world are the largest area of recruitment for terrorist groups. Guterres also warns that we live in a \u201cdangerous world\u201d today; countries must bolster their efforts to deliver peace. The euro has weakened on Mario Draghi\u2019s comments at the ECB\u2019s first press conference of 2017, with investors interpreting his stance as largely dovish. After announcing its decision to leave key interest rates and the quantitative easing (QE) programme unchanged at its 1,000th board meeting, the ECB president highlighted downside risks to the eurozone economy from \u201cglobal uncertainty\u201d and noted a lack of underlying upward pressure on inflation. Much of the recent rise in inflation, he says, is down to energy price movements and he also pointed out nominal wages growth remains subdued. There is more of that in his opening statement. Draghi appeared keen to send the message that the ECB remains ready to do more to shore up the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery as necessary. Draghi said there was no discussion of tapering - the process of winding down QE. In the wake of criticism from German politicians over how low interest rates were hurting those with savings, he also called on people to be patient with the ECB. He patiently fielded several questions on German low rate angst. To the likely disappointment of reporters at the news conference, the ECB president dodged a question on whether Donald Trump could make life more difficult for those charged with safeguarding the euro after the president elect said in an interview that it would be a struggle keeping the euro together. A careful Draghi said: I just won\u2019t make any comment on that... I would rather comment on policies and policy actions than just statements.\u201d His apparently relaxed stance on inflation left the euro down 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.0600 by the end of the news conference. Against the pound it is down 0.6% on the day to 86.19 pence. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 share index turned positive after the apparent promise of ultra-low interest rates for a very long time to come. Commenting on the tone of the press conference, David Lamb sums up the likely reaction of German politicians: In Berlin, Mario Draghi\u2019s unwavering dovishness will go down about as well as Donald Trump\u2019s hints of tariffs on German cars... With the money-printing set to continue until further notice, inflationary pressures will return and the euro has taken an immediate hit. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima says the\u201drace to the bottom on corporate tax\u201d needs to be addressed. It\u2019s worrying now. We\u2019ve seen the promise from president-elect Trump to cut corporate tax. We\u2019ve heard Theresa May threatening to make Britain a little island with low tax rates on the shores of Europe. These are steps in the wrong direction. This year we need to see progress on this corporate tax competition. This isn\u2019t just an issue of legal compliance, Byanyima continues. The local corner shop where I buy bread probably pays a higher tax rate than Apple. We want to see big companies take this as more than a legal compliance, and see it as a moral issue to society - to provide their fair share to fund heath, education, to create jobs for young people, she adds. Switzerland is now \u2018fighting the good fight\u2019 against tax avoidance today, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. Some background: the new global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) come into effect in September 2017, when around 50 jurisdictions will work towards having their first information exchanges. Angel Gurria insists that real progress has been made in fighting tax avoidance and evasion. Back in 2008, there were 30 agreements to share tax information. Today there are 3,500, he says. The promise is enormous, and the potential is very great and it could really help these developing countries. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima is adamant that the current plans don\u2019t go far enough. Simply hiring more tax collectors doesn\u2019t address the use of tax loopholes, or the wider issue of low corporate tax rates. The transparency is good, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough. It doesn\u2019t have public country-by-country recording -- if people don\u2019t know what firms are doing, you\u2019re not going to get the secrecy out and tax them fairly. Panama\u2019s vice-president points the finger at big companies for forcing tax breaks out of developing countries. Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado says some multinationals go to 3rd World companies and \u201cinsist on negotiating tax breaks that local companies don\u2019t have\u201d, in return for siting their operations there. Poland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, reckons the global tax avoidance problem is probably even bigger than that $240bn figure. Morawiecki says that the three countries who make the most foreign direct investment into the European Union are the United States, then Switzerland, then Bermuda. And the list of FDI payments to countries from the EU is exactly the same (ie, the most goes to the US, then Switzerland then Bermuda). If this is not huge, global tax evasion, I don\u2019t know what is. Tax avoidance is a human rights issue, declares Winnie Byanyima, executive director at Oxfam International. She tells her audience at WEF that Kenya is losing $1.1bn every year through tax incentives and tax exceptions. That\u2019s almost double its health budget; in a country where 1 in 40 children die at childbirth. This is really a human rights issue. Byanyima is much less optimist than the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria - she agrees there is progress, but we have a long way to go. She brings a home truth to Davos too: First of all, the developing countries are not at the table, while a notorious tax haven like Switzerland had a place at the table. There is a harmful race to the bottom with countries offering lower tax rates to attract companies (something Philip Hammond has been hinting at), Byanyima adds, saying pointedly: If you can\u2019t dodge taxes, you pay the government to lower the tax rate. Companies need to be forced to provide proper country-by-country reporting of their tax bills, she concludes, to get proper transparency: Yes we are moving, but not fast enough or broadly enough. Panama\u2019s vice-president says her government understands the importance of taxes, both to fund Panama\u2019s spending and to help other countries fight evasion. According to Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado, Panama had been taking action since her government took office 2 and a half-years ago. Before the Panama Papers, President Varela had announced our commitment to automatic information sharing, to the United Nations. And then this leak came, which pointed out a global problem... A global problem which Panama needs to participate in the solution, and the rest of the world needs to participate in the solution. It made us run faster, we were already running. I can say today there is not one issue pending in Panama\u2019s steps to comply with international standards on information sharing, she adds. The panel begins by hearing that countries lose $240bn of tax revenues per year through tax avoidance by companies, according to the OECD 100 countries have signed to an information-sharing deal. Is it making a difference? Absolutely, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. And that includes Panama, which has signed up too. My message to the Panamanian Congress is - yes, pass the law. Complying with the tax system doesn\u2019t mean changing it, it means enforcing it, Gurria continues. And next September, countries will start automatic information sharing - companies who haven\u2019t reported information correctly will be caught out. Nine months ago the Guardian exposed how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca was helping some of the world\u2019s richest people, and its largest companies, avoid tax. Those revelations helped to drive the issue of aggressive tax avoidance high up the political agenda. Now, a heavyweight group at Davos are discussing how to get multinational companies to pay a fair share -- an issue Theresa May also highlighted in her speech. On the panel: Angel Gurr\u00eda: Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Winnie Byanyima: Executive Director, Oxfam International Valdis Dombrovskis: Vice-President and Commissioner, Euro and Socia..., European Commission Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado: Vice-President of Panama Mateusz Morawiecki: Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Here\u2019s some background reading while we wait for it to start: Chancellor Philip Hammond turned a bit lyrical when he spoke to business leaders today, telling them that the \u201cfog of Brexit\u201d was starting to lift. \u201cWe are not going to get rid of it overnight but I hope gradually it will start to lift. A few things are becoming clearer through the mist.\u201d The chancellor also stressed that the Government would do whatever necessary to ensure Britain remained competitive in the event that the rest of the EU cuts up rough in the divorce negotiations for Brexit. Hammond said: If somehow despite out best efforts political retribution were to triumph over economic logic, and we don\u2019t get a fair deal....we will have to do whatever was necessary to ensure the continued competitiveness in those circumstances. \u201cThat\u2019s not a threat. It is a statement of the blindingly obvious.\u201d He returned to the theme in the Q&amp;A session after his speech, saying that a free trade deal with the EU was not the only way for Britain to remain competitive. \u201cWe have reinvented ourselves before and we will do so again if we have to.\u201d Elsewhere in Davos, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has taken another stride onto the world stage by announcing a major sponsorship deal with the Olympics. Ma\u2019s Alibaba has signed up until 2028, and will provide cloud computing services, and help build a new e-commerce platform to flog Olympic branded products to the masses. They\u2019ll also help develop and customise the Olympic Channel, a web site, for a Chinese audience. No pricing details, I\u2019m afraid. Chancellor Philip Hammond has been praising the City, at a lunch with top UK CEOs and journalists. Hammond warns that \u2018fragmenting the City\u2019 isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interests, but he has also repeated his warning that the UK could lower taxes and regulations if it can\u2019t get a good Brexit deal: Hammond also touches on the customs union issue that is worrying Sir Angus Deaton: Away from Davos, the European Central Bank has confirmed it is leaving its key interest rates unchanged and not tinkering any more for now with its bond-buying programme, AKA quantitative easing (QE). Amid signs that inflation and growth are picking up, the Frankfurt-based central bank for the eurozone also stuck to its previous guidance that it stood ready to act should things take a turn for the worse. The full statement is here, but here\u2019s a flavour: The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases... If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the [asset purchase] programme in terms of size and/or duration.\u201d We will get a clearer sense of how ECB policymakers see things when president Mario Draghi hosts a news conference at 13.30GMT. The ECB surprised markets in December by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month. The value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u20ac60bn (\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u20ac80bn currently. But whatever you do, don\u2019t try and tell Mario Draghi that\u2019s tapering. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who isn\u2019t at Davos, alas) has responded to May\u2019s speech: \u201cToday in Davos the Prime Minister talked about making globalisation work for all. But actions speak louder than words. \u201cAt every opportunity, the Conservatives have given handouts to the wealthiest and cut taxes for big business - while refusing to provide vital funds for the NHS, cutting social care and ditching rights at work. \u201cTheresa May\u2019s vision for Brexit is now clear: a bargain basement Britain on the shores of Europe based on low pay and deregulation. \u201cThis week we heard the Prime Minister threaten to turn Britain into a tax haven, slashing corporate taxes and workers\u2019 rights in an all-out race to the bottom. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be taken in by warm words. This Conservative Government is backed to the hilt by wealthy elites, lines the pockets of its friends and resists all practical steps to make a fairer Britain work for all\u201d. Nobel prize winner Sir Angus Deaton tells me that May\u2019s speech missed out some key issues. For starters, there was no mention of Scotland - Deaton\u2019s home country. He wants to be a member of the European Union, and a member of the United Kingdom - and now that doesn\u2019t seem possible. And on trade, Deaton says: I was also surprised she talked about free trade all the time, and she didn\u2019t talk about the customs union. That\u2019s a big deal. Free trade and custom unions are not the same thing, and I think that will hurt Britain. So I haven\u2019t changed my expectation that in the long run Britain would be a lot better off in the EU than out. This was the first time that Deaton has watched May speak in the flesh, and he was reminded of an earlier Conservative leader. The immediate analogy when you see her for the first time is, this looks like Mrs Thatcher. But when you listen to her, she\u2019s sort of the anti-Thatcher in some sense. Mrs Thatcher used to say there is no society, while she was talking about society. Mrs Thatcher would have not been very keen on taking us out of the EU. So it really is very different from Mrs Thatcher. Theresa May\u2019s stern rebuke to businesses who are not paying a fair share of tax sounded good in the cavernous WEF hall. However, we should remember that Britain has been lowering its own corporation tax rate for years to attract firms to base here. And just last week, chancellor Philip Hammond threatened that the UK might abandon European-style regulations and taxes after Brexit, if the economy struggles. The leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Liberal Democrat party, Tim Farron, says: \u201cThe Prime Minister certainly has a brass neck. She goes to Davos to lecture businesses about looking after the little guy yet she threatens to turn the UK into a Europe\u2019s biggest tax haven. \u201cThis shows, yet again, that this Tory government are treating our country like UK plc. They are running our economy like it is a closing down sale. But higher prices and more expensive fuel mean families will feel the brunt of this government\u2019s bad economic policies.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s speech may have been a hot ticket at Davos and generally well received by those present, but the market reaction back home was far more muted than the wild gyrations seen during Tuesday\u2019s Brexit performance. For a start the speech was shorter - only half an hour compared to around 50 minutes - and revealed no new details of Brexit strategy. The pound was already up 0.47% at $1.2314 against the dollar at the start of the speech, hit a peak of $1.2332 and then as she finished, drifted back to where it started but still showing a positive move for the day. Against the euro, the pound had edged up 0.19% at the start, and ended up 0.16% at \u20ac1.1548. The FTSE 100, down due to the rise in the pound dampening enthusiasm for overseas earners, dipped lower during the speech, from 7216 to 7208, down 0.55% on the day so far. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound seemed to react well to Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech this Thursday, with the first ECB meeting of 2017 still to come... It was the tone that mattered more than the content, with May framing the Brexit vote as, however incredulously, a defence of globalisation and free trade. This did, however, lead the FTSE more than 40 points lower, the UK index hampered not only by the pound\u2019s rebound but also the losses in its commodity and banking sectors, as well as the 6% post-third quarter update decline seen by Royal Mail. London mayor Sadiq Khan tells us that it\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d that Theresa May is in Davos today. But he also warns that her Brexit speech on Tuesday, in which she confirmed Britain would leave the Single Market, has spooked some in the City. On a whistle-stop trip around Davos, Khan tells us that firms who leave London are unlikely to permanently relocate to Europe. I think the fact she\u2019s got a plan is welcome. I think the fact she\u2019s here is brilliant But I think she needs to be listening to what our friends, chief executives, innovators, entrepreneurs, political leaders are saying, which is that no-one is bringing us bad will. There\u2019s no bad feeling here. But there\u2019s got to be a recognition that so-called hard Brexit benefits no-one, in relation to London, the UK, or Europe. Businesses that leave London aren\u2019t going to Paris, Brussels, Madrid, Frankfurt, they\u2019re going to New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Khan says he fully accepts the referendum result, but argues that \u201cno-one voted to make us poorer\u201d. So the government must make it a priority to get \u201cprivileged access to the single market\u201d so London can still attract talent. The good news is that over the last six months Google, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat have expanded their presence in London. But the bad news is that, as a consequence of the speech on Tuesday we have some banks and investment firms expressing unease about their future. Europe\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, has also given May a thumbs-up for her comments on making globalisation work. Speaking to AFP newswires here, she said: It was a good speech. She captured lots of the concerns about a responsible globalisation that we all talk about. Katherine Garrett-Cox, the former chief executive of Alliance Trust, tells me that Theresa May gave Davos what it wanted. I think she did a very good job of setting out a clear plan in terms of what Britain intends to do, what Britain intends to stand for, and I think that\u2019s really what people wanted to hear. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of criticism over the past six months over where does this start and where does it go. I think we heard very clearly that that\u2019s the plan, and now we\u2019ve got to get on and do it. Q: Can we do it, though, at the same time as negotiating Brexit? We\u2019ve all heard that the divorce, as people have called it, is going to be complicated and complex. But I think we all have to believe that we can do it, so I\u2019m optimistic. Q: What\u2019s your biggest concern now with Brexit? My biggest concern is that businesses step up and embrace the opportunity rather than constantly looking for the downside. I\u2019ve grabbed a word with Dr Paul Sheard, the chief global economist of Standard &amp; Poors, outside the conference room. He says May gave a \u201cvery good\u201d speech. Theresa May was laying down a stake and saying - Britain will be the lead supporting voice for globalisation in the world. A lot of people have seen Brexit as anti-globalisation, a return to nationalism. She\u2019s pivoting to saying \u2018no, this is about Britain being very global\u2019. We now have two global leaders, President Xi Jinping and Theresa May, both making a pitch in support of globalisation, Sheard adds. Two days ago, Chinese president Xi Jinping wowed Davos with a speech defending globalisation, at a time when Donald Trump has put free trade under threat. And now Theresa May has declared that Britain is determined to become a more powerful player after Brexit, despite the difficult negotiations ahead. 1) She seemed to give Davos what it wanted to hear, saying that the UK will be a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d after leaving the EU I want the UK to emerge from this period of change as a truly Global Britain \u2013 the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too; a country that gets out into the world to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike. 2) She threw her weight behind the growing pressure to fix globalisation to address the populist surge in politics; a major issue this year. May, though, took an almost moral tone, speaking about how the responsibilities we have to one another have been forgotten. This was the key line: But just as we need to act to address the deeply felt sense of economic inequality that has emerged in recent years, so we also need to recognise the way in which a more global and individualistic world can sometimes loosen the ties that bind our society together, leaving some people feeling locked out and left behind. 3) She was interventionist, highlighting her industrial strategy and saying: For government, it means not just stepping back and \u2013 as the prevailing orthodoxy in many countries has argued for so many years \u2013 not just getting out of the way. Not just leaving businesses to get on with the job and assuming that problems will just fix themselves. It means stepping up to a new, active role that backs businesses and ensures more people in all corners of the country share in the benefits of its success. 4) And she criticised business leaders too, especially those multinationals who can seem to play by different rules. Theresa May ended her speech with a call on global leaders and business chiefs to work together to make globalisation work for everyone. As we build a new, bold, confident Global Britain and shape a new era of globalisation that genuinely works for all As we harness the forces of globalisation so that the system works for everyone, and so maintain public support for that system for generations to come. I want that to be the legacy of our time. To use this moment to provide responsive, responsible leadership that will bring the benefits of free trade to every corner of the world; that will lift millions more out of poverty and towards prosperity; and that will deliver security, prosperity and belonging for all of our people. May returns to the downsides of globalisation - and the damage it has done to societies. Too often today, the obligations we have to each other have been forgotten, she says. We need to recognise how a more global and individualistic world can loosen the ties that bind us together. And May stakes her flag firmly, declaring: I am determined that centre-ground mainstream politics can respond to the concerns people have today. That means standing up for free trade and globalisation, but also ensuring it works for everyone. And she quotes Edmund Burke, who wrote: A state without the means for some change is without the means for its own conservation. May insists that governments have an obligation to help those who need help the most. If you\u2019re just getting by, you don\u2019t want a government that gets out of the way - you want one that will help you. Government and business need to do even more to make the case for globalisation, May continues. She cites her new industrial strategy -- a term that had fallen into disrepute in recent years. But Britain is going to create the conditions where winners can grow and thrive, not about \u2018picking winners\u2019. We must step up and take control to make sure that free trade and globalisation works for everyone. May now addresses the UK business leaders in the audience - saying they must do more to help the public. She cites the importance of everyone paying a fair share of tax. In the UK, trust with business runs at just 35% among the lowest-income groups. Companies must putting aside short-term considerations, and investing in people and communities for the long term. There is a feeling that some companies, especially multinationals, are playing by a different set of rules to everyone else, May declares. It is essential for business to show leadership - to show that in this globalised world, everyone is playing by the same rules. On globalisation, May reiterates that some people are being left behind by economic changes - they are getting by but not getting on. On slavery, May urges her audience to help tackle this abhorent problem; she has convened a top-level panel at Davos today to seek solutions. May reminds the audience of the dark days in the first half of the 20th century. We must uphold the institutions that help the world to work together, and guarantee global security. May also cites Britain\u2019s multicultural heritage. May is outlining her vision of making Britain a truly global country. We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again. A country in charge of its own destiny is in a better position to take the lead in improving the world, she continues. She cites the fact that some of Britain\u2019s most famous car brands, like Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by India\u2019s Tata. Brexit was a vote to take control, and make decisions ourselves, May continues. Britain\u2019s history and culture is profoundly international, she says. We have always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We are, by instinct, a great global trading nation. And we want to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world. She welcomes the fact that preliminary talks are underway with several countries including Australia, while China and the Gulf States have expressed interest in making deals with us. Britain faces a time of momentous change, and tough negotiations, May says, following the Brexit vote. But we must believe that it will lead to a better future British people chose to build a truly global country, May says. And we face the future with confidence. May\u2019s on the stage now. This is an organisation that is committed to improving the state of the world. Those of us who meet here are optimists, who believe in the power of public and private collaboration to make the world tomorrow better than today. Free trade, partnership and globalisation. But outside this hall, those forces for good which we take for granted are being called into question. Forces that have had such a positive impact, lifting millions out of poverty, broken down barriers and raised living standards, are now being undermined. As we meet here, across Europe parties of the far left and far right are trying to profit from a keenly felt sense, especially among those on modest incomes, that these forces are not working for them. These people feel that mainstream political and business leaders have failed to appreciate their legitimate concerns for too long, May says. But she will lay out an agenda for how mainstream politics can address this. Davos\u2019s founder Klaus Schwab has taken the stage, to introduce Theresa May. Schwab says he was born before world war 2 broke out - for him, Europe was a big dream of never having war again, and feeling united. He says he\u2019s very pleased to hear Theresa May say that the UK will not leave Europe, but will have a very amicable divorce. Hammond and Khan are now chatting together, as we wait for the PM... Chancellor Philip Hammond just marched into the hall, not far behind Sadiq Khan. Even the global elite have to queue sometimes. There\u2019s a massive line snaking around the conference now, as delegates try to bag a decent seat to watch Theresa May in 25 minutes. There\u2019s a flurry of activity as some of the global elite head into a private meeting in the heart of the WEF conference centre. It looks like an IGWEL - or Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders in the Davos jargon. I\u2019ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and HSBC chairman Douglas Flint arriving (you can see Lagarde here) One insider says they\u2019ll be discussing sustainable development; hopefully they\u2019ll still catch Theresa May\u2019s speech too. London mayor Sadiq Khan is also in Davos today. He\u2019s been meeting with business leaders, and arguing for Britain to get privileged access to the single market. He\u2019s just giving an interview to the BBC now, saying that his message to EU leaders is not to assume the Brexit vote was a one-off. Unless you address the concerns around globalisation, unless you address these issues, if there\u2019s a vote in your country whether to stay or leave the EU don\u2019t be surprised if your voters decide to leave the EU. Good morning from Davos, and day three of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting. Theresa May swept into the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re hotel in the centre of this ski resort last night, on the latest stage in her push for Brexit. The UK PM is the hottest act in town today; at 10.15am local time (9.15am GMT) she will deliver a special address to an audience of fellow world leaders, business chiefs and economists. The speech gets top billing: Britain after Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May will spell out the economic implications of leaving the European Union May is expected to talk about those who have not prospered under globalisation; linking the Brexit vote into a broader theme that has dominated talk at Davos this week already. One Downing Street source told Sky News overnight that: \u201cThe PM is reflecting themes she\u2019s spoken about before - that change has to come in order to benefit who have been left behind.\u201d May\u2019s likely to use the speech to pitch for more global trade, saying Britain remains open to business despite voting to leave the EU. The speech could also include a hard-hitting section on modern slavery; a priority for May since her days as Britain\u2019s Home Secretary. May is also meeting bank chiefs in Davos, such as Wall Street bosses who are wondering whether to start moving jobs and operations out of the City in anticipation of the UK leaving the single market. Bloomberg: May Meets Wall Streeters in Davos as Banks Plan Brexit Exodus It could be a tricky Davos debut for May; the Guardian reports this morning that European leaders are presenting a united front ahead of the EU exit talks. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, led the way, predicted that negotiating Brexit will be \u201cvery, very, very difficult\u201d But May has allies here too; chancellor Philip Hammond will meet with a clutch of UK business chiefs at a lunch later. We\u2019ve also spied Liam Fox; the Secretary of international trade told us last night that he\u2019s here to make the the case for free trade, and make sure that global markets don\u2019t \u201csilt up\u201d. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action from Davos through the day...",

After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019.</p> <p>This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter...</p> <p>In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u2019t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning.</p> <p>Ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u2019s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li>The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44</li> <li>Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89</li> <li>France\u2019s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14</li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%.</p> <p>As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u20ac1.1590.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:17:23.303Z\">at 5.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f2c0e4b01065cf59861d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:15:30.626Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u2019s interview with Bloomberg TV.</p> <p><em>On bank jobs leaving London:</em></p> <p>Well I\u2019ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u2019ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that.</p> <p><em>On the customs union:</em></p> <p>Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK.</p> <p><em>On globalisation:</em></p> <p> I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone.</p> <p><em>On the pound\u2019s weakness:</em></p> <p>Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom.</p> <p><em>And on technology and jobs:</em></p> <p>Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. <br></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-19/may-tells-banks-she-values-them-as-they-pack-their-brexit-bags\">Bloomberg\u2019s write-up</a> of the interview.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:20:15.585Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f01ee4b00b8fc2ae2666\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:59:15.534Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes people feel globalization has &quot;left them behind,&quot; Theresa May says <a href=\"https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN\">https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5NaC9Y37cx\">pic.twitter.com/5NaC9Y37cx</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5880ece5e4b0f0efb00f5cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nickfletcher\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:54:45.388Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve had &quot;positive discussions&quot; with big banks about jobs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal\">@bbckamal</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/davos2017?src=hash\">#davos2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd\">https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FUjE1fEKMs\">pic.twitter.com/FUjE1fEKMs</a></p>&mdash; BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU.</p> <p>Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy.</p> <p>She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/822122563610480642\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most of what UK PM May said in that BTV interview has already been discounted...

Why? Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u2019s Hong Kong.

For a start the speech was shorter - only half an hour compared to around 50 minutes - and revealed no new details of Brexit strategy.<br></p> <p>The pound was already up 0.47% at $1.2314 against the dollar at the start of the speech, hit a peak of $1.2332 and then as she finished, drifted back to where it started but still showing a positive move for the day.</p> <p>Against the euro, the pound had edged up 0.19% at the start, and ended up 0.16% at \u20ac1.1548. The FTSE 100, down due to the rise in the pound dampening enthusiasm for overseas earners, dipped lower during the speech, from 7216 to 7208, down 0.55% on the day so far. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound seemed to react well to Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech this Thursday, with the first ECB meeting of 2017 still to come... It was the tone that mattered more than the content, with May framing the Brexit vote as, however incredulously, a defence of globalisation and free trade. This did, however, lead the FTSE more than 40 points lower, the UK index hampered not only by the pound\u2019s rebound but also the losses in its commodity and banking sectors, as well as the 6% post-third quarter update decline seen by Royal Mail.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5880a0f0e4b00b8fc2ae2452\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T11:38:13.002Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sadiq Khan: May must listen to businesses</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b629a09cab7c6a3175c3764900c686559489d42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b629a09cab7c6a3175c3764900c686559489d42/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May leaves the stage after giving her speech today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May leaves the stage after giving her speech today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Gillieron/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>London mayor Sadiq Khan tells us that it\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d that Theresa May is in Davos today.</strong></p> <p>But he also warns that her Brexit speech on Tuesday, in which she confirmed Britain would leave the Single Market, has spooked some in the City.</p> <p>On a whistle-stop trip around Davos, Khan tells us that firms who leave London are unlikely to permanently relocate to Europe.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the fact she\u2019s got a plan is welcome.

      "bodyText": "Is the City of London going to hell in a Brexit handcart? If you believe so, you might point to the growls from the bankers in Davos about shifting jobs to the continent. We could move 1,000 roles, says HSBC, with Paris the main beneficiary. Same figure for us, replies UBS, but possibly Frankfurt and Madrid. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is stalling on its plan to expand in London. On the other hand, here\u2019s Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, breathing easily: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the financial centre of Europe will leave the City of London. There are all sorts of reasons why I think the UK will continue to be the financial lungs for Europe.\u201d The reality, one suspects, is that these positions are not as far apart as they seem. Everybody is trying to anticipate the outcome of the Brexit negotiations but, in the absence of facts, the bankers\u2019 statements are a cocktail of contingency planning and hazy guesswork. What is plainly true is that, if banks and other financial firms are legally bound to conduct certain types of business in the eurozone, that is where they will shift the relevant roles. That is what HSBC and UBS are primarily talking about. Of course, the banks \u2013 like UK carmakers \u2013 have an incentive to frighten the government with large numbers to try to protect their interests during the negotiations. But a thousand jobs here, a thousand there? Yes, that seems quite possible. It\u2019s a very big industry. Yet the hell-in-a-handcart question is different. It\u2019s about whether the loss of those jobs would herald the slow decline of the City, with business relentlessly leaking away over the years. That, as Staley suggests, remains hard to believe. First, the banks would prefer to move as few posts as possible. Relocation is a hassle and UK regulators and politicians are familiar beasts. Second, the bankers probably aren\u2019t making it up when they say the rest of the EU\u2019s interests would not be served by upending the City. There isn\u2019t an easy alternative financial capital and a fragmented collection of centres implies expense, to be paid in higher costs by European companies. That point, plus the risks to financial stability, may be gaining ground in the EU. So is a third: that New York could be the biggest beneficiary of a sudden shift in the financial landscape. Returns on capital for banks are currently far fatter in the US than in the eurozone. So don\u2019t assume US banks would rush to Frankfurt. Their US boards may prefer the Trumpist option of reinvesting at home. To repeat, everything hinges on the new trading arrangements between the UK and the EU \u2013 and some form of standstill agreement, which allows adjustment to happen over time, could be the critical protection that the City requires. In the meantime, here\u2019s a private pointer from one senior banker: watch the property markets. Tales of relocation become solid only when banks commit to spending serious sums on flashy new premises. And, if a large continental bank were to run against the general chatter and order a sizeable chunk of office space in London, that would be very significant. Time for a big tobacco pay filter It is a poor state of affairs that so many fund managers, especially in the US, can\u2019t be bothered to think for themselves and instead rely on third parties to advise them on how to vote at companies\u2019 annual meetings. But it is also true that few shareholder rebellions, at least on boardroom pay, gain momentum unless such proxy voting agencies back them. That is why Imperial Brands, as Imperial Tobacco calls itself these days, will be alarmed that ISS has come out against its proposed pay policy. The fag firm had been delighted that Glass Lewis, another proxy agency, supported the proposed hike in chief executive Alison Cooper\u2019s maximum pay package to \u00a38.5m. Now ISS, which carries greater clout, is in the opposition camp. ISS\u2019s reasoning is sound. First, the agency observes that Imperial can\u2019t seem to stop fiddling. This is the second time in three years that it wants to increase executives\u2019 variable pay. That is not how the game is meant to be played; rather, companies are supposed to get a policy approved and then let it run for three years. Second, ISS agrees with a point made here a couple of days ago: Imperial is playing the tired and discredited \u201cbenchmarking\u201d card. It thinks Cooper, who earned \u00a35.5m last year, needs a rise just because bosses of other companies with similar stock-market valuations can get even more. But if all companies take that view when their shares have outperformed (and never when they have underperformed), inflation becomes baked into the system. Common sense ought to prevail. Cooper can earn \u00a37.1m a year under the current policy. She owns shares in Imperial worth \u00a36.5m and has unvested performance-related awards worth up to \u00a312m. That ought to be sufficient motivation to try hard. Imperial\u2019s proposal is a shabby try-on that deserves to fail, as a few fund managers who do think for themselves have been saying in private. The intervention of ISS makes the vote on 1 February interesting. An honest departure \u201cSuccession processes are challenging for everyone involved and, unfortunately, it is rare that all those involved stay with the company,\u201d says Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline. At least that\u2019s honest: Abbas Hussain, head of Global Pharmaceuticals (and brother of former England cricket captain Nasser), is departing because he lost out to Emma Walmsley in the race to succeed Witty. Hussain, 52, can be confident of landing a big job elsewhere. Top marks for sparing us the usual guff about leaving to pursue other interests.",

      "body": "<p>Is the City of London going to hell in a Brexit handcart? If you believe so, you might point to the growls from the bankers in Davos about shifting jobs to the continent. We could move 1,000 roles, says HSBC, with Paris the main beneficiary. Same figure for us, replies UBS, but possibly Frankfurt and Madrid. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/19/goldman-sachs-uk-brexit-us-city-hsbc-ubs-london\">Goldman Sachs is stalling on its plan to expand in London</a>.</p> <p>On the other hand, here\u2019s Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, breathing easily: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the financial centre of Europe will leave the City of London. There are all sorts of reasons why I think the UK will continue to be the financial lungs for Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The reality, one suspects, is that these positions are not as far apart as they seem. Everybody is trying to anticipate the outcome of the Brexit negotiations but, in the absence of facts, the bankers\u2019 statements are a cocktail of contingency planning and hazy guesswork.</p> <p>What is plainly true is that, if banks and other financial firms are legally bound to conduct certain types of business in the eurozone, that is where they will shift the relevant roles. That is what HSBC and UBS are primarily talking about. Of course, the banks \u2013 like UK carmakers \u2013 have an incentive to frighten the government with large numbers to try to protect their interests during the negotiations. But a thousand jobs here, a thousand there? Yes, that seems quite possible. It\u2019s a very big industry.</p> <p>Yet the hell-in-a-handcart question is different. It\u2019s about whether the loss of those jobs would herald the slow decline of the City, with business relentlessly leaking away over the years. That, as Staley suggests, remains hard to believe.</p> <p>First, the banks would prefer to move as few posts as possible. Relocation is a hassle and UK regulators and politicians are familiar beasts. Second, the bankers probably aren\u2019t making it up when they say the rest of the EU\u2019s interests would not be served by upending the City. There isn\u2019t an easy alternative financial capital and a fragmented collection of centres implies expense, to be paid in higher costs by European companies. That point, plus the risks to financial stability, may be gaining ground in the EU.</p> <p>So is a third: that New York could be the biggest beneficiary of a sudden shift in the financial landscape. Returns on capital for banks are currently far fatter in the US than in the eurozone. So don\u2019t assume US banks would rush to Frankfurt. Their US boards may prefer the Trumpist option of reinvesting at home.</p> <p>To repeat, everything hinges on the new trading arrangements between the UK and the EU \u2013 and some form of standstill agreement, which allows adjustment to happen over time, could be the critical protection that the City requires. In the meantime, here\u2019s a private pointer from one senior banker: watch the property markets. Tales of relocation become solid only when banks commit to spending serious sums on flashy new premises. And, if a large continental bank were to run against the general chatter and order a sizeable chunk of office space in London, that would be very significant.</p> <h2>Time for a big tobacco pay filter<br></h2> <p>It is a poor state of affairs that so many fund managers, especially in the US, can\u2019t be bothered to think for themselves and instead rely on third parties to advise them on how to vote at companies\u2019 annual meetings. But it is also true that few shareholder rebellions, at least on boardroom pay, gain momentum unless such proxy voting agencies back them.</p> <p>That is why Imperial Brands, as Imperial Tobacco calls itself these days, will be alarmed that ISS has come out against its proposed pay policy. The fag firm had been delighted that Glass Lewis, another proxy agency, supported the proposed hike in chief executive Alison Cooper\u2019s maximum pay package to \u00a38.5m. Now ISS, which carries greater clout, is in the opposition camp.</p> <p>ISS\u2019s reasoning is sound. First, the agency observes that Imperial can\u2019t seem to stop fiddling. This is the second time in three years that it wants to increase executives\u2019 variable pay. That is not how the game is meant to be played; rather, companies are supposed to get a policy approved and then let it run for three years.</p> <p>Second, ISS agrees with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jan/16/rolls-royce-sfo-criminal-investigation\">a point made here a couple of days ago</a>: Imperial is playing the tired and discredited \u201cbenchmarking\u201d card. It thinks Cooper, who earned \u00a35.5m last year, needs a rise just because bosses of other companies with similar stock-market valuations can get even more. But if all companies take that view when their shares have outperformed (and never when they have underperformed), inflation becomes baked into the system.</p> <p>Common sense ought to prevail. Cooper can earn \u00a37.1m a year under the current policy. She owns shares in Imperial worth \u00a36.5m and has unvested performance-related awards worth up to \u00a312m. That ought to be sufficient motivation to try hard. Imperial\u2019s proposal is a shabby try-on that deserves to fail, as a few fund managers who do think for themselves have been saying in private. The intervention of ISS makes the vote on 1 February interesting.</p> <h2>An honest departure</h2> <p>\u201cSuccession processes are challenging for everyone involved and, unfortunately, it is rare that all those involved stay with the company,\u201d says Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline. At least that\u2019s honest: Abbas Hussain, head of Global Pharmaceuticals (and brother of former England cricket captain Nasser), is departing because he lost out to Emma Walmsley in the race to succeed Witty. Hussain, 52, can be confident of landing a big job elsewhere. Top marks for sparing us the usual guff about leaving to pursue other interests.<br></p>",

    "webTitle": "Big six energy suppliers warned not to raise prices any time soon", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The regulator Ofgem has warned the big six energy companies against raising prices in spring, despite a 15% increase in their costs. It said rising wholesale gas and electricity prices were largely to blame for driving costs upwards, along with renewable energy subsidies. But its chief executive, Dermot Nolan, said this was not an excuse for tariff hikes. \u201cAt this point in time it is not obvious to us that there should be price rises [to consumers],\u201d Nolan said, adding that energy suppliers would need to justify any rise. Energy companies said late last year that upward pressure from wholesale costs might soon be passed on to consumers with tariff price rises. But Nolan pointed to the way big players buy their energy: by acquiring as much as possible two years in advance. Energy companies were slow to pass on falling wholesale prices to householders in 2014, he said, and so he would expect the suppliers not to rush into changing prices now that the pressure was in the other direction. On Thursday the regulator published its supplier cost index, the first time it has analysed costs facing energy suppliers since 2015. Nolan said it should act as \u201csome check on energy companies\u2019 behaviour on price rises\u201d, in a pointed warning to the big six \u2013 EDF Energy, British Gas, SSE, E.On, Scottish Power and Npower. EDF Energy announced a price rise in December, which will raise customers\u2019 electricity prices by 8.4% and lower gas prices by 5.2% in the spring. Oil prices, which also set the gas price, fell from a peak of $115 a barrel in 2014 to less than $30 at the beginning of last year. However, the price has now recovered to $54. Other companies have pledged to freeze prices until the end of winter but some, such as SSE, have already hinted that wholesale pressures will lead to imminent hikes. Switch sites, which help consumers move to a different energy provider, have said EDF\u2019s move was likely to be the \u201cfirst rise of many\u201d. However, Ofgem said the hedging by energy suppliers, whereby they buy energy in advance, meant they were likely to have been insulated from recent wholesale price increases. For those companies, the cost of supplying a dual-fuel customer would be \u201conly slightly higher than a year earlier\u201d. Ofgem analysis found that electricity wholesale costs accounted for six percentage points of the increase on the cost index, with gas wholesale costs accounting for 6.6 points. Levies on environmental and social programmes, in particular to support renewable energy, accounted for 2.9 percentage points. Other costs, such as energy transmission and distribution, were down slightly. Despite the higher costs to suppliers, they are still around a tenth lower than they were at the start of 2014 due to a two-year period of falling costs. The average household dual-fuel energy bill was \u00a31,066 in December 2016 compared with \u00a31,140 in December 2013. Which? welcomed the new index, which will be updated every quarter. \u201cThe new index is a step in the right direction to introduce more transparency and help to understand what factors impact people\u2019s bills. We expect to see Ofgem use this index to monitor suppliers and hold them to account to help protect customers from paying more than they need to for their energy,\u201d said Vickie Sheriff, the consumer group\u2019s director of campaigns and communications. An EDF spokeswoman said: \u201cOur policy of buying electricity ahead of time has protected customers from the more recent volatility in wholesale prices, however non-wholesale energy costs have risen and we have been honest with customers about the future impact on prices, confirming that we are holding off increasing electricity prices until March.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce, which this week agreed to pay \u00a3671m in penalties after admitting it had engaged in corruption, lobbied ministers to weaken proposed curbs on bribery a decade ago. The effort to dilute anti-bribery regulations was conducted under the leadership of Sir John Rose, the firm\u2019s chief executive until 2011, who is facing calls from Labour to be stripped of his knighthood after the bribery settlement. Documents from a 2004 court case show how Rolls-Royce, in alliance with other multinationals, exerted pressure on the government to water down proposals that were intended to combat bribery. Tony Blair\u2019s government had proposed strengthening rules to stop bribery in contracts that were supported by the UK\u2019s export credit agency and ministers said they were stepping up efforts to prevent UK businesses paying bribes to secure contracts overseas. The documents detail how Rolls-Royce and the other multinationals objected to the proposals and began privately to lobby against them. Minutes of a meeting in July 2004 show that Rolls-Royce told civil servants it refused to disclose any details of its middlemen to the government as they saw these arrangements as strictly private. At another meeting the following month, Rolls-Royce and the other firms again argued for secrecy on the grounds that they \u201coperated in a particular environment\u201d that \u201cwas very competitive with a small number of large companies\u201d. \u201cThese competitors would gain a major commercial advantage if they knew who [Rolls-Royce]\u2019s intermediaries were. These details were very commercially sensitive. The network of agents/intermediaries was a valuable asset built up over a number of years and offered important commercial advantages such as being able to open doors \u2026 Even within the companies the names were restricted to a small number of senior employees,\u201d the minutes record. The then Labour government subsequently diluted the anti-bribery proposals. That decision was challenged in a legal action brought by the anti-corruption campaign group Corner House. As a result, the lobbying documents were released. Sue Hawley, an anti-corruption campaigner involved in the legal action, said: \u201cClearly Rolls-Royce didn\u2019t want any scrutiny of its agents and commission payments because its main business model was paying bribes via agents to win contracts.\u201d In his judgment approving the Rolls-Royce settlement this week, Sir Brian Leveson described how the firm had systemically used middlemen to funnel \u201ctruly vast corrupt payments\u201d to secure contracts. The bribes were paid to win contracts in countries including Indonesia, China, Russia, Thailand, Iraq and Angola, earning more than \u00a3250m in profits. Leveson found that the corruption involved \u201csenior (on the face of it, very senior) Rolls-Royce employees\u201d and disclosed how Rolls-Royce had changed its procedures for approving payments to its middlemen. In 2003, payments over a certain threshold had to be specifically approved by the chief executive, a post occupied at the time by Rose. The Guardian asked Rose, who led the company between 1996 and 2011, how many times he had approved payments to middlemen over this threshold. Rose declined to answer. He has not made any comment since the settlement was announced on Monday. On Wednesday, the shadow secretary of state for international trade, Barry Gardiner, said Rose could not credibly retain his knighthood after Rolls-Royce admitted it was responsible for \u201cegregious criminality over decades\u201d during his term as chief executive. Leveson said in his ruling that he had approved the deal to halt the investigations as he was satisfied that Rolls-Royce had changed its management team since prosecutors began to look at evidence of the corruption in 2012. \u2022 If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service (see how here).",

      "bodyText": "Efforts to tackle global tax avoidance are being undermined by a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d on corporate tax rates led by Britain and the US, the World Economic Forum heard on Thursday. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, told an audience at Davos that world leaders are failing to move fast enough, or far enough, to make firms pay their fair share. The trend of lowering corporation tax rates, in an attempt to lure companies to switch their headquarters, is making the situation worse. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying now. We\u2019ve seen the promise from President-elect Trump to cut corporate tax. We\u2019ve heard Theresa May threatening to make Britain a little island with low tax rates on the shores of Europe. \u201cThese are steps in the wrong direction. This year we need to see progress on this corporate tax competition,\u201d she added. Byanyima was speaking on a panel on multinational tax policy in the light of the release of the Panama Papers nine months ago, which showed how companies and rich individuals exploited the international tax regime to avoid tax. Panama\u2019s vice-president, Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado, said the Panama Papers leak had identified a \u201cglobal problem\u201d, and made her government intensify its efforts to tackle the issue. \u201cIt made us run faster, we were already running,\u201d she said. She also attacked multinational companies who \u201cinsist on negotiating tax breaks that local companies don\u2019t have\u201d, when they site operations in a developing country. Figures from the Organiation for Economic Cooperation and Development show that countries lose $240bn of revenue a year through companies shifting profits around the world. New rules come into force this year to force countries to share information between each other, to prevent companies siphoning profits to tax havens. The OECD secretary general, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, insisted progress has been made since the financial crisis. Back in 2008, there were 30 agreements to share tax information. Today there are 3,500, Gurr\u00eda said. \u201cThe promise is enormous, and the potential is very great and it could really help developing countries.\u201d Byanyima cited data showing that Kenya is losing $1.1bn (\u00a3893m) through tax exemptions and incentives each year. \u201cThat\u2019s almost double its health budget; in a country where one in 40 children die at childbirth. This is really a human rights issue.\u201d On Tuesday, the UK prime minister, Theresa May, warned European politicians that Britain would set \u201ccompetitive tax rates\u201d to lure companies and investors to Britain, if it didn\u2019t get an acceptable Brexit deal. However, on Thursday, she told leaders in Davos that businesses need to pay their fair share of tax. Byanyima argues that businesses need to see tax as a moral issue, and an obligation to help fund heath, education, to create jobs and opportunities for young people. \u201cThe local corner shop where I buy bread probably pays a higher tax rate than Apple,\u201d she added. Oxfam is calling on the world\u2019s richest people to \u201ceven it up\u201d, after new data showed that the eight richest people own as much net wealth as the bottom 50% of the world population. Elsewhere in Davos, President Alpha Cond\u00e9 of Guinea blamed \u201cwestern lawyers and PR firms\u201d for helping to create and hide complex financial structures that allow multinational companies to hide money flows. \u201cCorruption in developing countries is too often supported by the most prestigious lawyers, expensive PR firms and some of the biggest financiers in the world \u2013 often registered in London, New York and Zurich,\u201d Cond\u00e9 said. \u201cThey can hide behind complex company structures that make it almost impossible to determine who owns and controls them, who works for them, and where money flows,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail\u2019s share price has fallen after uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the European Union curbed the amount of junk mail and business letters being sent. While group revenues were flat for the nine months to 25 December, the postal service said correspondence in the business world had slowed. \u201cWe are seeing the impact of overall business uncertainty in the UK on letter volumes, in particular advertising and business letters,\u201d the company said in a statement which sent its shares down by more than 5%. Royal Mail warned in November that it had experienced a drop-off in marketing business \u2013 better known as junk mail \u2013 both before and after the EU referendum, as firms reined in spending. While it did not directly reference Brexit in its latest update, sources familiar with the postal service\u2019s fortunes said advertising and corporate correspondence are being choked off by corporate jitters over the UK\u2019s future EU relationship. It said this uncertainty was responsible for a 2% fall in revenue at UKPIL, the parcels, letters and marketing business which provides the lion\u2019s share of Royal Mail\u2019s income. \u201cThis impacted UKPIL revenue despite a solid performance from UK parcels against a highly competitive backdrop,\u201d the firm said. Royal Mail also took a \u00a310m hit on the weakened value of sterling, which is down around 18% since the vote to leave the EU. Althought the weakness of the pound boosted its export income by \u00a320m in the nine-month period it was more than wiped out by a \u00a330m increase in terminal dues \u2013 fees paid by the Royal Mail to foreign postal services for processing letters sent from the UK. Overall revenues were flat, as increased parcels business \u2013 up 2% in volume and 3% in revenue \u2013 offset the decline in letters. Royal Mail noted that growth was fed in particular by the consumer parcels sector, which has been boosted by online shoppers ordering products for home delivery. Although the Royal Mail\u2019s shares fell 5% on the trading update, its shares are still nearly a pound higher than the \u00a33.30 price set by the government when it kicked off the privatisation of the postal service via a stock market float in 2013. The government was widely criticised for setting the price too low and allowing City of London investors to grab cheap stock, curbing the amount raised for the Exchequer. Since it was privatised, the Royal Mail has also announced cuts to workers\u2019 \u201csimply unaffordable\u201d pensions. The company pays around \u00a3400m a year into its \u201cdefined benefit\u201d scheme, which guarantees a pension based on a postal worker\u2019s average salary over his or her lifetime, rather than what happens on the stock market. But the company said financial market conditions had deteriorated so much that the cost of keeping the plan fully open would balloon to \u00a3900m over the next few years. Although the cuts were first mooted just before the EU referendum, historic lows in bond markets following the vote have made the pensions even less affordable to companies. The Communication Workers Union, which represents most of Royal Mail\u2019s workforce, has pledged to defend its members pension rights.",

In recent years, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron have all gone down a storm at the Glastonbury for global capitalism. Theresa May, aided by her chancellor Philip Hammond, had a much tougher time this year. They were the equivalent of a folk duo turning up at a heavy metal concert, faced with an audience that was one part apprehensive, one part indifferent and one part openly hostile.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs has suspended plans to move key operations from the US to London because of the uncertainty created by the vote to leave the EU. The Wall Street firm \u2013 in the midst of building a new \u00a3350m London headquarters \u2013 had been preparing to shift more of its global operations and IT activities from New York, but now appears to have embarked on a hiring freeze. The warning from Goldman came as other major City employers used the Davos summit in Switzerland to warn that jobs would have to be moved from London. HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, has reiterated that 1,000 roles will \u201cmove in about two years\u2019 time, when Brexit becomes effective\u201d, while the Swiss bank UBS has acknowledged that 1,000 of its 5,000 staff could shift, possibly to Frankfurt or Madrid. The Swiss bank is said to have held talks with the Spanish authorities about moving 300 roles to Madrid, although the finance ministry said it would not comment on private meetings. Jamie Dimon, boss of JP Morgan, which has already warned that 4,000 UK jobs are at risk, said on Wednesday: \u201cIt looks like there will be more job movement than we hoped for.\u201d Amid speculation about the number of jobs that Goldman could shift out of London, the bank\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, said New York was already proving the winner from the early Brexit fallout. \u201cOperating our business to maximise our global potential, we were trying to get as much into the UK as we could. So if a business needed to be done in the UK, it was always there,\u201d he said. He added that the UK time zone had always been a big advantage: \u201cYou wake up with Japan, you go to bed at the close in New York.\u201d \u201cWe were on track to move more and more of our global activities \u2013 global ops, global technology \u2013 all those things made and more sense to operate out of [the] UK. Now we are slowing down that decision,\u201d Blankfein told Bloomberg TV in Davos. Top bankers met Theresa May in Davos on Thursday and the prime minister told Bloomberg TV she wanted \u201cto ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London\u201d. Blankfein\u2019s remarks come amid speculation that the bank could shift half of its 6,000-strong workforce out of London, 1,000 of whom would be relocated to Frankfurt. A Goldman spokesman in London insisted no decision had yet been taken: \u201cWe continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote. There remain numerous uncertainties as to what the Brexit negotiations will yield in terms of an operating framework for the banking industry. As a result we have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\u201d The bank is continuing to press on with building its new nine-storey London HQ behind the two buildings it currently occupies, with the aim of moving in in about 2019. The bank has the option to take all the floors or sublet it to tenants. On the six-month anniversary of the referendum, Mark Boleat, policy chair of the City of London Corporation, warned that City firms were delaying investment decisions. \u201cImportant strategic business decisions are being delayed. Firms\u2019 nervousness can only be allayed if they know how they can continue running their business. A transitional arrangement should be agreed as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Brexit vote and the slump in sterling that followed the referendum has delivered a big boost to sales at luxury label Burberry \u2013 powered by overseas shoppers who have flocked to the UK to stock up on branded goods. The classic British label, famous for its beige check design, said sales in the UK surged by 40% in the final three months of 2016, boosted by strong demand for goods such as its buckle bags, which start at around \u00a3500 for a mini leather version and climb to \u00a38,000 for an alligator version. In central London, there was little sign of a mad scramble for these bags or any other Burberry merchandise outside the brand\u2019s Regent Street store. But a surge in luxury spending will never be as obvious as queuers battling for a Black Friday TV. The marbled flagship store of Britain\u2019s biggest luxury brand probably has at least four immaculately black-clad assistants for every shopper \u2013 but they insist they\u2019ve been rushed off their feet. While Burberry\u2019s formal statement to the City was coy about who exactly was behind the 40% uplift in UK sales, staff at its Regent Street store were far more forthcoming: it was all down to Chinese shoppers, they said. One reckons that about 70% of shoppers visiting the brand\u2019s flagship outlet are now tourists from China, a big surge in the last year. That\u2019s partly down to visa changes which now enable tourists to make multiple visits over two years \u2013 previously it was just six months. But its mostly down to the near 20% plunge in the value of the pound, which has brought bargain-hunters to upmarket British stores. Burberry is clearly catering for the lucrative Chinese market, with Mandarin-speaking shop assistants and windows touting \u201cGive the gift of Burberry this Lunar New Year\u201d aimed at tourists holidaying ahead of the Chinese new year on 28 January. One young Chinese tourist visiting with his parents said: \u201cWe\u2019re on holiday but we\u2019re taking a look at Burberry because it\u2019s cheaper here than at home. We might buy.\u201d Steve and Tuba Hancock, visiting from Australia, say they\u2019ve been taking a look at the handbags because of the bargains on offer: \u201cIn Sydney they\u2019re something like $1,000, whereas here they\u2019re more like $700 or even $500,\u201d says Steve. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper in England, plus we can get a tax refund when we leave the country,\u201d adds Tuba. Staff say regular shoppers are also contributing to Burberry\u2019s soaring UK sales. There are more personal shopping assistants to advise on wardrobe updates and special touches such as in-store monogramming for small items such as wallets and purses, which have contributed to a double-digit uplift in spend from returning customers. The cheapest item on offer is a \u00a314 nail varnish and the most frequently bought items are \u201ccharms\u201d for fixing to handbags or keys, including tiny teddies for \u00a3150 and sequinned hearts for \u00a3105. Burberry\u2019s trademark trenchcoat is about \u00a31,500, but shoppers looking for something a bit more upmarket need an appointment to view the most expensive item on sale, a \u00a328,000 alligator trench coat which is held in a safe behind the scenes, along with a matching handbag. Staff say they sold several over Christmas. Down the road in the Bond Street store the alligator trenches are out of stock, but they have one left in python \u2013 a snip at \u00a310,500, especially if you\u2019re buying in dollars. Elsewhere around the globe Burberry is doing better, after a difficult period last year. Revenue over the three months rose 4% on an underlying basis, when stripping out the impact of currency fluctuations, to \u00a3735m. Like-for-like sales across all regions rose 3%. Sales fell in the US and were weak in continental Europe, but the company did not provide specific figures. Business picked up in France and there was low single-digit growth in Asia Pacific, with improvement in mainland China and Hong Kong. George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cPlenty of customers are jumping on planes to the UK to take advantage of the extra buying power sterling\u2019s weakness gives them. All in all, there are plenty of encouraging signs for the group just now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has told the world\u2019s biggest companies they need to start paying their taxes and treat their workers more fairly in order to address the concerns of those who feel left behind by globalisation. In a keynote speech to the World Economic Forum, the prime minister said governments could not rely on international market forces to deliver prosperity for everyone and action was needed to address the \u201cdeeply felt sense of economic inequality that has emerged in recent years\u201d. May\u2019s warning that businesses needed to address the issue of executive pay and that market forces alone would not ensure the spread of prosperity to all ensured her first appearance in Davos was met with only lukewarm applause from her well-heeled audience. The prime minister said that \u201cacross Europe, parties of the far left and the far right\u201d were seeking to exploit the sense among people on modest incomes that globalisation was not working for them. \u201cI want to set out a manifesto for change that responds to these concerns and shows that the politics of the mainstream can deliver the change people need,\u201d May said. \u201cBecause talk of greater globalisation can make people fearful. For many, it means their jobs being outsourced and wages undercut. It means having to sit back as they watch their communities change around them.\u201d Following the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election, responding to growing populist pressures has been a feature of this year\u2019s Davos. May said both governments and business had to do more to address the concerns of those who felt that \u201cthose who prosper seem to play by a different set of rules\u201d. May said: \u201cIf you\u2019re just getting by, you don\u2019t want a government that gets out of the way, you want one that will help you.\u201d Business had to do more to spread the benefits of free trade and globalisation to more people. \u201cIt means playing by the same rules as everyone else when it comes to tax and behaviour,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause in the UK trust in business runs at just 35% among those in the lowest income brackets. And it means putting aside short-term considerations and investing in people and communities for the long term. \u201cIt means businesses paying their fair share of tax, recognising their obligations and duties to their employees and supply chains, and trading in the right way; companies genuinely investing in \u2013 and becoming part of \u2013 the communities and nations in which they operate, and abiding by the responsibilities that implies; and all of us taking steps towards addressing executive pay and accountability to shareholders.\u201d May said she rejected the prevailing orthodoxy that the best thing government could do was to get out of the way. Problems would not just solve themselves if business was left to get on with the job. Outlining the government\u2019s rationale for a more interventionist approach, she said: \u201cOur strategy is not about propping up failing industries or picking winners, but creating the conditions where winners can emerge and grow. It is about backing those winners all the way to encourage them to invest in the long-term future of Britain.\u201d May said her aim was to deliver jobs and economic growth to every community and corner of the country. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave all this to international market forces alone, or just rely on an increase in overall prosperity. \u201cInstead, we have to be practical and proactive \u2013 in other words, we have to step up and take control \u2013 to ensure free trade and globalisation work for everyone.\u201d Two days after outlining her approach to Brexit, the prime minister adopted an emollient tone towards Britain\u2019s EU partners, saying that it was \u201coverwhelmingly and compellingly\u201d in Britain\u2019s interests for Europe to succeed. She said Britain had voted with \u201cdetermination and quiet resolve\u201d to leave the EU. \u201cLet us not underestimate the magnitude of that decision,\u201d she said. \u201cBritain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country\u2019s children, and grandchildren too. \u201cWe are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.\u201d She said Britain was a racially diverse nation, welcomed inward investment and played a leading role in the UN and other global institutions. \u201cBy instinct we are a great trading nation,\u201d May said. \u201cWe seek the freedom to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world.\u201d The prime minister said talks had already started with Australia, New Zealand and India. But Sir Angus Deaton, the Scottish-born Nobel prize winner, said he was surprised that May didn\u2019t talk about the customs union, in which EU member states currently impose the same import duties, with no tariffs between them. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal. Free trade and custom unions are not the same thing, and I think that will hurt Britain,\u201d Deaton said. \u201cSo I haven\u2019t changed my expectation that in the long run Britain would be a lot better off in the EU than out.\u201d The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the UK must ensure \u201cprivileged access\u201d to the single market after it leaves the EU. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a recognition that so-called hard Brexit benefits no one, in relation to London, the UK, or Europe,\u201d said Khan, who has been meeting business leaders and politicians in Davos. \u201cBusinesses that leave London aren\u2019t going to Paris, Brussels, Madrid, or Frankfurt, they\u2019re going to New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\u201d Dr Paul Sheard, chief global economist at Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, says May was making a pitch for Britain to be the \u2018lead supporting voice for globalisation\u2019. \u201cA lot of people have seen Brexit as anti-globalisation, a return to nationalism. She\u2019s pivoting to saying \u2018no, this is about Britain being very global\u2019,\u201d Sheard said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s housing market cooled in December as sales activity fell and estate agents were less optimistic about prospects in the coming months. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the market \u201cstuttered\u201d at the end of 2016 and had gotten off to a slow start in 2017. \u201cIt remains to be seen if this is a temporary setback,\u201d Rics said. \u201cThe number of house sales in the UK faltered in December, and predictions for expected new sales over the next three months were also pared back.\u201d A net balance of 1% of surveyors reported a fall rather than a rise in sales last month, ending a run of rises since August. There was also a sharp decrease in the number of surveyors expecting sales to increase over the next three months, to a net balance of 4%, down from 18% previously. Wales, the south-west and the north-west were the exceptions, with sales increasing last month. Despite a dip in activity across most of the UK, house prices continued to rise, but at a slower pace. The headline balance of surveyors reporting a rise fell to 24% from 29%. \u201cAlthough this suggests prices are still rising firmly, the latest figure does end a run of four successive months of higher house price balances,\u201d Rics said. Central London was the only area where prices fell, extending the run of falls to 10 months. The strongest price growth was in the north-west. Figures published last month by mortgage lender Nationwide showed London house prices in 2016 grew at a slower rate than the national average for the first time in eight years. Rics said: \u201cWith regards to the outlook, near-term price expectations softened for the second consecutive report, suggesting immediate price expectations may be easing slightly given slower demand growth.\u201d Over 2017 as whole, surveyors expect house prices to rise, including those in central London. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, said: \u201cThe latest survey provides further evidence that both price and rent pressures are continuing to spread from the more highly valued to more modestly valued parts of the market for good or ill.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The leadership of Rolls-Royce knew in 2010 about allegations regarding corruption within the company but decided not to notify the Serious Fraud Office, according to the damning judgment on the scandal from Lord Justice Leveson. The verdict raises questions for the board of directors at the time about the extent of their knowledge of irregular activities and why no action was taken. One major City investor said the charges and fine against Rolls raise further issues about corporate governance in Britain, a topic that is already being investigated by a Commons select committee. The investor said the scandal inside the UK\u2019s most respected engineering business created a \u201cstudy of fundamental flaws in UK corporate governance. Those responsible walk away into the sunset, leaving everyone else to pick up the pieces.\u201d The Rolls board has changed significantly since 2010. The judge stated that he had been \u201cinformed (and accept) that no current member of the board was involved in any of the conduct described in the statement of facts\u201d and that there had been \u201ccultural change\u201d at the FTSE 100 engineering group. But the board in 2010 contained some heavyweight City figures alongside the management team led by then chief executive Sir John Rose, who retired the following year, and Andrew Shilston, then finance director, who is now the senior independent non-executive director at BP. The other directors included: Sir Simon Robertson Chairman of Rolls-Royce from 2005 to 2013 and the former deputy chairman of HSBC. Robertson is an investment banker who was managing director of Goldman Sachs International and chair of UK-based investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. He now leads his own advisory firm, Simon Robertson Associates, as well as holding a string of other external positions, including honorary director of the Royal Opera House. He declined to comment about the corruption scandal and why information was not passed to the SFO in 2010. Iain Conn The chief executive of Centrica, owner of British Gas, was the senior independent director at Rolls in 2010 and was on the board from 2005 to 2014. When asked by the Guardian at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday what he was told in 2010, Conn said: \u201cI\u2019m not an officer of the company. I can\u2019t speak for the company. You\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d Peter Byrom Non-executive director of Rolls from 1997 to 2013 as well as a member of its ethics committee. Another investment banker, he was a director at Rothschild for nearly 20 years before joining the board of engineering group Amec and Domino Printing Sciences. Byrom could not be reached for comment. Dame Helen Alexander Former president of the CBI, the biggest business trade body in Britain, and a former director at some of the country\u2019s most high-profile companies, including BT and Centrica. Alexander was a member of the Rolls ethics committee in 2010 and left the company last May. She declined to comment. Sir Peter Gregson Held a string of senior positions at British universities and is now chief executive and vice-chancellor of Cranfield University. A board member at Rolls from 2007 to 2012. He declined to comment. John McAdam Still on the board of Rolls after joining nine years ago. McAdam is chairman of United Utilities, the energy group, and the pest control firm Rentokil Initial. McAdam declined to comment, but the statements from the judgment suggest that as an existing director he has been absolved of any blame. John Neill The brains behind car parts group Unipart for 40 years. Neill took over as a 29-year-old and is today chairman and chief executive. On the board of Rolls from 2008 to 2015. He declined to comment. John Rishton A non-executive of Rolls in 2010 after joining in 2007, he replaced Rose as chief executive in 2011. As CEO, Rishton reported the allegations of corruption within the company to the SFO. He left the company in 2015 as its financial performance deteriorated. Now non-executive director at leading UK companies Unilever, Serco and Informa. He declined to comment. Ian Strachan Chairman of the ethics committee at Rolls in 2010. Strachan, a veteran of the mining and energy industries, was on the board for a decade until departing in 2014. He could not be reached for comment. International advisory board As well as a standard board of directors, Rolls also had a panel that advised the company on \u201cemerging political, business and economic trends\u201d. Members of the panel included Lord Powell, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher and John Major; the former president of Brazil Fernando Henrique Cardoso; Sir Rod Eddington, who used to run British Airways; General Sir Mike Jackson, a former chief of general staff for the Ministry of Defence; and Ratan Tata, then the chairman of Tata Sons, owner of Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel.",
