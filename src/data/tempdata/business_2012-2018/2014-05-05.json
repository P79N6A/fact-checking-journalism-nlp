      "bodyText": "The government must urgently establish a strategic authority to oversee the future growth of Britain's ageing energy infrastructure, a study argues on Tuesday . Academics at Newcastle University challenge the government's market-based approach, saying the \u00a3100bn needed to secure energy security is not being delivered by a fragmented system that lacks central direction. The academics, led by Prof Phil Taylor, argue that the country needs a \"systems architect\" and that energy, at least for the bulk of the population, is too cheap, which is leading to waste. While the Labour party has already said it wants an energy security board, one leading figure in the industry has said that Taylor was highlighting that \"nobody is in charge\" of the country's energy policy. Before Tuesday's launch of the university's latest energy briefing note, Taylor, who leads its Institute for Research on Sustainability, said: \"The current pricing model does not accurately reflect the high economic and environmental cost of generating, storing and distributing energy. In fact, because of the way energy is sold today, it becomes cheaper the more we use. This is unsustainable. \"Although we must make sure people can afford to heat their homes, for the majority of us energy is actually too cheap \u2013 this is why we leave lights on, keep appliances running and use machines at peak times when energy costs more.\" The research paper describes the energy system as fragmented and, while it does not mention the role of the National Grid, which looks after the pipes and pylons, makes clear there needs to be a new body above that, but below government, which can oversee planning and development. It also wants the government to help find ways to store low carbon energy efficiently and effectively in times of high supply so it can be released during periods of high demand, or to keep the lights on after storms have damaged the power network. The academics call on ministers to work with the energy industry to fundamentally change the way energy is priced. The briefing note says: \"Energy providers should be rewarded for providing tools and techniques that help customers use energy efficiently and cost-effectively.\" The leading industry figure, who asked not to be named, said: \"This is all very sensitive. The assumption has been that the government and the National Grid are in charge but they don't provide solutions, just a framework for the market to decide. That has only produced multiple policies and regulatory intrusion. We cannot go on this way.\" The industrialist said a systems architect could perform functions similar to those of a strategic rail authority or even the Bank of England, but that there was no reason why this could not be done by the private sector. The body would need to involve commercial, technical and environmental experts as well, perhaps, as social scientists. Meanwhile, the university paper believes too much of the debate within Westminster has focused on issues of affordability and emissions reduction while ignoring other vital issues such as the energy sector's use of water. \"This thinking risks locking the UK into a future in which water availability could put energy security at risk, and power stations could be forced to reduce production or even shut down if there isn't sufficient water available to keep them safely operational.\" These kinds of arguments are increasingly being raised in different forms around the industry. A group of energy experts set up by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) warned before Christmas that \"whole system\" thinking was needed for the power grid to ensure the lights stayed on in Britain.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The controversial takeover of AstraZeneca by US drugs group Pfizer is to be investigated by MPs, who are being urged to take evidence from their chiefs amid fears the \u00a363bn transaction could threaten the future health of the UK's science base. The inquiry comes as the AstraZeneca board faced fresh pressure from Pfizer boss Ian Read who told Wall Street that its proposal was a \"compelling offer\" that offered shareholders in the British company the chance to \"trade up\" and own a piece of a bigger company with better prospects. Andrew Miller, the Labour MP who chairs the science and technology select committee, said he had decided to launch an investigation after senior industry figures had contacted him over the long weekend to express their concerns about the deal and confirmed he would be calling expert witnesses from both companies to give evidence at next week's hearing. \"Very serious players in the sector have privately expressed their serious concerns to me about this proposition,\" he said. \"The bean-counters are debating the commercial value of this business but we are interested in the science base and the R&amp;D [research and development] undertaken in the UK.\" On Friday, AstraZeneca rejected a \u00a350-a-share offer that included \u00a315.98 in cash, which was slightly higher than Pfizer's opening gambit. Read told analysts he was disappointed with the response, and that the board was \"considering all options on how we progress these discussions\". Amid speculation that Pifzer \u2013 best known for its drug Viagra \u2013 could go hostile to win control, Read said: \"We \u2026 believe it is in the best interests of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders that we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction that can be recommended by both our boards.\" There are also concerns that Pfizer's main motivation is to use the deal to move its tax domicile to the UK, where the corporation tax rate is falling to 20% in 2015 compared with a US rate of up to 40%. Read told analysts the deal was an opportunity to \"get our tax rate down\". The takeover, which would be the biggest ever by a foreign company, has sparked a furious debate with politicians, stakeholders and captains of industry increasingly divided on its merits. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the business select committee, last week called for an investigation, fearing the tie-up \"could threaten the UK's strategic interests\". Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, wrote to Miller on Monday to urge him to call Read and AstraZeneca's boss, Pascal Soriot, to give evidence at the 14 May hearing. Read was in London for two days last week in a charm offensive designed to get AstraZeneca shareholders and UK government ministers on side. \"AstraZeneca is one of the UK's most significant investors in R&amp;D and a major contributor to our science base,\" said Umunna. \"There is a strong national economic interest in this issue.\" Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of the Royal Institution and former chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, waded into the row on Monday, writing in the Financial Times that the ownership of AstraZeneca was \"irrelevant\". \"In essence it does not matter where a global company's headquarters are,\" he wrote. \"What is really important is that Britain encourages these companies to do their drug discovery and development work here.\" Other figures in science and business, such as John LaMattina, Pfizer's former president of global R&amp;D, and the former science minister Lord Sainsbury, have been more circumspect about the potential impact on the UK's science base with growing calls for a tougher public interest test ahead of takeovers of important businesses. Pfizer has until 26 May under UK takeover rules to persuade AstraZeneca to enter talks or, if it fails, to make a hostile bid or walk away. AstraZeneca, the country's second-biggest pharmaceutical company after GlaxoSmithKline, employs 6,700 people in the UK. Three years ago, Pfizer closed its world-renowned research laboratory in Sandwich, Kent, triggering more than 1,500 job losses. Read promised prime minister David Cameron last week \"significant undertakings on research, jobs and investment\", and said \"key scientific leadership\" would continue to be based in the UK, but Miller said its actions in Kent had \"created a confidence gap to say the least\" in the science community. Analysts say Pfizer wants to get its hands on AstraZeneca's healthy pipeline of new drugs as it loses revenue from its older products. Read has been praised for his cost-cutting prowess but that can only go so far when sales are falling. First quarter sales, published on Monday, were down 9% at $11.4bn (\u00a36.8bn) as blockbusters such as Lipitor, the cholesterol drug, and Viagra face competition from cheaper generic alternatives.",

      "bodyText": "The European commission has insisted the risk of deflation in the eurozone is very low, even as officials cut forecasts for rises in prices and trimmed expectations for economic growth next year. Launching its spring 2014 forecasts, the commission outlined UK growth predictions that Howard Archer, chief UK And European economist at IHS Global Insight, said would make it the \"strongest expanding major west European economy in both years\". The eurozone is forecast to grow by 1.2% this year, the commission said, revising its 2015 forecast down by 0.1 percentage point to 1.7%. The UK forecasts were for 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively. But as Siim Kallas, the European commission's vice-president, declared that \"the recovery has now taken hold\" across the EU, questions were being raised about the impact of further falls in prices across the eurozone. The commission's inflation predictions expect prices in 2014 to rise even more slowly \u2013 by 0.8%, compared with 1% three months ago. Price growth was 1.3% in 2013, well below the 2% desired by the European Central Bank. The forecasts were released before the ECB's meeting on 8 May. Economists polled by Reuters are not expecting the central bank to change its policies toward economies growing more slowly than those outside the eurozone. Despite cutting its predictions for inflation, the commission said the probability of deflation was very low. Archer said: \"While the ECB currently regards the risk of generalised deflation across the eurozone as limited and sees no evidence that consumers are delaying purchases in anticipation of falling prices, the bank is seriously concerned that prolonged very low inflation will destabilise medium-term inflation expectations, thereby making it harder and longer to get consumer price inflation back to its target rate of 'close to, but just below 2.0%'.\" The EU came out of recession a year ago, but Kallas said more structural reforms were needed for the recovery to remain in place after Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus needed bailouts. \"The recovery is gaining traction, Kallas was quoted as saying. \"Importantly, the employment situation has started improving.\" Eurozone unemployment was 12% last year. The commission is forecasting a drop to 11.8%, despite previously expecting unemployment to remain at 12%. The UK has been growing faster than the EU average. Despite this, Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, criticised the coalition government's austerity measures and its Help to Buy programme for the housing market. \"The stated goal of the austerity drive was to improve Britain's confidence as a sovereign borrower,\" Summers wrote in the Financial Times. \"Yet there is a basic fact that guaranteeing mortgages en masse is creating a huge potential government liability, as do other loan guarantee programmes.\"",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s competition watchdog has launched federal court action against Coles, accusing the supermarket giant of engaging in \u201cunconscionable conduct\u201d towards 200 small suppliers. Coles faces allegations it used unfair tactics to pressure suppliers to agree to make ongoing payments to the company in return for purported benefits from changes to purchasing decisions. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said Coles aimed to obtain $16m in such \u201crebates\u201d from smaller suppliers. The rebate program was based on changes the supermarket had made to its supply chain which purportedly benefited suppliers. The rebate was to be calculated based on the value to the supplier of being able to access the Coles supplier portal and improvements to ordering patterns. The ACCC said it would allege that in relation to 200 of its smaller suppliers, Coles required agreement by the supplier to the rebate within a matter of days. \u201cIf these suppliers declined to agree to pay the rebate, Coles personnel were allegedly instructed to escalate the matter to more senior staff, and to threaten commercial consequences if the supplier did not agree,\u201d the ACCC said in a statement announcing the federal court proceedings on Monday. \u201cThe ACCC alleges that, in a number of cases, threats were made when suppliers declined to agree to pay the rebate.\u201d Coles vowed to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself against the ACCC\u2019s allegations. The competition watchdog accused Coles of breaching Australian consumer law by providing misleading information to suppliers about the value of the changes Coles had made and using undue influence and unfair tactics to obtain payments. It alleged Coles had taken advantage of its superior bargaining position by \u201cseeking payments when it had no legitimate basis for seeking them\u201d and requiring agreements without giving suppliers sufficient time to assess the benefits. The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said the alleged conduct was capable of causing significant detriment to small suppliers\u2019 businesses. \u201cIf this conduct is established in court, the ACCC expects that the community will share the ACCC\u2019s view that business should not be conducted in this way in Australia,\u201d he said. The ACCC, which continues a broader investigation into major supermarket chains\u2019 treatment of suppliers, said it would seek pecuniary penalties, declarations, injunctions and costs. In a statement, Coles said it was \u201ctotally committed\u201d to negotiating fairly and working collaboratively with suppliers. \u201cThe ACCC legal action concerns a detailed supply chain program implemented by Coles over two years ago as a part of its strategy to develop a more efficient and internationally competitive supply chain,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe project involved improvements to both supply chain collaboration and efficiencies in logistics.

Its recommendations start from a premise that the Australia which has become<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/apr/21/australia-has-it-pretty-damn-good-so-why-arent-we-cheering\"> the envy of the world</a> needs to be drastically changed.

The entire document lacks much coherence. Recommendations are made with little care for their impact on other areas. They also stray into areas like the minimum wage, which have nothing to do with the budget.</p> <p>It suggests governments should protect the \u201ctruly disadvantaged\u201d and then proceeds to suggest cuts to Newstart, NDIS, carers allowances, foreign aid, the pension, homeless funding and students.</p> <p>Perhaps we should ignore it \u2013 and realise its purpose is just to soften us up for the budget. In the past, sensible people in the government and their media cheerleaders would have put it quickly to one side. But such sense is thin on the ground these days. The softening up is not just for the budget, but to shift to the right what is considered a \u201cneutral\u201d position.</p> <p>Take the proposed $15 fee for GP visits. The budget will likely introduce just a $6 charge.

      "bodyText": "The Commission of Audit is a rare example of a government attaching itself to a document that appears to hate Australia. Its recommendations start from a premise that the Australia which has become the envy of the world needs to be drastically changed. Notions of equality and fairness which have underpinned our health, education and welfare systems would be replaced with a view that efficiency trumps all. Its few recommendations that affect revenue would pit states against each other with an ultimate aim of further reducing tax revenue in the hope that there will need to be more cuts to services similar to what has happened in the US over the past 30 years. It is like the authors caught a few episodes of The Wire and thought, \u201cif only\u201d. Such drastic changes to our social and economic way of life would perhaps not be so bad if it wasn\u2019t recommended in such a silly way as in the Commission of Audit report. The entire document lacks much coherence. Recommendations are made with little care for their impact on other areas. They also stray into areas like the minimum wage, which have nothing to do with the budget. It suggests governments should protect the \u201ctruly disadvantaged\u201d and then proceeds to suggest cuts to Newstart, NDIS, carers allowances, foreign aid, the pension, homeless funding and students. Perhaps we should ignore it \u2013 and realise its purpose is just to soften us up for the budget. In the past, sensible people in the government and their media cheerleaders would have put it quickly to one side. But such sense is thin on the ground these days. The softening up is not just for the budget, but to shift to the right what is considered a \u201cneutral\u201d position. Take the proposed $15 fee for GP visits. The budget will likely introduce just a $6 charge. Both are poor policies \u2013 one just seems less radical. The GP fee is a classic case of what happens when economists think they know everything. Economists love price signals. They are very effective at changing behaviour, and when used in health policy (such as with cigarettes) they can change behaviour for the good. But people are very poor judges of why we should go to the GP, and fewer visits to the GP will not make for a healthier Australia.

He just thought it must be because people got it for \u201cfree\u201d. Ideology over evidence. The commission in a nutshell. Similarly, its view that private health insurance is a more efficient way to insure health owes much to ideology and little to evidence. It charts a way towards a more American style of private insurance dominated health. Anyone recommending our health system follows the US really should not cut paper without supervision, let alone give advice on how to cut the budget. Bloomberg in 2013 rated our health system the seventh most efficient in the world; the US came 46th. Clearly we\u2019re the ones who need to drastically change. Last year I noted the richest 20% of 60-year-olds can expect to live two years longer than the poorest 20%. In the US, the gap is four years between the richest 50% to the poorest 50%, meaning the gap between the most extreme 20% would be even larger. The inequality of the US health system is so bad that since 1977 life expectancy for 65-year-olds in the richest half has risen by six years, whereas for the poorest half it rose a mere 15 months.

Moreover, while the percentage of young people on the minimum wage is greater than those who earn above that rate, it\u2019s worth noting that most workers on minimum wage are over 25: I guess we should also envy the high levels of working poor in the US: A US family on median income in 2012 actually earned less than it did in 1989, while its middle class as a whole has shrunk.
