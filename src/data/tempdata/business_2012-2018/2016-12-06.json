      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has confirmed the sale of its travel division to Thomas Cook, its joint venture partner, securing an \u00a382m windfall. Fellow mutual Central England Co-operative will receive \u00a35.8m for its 3.5% stake in the venture under a deal agreed six years ago. The Co-op group will receive \u00a350m for its 30% stake in the business by November next year and \u00a332m in dividends in two payments between January and April next year. The mutual has already received \u00a35m of \u00a337m in dividends that it was originally promised between October and December this year. It plans to spend the cash on its revival plans including revamping grocery stores and improving its membership scheme The anticipated windfall comes at a useful time for the group, which is halfway through a three-year turnaround programme after its bank came close to collapse in 2013, threatening the existence of the entire group. Pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a317m in the first six months of 2016 after restructuring costs and price cuts amid a competitive grocery market. Rod Bulmer, chief executive of consumer services at the Co-op, said: \u201cWe have enjoyed a successful partnership with Thomas Cook through the joint venture. Going forward, having a minority stake in a travel business does not fit with the strategy of the Co-op.\u201d Thomas Cook said it would take full control of the venture\u2019s 764 high street travel agencies next November. Some of the stores are branded Thomas Cook and some Co-operative Travel. The travel group said it would all now move under its banner. It has the right to use the Co-op brand until November 2018 but even after that point the Co-op Travel brand will not completely disappear from the high street. There are dozens of travel agencies run by regional co-operative groups around the country which are still entitled to use the name. Central England Co-operative operates 20 travel outlets which are not included in the joint venture with Thomas Cook, and these will continue to operate.",

      "bodyText": "Read the spread betting firms\u2019 responses to the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s proposed clampdown and you\u2019ll notice an absence of outrage. The firms didn\u2019t squeal that a heavy-handed regulator is treading on ground it doesn\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t protest that their clients are all financial sophisticates who have a deep appreciation of the perils that can lurk within leveraged products like contracts for difference. Instead, there was acceptance that cooperation was the only credible stance to adopt, even when the FCA had just caused share prices across the sector to crash by more than a third. The spread betting firms knew this moment was coming. Sooner or later, even a half-awake regulator was bound to notice that it was a bad idea to allow retail customers to risk their wealth by playing at being old-style proprietary traders at an investment bank. The firms are probably amazed their winning run has lasted so long. Authorities in the US introduced caps on leverage half a decade ago because they could see that an inexperienced retail punter wishing to trade, say, currencies on a 200 times leverage ratio plainly doesn\u2019t understand the risks. To put it in hard numbers, 200 times leverage means that a customer can put up cash collateral of \u00a31,000 and trade a currency pair worth \u00a3200,000. It sounds appealing until the losses arrive, as they usually do in volatile markets populated by hardened professionals. The FCA says 82% of clients lose money on contracts for difference. The statistic has been an open secret for years. The high loss ratio is the reason why the industry is so addicted to celebrity endorsements and high-profile sports sponsorships \u2013 it is constantly in need of fresh mugs. The FCA\u2019s remedies are sensible. Yes, of course, we must all have the freedom to risk our shirts on derivative financial instruments if we really wish. But it is right that the regulator should make the process harder. Many of us would regard the proposed new leverage limit of 25 times for inexperienced clients, and 50 times for everybody else, as still racy, but it would be an improvement on the current set-up. Risk warnings and disclosure of profit-loss ratios are just common sense add-ons. Foreign operators, it should be noted, will still be able to offer whatever leverage they like to UK customers. That is a shortcoming in the reforms but maybe, as the FCA suggests, banning such firms from advertising their offers in the UK will be a practical remedy. The real question is why it took the FCA so long to act. The answer is that it has been fiddling around ineffectually for years with warning letters, firm-specific interventions and attempts at pan-European harmonisation. A straightforward cap on leverage, as the US understood, was always a better solution. A few European countries have already moved in that direction; others will probably follow the UK\u2019s example. Well played, Andrew Bailey, new boss at the FCA, for arriving at the obvious conclusion that escaped his predecessors. Drax diversification could fuel brighter future You know Drax: it\u2019s the company that burns coal in a large power station in North Yorkshire while getting with the low carbon programme by converting to biomass. It has been an unstable existence, to put it mildly. Coal-fired producers are at the mercy of commodity markets. Meanwhile, biomass, or wood pellets, are not everybody\u2019s idea of green energy and a chancellor can change the subsidy regime overnight, as George Osborne did in his 2015 budget, doing serious damage to Drax\u2019s share price. But here comes new Drax, in pursuit of diversification. The company proposes paying \u00a3340m to buy Opus Energy, a supply business serving small- and medium-sized businesses. It will also get into the gas turbine game by acquiring four development projects that could each cost \u00a380m to \u00a3100m to build. These would be heavy outlays for a company with a stock market value of \u00a31.3bn, but you can understand why the shares rose 12%. Drax is attempting to gain control of its own destiny and both new adventures should be low risk, at least compared with the current assets. Opus, even if not obviously cheap at 10 times earnings, is a growing company and Drax already owns a supply business. Gas-fired turbines are a sound long-term bet as the UK\u2019s energy mix shifts towards solar and wind, creating a need for capacity that can fill the gaps in generation. Drax\u2019s variety \u2013 gas plants that can switch from idle to full speed in 10 minutes \u2013 may not succeed in the next round of capacity auctions, but they should be needed one day. There is just one potential pitfall: the Opus purchase depends on Drax winning EU state aid approval for subsidies to burn more wood pellets. In short, Drax can\u2019t afford Opus without the subsidy. Drax\u2019s chief executive, Dorothy Thompson, is confident of a thumbs up. If she\u2019s right, the \u201cretooling for a post-coal future\u201d deserves applause. Drax would look less like a hard-luck story and more like a solid business again. Sorrell\u2019s pay: defending the indefensible Defending Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s \u00a370m pay package is not easy, but Sir John Hood, chair of WPP\u2019s remuneration committee, could surely do better than pleading that the fixed salary component is just like any other chief executive\u2019s. Come on, Sir John, inviting us to look at the \u00a31m is ridiculous when it\u2019s the \u00a369m that causes the outside world to think boardroom pay is out of control.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is being forced to justify if the \u00a3400m it has set aside to compensate small business customers will be large enough to meet the claims from those who argue they have been mistreated by the bailed-out bank. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, has asked the 73% taxpayer-owned bank if the \u00a3400m is an underestimation of the cost of compensating customers of its defunct global restructuring group (GRG). In a letter to the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, Tyrie said campaigners had asked for the bank to pay out \u00a32bn in compensation. Tyrie wrote to McEwan \u2013 and Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 after last month\u2019s move by RBS to apologise to small business customers and pledge to issue them with refunds of fees and allow them to make fresh complaints about their treatment between 2008 and 2013. At the time RBS said it expected to spend \u00a3400m on the process, which has followed three years of campaigning by customers. The issue with GRG first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Tyrie set out a series of questions for McEwan which included providing details of the timescale for the payouts and information about whether firms which went into liquidation would receive payments. The MP also asked Bailey when the regulator would publish its findings into GRG. The report \u2013 known as a section 166 report \u2013 is long delayed and may not be published in full until the individuals mentioned have been able to review it, in a process known as \u201cMaxwellisation\u201d. In his letter to Bailey (pdf), Tyrie also asked for the Treasury select committee to receive the agreement between RBS and the FCA about the redress scheme. \u201cThis should include any application made by RBS to the FCA for approval of the new review complaints procedure,\u201d the letter said. As he published his correspondence, Tyrie said: \u201cMore detail on the design of the scheme is needed. This could give affected businesses more confidence that they will obtain reasonable compensation. The regulator should publish its full report into GRG as soon as possible.\u201d Both RBS and the FCA said they would respond to Tyrie in due course. RBS shares closed up almost 6% at 209p \u2013 still below the 502p average price taxpayers paid for the stake during 2008 and 2009.",

      "bodyText": "Plans by leading Italian banks to raise billions of euros from investors to boost their financial strength have been damaged by the outcome of Sunday\u2019s referendum, a leading ratings agency said on Tuesday as it downgraded its outlook for the sector. Fitch \u2013 which said it had a negative outlook on the Italian banking industry for 2017 \u2013 said profitability in the sector was already frail before the referendum result that sparked political chaos and forced the resignation of the prime minister, Matteo Renzi. \u201cThe referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) and UniCredit, and have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector\u2019s ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further,\u201d Fitch said. The ratings agency delivered its verdict on the sector, which is weighed down with \u20ac360bn (\u00a3304bn) of bad debts amid attempts to find investors to inject up to \u20ac5bn into MPS, the world\u2019s oldest bank. Senior officials from MPS, which was the weakest of the 51 subjected to stress tests by regulators earlier this year, were in Frankfurt to meet executives from the European Central Bank ahead of an end-of-year deadline to boost its financial health. But expectations that the government will step in boosted sentiment, with the index of Italian banking stocks jumping 9% and pushing bank shares across Europe higher. Shares in MPS were briefly suspended after falling 5% before ending up 1%. Shares in Unicredit, which has been expected to launch a \u20ac12bn cash call next week, rose 13%. Renzi\u2019s resignation has been temporarily frozen by the president, Sergio Mattarella, until the senate passes a budget, perhaps on Wednesday, when a new prime minister from his Democratic party is expected to take over until elections are held. The referendum, which rejected constitutional reforms favoured by Renzi, was held at a crucial time for the fresh injection of funds into MPS, where the US bank JP Morgan is helping to broker a plan to attract investors to buy its shares. Tomas Kinmonth, fixed income strategist at ABN Amro, said a \u20ac1bn complex debt structuring completed on Tuesday \u201cwill assist in the capitalisation of the struggling Italian bank\u201d. \u201cThis is a crucial step, and perhaps enough to tempt the equity consortium to help rescue the bank,\u201d said Kinmonth. The Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 the gulf state\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 is among the investors that MPS has hoped to convince to participate in the cash call. But the political uncertainty may deter such a private sector rescue and Italy is said to be preparing a package of measures under a \u201cprecautionary bailout\u201d. Some \u20ac2bn of debt is held by private investors who would be required to take losses under new EU rules. According to reports, however, a plan is being devised under which the first \u20ac100,000 of their investment could be protected, as would be case if they were depositors with the bank.",

      "bodyText": "When Mark Carney insisted in a speech at Liverpool John Moores University that the conditions through which we are now living are \u201cexactly the same\u201d as those that British citizens endured during the \u201clost decade\u201d of the 1860s, he was taking a bit of rhetorical licence. The past is never simply the present dressed up in funny clothes, and the analogy between today\u2019s painful realities and those of 150 years ago doesn\u2019t quite hold. And yet, the governor of the Bank of England had a point. When Overend Gurney collapsed in 1866, it undid once and for all the sense that, give or take a few individual misfortunes, capitalism was a moral force that rewarded skill and hard work. Toppling under a mountain of unsecured debt, the joint stock bank dragged down 200 businesses and a broad tranche of private investors with it, from courtiers to grocers. As with the Northern Rock crisis in 2007, there were queues of panicky investors lining the streets. More profoundly, now came a dawning realisation that bad things could happen to good people. Thanks to the publication of Charles Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species in 1859, the universe increasingly seemed not only godless but, what was perhaps even worse, indifferent to the sufferings of ordinary folk. The shock of 1866 was doubly hard because, for the previous 15 years, Britain had been sailing on a sea of prosperity and confidence. In 1851, the Great Exhibition had showcased the nation\u2019s position as \u201cthe workshop of the world\u201d, the great exporter of industrial goods and technological know-how to the four corners of the globe. Business was thriving, the social discontent of the \u201chungry\u201d 1840s had receded, and this was, to use the coinage of the historian WL Burn, the \u201cage of equipoise\u201d, a serene and sunny upland of prosperity and social cohesion. Increasingly, though, there were worrying signs that Britain could not hold on to its trading pre-eminence for much longer. Germany and the United States were playing industrial catch-up, and would soon be making everything from saucepans to spanners more cheaply and better than we ever could. What\u2019s more, with global transport systems stretching further as each year passed, Britain\u2019s grain, and even its dairy and meat produce, would soon be supplied from as far away as Australia and Canada. Domestic farming was about to go into a decline from which, some historians suggest, it has never recovered. This sense that 1860s Britain had entered a post-industrial landscape of environmental exhaustion and terminal moral decay was there in the literature too. Charles Dickens\u2019 Our Mutual Friend (1864-5) tells the story of \u201cthe golden dustman\u201d, Mr Boffin, who has amassed a great fortune from the heaps of refuse that now ring London\u2019s smarter residential areas. Inside those houses, meanwhile, families such as Mr and Mrs Veneering do nothing but surround themselves with the shiny surfaces of their brand new furniture, as if setting the scene for an endless series of selfies. If the economic underpinnings of Britain\u2019s \u201cequipoise\u201d were under strain in the 1860s, then so too was its political status quo. Everywhere, working men were campaigning for the vote. The problem was that no one knew how all those Manchester factory hands and Barrow steelworkers would behave at the ballot box. Their economic interests and cultural ambitions lay so far from those of the metropolitan elite that, according to the prime minister Lord Derby, the 1867 reform bill, extending the franchise to working-class men, would be nothing less than \u201ca leap in the dark\u201d. Yet far from swinging Britain wildly towards radical liberalism, which had been the terror, the effect was to strengthen popular Conservatism. Still, if Carney is serious about his comparison between us and the people of 1860s, he might want to delve deeper and find some reasons to be cheerful. The 1860s, after all, saw the beginning of a new wave of feminism. Bank failures such as Overend Gurney had left women more financially vulnerable than ever: with professional men going down like ninepins, their wives and daughters needed new ways to take care of themselves. Initiatives in education meant that young women were finding new ways of entering the skilled employment market as clerks and commercial artists as well as qualified teachers. In 1870, the Married Women\u2019s Property Act allowed women to hang on to their own financial resources rather than see them pass to their husband to squander. There had even been a serious suggestion that the 1867 reform bill should extend the vote to women on the same terms as men. The fact that this didn\u2019t come to pass for another 50 years makes you realise that, within the detritus of that first \u201clost\u201d decade, were the seedlings of important new beginnings. Kathryn Hughes Were the 1860s really a \u2018lost decade\u2019? When economists refer to a lost decade, they are usually counting each year\u2019s growth and concluding that 10 years of effort have left the country pretty much where it started. Mark Carney meant something slightly different when he used the phrase to refer to the years since the collapse of Northern Rock in 2008. The Bank of England governor was pointing more specifically to wage growth \u2013 not the stagnation of all activity in the economy as a whole, measured by gross domestic product (GDP). On that measure, the comparison with the 1860s is correct. A graph documenting the last 150 years shows that wages slumped around 1860 before recovering to leave workers no better off by 1870. But the similarities stop there, as Threadneedle Street points out in its own history [PDF] of the troubles that befell the largest and most famous discount broker in Britain at the time. Overend Gurney, which collapsed with huge debts in 1866, was an isolated case. Or as the Bank puts it: \u201cThe idiosyncratic failure of a bank \u2026 rather than a systemic crisis with a common cause.\u201d It was allowed to go bust by officials who believed it rotten to the core. Other institutions were saved from contagion by a flood of central bank loans. One result was the destruction of some middle-class wealth. Yet annual wages were more likely affected by the American civil war (1861-65), which denied the Lancashire cotton mills of vital raw materials and forced huge numbers of workers to accept pay cuts or lose their jobs altogether. Sir Roderick Floud, an eminent economic historian and an editor of the Cambridge Economic History of Modern Britain, says the US was already a powerful trading partner and that a blockade of the secessionist south took its toll on Britain, \u201cwhich is another one-off event and really not applicable to today\u201d. The only decade that resulted in stagnant GDP was the 1920s, which saw violent swings from year to year that resulted in zero progress. The 1930s, contrary to popular belief, was a period of growth, though mostly spurred by public-sector spending on housing and Britain\u2019s rearmament programme. Phillip Inman",

Inside those houses, meanwhile, families such as Mr and Mrs Veneering do nothing but surround themselves with the shiny surfaces of their brand new furniture, as if setting the scene for an endless series of selfies.</p> <p>If the economic underpinnings of Britain\u2019s \u201cequipoise\u201d were under strain in the 1860s, then so too was its political status quo. Everywhere, working men were campaigning for the vote. The problem was that no one knew how all those Manchester factory hands and Barrow steelworkers would behave at the ballot box. Their economic interests and cultural ambitions lay so far from those of the metropolitan elite that, according to the prime minister Lord Derby, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/houseofcommons/reformacts/overview/furtherreformacts/\">1867 reform bill</a>, extending the franchise to working-class men, would be nothing less than \u201ca leap in the dark\u201d. Yet far from swinging Britain wildly towards radical liberalism, which had been the terror, the effect was to strengthen popular Conservatism.</p> <p>Still, if Carney is serious about his comparison between us and the people of 1860s, he might want to delve deeper and find some reasons to be cheerful. The 1860s, after all, saw the beginning of a new wave of feminism. Bank failures such as Overend Gurney had left women more financially vulnerable than ever: with professional men going down like ninepins, their wives and daughters needed new ways to take care of themselves.</p> <p>Initiatives in education meant that young women were finding new ways of entering the skilled employment market as clerks and commercial artists as well as qualified teachers. In 1870, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_Women's_Property_Act_1870\">Married Women\u2019s Property Act</a> allowed women to hang on to their own financial resources rather than see them pass to their husband to squander. There had even been a serious suggestion that the 1867 reform bill should extend the vote to women on the same terms as men. The fact that this didn\u2019t come to pass for another 50 years makes you realise that, within the detritus of that first \u201clost\u201d decade, were the seedlings of important new beginnings. <br><strong>Kathryn Hughes</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3e45e6b05878ddb960c9231f6183c5f69beb8be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3e45e6b05878ddb960c9231f6183c5f69beb8be/102_1158_3497_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panic stations!

The run on Overend Gurney in 1866.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Evans Picture Library/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Were the 1860s really a \u2018lost decade\u2019?</h2> <p>When economists refer to a lost decade, they are usually counting each year\u2019s growth and concluding that 10 years of effort have left the country pretty much where it started.</p> <p>Mark Carney meant something slightly different when he used the phrase to refer to the years since the collapse of Northern Rock in 2008. The Bank of England governor was pointing more specifically to wage growth \u2013 not the stagnation of all activity in the economy as a whole, measured by gross domestic product (GDP).</p> <p>On that measure, the comparison with the 1860s is correct. A graph documenting the last 150 years shows that wages slumped around 1860 before recovering to leave workers no better off by 1870. But the similarities stop there, as Threadneedle Street points out in its <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2016/q2/q2pre.pdf\">own history</a> [PDF] of the troubles that befell the largest and most famous discount broker in Britain at the time.</p> <p>Overend Gurney, which collapsed with huge debts in 1866, was an isolated case. Or as the Bank puts it: \u201cThe idiosyncratic failure of a bank \u2026 rather than a systemic crisis with a common cause.\u201d It was allowed to go bust by officials who believed it rotten to the core. Other institutions were saved from contagion by a flood of central bank loans.</p> <p>One result was the destruction of some middle-class wealth. Yet annual wages were more likely affected by the American civil war (1861-65), which denied the Lancashire cotton mills of vital raw materials and forced huge numbers of workers to accept pay cuts or lose their jobs altogether.</p> <p>Sir Roderick Floud, an eminent economic historian and an editor of the Cambridge Economic History of Modern Britain, says the US was already a powerful trading partner and that a blockade of the secessionist south took its toll on Britain, \u201cwhich is another one-off event and really not applicable to today\u201d.</p> <p>The only decade that resulted in stagnant GDP was the 1920s, which saw violent swings from year to year that resulted in zero progress. The 1930s, contrary to popular belief, was a period of growth, though mostly spurred by public-sector spending on housing and Britain\u2019s rearmament programme.<br><strong>Phillip Inman</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "A surge in the banking sector has helped lift European markets, as investors once again shrugged off the Italian referendum result and the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. Hopes that the country\u2019s parliament might pass a budget on Wednesday provided some support, as did the continuing optimism that investors might rescue struggling Monte dei Paschi. If that does not happen, there was growing talk that a state bailout could take place this weekend. The idea that the bank would be recapitalised one way or another pushed the Italian banking index 9% higher, its best one day performance since 8 July. Monte dei Paschi itself added 1%, while Unicredit climbed 13%. Elsewhere Deutsche Bank jumped 8% while in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland rose nearly 6% and Barclays 4.5%. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 33.01 points or 0.49% at 6779.84 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.85% to 10,775.32 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.26% to 4631.94 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 4.15% to 17,757.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.64% higher at 8893.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 622.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Boeing, and Donald Trump\u2019s tweet saying the company was charging too much to build the new Air Force One - $4bn - and should lose the contract. Boeing has now responded with a statement, saying: We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer. Ratings agency Fitch has moved its outlook on Italian banks from stable to negative for 2017, in the wake of the referendum vote and worries about their ability to recapitalise. Fitch said: The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased urgency and risks for Italian banks. Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures The \u201cNo\u201d vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed to our revision of the Outlook on Italy\u2019s \u2018BBB+\u2019 sovereign rating to Negative in October. The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector\u2019s ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further... Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using internal rating models. Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook limiting banks\u2019 ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks focus on cost-cutting. We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in additional capital requirements at some banks. The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing programme this week. So says David Rees of Capital Economics. But he adds: Nonetheless, the political situation in Italy, and indeed the rise of populism in Europe more generally, is something to keep an eye on in the months ahead. Italy\u2019s economy and banking sector are weak, and if the Five Star Movement\u2019s momentum continues to build, it may not be long before an exit from the euro becomes a more realistic concern for investors....Similar fears have rocked emerging market equities in the past, when the Greek debt crisis first came to the fore and Spanish and Italian bonds came under fire in 2012. Italy\u2019s banking sector continues to recover, helped by talk that the country\u2019s parliament might approve its budget on Wednesday, and there could be a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi this weekend. The country\u2019s banking index is currently up more than 7%, its best daily performance since the middle of July. The overall European banking index is up 3%, hitting its highest level since the middle of January. More fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s election - this time affecting UK mortgage rates. Rupert Jones reports: The first evidence has emerged that the era of record-low fixed-rate mortgages may be coming to an end after HSBC withdrew its \u201ccheapest-ever\u201d deal and increased rates on other products. HSBC had been offering a mortgage that allowed customers to lock in for two years at a rate of 0.99%, but this deal has been pulled with immediate effect. The bank\u2019s new mortgage offers are coming in at up to 0.5% higher. The move follows warnings from mortgage brokers that a number of factors, including Donald Trump\u2019s US election win, were set to push up the cost of new fixed-rate home loans. David Hollingworth at broker London &amp; Country Mortgages said: \u201cThe bottom of the market may have been hit. This [announcement] and the broader changes from HSBC, which has been very aggressively priced in the fixed-rate market, could spell the end of the sub-1% fixed rate, but also signals a potential turning point for fixed mortgage rates.\u201d The full story is here: Donald Trump may be casting doubt on Boeing\u2019s Air Force One order, but elsewhere US manufacturers are doing well. New orders for US factory goods rose 2.7% in October, the biggest increase for nearly a year and a half and just above expectations of a 2.6% improvement. The September figure was revised upwards from a gain of 0.3% to 0.6%. The latest figures mark the fourth straight month of increases. But there could be clouds ahead, given the strength of the dollar following Trump\u2019s election victory. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: US factory orders surged... in October, providing manufacturers with plenty of optimism in what has been a turbulent year. Uncertainty surrounds the sector, though, amid renewed strength of the dollar and the incoming president\u2019s trade policy, particularly his approach to China. Donald Trump\u2019s promised fiscal stimulus and the increasing likelihood of raising interest rates has fuelled a greenback rally, and that could starve off exports and hit US factories hard in the new year. And here\u2019s a video clip of Donald Trump outlining his unhappiness with Boeing. Along with the Oval Office, the nuclear codes and the attention of the whole world, winning a US presidential election gives you the power to move the markets. And airline maker Boeing just saw that for itself. Shares in Boeing fell by 1% at the start of trading in New York, after Donald Trump declared on Twitter (where else?) that the firm was charging too much to build the new Air Force One, and should lose the contract. The suggestion that the next US president might take a tough line has worried investors in Boeing (after all, he does have his own Trump Force One). Over in Greece this morning there has been much merriment over the euro group\u2019s decision last night to define the contours of a debt relief agreement for the country long at the centre of Europe\u2019s financial crisis. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens For the first time since economic crisis engulfed Greece just over seven years ago, a sitting government in Athens has felt fit to describe a decision taken in Brussels as a \u201cnational success.\u201d The positive spin and brave faces that have greeted the three bailouts rolled out for Greece, so far, have today been superseded by a genuine sense of relief at the announcement of short-term measures to lighten the country\u2019s mountainous debt load. Many in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, said the move by euro zone partners to shave \u20ac45bn euros off the pile \u2013 the equivalent of 22 percent of GDP \u2013 by extending the repayment period and adjusting interest rates - exceeded \u201cevery expectation.\u201d Addressing reporters today the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos described the decision both as a \u201csignificant achievement\u201d and \u201cdecisive step for the stabilisation of the Greek economy and complete restoration of confidence.\u201d But as Greece\u2019s political opposition was quick to point out the victory was bittersweet. This might be the first time that the nation\u2019s unmanageable debt burden has been addressed head-on \u2013 and as such can only be seen as rich reward for prime minister Alexis Tsipras - but it comes against a backdrop of calls for Athens to adopt yet more austerity once its current bailout programme expires in mid-2018. Amid signs of a looming showdown with the International Monetary Fund, which says further belt-tightening is the only way to plug the looming fiscal gap and thus ensure its own participation in Greece\u2019s third bailout to date, the spokesman called the demands \u201cirrational.\u201d Athens, he insisted, would neither accept the German proposal for Greece to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % through 2028 nor the IMF\u2019s demands for extra measures in 2019 and 2020. Both are expected to dominate talks when auditors representing creditor institutions return to continue negotiating a second review of policy measures set as the price of bailout funds. \u201cGreek society cannot endure more measures,\u201d said Interior minister Panos Skourletis hinting at the battle that is brewing. \u201cThe Greek economy can\u2019t endure them either.\u201d Angelino Alfano\u2019s prediction that Italy could hold a general election in February 2017 didn\u2019t impress the markets, sending shares and bonds down from their earlier highs: But shares are now pushing higher again, following a report that the parliament might approve the 2017 budget on Wednesday, in a confidence vote. That\u2019s sent the FTSE MIB index back up to its earlier highs, gaining 1.7% today. Over in Italy, a political leader has suggested that fresh general elections could be held next February. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, whose centre-right party is part of Matteo Renzi\u2019s coalition, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that: \u201cI forecast there will be the will to go to elections in February.\u201d Significantly, Alfano was speaking after having met with Renzi (whose resignation was put on hold by the country\u2019s president last night). Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Alfano rose to prominence as a key ally of Silvio Berlusconi, before dramatically splitting from the former PM in 2013 to form a new party. Italian bonds are still looking stable as traders head for lunch: One fundamental problem with Italian banks is that there are too many of them, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She argues that closing some branches would help make the sector competitive, and free up capital for other uses: Italy has more bank branches than pizzerias, in the future it desperately needs more pizza and less banks! She also explains why Monte dei Paschi\u2019s future matters, especially if its cash call fail this week. It\u2019s certainly not as systemically important as other banks, for example Italy\u2019s Unicredit, but Monte dei Paschi\u2019s main problem is that it has become symbolic of Italy\u2019s rotten banking sector that now relies on foreign capital for life support. If the Qatari\u2019s decide against investing in it then it gives a terrible signal to the world about the \u2018investability\u2019 of Europe\u2019s banks. Interestingly, in Europe it is not the systemically important banks that are the biggest risk to the financial sector, but the glut of mid-size banks that hold billions in bad debts that could endanger the health of the bigger banks in Europe, if contagion is to spread. Business confidence in Italy is likely to be hurt by the political uncertainty created by Sunday\u2019s referendum result, and the struggles in the banking sector. Ana Boata, economist at trade insurance firm Euler Hermes, believes 0.3 percentage points could be knocked off growth next year, taking the annual rate down from 0.9% to 0.6%. She predicts that foreign investment will be hit, and Italian firms could suffer high financing costs if their banks remain weak: While there is no need to panic, the resounding \u2018No\u2019 result and political turmoil that has followed could cause a mild confidence crisis in 2017. Even without any spill over to banks or the bond market, we expect -0.3pp of Italian GDP could be shaven off, leaving the economy with the prospect of a mere 0.6% growth next year. \u201cIt will be Italian companies that bear the brunt of a confidence shock, albeit a mild one, which are already contending with some of the worst cash flow conditions in the world \u2013 businesses are waiting on average for 88 days for payment for goods and services. We are likely to see divestment from abroad and tougher financing conditions mean that inward investment levels will stay flat, compared to 2% growth we previously predicted for 2017, and hamper the economy\u2019s chances of recovery.\u201d European banking shares are rallying this morning, as traders look for silver linings in the Italian political upheaval. Almost every bank in the index of major European banks, the Stoxx 600, has gained ground. The prospect of Monte dei Paschi (-2.6%) receiving a dose of state aid this weekend is calming the markets, as this would remove the risk that it might simply collapse. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, has taken his eye of his company\u2019s plunging share price to explain all: One of the biggest worries surrounding the referendum was the impact it could have upon the nation\u2019s banking system, with the likes of Unicredit and Monte dei Paschi in the midst of a recapitalisation and bank rescue plan. Plans to raise substantial funds at Monte dei Paschi have hit the buffers after the \u2018No\u2019 vote and while a likely government bailout may not be the ideal otucome for the bank, it will mitigate the risk of a collapse and contagion in the region, hence the widespread gains across the financial sector today. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has weighed in on Brexit this morning, warning that the UK\u2019s demands are not compatible with a smooth exit from the EU. Our politics liveblog has all the details: Britain\u2019s financial spread-betting firms love to talk about the possibilities created by stock market volatility. But they\u2019ve had a nasty taste of it themselves this morning, after the City regulators announced a crackdown on \u2018contract for difference\u2019 products. CFD\u2019s allow a customer to make big profits if they correctly predict a market move -- or see their nest egg crushed by the stampeding herd if they get it wrong. So today, the FCA announced new rules to prevent \u201cinexperienced\u201d clients from getting burned. It wants to restrict how much leverage a retail customer can take on (to restrict them from taking big positions on a small deposit), and better risk warnings. And no wonder - given that 82% of clients manage to lose money on CFD! All sensible-sounding stuff. But shares in IG and CMC Markets, two of the biggest players, have both plunged by 30% this morning -- showing how profitable these retail investors have been. More here: The pound has hit a two-month high this morning, after chancellor Philip Hammond meets with fellow finance ministers in Brussels. Arriving at the meeting, Hammond told reporters that the UK government hasn\u2019t ruled out paying into the EU budget in return for access to its markets. He said: \u201cWe want to keep all options open.... That is something we would have to look at, looking at the costs and the benefits based on what is in the best interests of the British taxpayer.\u201d The possibility of a so-called Soft Brexit has nudged sterling up to $1.277 this morning, its highest level since early October. European stock markets are remarkably calm this morning. Most stock indices are up in early trading, led by Italy, where the banking index has rallied by almost 2%. Shares in Monti dei Paschi, though, have fallen by 3% in volatile trading, as investors wonder whether its rescue plan can be salvaged by the weekend. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is becalmed, down a few points. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE is lacking any macro-momentum bar the continued, and exhausting, Brexit-brouhaha that have been a constant presence since June, meaning it is struggling to significantly break through the levels it has been stuck around for the last few months. Newsflash from Italy: The Rome government will be desperate avoid inflicting bail-in losses on small bondholders, says the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Robin Bew: That could mean breaking EU rules on bank rescues, unless Italy can \u2018bend\u2019 them by finding a way to compensate those small savers. Here\u2019s a handy reminder of how badly Italian banks have fared this year, and how badly Italy has performed this millennium, from the Wall Street Journal. Italian government debt is strengthened in value this morning, showing that the markets remain relaxed about the situation. The rally has pulled down the yield on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds to 1.95%, down from 1.9% last night, and actually lower than before Sunday\u2019s referendum. The gap between Italian and German debt remains steady too - another sign of market calm. The Financial Times reckons that Monte dei Paschi may have to be bailed out this weekend. It all depends whether Qatar can be persuaded to still back its \u20ac5bn cashcall, even though Italy has been plunged into political limbo. Here\u2019s the key points. Bankers are running out of private-sector solutions for Monte dei Paschi di Siena and have told the Italian lender to prepare for a state bailout this weekend after prime minister Matteo Renzi was felled by a referendum defeat. While financial markets responded relatively calmly to the referendum result, people briefed on the situation said the political upheaval made it \u201cmore difficult\u201d to secure a \u20ac1bn investment from Qatar on which Monte dei Paschi\u2019s \u20ac5bn capital-raising plan hinges. Senior bankers fear that a failure to shore up the bank, which was the worst loser of this summer\u2019s European bank healthcheck, could damage already jittery investor confidence about Italy\u2019s overall banking sector, which is hobbled by \u20ac360bn of bad loans and weak profitability. JPMorgan Chase and Mediobanca, advisers to Monte dei Paschi, have been working with Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister, to persuade the Qatar Investment Authority to pump money into Italy\u2019s third-largest lender. But hope is fading that they can secure a deal by this week\u2019s deadline. Without the cornerstone investment from Qatar, the other parts of the complex plan to fill the bank\u2019s \u20ac5bn capital shortfall are likely to collapse. Reuters is reporting that Italian authorities are standing by to provide \u2018precautionary\u2019 state aid to their oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi, if its rescue plan fails. Intriguingly, this measure could (apparently) allow Rome to get much-needed capital into MPS without triggering European rules forcing some bondholders to take a hit. That would protect those families and pensioners who hold bank bonds. Here\u2019s the story: Measures to allow state aid for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena are ready but will depend on political developments in coming days, sources familiar with the matter said. The Tuscan lender is looking at the idea of a precautionary recapitalisation which would avoid the triggering of European bail-in rules, one source said. Monte dei Paschi needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.38 billion) by the end of December to avoid being wound down, but investors are reluctant to back the cash call after Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lost a referendum on Sunday and pledged to resign. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Matteo Renzi\u2019s defeat in Sunday\u2019s Italian referendum continues to reverberate around Europe, even though the outgoing PM has agreed to stay on a little longer to get the country\u2019s 2017 budget passed. The big worry, of course, is Italy\u2019s banks - with their \u20ac350bn of non-performing loans and uncomfortably thin capital reserves. The City is watching to see if Renzi\u2019s defeat has scuppered the plans to recapitalise these institutions using private money; potential investors could well have been scared away by the crisis in Rome. If these efforts fail, then Italy\u2019s government may have to activate bail-in procedures, which would inflict losses on private bondholders. And in Italy, that includes many members of the public. As CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson explains, the Italian banking sector is a serious worry: Any new government technocratic or otherwise is still faced with the unenviable task of either bailing in the Italian banking sector and wiping out a wave of Italian pensioners and savers, or defying Brussels and trying to bail the banks out with taxpayer\u2019s money in contravention of new rules to protect taxpayers. As it is the recapitalisation plan for Monte dei Paschi di Siena is much more problematic now that Renzi has gone given the uncertainty that is likely to come next as we await the shape of any new administration. No one in their right mind is likely to invest in a bank that has already been bailed out three times in the last few years against such an uncertain political backdrop. One thing is certain the events of the last few days make it likely that we will see the ECB extend its asset purchase scheme by at least another six months, beyond March 2017 when they meet later this week. The wider stock markets, though, continue to be quite relaxed about the political situation in Italy. Most European indices rose yesterday, and traders are expecting a quiet morning today. We\u2019ll also be watching Greece, which was last night granted some short-term debt relief by its European creditors. But more seriously, the eurogroup and the IMF are still split over Greece\u2019s fiscal targets, meaning the Fund still hasn\u2019t officially joined the \u20ac86bn bailout programme. Euro zone grants Greece short-term debt relief; no deal with IMF",

Fitch said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased urgency and risks for Italian banks.</p> <p>Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures</p> <p>The \u201cNo\u201d vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed to our revision of the Outlook on Italy\u2019s \u2018BBB+\u2019 sovereign rating to Negative in October.</p> <p>The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector\u2019s ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further...</p> <p>Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using internal rating models.</p> <p>Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook limiting banks\u2019 ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks focus on cost-cutting.</p> <p>We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in additional capital requirements at some banks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5846dfbae4b015a427f782e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-06T15:58:38.240Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing programme this week.

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority has studied a sample of spread-betting customers and found that 82% lost money on products offered by the industry called contracts for difference (CFDs). Is the regulator correct? The FCA\u2019s figure is broadly accurate, but it is not a new development. The ratio of losers to winners \u2013 about 80% of customers have always lost money \u2013 has long been financial spread betting\u2019s dirty little secret. That might not be a problem if their products were being sold as a form of leisure, in the same way that you may have an occasional flutter on the Grand National. But watching financial markets is nowhere near as much fun as watching sport and its complexity makes cricket\u2019s Duckworth-Lewis method seem like a GCSE maths question. So financial spread betting has to be marketed as an investment product. For the vast majority \u2013 the dentists and teachers dabbling with the equity and currency markets \u2013 it has never been anything close to that. Why do most customers lose? There are a few reasons, but the main one is that predicting the future is really difficult, even for professionals. It is rare to get a City fund manager who consistently outperforms the market over the long run, so what chance has the dentist from Dumbarton or the teacher from Truro got? Secondly, the way these bets are structured puts the gambler at a disadvantage. For example, while there are no fees on a trade, you buy and sell shares depending on a \u201cspread\u201d around the actual price. A share trading at 100p may need to be bought at 101p, from which your winnings and losses are calculated. If the share goes up by 1p, you would win nothing. If it goes down by a penny, you would lose 2p a share \u2013 or two times your stake. Thirdly, buying shares in the traditional manner may provide an investor with an income via a dividend, which would need to be factored into any profit calculation. There are no dividends with spread betting. Why do so many financial spread-betting companies sponsor football and rugby clubs? It is not just sporting teams. The industry advertises heavily in all sorts of areas, especially the financial media, and runs educational courses to help improve its clients\u2019 trading (which a cynic would say are really marketing events to tempt punters into betting for longer). The reason for this effort stems from the ratio of losers to winners. If you are betting on a football match and lose, there is still a chance that you enjoyed the game (and the bet might have enhanced the entertainment). The same has never been true of the financial markets, so if you are not winning, the betting soon becomes extremely tiresome. That means there are always a huge amount of spread-betting customers who quit, forcing companies to continually search for new customers. But if people stop spread betting as soon as they realise they are losing money, is it really that dangerous? That depends. You can lose a little over a long period of time, get bored of it and quit, and that should not be hugely damaging. However, because spread betting can cause a customer to lose a lot more than their stake, they can end up with large debts if a market moves swiftly against them. That is what happened in January 2015, when the Swiss national bank scrapped the \u20ac1.20 ceiling for the Swiss franc against the euro, which had been introduced in September 2011 to prevent the \u201cSwissie\u201d from surging in value. Amateur traders ended up with five-figure debts. How can you lose more than you stake? This is because spread betting is a leveraged product: you borrow money to make larger bets than you could otherwise afford. Let\u2019s take shares in a fictional airline called Speedy Jet, which trade at about \u00a31 each. With conventional share buying, if you want to own \u00a31,000 of the airline\u2019s shares, you need to buy 1,000 of them and pay the money upfront. On a spread bet, you would place a bet of \u00a310 per point to give you the same exposure. So if Speedy Jet shares rise by a penny \u2013 equivalent to a point \u2013 you would win \u00a310, just as on the share trade. However, the difference with a spread bet is that you would only need a fraction of \u00a31,000 to take this position. So, for example, opening a \u00a310 per point spread bet on Speedy Jet may require an initial deposit of \u00a350 (at a 5% deposit rate), rather than the \u00a31,000 upfront if you had bought the shares. That allows customers to make larger bets than they might, which can work both ways. If Speedy Jet shares go up by 20p, you have risked \u00a350 to win \u00a3200 (20 points x \u00a310). But the reverse is also true. If the shares lose 20p, you will have lost \u00a3200 \u2013 four times your stake. The FCA said people were sometimes able to have leverage of 200 times, meaning they can take a \u00a320,000 position with a \u00a3100 deposit.",

Gurney is best known for reality show Duck Dynasty, the most-watched non-fiction series in US cable history, which is set to head into its final season on A&amp;E next year. \u201cThe board of Gurney Productions is currently in discussion with Scott and Deirdre Gurney about future arrangements with them,\u201d ITV said in a statement. ITV has appointed Craig Armstrong \u2013 the co-founder of 5X5 Media whose credits include CBS\u2019s Survivor and Jamie Oliver\u2019s Food Revolution \u2013 as interim chief executive of Gurney Productions. Chris Valentini, chief operating officer of ITV America, will also help oversee the company. In a memo to staff Armstrong said the Gurneys had been put on a \u201cshort, temporary leave of absence\u201d. \u201cStarting immediately, Scott and Deidre are no longer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company,\u201d he said. \u201cGurney Productions is a very important part of the ITV family and we are committed to keep things running smoothly until the situation with Scott and Deidre is resolved,\u201d he said. Armstrong added that he would need to question some staff, alongside legal counsel, as part of the investigation. The US production arm of the ITV Studios business reported a 34% decline in revenues in the first half of the year. America has been Crozier\u2019s main market for international expansion, and hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent buying the companies behind shows such as Pawn Stars and Cake Boss. Crozier has spent \u00a31.2bn acquiring 15 production companies, a figure that could rise to nearly \u00a32bn by 2021 if the former owners reach their earn-out targets, triggering further payments. The entire ITV Studios operation, which makes shows from Coronation Street and Come Dine With Me to Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Poldark, reported an 18% boost in revenues to \u00a3923m in the first nine months of the year. However, growth was driven by new acquisitions, which last year included The Voice maker Talpa Media and Poldark and Parade\u2019s End maker Mammoth. Stripping this out, ITV Studios saw revenues decline 9% on an organic basis in the first nine months. The broadcaster expects profits at ITV Studios, which have risen from \u00a391m in 2009 to \u00a3250m by the end of this year, to be flat in 2017 as it focuses on major investment in finding new hit shows.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chair of WPP\u2019s pay committee has told MPs that Sir Martin Sorrell is not on a \u201csuperstar\u201d salary, months after the chief executive faced a shareholder revolt over his \u00a370m pay package for last year. Sir John Hood was taken to task over the scale of Sorrell\u2019s remuneration by a committee of MPs investigating corporate governance and issues including executive pay and board responsibilities. Labour MP Iain Wright, who chairs the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee, questioned whether Sorrell merited such a deal given that the world\u2019s largest marketing services group needs a pool of top executives. \u201cWPP is a massive global success story but one single individual cannot possibly control those global operations,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why provide a superstar salary when you need proper management processes throughout the globe?\u201d \u201cSir Martin doesn\u2019t have a superstar salary,\u201d Hood said. \u201cHe has a salary that is in the range of other chief executives in the UK. What Sorrell has is an incentive programme that rewards him highly for value creation, for increasing shareholder wealth. His remuneration is highly levered toward that.\u201d Hood admitted that Sorrell, who has received \u00a3190m since 2009, has been \u201crewarded very highly\u201d, adding that the controversial incentive pay scheme that had been the subject of much shareholder anger was closed in 2012. However, Sorrell will continue to receive big payouts from the scheme until the new one kicks in next year. The committee also rounded on Jan du Plessis, chairman of Rio Tinto, over top management receiving bonus payouts relating to hitting safety targets despite four deaths at the mining group last year. \u201cMining is a dangerous business and when you\u2019ve got a 140-year history and never had a year without a fatality, I\u2019m sorry, but \u2026 this is a trap of political correctness,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to take safety seriously and say to the chief executive you get zero [bonus unless zero fatalities] on safety grounds that sounds politically appropriate but actually it is not realistic.\u201d Du Plessis said the company had an outstanding reputation for safety in the mining industry and that awarding a bonus only in the case of zero fatalities would be \u201cplaying to the audience\u201d. Labour MP Anna Turley said the chief executivewere not at risk in the day-to-day mining operations, but received safety-related bonuses while workers were not involved in such schemes. \u201cI\u2019m quite proud of what we pay our people for an important job,\u201d he said. Du Plessis added that it would be unhelpful to allow workers a seat on company\u2019s remuneration committees \u2013 one of the ideas opened for discussion in the government\u2019s corporate governance green paper published last week after a series of scandals over executive pay. \u201cUnhelpful to who?\u201d asked Stefan Stern, director of the thinktank the High Pay Centre. \u201cThere is a disconnection between a certain group of people used to very big numbers. They are desensitised to the vastness of some of these numbers. And they have lost sight of that connection through to the shop floor.\u201d Du Plessis said there was a broader problem of executive remuneration being too complex and increasing distrust from the public over the issue. Amra Balic, a managing director at BlackRock Investment Stewardship, said she spent more time talking about pay in the UK than in other countries in Europe. \u201cBoards need to own pay,\u201d she said. \u201cPay for performance is what we believe in but that needs to go hand in hand with paying for a job done. We will be voting against [remuneration] committee chairman going forward if we feel there is a disconnect between pay and performance.\u201d Balic said BlackRock was preparing a letter to send to 350 UK companies that outlined the company\u2019s concerns including issues such as the calculation of year-on-year pay rises and pension contributions. Balic highlighted issues including pay benchmarking and the use of consultant firms. \u201cWe need another careful look and try to wean companies off so-called experts that have set up an industry advising companies,\u201d said Helena Morrissey, chair of the Investment Association and member of the executive remuneration working group it established last year.",

    "webTitle": "UK office construction forecast to plunge after Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Brexit vote will lead to a slump in office construction, with up to half of planned developments in central London likely to be postponed or scrapped in coming years, according to estate agent Savills. Commercial development has barely recovered from the post-financial crisis slump, and the uncertainty surrounding the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will trigger another 30% to 40% decline across the country in the next five years, Savills said in its annual forecasts. Central London will be worst hit. Its report said: \u201cThe seismic shock of the Brexit vote brought transactional activity in many cases to a juddering halt, a pause at least to reconsider pricing as opposed to pulling out of deals.\u201d Several commercial property funds suspended trading in the summer to stop withdrawals from panicking investors fearing a collapse in property values, but all funds have since re-opened. Worried about the impact of Brexit on the City, banks are considering moving operations to mainland Europe and there have been warnings that 100,000 jobs could go if London loses its ability to process euro-denominated transactions. This would sharply reduce demand for new office space. Savills is predicting a 4% fall in UK office prices next year followed by a 1% drop in 2018. Thereafter it forecasts a slow return to growth, pencilling in price increases of 1.1% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020 and 3.2% in 2021. This translates into 1.6% growth over the five-year period. Mat Oakley, head of UK &amp; European commercial research at Savills, said: \u201cIn London offices we have seen about a 5% fall this year, and there is probably another 2% to 3% to go \u2013 assuming we get a reasonably soft Brexit.\u201d The gloomy predictions come a week after the City\u2019s biggest tower, 1 Undershaft, received planning permission. The developer, Singapore-based Aroland Holdings, says it will house 10,000 workers. Another tower at 22 Bishopsgate has also been given the green light. The developer, French-owned fund management firm Axa, had warned before the referendum that that it might pull out in the event of a Brexit vote, but decided to push ahead in October. Oakley said there had been an increase in overseas investors piling into London offices and other UK commercial assets since the June referendum, all attracted by the weaker pound. As domestic investors are in retreat, the proportion of foreign buyers is about to rise to a record high of about 60% between October and December, up from a recent average of 42%. While the Brexit vote came as a shock in June, other events such as the election of Donald Trump in the US and the upcoming elections in France and Germany next year meant that the UK is regarded as somewhat less risky than before, he added. With London property so expensive, investors from the Middle East have been hunting for cheaper deals outside the capital, in places such as Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Bristol. The Savills report said: \u201cLower levels of domestic demand, particularly at larger lot sizes will give non-domestic investors a clearer playing field.\u201d The next five years are likely to experience record levels of international investment in commercial property outside London, ranging from office blocks to shopping centres, warehouses and data centres. Mark Ridley, chief executive of Savills UK and Europe, said: \u201cThe sterling devaluation has made UK property very attractive for international investors pegged to the dollar or euro, with 2017 activity in central London likely to be dominated by Asian investors, with American and pan-European investors also strong nationally.\u201d Sterling has lost 13% of its value against the dollar since the referendum and is down almost 9% against the euro. At one stage it had lost almost 20% of its value. Another draw for foreign investors is that they continue to be taxed in the same way as UK buyers, unlike countries such as the US which have imposed extra non-dom taxes. Savills also sees an end to the post-credit crunch house price boom, forecasting that residential prices will flatline next year after five years of increases. London\u2019s luxury property market has been hit in particular, as Brexit uncertainty and increased stamp duty have been putting off foreign buyers. Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, noted that there had been a shift in housing policy under housing and planning minister Gavin Barwell, with a bigger emphasis on building more homes across a wider range of tenures such as homes for rent. But a representative from Church Commissioners, who manage the Church of England\u2019s \u00a37bn investment fund, suggested that Cook was painting too rosy a picture.",

Central London will be worst hit.</p> <p>Its report said: \u201cThe seismic shock of the Brexit vote brought transactional activity in many cases to a juddering halt, a pause at least to reconsider pricing as opposed to pulling out of deals.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/property-fund-turmoil-continues-as-legal-and-general-foreign-and-colonial-reveal-cut-in-value\">Several commercial property funds suspended trading</a> in the summer to stop withdrawals from panicking investors fearing a collapse in property values, but all funds have since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/24/property-funds-back-brexit-vote-closures\">re-opened</a>.</p> <p>Worried about the impact of Brexit on the City, banks are considering moving operations to mainland Europe and there have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/100000-clearing-jobs-at-risk-from-brexit-vote-stock-exchange-chief\">warnings that 100,000 jobs could go</a> if London loses its ability to process euro-denominated transactions. This would sharply reduce demand for new office space.</p> <p>Savills is predicting a 4% fall in UK office prices next year followed by a 1% drop in 2018. Thereafter it forecasts a slow return to growth, pencilling in price increases of 1.1% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020 and 3.2% in 2021. This translates into 1.6% growth over the five-year period.</p> <p>Mat Oakley, head of UK &amp; European commercial research at Savills, said: \u201cIn London offices we have seen about a 5% fall this year, and there is probably another 2% to 3% to go \u2013 assuming we get a reasonably soft Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>The gloomy predictions come a week after the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/trellis-1-undershaft-skyscraper-london-green-light-building\">City\u2019s biggest tower, 1 Undershaft, received planning permission</a>. The developer, Singapore-based Aroland Holdings, says it will house 10,000 workers. Another tower at 22 Bishopsgate has also been given the green light. The developer, French-owned fund management firm Axa, had warned before the referendum that that it might pull out in the event of a Brexit vote, but decided to push ahead in October.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T15:16:14/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Savills commercial property forecasts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T15:16:14/embed.html\">Savills commercial property forecasts</a> <figcaption>Savills commercial property forecasts</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oakley said there had been an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/inside-china-passion-foreign-property-investment-uk\">increase in overseas investors piling into London offices</a> and other UK commercial assets since the June referendum, all attracted by the weaker pound. As domestic investors are in retreat, the proportion of foreign buyers is about to rise to a record high of about 60% between October and December, up from a recent average of 42%.</p> <p>While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/commercial-property-prices-brexit-clauses-ubs\">Brexit vote came as a shock in June</a>, other events such as the election of Donald Trump in the US and the upcoming elections in France and Germany next year meant that the UK is regarded as somewhat less risky than before, he added.</p> <p> With London property so expensive, investors from the Middle East have been hunting for cheaper deals outside the capital, in places such as Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Bristol.</p> <p>The Savills report said: \u201cLower levels of domestic demand, particularly at larger lot sizes will give non-domestic investors a clearer playing field.\u201d The next five years are likely to experience record levels of international investment in commercial property outside London, ranging from office blocks to shopping centres, warehouses and data centres. </p> <p>Mark Ridley, chief executive of Savills UK and Europe, said: \u201cThe sterling devaluation has made UK property very attractive for international investors pegged to the dollar or euro, with 2017 activity in central London likely to be dominated by Asian investors, with American and pan-European investors also strong nationally.\u201d</p> <p>Sterling has lost 13% of its value against the dollar since the referendum and is down almost 9% against the euro.

    "webTitle": "Spread-betting industry loses \u00a31bn after City watchdog steps in", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than \u00a31bn has been wiped off the stock market value of the spread-betting industry after the City regulator announced a clampdown to protect inexperienced retail customers from unexpected losses on complex trades. The Financial Conduct Authority said it was concerned about people opening online accounts with spread-betting providers without understanding the products they were trading. A representative sample of customer accounts found that 82% lost an average of \u00a32,200 on the products, known as contracts for difference (CFDs). The regulator proposed a series of measures to protect consumers, including standardised risk warnings, compulsory disclosure of total profit-loss ratios across all clients, limits on trading using small amounts of capital and banning companies from using bonuses to tempt people to start trading. Shares in publicly traded spread-betting companies plunged after the announcement. Shares in IG Group, the biggest operator, plummeted by 32% to 532p, wiping more than \u00a3900m off its value. IG said some companies\u2019 marketing of CFDs fell short of appropriate standards and the FCA\u2019s proposals could be good for customers. The proposals did not appear to apply to firms offering CFDs from outside the UK, where standards are often lax, it said. CMC Markets dropped by 30% to 125p, cutting its market value by more than \u00a3160m. Founded and run by Peter Cruddas, the Brexit backer and former Conservative party treasurer, CMC floated on the stock market in February at 240p a share and has since lost more than 45% of its value. The fall knocked about \u00a390m off the value of Cruddas\u2019s 57% stake in the company. AIM-listed Plus500 lost 28%, or \u00a3160m, as its shares tumbled to 388p, and shares in Playtech, which makes gambling software, also fell. CFDs are derivative products that allow people to gamble on price movements in shares, commodities and currencies without owning them. Customers can increase the size of their trades by putting down a small amount of capital to maximise potential gains and losses. A leverage ratio of 100:1 lets someone take a \u00a310,000 position with a \u00a3100 deposit. The FCA proposed limiting leverage to 25:1 in a customer\u2019s first year of trading and 50:1 for more experienced consumers. The potential losses for spread-betters were demonstrated in January 2015 when the Swiss central bank unexpectedly removed the cap on the franc\u2019s value against the euro. IG said at the time the move could cost it as much as \u00a330m after customers with no means of paying racked up thousands of pounds of losses from betting against the franc. IG also took a hit by closing customer positions at worse prices than it was able to get in the market. The number of companies authorised by the FCA for retail CFD business has roughly doubled to 97 since 2010. The longest-established companies started in the 1970s and 80s by offering bets to relatively knowledgeable clients, but there are now about 125,000 active UK customers and 400,000 based overseas, with a total of \u00a33.5bn on deposit with providers. Christopher Woolard, the FCA\u2019s director of strategy and competition, said: \u201cWe have serious concerns that an increasing number of retail clients are trading in CFD products without an adequate understanding of the risks involved, and as a result can incur rapid, large and unexpected losses. \u201cWe are introducing stricter rules for CFD products to ensure the sector addresses the shortcomings identified and firms make sure that retail clients are aware of the high risks involved in trading these complex products.\u201d The FCA has been examining the industry since July 2015. In February, it told companies to do more to protect customers from losses after finding that checks on their suitability and warnings about risk were inadequate. Jake Green, a partner at law firm Ashurst, said the regulator\u2019s proposals showed it was intervening in products, rather than enforcing good conduct, which could lead to some companies folding or being taken over. \u201cThis will come as a shock to the UK industry, which received detailed briefings from the FCA earlier in this year, where this was not indicated,\u201d he said. The FCA has asked the industry and other interested parties for comments on its proposals by 7 March 2017.",

    "webTitle": "Southern rail strike: Grayling offers to meet RMT union for talks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has offered to meet the RMT union if it suspends its industrial action in its dispute with Southern rail, as commuters on the troubled network suffered further disruption with an overtime ban by drivers starting alongside a fresh strike by conductors . Members of the RMT are on strike for three days, while industrial action by Aslef members, including the refusal to work additional shifts, will run indefinitely. Southern, which has admitted to parliament that it does not have enough drivers to operate its timetable, has told customers it expects services \u201cto be severely disrupted on every day from Tuesday 6 December until further notice\u201d. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said his union had been seeking talks with Grayling since he became secretary of state in June. \u201cHe has refused to meet us because we are taking industrial action,\u201d Cash told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Asked if he would agree to suspend the strike if Grayling offered to meet the union, Cash said: \u201cIf he says he wants to meet us, I will certainly put that suggestion back to our executive, yes.\u201d Within an hour, Grayling said he would meet the union if it suspended strikes. \u201cCall it off and we will work together for the future of the railways,\u201d he told Today. But he made it clear that he sided with the company in the dispute and said it would be wrong for him to interfere in the negotiations. Grayling said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is right and proper for me to insert myself into a negotiation between a private company and a trade union over a strike I think is politically motivated.\u201d Southern is changing the role of conductors and bringing in more driver-only operated trains, which unions argue threatens safety as well as jobs. Grayling said the strike was unnecessary. He said: \u201cI am very happy to meet the unions ... They don\u2019t have to carry out this action. Nobody is losing their job, nobody is losing any money. It is perfectly safe as judged by the independent rail inspectorate. There is no reason for this strike to be happening.\u201d Cash, however, took further aim at Grayling, who has been announcing separate proposals to reform how railways are run. The RMT general secretary said: \u201cInstead of parading around the newsrooms with his lethal scheme to give outfits like Southern a chance to wreck rail infrastructure, \u200eas well as our train operations, the transport secretary should be in a room with the unions and [Southern] sorting out the current shambles.\u201d The long-standing dispute has reached the point where even a group of Church of England bishops has attempted to intervene. In a letter, the bishops in Sussex called for an end to the \u201ccircle of blame\u201d, saying the dispute was threatening the economic health and development of communities. The church leaders said those responsible for the trains had a \u201cmoral duty to alleviate the damage that the disruption is causing\u201d. The RMT said it was willing to attend any talks brokered by the bishops. The RMT said the action that started on Tuesday was \u201crock solid\u201d. The train company said there was major disruption to trains on the mainline to Brighton and to Redhill, and some disruption to the Gatwick Express, while some branch lines were partially closed. Southern is hoping to run about 50% of scheduled trains this week, but has warned of \u201csevere and significant disruption\u201d and that \u201cstations will be incredibly busy\u201d. It has advised customers to avoid travelling if possible. Southern does not expect to run any trains on three days next week when drivers are planning to strike. \u201cIf passengers can make alternative travel arrangements they should, and if they don\u2019t have to travel they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Southern said. Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway, has launched legal action to block Aslef\u2019s strike, and a hearing is due at the high court in London on Wednesday. More strikes by the RMT, along with the overtime ban, are planned in the run-up to Christmas and over the new year. A week-long strike by drivers will halt Southern operations again in January.",

      "bodyText": "Chip designer and Apple supplier Imagination Technologies is in demand after better than expected results and news that its restructuring is on track. The company said royalty revenues rose 6% and licensing revenues 7% in the first half, with earnings before interest and tax up 65% to \u00a312.2m. It has sold its Pure radio business and most of IMGsystems, with design and software group IMGworks near disposal, and it has achieved \u00a327.5m of annual cost savings. It plans to concentrate on three core businesses, graphics, processing and connectivity (wi-fi and Bluetooth). Chief executive Andrew Heath said: We have successfully executed the restructuring programme initiated last February, on time and in line with our expectations. The \u00a327.5m of cost savings...have been delivered - this has enabled the business to return to profitability... We are now in a much better position to exploit our leading technologies, across a range of increasing opportunities and execute our refreshed strategy. From our continuing operations we remain on course to deliver an underlying trading performance for the year in line with our expectations and anticipate that we will continue to see an additional benefit from the strong US dollar. The company also announced that chairman Bert Nordberg will leave in February 2017 after just two years, to be replaced by Peter Hill, non-executive chairman of Keller and Volution Group. The company\u2019s shares have climbed 17p or nearly 8% to 237p, and analysts at Liberum said: Imagination\u2019s first half results are ahead of our forecasts, aided by currency moves and a 260% year on year jump in Ensigma [connectivity] licensing revenue. We expect a sequentially stronger second half based on higher Apple royalties, healthy licensing, and further currency benefits. We have raised both our adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share forecast for 2017 by 14% each. We believe all three of Imagination\u2019s businesses are well positioned to see growing licensing and royalty revenue due to the increasing importance of graphics processing, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, automated driving and Internet of Things. Valuations are attractive. Buy. At Investec, analyst Roger Phillips said: Interims are strong on a headline basis with a beat to revenue \u2013 both licence and royalty - and EBIT, and guidance retained for 2017 with the rider of a possible foreign exchange benefit. The fly in the ointment is that the positive bits of the interims come from the less valuable parts of the business, while the core PowerVR franchise is weak. The Chairman has also announced his departure. We retain our Buy; this set of results should represent trough financials, with a stronger second half in store and potential upside in 2018 from regained market share. We think the GPU IP business is worth at least 260p on the current trough financials, with potential upside in 2018 through regained Asian System on a Chip market share (particularly Mediatek).",

    "webTitle": "Drax jumps 14% after deals as markets continue to shrug off Italy woes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Drax shares have surged more than 14% after the coal fired power plant owner unveiled a series of deals to diversify its business. It is paying \u00a3340m to buy power supplier Opus Energy, which was founded in 2002 now has 8.3% of the non-domestic market. Drax has also bought four gas power plant projects for \u00a318.5m. The company is moving away from its traditional coal-fired business, and has converted its plants so that some 70% of the electricity generated now comes from biomass. But it is still awaiting European approval of the contract for difference investment awarded to it by the UK government, and the Opus deal will depend on this. Drax chief executive Dorothy Thompson said: These initiatives mark an important step in delivering our strategy, contributing to stronger, more predictable, long-term, financial performance, through greater diversification of the businesses, delivering more opportunities right across the markets in which we operate. Drax shares are 37.6p higher at 315.2p, while Telecom Plus, which will receive \u00a371m in cash for its 20% stake in Opus, is up 9p at \u00a312.21. But analysts at Jefferies cautioned the price paid for Opus looked a little high, and Drax was forecasting profits at the bottom end of its target range. Jefferies said: In essence, today\u2019s update will we see Drax evolving away from its traditional commodity exposed business towards a more diversified and integrated model. We see three key benefits from today\u2019s acquisition. (1) Opus Energy looks like a well run retail business with attractive margins in a segment that is not hugely exposed to political and media scrutiny compared to the domestic retail market. (2) The deal increases the stability of Drax\u2019s earnings and cash flows going forward. (3) There are also some opportunities for synergies related to Opus\u2019 current trading agreements. The acquisition multiple is 10 times enterprise value/EBITDA which, in our view, does not stand out as considerably cheap. Secondly, this is the first time that the company is making a step into the SME retail market, therefore it remains to be seen whether Drax has the necessary expertise to manage this successfully. Lastly, Drax states that the combined group will be able to provide flexible and innovative energy solutions for customers, it is unclear how much of this could translate into earnings growth and shareholder return. Drax has updated guidance for 2016. Full year 2016 EBITDA is now expected to be at the low end of the \u00a3135-169m consensus range as a result of the CfD contract not yet being approved. Despite the rise in Drax shares, the mid-cap FTSE 250 has fallen 70 points or 0.4%, dragged down by spread betting groups after a proposed clampdown by the Financial Conduct Authority. CMC Markets is down 28% while IG has lost 29%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down just 5.17 points at 6741.66, as investors continued to take the Italian referendum and resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi in their stride. HSBC is 3% higher at 645.1p after analysts at Morgan Stanley moved from underweight to equal weight with a 645p price target, while Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 3.2p to 201p. But mining shares suffered some profit taking with Anglo American down 40p at \u00a312.03 and BHP Billiton 35p lower at 1304.5p.",

Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In essence, today\u2019s update will we see Drax evolving away from its traditional commodity exposed business towards a more diversified and integrated model.</p> <p>We see three key benefits from today\u2019s acquisition. (1) Opus Energy looks like a well run retail business with attractive margins in a segment that is not hugely exposed to political and media scrutiny compared to the domestic retail market. (2) The deal increases the stability of Drax\u2019s earnings and cash flows going forward. (3) There are also some opportunities for synergies related to Opus\u2019 current trading agreements.</p> <p>The acquisition multiple is 10 times enterprise value/EBITDA which, in our view, does not stand out as considerably cheap. Secondly, this is the first time that the company is making a step into the SME retail market, therefore it remains to be seen whether Drax has the necessary expertise to manage this successfully.

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has issued a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of \u201cisolation and detachment\u201d among people who feel left behind by globalisation. Warning that the UK was suffering its \u201cfirst lost decade since the 1860s\u201d, Mark Carney said that one of the reasons for the Brexit vote was a sense among people that they had lost control of their futures. The governor also used his first big speech since Donald Trump swept to power in the US to warn that open markets are under threat and that politicians must do more to share out the gains of global trade and the rise of technology. Speaking against a backdrop of growing support for anti-establishment politicians, Carney repeatedly referred to people\u2019s isolation, sense of insecurity and their frustrations with global trade and technology. Those forces had favoured the \u201csuperstar and the lucky\u201d, he said. \u201cBut what of the frustrated and frightened?\u201d \u201cFrom the rising spectre of global terrorism to intensifying geopolitical tensions and financial crises, for too long, for too many people, the world seems to be getting riskier,\u201d he said in a lecture to Liverpool John Moores University. He did not refer specifically toTrump\u2019s use of a protectionist platform. But asked after the speech about the UK vote to leave the EU, he said people were driven to support Brexit by different reasons, including questions of sovereignty, economic concerns and a sense of losing control. Following criticism of experts from some Brexit campaigners, such as Michael Gove, Carney acknowledged in his speech that voters deserved a more honest appraisal from economists when it came to the real impact of changes such as globalisation and the automation of jobs. \u201cThe fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods \u2013 and therefore identities \u2013 well before new ones emerge,\u201d he said. He noted the rise in living standards around the world in recent decades and said technological progress had lifted more than 1 billion people out of poverty. But he recognised those advances had not been felt equally. \u201cDespite such immense progress many citizens in advanced economies are facing heightened uncertainty, lamenting a loss of control and losing trust in the system. To them, measures of aggregate progress bear little relation to their own experience. Rather than a new golden era, globalisation is associated with low wages, insecure employment, stateless corporations and striking inequalities,\u201d he said. That climate had combined with the aftermath of a financial crisis that exposed how banks had been working in a \u201cheads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble\u201d, he added. \u201cAs a consequence of all of these developments, public support for open markets is under threat. Turning our backs on open markets would be a tragedy, but it is a possibility. It can only be averted by confronting the underlying reasons for this risk upfront.\u201d Carney also used his speech to defend the Bank in the wake of Theresa May\u2019s remarks in October that there had been \u201csome bad side-effects\u201d from low interest rates and quantitative easing, which involves central banks pumping electronic money into the financial system. He reiterated the Bank\u2019s stance that monetary policy could not be held accountable for rising inequality and insisted the policymakers would set rates with a view to keeping inflation in check while also being careful not to damage the jobs market as the Brexit process progresses. The main focus of his last speech of an eventful year, was inequality and he described current times as \u201cthe first lost decade since the 1860s\u201d. Carney set out three priorities to tackle the sense of \u201cisolation and detachment\u201d felt by substantial proportions of people, including the Bank\u2019s recurring plea for the government to play a role in shoring up the economy rather than leaving monetary policy to do all the heavy lifting. \u201cFirst economists must clearly acknowledge the challenges we face, including the realities of uneven gains from trade and technology,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, we must grow our economy by rebalancing the mix of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reforms. \u201cThird, we need to move towards more inclusive growth where everyone has a stake in globalisation.\u201d Most potential solutions to the sense of disenchantment lay \u201coutside the Bank\u2019s remit,\u201d Carney said. Defending the Bank he said: \u201cMonetary policy has been keeping the patient alive, creating the possibility of a lasting cure through fiscal and structural operations. It has averted depression and helped advanced economies live to fight another day, so that measures to restore vitality can be taken.\u201d \u201cIn the end, monetary policy isn\u2019t a spectre but a friendly ghost.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Diesel farms make fresh bids to supply National Grid back-up power", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of Britain\u2019s energy network is gearing up to buy more power from suppliers to ensure the country\u2019s lights stay on, with polluting diesel generators among the providers vying for contracts. The National Grid needs back-up electricity sources that kick in when, for instance, demand is high but the weather is not breezy enough to power wind farms. It secures this back-up power through the annual capacity market auction that begins on Tuesday and will see controversial \u201cdiesel farms\u201d taking part. This auction process has created lucrative investment opportunities for people to invest in diesel farms, rows of noisy and polluting generators that operate for up to 15 years. In fact, financiers have set up companies specifically to access payments from the National Grid. And while the government is weighing up plans to limit the attractiveness of such investments, many diesel farms have been built and are already delivering returns. Still more could land multimillion-pound contracts this week. Industry sources said one farm can easily make \u00a35m a year, while non-profit climate analysis firm InfluenceMap today claims the diesel farm industry could pick up \u00a3500m in a matter of years. In some cases, investors are also eligible for generous tax breaks. Gas has become an increasingly important part of the UK\u2019s energy mix as coal, due to be phased out by 2025, has been scaled back. Diesel farms are not there to provide power on a routine basis, but to fire up at times of peak use or to help balance second-by-second changes in demand. While the farms offer a profitable investment, those who live nearby say their lives are blighted by noise pollution and fear of toxic emissions. In Ernesettle, Plymouth, locals told the Guardian they are fed up with generators being built in their quiet neighbourhood. One of the two diesel farms in Ernesettle is owned by Rockpool Investments, founded by City financier Nicola Horlick. Each of Rockpool\u2019s nine diesel farms has more than 100 investors putting in a combined \u00a334m, according to documents seen by the Guardian. But for Ernesettle residents, the reality is intolerable noise pollution and a growing fear of harmful nitrogen oxide emissions. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bloody jet engine in my garden,\u201d said Flo Vickery. Vickery was among hundreds employed at the Toshiba factory that once stood on the site the diesel farms now occupy. She has kept a diary of the noise they give off and says that in winter they often run for two hours an evening, several days a week. Neighbour Chris Kelland said: \u201cWhen the wind blows I have to shut the window because it\u2019s just a continuous drone. It\u2019s a big air polluter too. Why don\u2019t they put it in their own back yard?\u201d Plutus PowerGen, which operates and part owns Rockpool\u2019s plants, said it only uses Green D+ diesel, which boasts lower emissions. The company acknowledged there may be some noise pollution, but said its plants only run for up to 200 hours a year, meaning noise is \u201climited\u201d. However, the plants typically run only in winter, meaning noise from the generators could affect residents for at least an hour each day for four months. One reason Rockpool is so keen on diesel farms is that any set up before November 2015 are eligible for a tax break through the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS). The scheme offers an income tax cut worth 30% of the investment, as well as reductions in Capital Gains Tax. Stock market filings show that Rockpool set up nine power plant firms in time to beat a policy change that prevents new power plants from accessing the EIS tax break. Even without tax relief, diesel plants can deliver high returns. Through the annual capacity market auction, companies can bid for 15-year contracts to provide power at short notice. The Grid said it did not know how many contracts have been awarded to plants that run on diesel. But the rewards on offer mean Rockpool is just one of several major diesel investors. One such firm is Peak Gen Power, which applied to build 15 plants in the upcoming 2016 auction after succeeding with 13 bids last year. It refused to say what fuel it will use but planning applications show that it has repeatedly sought permission for diesel-fuelled plants. Accounts registered at Companies House show the majority owner of Peak Gen Power is Dione Holdings, registered in the British Virgin Islands. The company declined to comment on the offshore structure. While Rockpool and Peak Gen Power declined to comment, Oliver Hughes of Oxford Capital Partners \u2013 a diesel farm investor \u2013 said: \u201cFrom our perspective, there\u2019s an ever-increasing reliance on intermittent generation from renewables. One solution is to run a large coal fired power plant. The alternatives [to diesel farms] are potentially a lot more ugly.\u201d But energy experts dispute the suggestion that diesel is a necessary part of the transition to a low carbon future. \u201cCleaner and cheaper options that the government should be prioritising include demand response, where non-essential demand is turned off for a little while, battery storage and CHP (combined heat and power) generation,\u201d said Richard Black, director of the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit. \u201cAll of those are natural components of the low-carbon power system that Britain needs to build over the next 15 years, whereas diesel is not.\u201d There are moves under way in government to change the policies that make diesel farms such an attractive investment. Energy regulator Ofgem has said that payments to small power plants appear too high. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy recently proposed limiting these payments and has also considered slashing payouts to firms that are also in receipt of tax relief. Rockpool Investments has fought policy change hard, according to a document obtained by InfluenceMap and shared with the Guardian. The document warns that retrospectively limiting the financial benefits available to the companies Rockpool owns would have a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on them. But rival UK Power Reserve thinks the double whammy of subsidies and tax relief could be illegal under EU state aid rules. \u201cWe believe any tax relief funded projects should be completely excluded from the capacity market and we won\u2019t rest until that happens,\u201d said chief executive Tim Emrich. He said: \u201cUK Power Reserve is considering its legal options in relation to state-aid non-compliance,\u201d adding that BEIS\u2019s proposed reforms \u201cdo not go far enough\u201d. Diesel farms face a second threat, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulting on measures to limit diesel emissions. This would make it harder for them to comply with environmental regulations, forcing them to spend money on pollution abatement technology or switch to a more expensive but cleaner fuel. Defra acknowledged in its consultation that \u201cpotential distortions in the wider policy landscape\u201d have given diesel an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d. Impending policy change is beginning to have an effect, with several diesel companies understood to have pulled out of the running for the capacity market auction. But changes to the way the Grid pays small power plants are not expected to apply to those that secured consent in previous auctions. That means communities like Ernesettle have little to gain and local councillor Mark Lowry has been left scratching his head. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to make money from this, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cFind some land, put a few diesel generators on it, get a massive tax subsidy. It\u2019s so illogical.\u201d",

Still more could land multimillion-pound contracts this week.</p> <p>Industry sources said one farm can easily make \u00a35m a year, while non-profit climate analysis firm InfluenceMap today claims the <a href=\"http://influencemap.org/report/Diesel-Subsidies-in-the-UK-c55c505390a65b84df1465cfdafc15fc\">diesel farm industry could pick up \u00a3500m</a> in a matter of years. In some cases, investors are also eligible for generous tax breaks. Gas has become an increasingly important part of the UK\u2019s energy mix as coal, due to be phased out by 2025, has been scaled back. Diesel farms are not there to provide power on a routine basis, but to fire up at times of peak use or to help balance second-by-second changes in demand.</p> <p>While the farms offer a profitable investment, those who live nearby say their lives are blighted by noise pollution and fear of toxic emissions. In Ernesettle, Plymouth, locals told the Guardian they are fed up with <a href=\"http://web.plymouth.gov.uk/planningdoc-2?appno=14/02387/FUL\">generators being built in their quiet neighbourhood</a>.</p> <p>One of the two diesel farms in Ernesettle is owned by Rockpool Investments, founded by City financier Nicola Horlick. Each of Rockpool\u2019s nine diesel farms has more than 100 investors putting in a combined \u00a334m, according to documents seen by the Guardian. But for Ernesettle residents, the reality is intolerable noise pollution and a growing fear of harmful nitrogen oxide emissions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d340258fd1bd69347c655b67362d731a0e28bd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d340258fd1bd69347c655b67362d731a0e28bd1/0_316_4746_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ernesettle residents Chris Kelland, Neil Macfarlane, Flo Vickery, Ray Morton and Alison Sargent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernesettle residents Chris Kelland, Neil Macfarlane, Flo Vickery, Ray Morton and Alison Sargent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Mostyn for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a bloody jet engine in my garden,\u201d said Flo Vickery.</p> <p>Vickery was among hundreds employed at the Toshiba factory that once stood on the site the diesel farms now occupy. She has kept a diary of the noise they give off and says that in winter they often run for two hours an evening, several days a week.</p> <p>Neighbour Chris Kelland said: \u201cWhen the wind blows I have to shut the window because it\u2019s just a continuous drone. It\u2019s a big air polluter too. Why don\u2019t they put it in their own back yard?\u201d</p> <p>Plutus PowerGen, which operates and part owns Rockpool\u2019s plants, said it only uses Green D+ diesel, which boasts lower emissions. The company acknowledged there may be some noise pollution, but said its plants only run for up to 200 hours a year, meaning noise is \u201climited\u201d.</p> <p>However, the plants typically run only in winter, meaning noise from the generators could affect residents for at least an hour each day for four months. One reason Rockpool is so keen on diesel farms is that any set up before November 2015 are eligible for a tax break through the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-enterprise-investment-scheme-introduction\">Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)</a>.</p> <p>The scheme offers an income tax cut worth 30% of the investment, as well as reductions in Capital Gains Tax.</p> <p>Stock market filings show that Rockpool set up nine power plant firms in time to beat a policy change that prevents new power plants from accessing the EIS tax break. Even without tax relief, diesel plants can deliver high returns.</p> <p>Through the annual capacity market auction, companies can bid for 15-year contracts to provide power at short notice. The Grid said it did not know how many contracts have been awarded to plants that run on diesel.</p> <p>But the rewards on offer mean Rockpool is just one of several major diesel investors. One such firm is Peak Gen Power, which applied to build 15 plants in the upcoming 2016 auction after succeeding with 13 bids last year.</p> <p>It refused to say what fuel it will use but planning applications show that it has repeatedly sought permission for diesel-fuelled plants. Accounts registered at Companies House show the majority owner of Peak Gen Power is Dione Holdings, registered in the British Virgin Islands. The company declined to comment on the offshore structure.</p> <p>While Rockpool and Peak Gen Power declined to comment, Oliver Hughes of Oxford Capital Partners \u2013 a diesel farm investor \u2013 said: \u201cFrom our perspective, there\u2019s an ever-increasing reliance on intermittent generation from renewables. One solution is to run a large coal fired power plant. The alternatives [to diesel farms] are potentially a lot more ugly.\u201d</p> <p>But energy experts dispute the suggestion that diesel is a necessary part of the transition to a low carbon future.<br></p> <p>\u201cCleaner and cheaper options that the government should be prioritising include demand response, where non-essential demand is turned off for a little while, battery storage and CHP (combined heat and power) generation,\u201d said Richard Black, director of the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit. \u201cAll of those are natural components of the low-carbon power system that Britain needs to build over the next 15 years, whereas diesel is not.\u201d</p> <p>There are moves under way in government to change the policies that make diesel farms such an attractive investment. <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/system/files/docs/2016/12/update_letter_-_charging_arrangements_for_embedded_generation.pdf\">Energy regulator Ofgem</a> has said that payments to small power plants appear too high. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy recently proposed limiting these payments and has also considered slashing payouts to firms that are also in receipt of tax relief.</p> <p>Rockpool Investments has fought policy change hard, according to a document obtained by InfluenceMap and shared with the Guardian. The document warns that retrospectively limiting the financial benefits available to the companies Rockpool owns would have a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on them.</p> <p>But rival UK Power Reserve thinks the double whammy of subsidies and tax relief could be illegal under EU state aid rules.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe any tax relief funded projects should be completely excluded from the capacity market and we won\u2019t rest until that happens,\u201d said chief executive Tim Emrich.</p> <p>He said: \u201cUK Power Reserve is considering its legal options in relation to state-aid non-compliance,\u201d adding that BEIS\u2019s proposed reforms \u201cdo not go far enough\u201d.</p> <p>Diesel farms face a second threat, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulting on measures to limit diesel emissions. This would make it harder for them to comply with environmental regulations, forcing them to spend money on pollution abatement technology or switch to a more expensive but cleaner fuel.</p> <p>Defra acknowledged in its consultation that \u201cpotential distortions in the wider policy landscape\u201d have given diesel an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d. Impending policy change is beginning to have an effect, with several diesel companies understood to have pulled out of the running for the capacity market auction.</p> <p>But changes to the way the Grid pays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/diesel-farms-set-win-lucrative-contracts-back-up-national-grid\">small power plants</a> are not expected to apply to those that secured consent in previous auctions. That means communities like Ernesettle have little to gain and local councillor Mark Lowry has been left scratching his head.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to make money from this, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cFind some land, put a few diesel generators on it, get a massive tax subsidy. It\u2019s so illogical.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy is on course for a solid finish to the year after activity in the services sector picked up and consumer spending continued to rise last month. But there were fresh signs of concern about inflation as the weak pound raises the cost of fuel and other imports. A closely watched survey of firms in Britain\u2019s dominant services sector, which spans banking to hotels, showed they enjoyed the fastest growth since January as they continued to recover from a short, sharp downturn following the Brexit vote. The Markit/CIPS UK services PMI [pdf] report chimed with other indicators suggesting businesses and consumers have shrugged off the referendum result for now. The survey\u2019s compilers, Markit, said the economy was on course to grow 0.5% in the final three months of the year based on the service sector report and its polls of the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors last week. That would match the pace of GDP growth in the third quarter and defy economists\u2019 post-referendum warnings of a sharp slowdown this year. Separate figures from Barclaycard released on Tuesday showed consumer spending grew 5.1% in November, the second highest year-on-year increase since it started publishing data five years ago. That followed record growth of 5.5% in October. The increase reflected an ongoing trend for people to spend money on meals out and cinema trips as well as the fact they had to pay more for essentials in November. Fuel prices were a big part of that, with spending on petrol up 11.7% on a year ago as a litre of unleaded petrol cost 116p, compared with 108p at this point in 2015. The figures chime with warnings from economists and the Bank of England that higher inflation and lacklustre pay growth will squeeze living standards next year and could hit an economy that has so far proved resilient to the Brexit vote. Commenting on the Barclaycard figures, its managing director, Paul Lockstone, said there had been a noticeable rise in the amount households were spending on necessities. \u201cThough there is little visible evidence of households yet being forced to decide between filling up the car or eating out with friends, the narrowing gap between essential and non-essential spend growth means they may need to look more carefully at how they allocate their cash once Christmas is out of the way,\u201d said Lockstone. The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has raised the cost of imports to the UK and services companies were also feeling the pressure of higher fuel prices last month as well as more expensive food imports and pricier business travel. Markit\u2019s poll of services companies showed those inflationary pressures combined with political uncertainty knocked business sentiment last month. It weakened for the first time since July, with companies also citing Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the race for the US presidency as a fresh source of uncertainty. But for now, companies in the sector are enjoying strong growth, with the weak pound helping to boost overseas demand. The headline reading on the services survey rose to 55.2 in November from 54.5 the month before. That beat economists\u2019 forecasts for it to ease to 54.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. The index has now been above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for four months. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, commented: \u201cThe further upturn in the vast services sector shows that the pace of UK economic growth remains resiliently robust in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit.\u201d Retailers reported that the Black Friday sales event had also boosted sales for part of November. Figures from the British Retail Consortium showed non-food sales were about 40% higher in the week including Black Friday than in other weeks during the month. Overall, like-for-like retail sales were up 0.6% in November on a year ago. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson commented: \u201cConsumer spending remains stable, although very much value-driven with a focus towards products on promotion.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A top US investment bank resigned as a key adviser to Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct because of concerns that the retail company had manipulated its share price, according to claims made in a high court document. Bank of America Merrill Lynch had concerns about Sport Direct\u2019s corporate governance and the \u201cpropriety\u201d of share transactions in 2012 around its employee bonus scheme, according to allegations in legal filings by Jeff Blue, previously one of Ashley\u2019s key allies. The claims raise further questions about the management of Sports Direct and the stewardship provided by the board of directors. The retailer has been involved in a string of scandals since an investigation by the Guardian a year ago revealed it is effectively paying staff in its warehouse less than the minimum wage. Blue is the company\u2019s former strategic development director and a former Merrill Lynch banker. He is suing Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, for \u00a314m over claims that the retail boss breached an agreement to pay him a \u00a315m bonus if the company\u2019s share price rose above 800p. In court documents, Blue claims he bolstered the reputation of Sports Direct in the City and used the resignation of Merrill Lynch as corporate broker to show the improvements that needed to be made. He quit Sport Direct last year. Shares in Sports Direct peaked at 922p in April 2014, but closed at just over 300p on Monday. The retailer is scheduled to publish its half-year results on Thursday, when Ashley will update the market on the company\u2019s performance but also face questions about a controversial arrangement between Sports Direct and a delivery company owned by his brother that is being scrutinised by the Financial Reporting Council. He also faces allegations that the retailer tried to secretly record a private conversation between MPs who visited its warehouse to check on working conditions. Blue alleges that Merrill Lynch resigned as corporate broker to Sports Direct in autumn 2012 after share purchases in August that breached financial regulations. The investment bank was concerned that Sports Direct had provided the funding for its employee benefit trust to buy more than \u00a320m of shares from workers, who had been awarded them as a bonus payment and were looking to cash them in, he claims. Under City rules, companies must inform the market in advance if they want to buy their own shares and must not purchase more than a quarter of the shares traded on a typical day. If the employee trust had not purchased the shares then Sports Direct could have been required to offer them to the wider market, potentially suppressing the company\u2019s share price as it would have increased the number of shares for sale. This would have benefited hedge funds who were betting that the share price would fall as a result of employees looking to cash in their bonuses. In the legal filing, Blue says: \u201cIn autumn 2012, Merrill Lynch withdrew from acting as Sports Direct\u2019s corporate broker. Merrill Lynch did so as a result of concerns that it had regarding Sports Direct\u2019s corporate governance, including the propriety of Sport Direct\u2019s decision in August 2012 to fund the Sports Direct Employee Benefit Trust to buy-back shares for the benefit of Sports Direct\u2019s employee share scheme, without complying with the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation as would ordinarily be required by a buy-back of shares by the Sports Direct itself.\u201d The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, is aware of the allegations. Despite Merrill\u2019s resigning in the autumn 2012, Sports Direct did not confirm its departure until it confirmed Espirito Santo and Oriel Securities as its joint corporate brokers in a statement in February 2013. Blue, Sports Direct and Merrill Lynch declined to comment.",

He is suing Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, for \u00a314m over claims that the retail boss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/09/mike-ashley-sports-direct-15m-jeff-blue\">breached an agreement to pay him a \u00a315m bonus if the company\u2019s share price rose above 800p</a>. In court documents, Blue claims he bolstered the reputation of Sports Direct in the City and used the resignation of Merrill Lynch as corporate broker to show the improvements that needed to be made. He quit Sport Direct last year.</p> <p>Shares in Sports Direct peaked at 922p in April 2014, but closed at just over 300p on Monday. The retailer is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/03/sports-direct-investors-question-and-answer-at-annual-meeting\"> scheduled to publish its half-year results on Thursday</a>, when Ashley will update the market on the company\u2019s performance but also face questions about a controversial arrangement between Sports Direct and a delivery company owned by his brother that is being scrutinised by the Financial Reporting Council. He also faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/six-mps-surprise-visit-sports-direct-shirebrook-warehouse\">allegations that the retailer tried to secretly record a private conversation between MPs who visited its warehouse to check on working conditions.</a></p> <p>Blue alleges that Merrill Lynch resigned as corporate broker to Sports Direct in autumn 2012 after share purchases in August that breached financial regulations. The investment bank was concerned that Sports Direct had provided the funding for its employee benefit trust to buy more than \u00a320m of shares from workers, who had been awarded them as a bonus payment and were looking to cash them in, he claims. Under City rules, companies must inform the market in advance if they want to buy their own shares and must not purchase more than a quarter of the shares traded on a typical day.</p> <p>If the employee trust had not purchased the shares then Sports Direct could have been required to offer them to the wider market, potentially suppressing the company\u2019s share price as it would have increased the number of shares for sale. This would have benefited hedge funds who were betting that the share price would fall as a result of employees looking to cash in their bonuses. </p> <p>In the legal filing, Blue says: \u201cIn autumn 2012, Merrill Lynch withdrew from acting as Sports Direct\u2019s corporate broker. Merrill Lynch did so as a result of concerns that it had regarding Sports Direct\u2019s corporate governance, including the propriety of Sport Direct\u2019s decision in August 2012 to fund the Sports Direct Employee Benefit Trust to buy-back shares for the benefit of Sports Direct\u2019s employee share scheme, without complying with the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation as would ordinarily be required by a buy-back of shares by the Sports Direct itself.\u201d</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, is aware of the allegations. Despite Merrill\u2019s resigning in the autumn 2012, Sports Direct did not confirm its departure until it confirmed Espirito Santo and Oriel Securities as its joint corporate brokers in a statement in February 2013.</p> <p>Blue, Sports Direct and Merrill Lynch declined to comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Australian government is lobbying for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to put more emphasis on coal and nuclear after concerns renewable energy projects were being prioritised. Draft guidelines were circulated by the bank that suggest it should prioritise investments in renewable energy projects across Asia while the Turnbull government has argued fossil fuels will play a significant role in energy generation in the region for decades to come.. Australia joined the AIIB in June 2015, with then-treasurer Joe Hockey pledging an initial $930m to the bank. The AIIB has been working with the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and a range of other banks to satisfy an estimated US$8tn infrastructure shortfall across Asia. The bank is still in the process of creating its identity, but its founding members, including Australia, have declared the AIIB should be a \u201cgreen bank.\u201d The draft guidelines suggest the AIIB should not consider financing nuclear plants at this stage, because the bank would \u201chave to develop the capacity to be involved in such complex and capital-intensive projects\u201d. It says this decision could be revisited if justified. It also suggests the AIIB should prioritise renewable energy generation over fossil fuel power. It says gas projects should be considered during the transition to a lower carbon intensity power mix, while coal and oil-fired power plants should be exceptionally considered \u201cif cleaner technologies are not available for well-founded energy security or affordability reasons\u201d. Members of the AIIB board will meet in Beijing on Thursday and Friday to talk about the draft strategy. Australia will be represented by Treasury official Chris Legg. Australia has a $3.7bn stake in the AIIB, making it the sixth-largest member (with voting power worth 3.8% of all members). China is the largest member, with a $28.8bn stake (and 28.8% voting power). But the Australian government\u2019s desire to have the AIIB\u2019s investment strategy give more priority to fossil fuel projects runs contrary to Australian public opinion. According to an online poll from Market Forces, taken between 15 and 19 August by Essential Research, 62% of Australians would prefer multilateral banks like the AIIB and World Bank to use taxpayer dollars to fund renewable energy projects. The poll, of 1,017 respondents, found just 13% of Australians would prefer money to fund fossil fuel projects (with 26% unsure). It also found that people aged 55 or over were more likely to indicate that they would prefer Australia to be funding renewable energy (66% compared to 59% of people aged 30-55, and 57% of people under 30). The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the government\u2019s energy market policies, for Australia and the region, had to ensure that energy prices were more affordable, while reducing cost-of-living pressures and promoting growth. \u201cWe must have a national energy strategy, and a real national energy market, with the strategy and infrastructure in place to support a new energy advantage and energy security for Australian companies and householders now and in the future,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. A spokesman said the government originally invested in the AIIB to support stronger regional development, saying economic growth was \u201cvital to our region and Australia\u2019s national prosperity\u201d. The AIIB has received submissions from governments, energy companies, non-government organisations and civil society groups about its draft energy investment strategy. According to the Australian, the Minerals Council of Australia has argued in its submission that the draft fails to address \u201cthe central role that adequate access to secure and affordable energy plays, and will continue to play, in providing economic opportunity and better living standards for hundreds of millions of people in east and south Asia\u201d. \u201c[The proposal] rightly endorses the notion of technology neutrality but then proposes the exclusion of some energy technologies and explicit preferment of others,\u201d the MCA submission said. Guardian Australia has contacted the Minerals Council. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, said he was concerned the government was trying to create opportunities for an industry that was in structural decline globally. \u201cWe\u2019ve got banks walking away from funding huge coal projects \u2026 so you\u2019ve got less commercial credit available,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] the government\u2019s trying to push into an area where more credible lenders and financial actors are actually moving away from. And it\u2019s with public money as well.\u201d",
