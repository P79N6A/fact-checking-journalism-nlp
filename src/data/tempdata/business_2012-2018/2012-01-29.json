Germany, as the key player, is resisting calls from Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, for a bigger fund. The Americans, British, Italians and French support her. On Sunday, the Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, joined the chorus calling for the fund to be increased. The likelihood is that it will be boosted to around \u20ac750bn by adding the money from the current temporary bailout fund, but not for a few months, as Berlin is determined to get the stringent new euro rulebook established first. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is to have a separate meeting ahead of the summit with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti. The new Italian leader has quickly emerged as the most formidable challenger to Merkel's hard line in the eurozone. He will argue that a bigger bailout fund is needed to bring down the cost of Italian borrowing, which would help to shore up the euro. Although Greece is not formally slated for discussion, EU policymakers are increasingly pessimistic that Athens can do enough to retrieve a situation permanently teetering on the brink of national insolvency. While Greece and its private creditors appear to be close to clinching a debt-swap deal that would shave \u20ac100bn off the national debt and leave the banks nursing 60% losses on their loans, the troika of officials from the European commission, European Central Bank and IMF have told eurozone governments that Greece is not doing enough to qualify for the second \u20ac130bn bailout agreed last October. The troika report delivered last week demanded a further \u20ac2bn in budget reductions, 150,000 public sector job cuts by 2015 and major reforms of the civil service, judiciary, military, health and education systems. No final decisions on Greece are expected. Instead, the summit is likely to conclude with ringing calls for \"smart growth\" policies and jobs creation in an attempt to placate the markets, public opinion and Belgian trade unions, without pledging any of the means to do so.",

      "bodyText": "Imagine the world economy as a video game, one observer said. You have to complete a number of stages before you win, and the idea is to dodge all the bad stuff that can come at you at any moment. If you really get it wrong, you are zapped and you have to start all over again. The game being played by the policymakers who assembled in Davos last week should be called Global Apocalypse. It now even has its own Super Mario figure in the shape of the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi. Sad to say, it is taking those in charge of the global economy a long time to master the controls. After four and a half years they have made it to the first level but are now stuck there. Missiles rained down on them in 2011 and by the year's end there was a very real fear of a wipeout as the euro crisis deepened. A bit of clever footwork from Super Mario has averted the immediate danger. The ECB has flooded Europe's financial system with cheap money and that has prevented banks from going to the wall. Mark Carney, Canada's central bank governor and chairman of the financial stability board, said on Saturday that the long-term refinancing arrangements meant there was no longer the risk of a repeat of the chaos that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. But as Churchill said after Dunkirk, wars are not won by retreats, however brilliantly executed, and getting beyond level one is still proving challenging, at least for the developed countries in the west, where it has taken unprecedented intervention from central banks to prevent it from being game over. Martin Wolf, of the Financial Times, aptly describes the current state of affairs as a contained depression. In a sense, it should come as no surprise that victory has so far proved elusive. George Osborne is right when he says that recoveries from recessions are always more difficult when the downturns are caused by excessive debt, but this slump has been accompanied by two other shocks: a big technological shift from an analogue to a digital world and a big geographical shift that has seen the centre of gravity of activity move from Europe and North America to Asia. Companies such as Nokia that were viewed as world-beaters only a few years ago are finding out exactly what the economist Joseph Schumpeter meant by creative destruction, but that process also seems to be at work between countries and regions. Even so, there is a way through the labyrinth provided policymakers avoid the obvious pitfalls and work methodically. One problem has been that they have tried to find short cuts over the past few years rather than work their way through the levels in the right sequence. So, if getting to the first level called for urgent and aggressive action to ease monetary policy and shore up the financial system, the next phase should be to deal with the global imbalances that caused the problem in the first place. The fundamental issue in the years leading up to the 2007 financial crisis was not the number of US sub-prime mortgages or even the explosion in derivatives; it was the instability caused by one half of the world running massive current account surpluses and the other half running massive current account deficits. What needs to happen now is that the surplus countries accept the need to increase domestic demand, thereby soaking up exports from the debtor countries, resulting in more balanced growth all round. Once the global economy has enough demand to allow the resumption of solid growth, there will be the right environment to repair the damage to the banking system. Regulation needs to be improved; banks have to provide themselves with bigger capital and liquidity buffers, and a solution has to be found to the \"too big to fail\" issue. Stronger banks will reduce the risk of a second credit crunch, making it easier for private-sector firms to finance expansion or secure working capital. Higher investment by the private sector will mean that governments will no longer have to shoulder so much of the burden of growth. Once a vigorous private-sector recovery is under way, finance ministries can adopt tougher fiscal policies without the risk of pushing their economies back into recession. By this stage, an end to the game is in sight. Governments can use the fruits of stronger growth to finance supply-side improvements to their economy, including extra spending on education, skills and infrastructure. Growth can be made sustainable by championing vibrant green technology sectors. Regulatory regimes can be tinkered with to prevent \"irrational exuberance\". There was little sign in Davos last week of this sort of strategy. In part, that's because some of the measures taken by central banks to prevent catastrophe have had unintended consequences: the impact of quantitative easing on commodity prices and hence on inflation, for example. In part, it has been the result of \"black swan\" events, such as Japan's tsunami. But mostly, it has been due to inertia, complacency and error. Policymakers have put the question of global rebalancing into a box labelled \"too hard to deal with\", and have been dilatory in sorting out the problems of their financial sectors. Instead, whether through a misguided belief in financial orthodoxy or a fear of the bond markets, they have concentrated on heavy-handed and blanket austerity, something that should have come at the very end of the game. The result has been sluggish growth in the west because every element of growth \u2013 public expenditure, consumer spending and investment \u2013 has been choked off simultaneously. If government is to retrench without causing recession, private demand has to rise, but the squeeze on real incomes and a reluctance to invest means this is not happening. The result is an unbalanced global economy, drifting towards a double-dip recession (in the west at least), a dysfunctional financial system and \u2013 a new ingredient in the toxic mix \u2013 a deeply disaffected public. Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund's managing director, spent last week rattling the tin in the hope of getting contributions for a $2 trillion (\u00a31.3tn) war chest. European policymakers were trying to put the finishing touches to a Greek debt deal. Draghi made it clear that providing liquidity to Europe's banks would not be enough on its own to bring an end to the crisis. What does it mean? It means that blanket austerity is not working, and. It means that what was originally a global response to a global crisis has become a series of national responses to national crises. It means that Europe is treating a three-dimensional problem (growth, banks, public finances) with a one-dimensional fix of deficit reduction. It means that the global economy is still struggling to get beyond level one of Global Apocalypse. And if policymakers don't start showing a bit more skill, it will soon be Game Over and time to play Global Apocalypse 2.",

      "bodyText": "Banging the drum for British business can be a thankless job at the best of times; but now, as politicians across the spectrum vie to offer searing critiques of capitalism, it's hardly surprising many firms feel unloved. In London this week, a new campaign will be launched, aimed at persuading the recession-scarred public that \"Business is Good for Britain\". John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which came up with the idea, is keen to separate his members \u2013 typically smaller companies \u2013 from the bonus-wielding City fat cats and boardroom bosses whose behaviour so infuriates the public. \"These are businesses that are civically minded; they're businesses that are part of the local community; they care about what they're doing,\" he says. \"They're passionate about creating wealth and jobs, and doing the right thing.\" And it is creating jobs that most of the British public regard as the main responsibility of business, judging by a survey carried out by polling group ComRes for the BCC. More than two-thirds (72%) of the 2,000 people surveyed thought that a company's first priority should be to its workforce; less than a third said its shareholders should come first. \"We have got to get business-focused in the UK,\" Longworth says. But the problem for him and his members is that at a time when falling living standards and rising unemployment are making life hard, many of the public have come to associate business with the get-rich-quick \"predators\" attacked by Labour leader Ed Miliband in his party conference speech last autumn; and even Cameron has admitted that something has gone awry. Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, says: \"I'm extremely worried that business is being depicted as being in the naughty corner. Business relies on society to provide the talent and skills they need, and society relies on business to create wealth and prosperity.\" Andrew Cave, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, says many smaller firms would agree with the argument that something has gone wrong with the system. \"Our members are the victims of many of the practices that are now being picked on by politicians,\" he says. Small British firms \u2013 with an average of four employees \u2013 often remain small: \"There's a very strong argument to get back to the kind of capitalism that allows companies to grow from the smallest businesses to the biggest.\" British entrepreneurs tend to expand their firm to a certain size and then sell out, often to an overseas investor \u2013 or, in more recent years, a private equity house. So Cave says one of the things that may need a rethink is the government's role in nurturing the growth of firms. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and its predecessor, the DTI, have traditionally taken a hands-off, laissez-faire approach, championing foreign investment and deregulation; but even in the US, cradle of no-holds-barred capitalism, the government has often intervened to block takeovers and champion domestic firms. President Obama has proudly cited the resurgence of American carmakers GM and Chrysler, which were bailed out by Congress at the height of the credit crisis, but have since bounced back. \"When you actually go to the States, there's a huge amount of protectionism: it stems from a pride in having a business that grows out of its local community, and has roots in its community,\" says Cave. Under Lord Mandelson, and now Vince Cable, the department for business has tried to take a more activist approach, and the government's new Enterprise Zones are meant to encourage business expansion, by granting tax breaks to firms that create jobs. But with corporate tax avoidance, bumper bonuses and rising unemployment hitting the headlines, teaching Britain to love business will be a hard sell.",

    "webTitle": "Fast food chains prosper as cash-strapped consumers shun retailers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mealtimes used to revolve around the kitchen table, but the fast-food boom is changing Britain and its high streets, as US food chains Subway, Starbucks and McDonald's set out to conquer a recession-weary nation still hungry for instant gratification. Last week, sandwich chain Subway trumpeted plans to open 600 new stores over the next three years, creating up to 6,000 jobs, while McDonald's said it would create 2,500 jobs this year through new outlets and 24-hour burger flipping. Starbucks, with 300 branches and 5,000 jobs said to be in the pipeline over the next five years, is also in the midst of a high street bun fight that is pitting US imports against flourishing domestic chains such as Greggs and Costa Coffee. With more than 1,400 stores in the UK, Subway is already five times the size it was in 2004, but its founder and self-styled \"sandwich king\" Fred DeLuca, who was in London to speak at a franchisee conference last week, was bullish: \"Everybody eats three times a day; it's only a question of where they choose to eat. The longer-term trends are that people eat out more often.\" His upbeat attitude is at odds with the gloomy atmosphere among high-street retailers who face painful and costly restructuring to shed stores that are no longer economic as shoppers pull in their horns. Analysts say firms like Subway and Greggs, which both offer \u00a33 lunch deals, are weathering the storm because they appeal to hard-pressed consumers who are seeking out affordable treats, like burgers and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e macchiatos, rather than splashing out on new outfits and video games. DeLuca said like-for-like sales at British Subway stores had jumped 10% over the last three months while the success of doughnut-maker Krispy Kreme in 2011 will see it push north into Scotland this year. The coalition's hopes that the private sector will create enough new jobs to soak up the thousands of workers laid off by the public sector has meant that the expansion plans of McDonald's and co have met with ministerial gushing. Nick Clegg toured the burger chain's UK training centre last Wednesday and said the big jobs number \u2013 with half the new positions earmarked for the under 25s \u2013 was \"fantastic news\" not least because the unemployment rate, at 8.4%, is at its highest level since 1995, with young people hit hardest. But like other developed nations, Britain has a well-documented weight problem. Analysts also question whether the economic pain will soon shift to coffee shops and fast-food outlets if the industry \u2013 which is shoehorning outlets into stations, hospitals and petrol stations and seeking franchise partners to reach smaller towns and cities \u2013 fulfils such high octane expansion plans. It is not only the service that is fast in the food-on-the-go sector, as research by the Local Data Company (LDC) shows. In the past five years McDonald's has been overtaken by Subway, only for Greggs, which has 1,500 stores, and in some parts of London two bakeries on the same street, to become the largest chain. DeLuca says Subway is not at risk of over-expanding: \"When we get to 2,000 stores, we'll have about one store for every 30,000 people (in the UK). That's actually quite low density for us. In the US we have one store for every 12,000 people.\" There are more than 47,000 takeaway food outlets in the UK, according to LDC, but less than a third are operated by the big brands and given the tough economic backdrop their success is expected to come at the expense of independent bakers and coffee shop owners. LDC director Matthew Hopkinson questions the need for Greggs and Subway to build huge store networks at a time when others are desperate to shake off costly leases: \"I find it difficult to understand how everyone is going to make money from massive expansion. It suggests that no one ever buys food and eats at home and we know from the success of the supermarkets that's not true.\" Despite the economic downturn, office workers still march to work armed with lattes, while on the domestic front there has been a technological race to create the most seductively shaped (read expensive) coffee machine for kitchen worktops. Jeffrey Young, managing director of research firm Allegra Strategies, which recently published a report examining the growth of branded coffee chains in the UK, said they had shown \"incredible resilience\" throughout the financial crisis. The report said sales at the big coffee chains rose 10% to \u00a32.1bn last year with around 11m cups of coffee drunk in, or carried out, each week. Coffee shops offer Britons a respite from the \"feeling of austerity\" in the current economy, explains Young: \"Coffee shops continue to be important to consumers who visit as part of their desire to socialise and have a regular affordable treat.\" He cautioned, however, that those consumers were already showing signs of cutting back each time they pop in for a pick me up with roughly \u00a33.18 spent per visit last year, compared with \u00a33.50 in 2009. With more than one in seven high street stores already lying empty, property experts do not expect the rapacious growth of food chains to fill that void. Indeed some food chains could find themselves marooned, as it is estimated that about 50% of the UK's shop leases will expire over the next seven years, threatening to accelerate the pace of high street change. \"People want to do a bit of window shopping and have a frothy coffee and a sandwich,\" adds Hopkinson. Take the window shopping out of the equation, and Britain's appetite for fast food might be lost rapidly.",

      "body": "<p>Mealtimes used to revolve around the kitchen table, but the fast-food boom is changing Britain and its high streets, as US food chains Subway, Starbucks and McDonald's set out to conquer a recession-weary nation still hungry for instant gratification.</p> <p>Last week, sandwich chain Subway trumpeted plans to open 600 new stores over the next three years, creating up to 6,000 jobs, while McDonald's said it would create 2,500 jobs this year through new outlets and 24-hour burger flipping.</p> <p>Starbucks, with 300 branches and 5,000 jobs said to be in the pipeline over the next five years, is also in the midst of a high street bun fight that is pitting US imports against flourishing domestic chains such as Greggs and Costa Coffee.</p> <p>With more than 1,400 stores in the UK, Subway is already five times the size it was in 2004, but its founder and self-styled \"sandwich king\" Fred DeLuca, who was in London to speak at a franchisee conference last week, was bullish: \"Everybody eats three times a day; it's only a question of where they choose to eat. The longer-term trends are that people eat out more often.\"</p> <p>His upbeat attitude is at odds with the gloomy atmosphere among high-street retailers who face painful and costly restructuring to shed stores that are no longer economic as shoppers pull in their horns.</p> <p>Analysts say firms like Subway and Greggs, which both offer \u00a33 lunch deals, are weathering the storm because they appeal to hard-pressed consumers who are seeking out affordable treats, like burgers and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e macchiatos, rather than splashing out on new outfits and video games.</p> <p>DeLuca said like-for-like sales at British Subway stores had jumped 10% over the last three months while the success of doughnut-maker Krispy Kreme in 2011 will see it push north into Scotland this year.</p> <p>The coalition's hopes that the private sector will create enough new jobs to soak up the thousands of workers laid off by the public sector has meant that the expansion plans of McDonald's and co have met with ministerial gushing.</p> <p>Nick Clegg toured the burger chain's UK training centre last Wednesday and said the big jobs number \u2013 with half the new positions earmarked for the under 25s \u2013 was \"fantastic news\" not least because the unemployment rate, at 8.4%, is at its highest level since 1995, with young people hit hardest.</p> <p>But like other developed nations, Britain has a well-documented weight problem. Analysts also question whether the economic pain will soon shift to coffee shops and fast-food outlets if the industry \u2013 which is shoehorning outlets into stations, hospitals and petrol stations and seeking franchise partners to reach smaller towns and cities \u2013 fulfils such high octane expansion plans.</p> <p>It is not only the service that is fast in the food-on-the-go sector, as research by the Local Data Company (LDC) shows. In the past five years McDonald's has been overtaken by Subway, only for Greggs, which has 1,500 stores, and in some parts of London two bakeries on the same street, to become the largest chain.</p> <p>DeLuca says Subway is not at risk of over-expanding: \"When we get to 2,000 stores, we'll have about one store for every 30,000 people (in the UK). That's actually quite low density for us. In the US we have one store for every 12,000 people.\"</p> <p>There are more than 47,000 takeaway food outlets in the UK, according to LDC, but less than a third are operated by the big brands and given the tough economic backdrop their success is expected to come at the expense of independent bakers and coffee shop owners.</p> <p>LDC director Matthew Hopkinson questions the need for Greggs and Subway to build huge store networks at a time when others are desperate to shake off costly leases: \"I find it difficult to understand how everyone is going to make money from massive expansion. It suggests that no one ever buys food and eats at home and we know from the success of the supermarkets that's not true.\"</p> <p>Despite the economic downturn, office workers still march to work armed with lattes, while on the domestic front there has been a technological race to create the most seductively shaped (read expensive) coffee machine for kitchen worktops.</p> <p>Jeffrey Young, managing director of research firm Allegra Strategies, which recently published a report examining the growth of branded coffee chains in the UK, said they had shown \"incredible resilience\" throughout the financial crisis. The report said sales at the big coffee chains rose 10% to \u00a32.1bn last year with around 11m cups of coffee drunk in, or carried out, each week.</p> <p>Coffee shops offer Britons a respite from the \"feeling of austerity\" in the current economy, explains Young: \"Coffee shops continue to be important to consumers who visit as part of their desire to socialise and have a regular affordable treat.\"</p> <p>He cautioned, however, that those consumers were already showing signs of cutting back each time they pop in for a pick me up with roughly \u00a33.18 spent per visit last year, compared with \u00a33.50 in 2009.</p> <p>With more than one in seven high street stores already lying empty, property experts do not expect the rapacious growth of food chains to fill that void.

      "bodyText": "Last year, there was an unexpected knock on the front door of Robert Peston's home in Muswell Hill, north London. When he answered, Peston, who has been the BBC's business editor since 2005, was confronted by a reporter from a local news agency. \"He asked me a question about whether I dyed my hair,\" Peston recalls. \"Apparently there was some Facebook group claiming that I did. This is the sort of weird thing that happens now but I can't say I object.\" Over the last four years, since the global financial crisis was triggered by the bursting of the US housing bubble and the domino-like fall of a series of over-leveraged, under-regulated banks, something curious has happened to business coverage. Where once it was the preserve of financial policy wonks and secretive, high-powered bankers who liked to discuss credit default swaps over breakfast, now it has emerged, blinking, into the mainstream. Reporters like Peston, who had previously resigned themselves to being \"in a bit of a ghetto\" (his words) are now being recognised in the street and door-stepped by other journalists concerned about the state of their follicular health. We are, it seems, a nation now obsessed by business and economics. Margin Call, a film starring Kevin Spacey that follows 24 hours in a crisis-hit investment bank, is currently playing in packed cinemas to considerable critical acclaim. In March, the writer John Lanchester publishes Capital, an epic novel examining the fall-out from the economic crash. A six-part docudrama about the city, produced by the team behind the psychological crime drama Luther, is being developed by the BBC. Television audience figures for business and economics reporting have spiked. The circulation of the Economist is actually rising, bucking the general trend of decline in the print media: in 2010, UK sales of the weekly magazine were up 11 per cent at 210,204. And Paul Mason, Newsnight's economics editor, says: \"Our audience research has shown that despite the fact that we've massively upped our coverage of the economy, the audience wants even more. For our audience, who are very professional, Volvo-driving types, they want to see the big business people grilled.\" Stories about the economy \u2013 the bailouts, the losses, the bankers' bonuses \u2013 have jumped to the top of the news agenda, replacing the slots previously occupied by political, sport or showbiz scoops. When the former BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg announced she was joining ITV News as the channel's business editor, the flurry of media attention resembled that of a high-profile football transfer (there was much heated debate about whether she should be allowed to take her Twitter account with her \u2013 in the end, Kuenssberg set up a new one and gained more than 73,000 followers without breaking sweat). Stephanie Flanders, the BBC's economics editor, recalls that her predecessor Evan Davis once complained that he had been in the job for eight years when \"absolutely nothing happened\". \"That's an exaggeration,\" says Flanders, \"but I suspect he spent more time battling to get economics on the news than I ever have. If anything, I have the opposite problem. When there have been days and days of bad economic news leading the nightly bulletins, I'm sometimes the one suggesting they put something else at the top of the running order for a change.\" For the first time in living memory, business correspondents are basking in the warm glow of the limelight. It is not just the hair dye. Every one of them I speak to recounts their own anecdote about the moment they realised their specialism had suddenly become cool. For Jeff Randall, the veteran business journalist and Sky News presenter, it was when cab drivers started asking \"Hey Jeff, what's going to happen to the markets?\" Randall laughs. \"If I could tell you that, I wouldn't be here,\" he jokes, sipping a cup of coffee on the top floor of the Gherkin building in London, overlooking an impressive sweep of the City. \"I'd be out there, making a million.\" For Gillian Tett, a regular television pundit and US managing editor of the Financial Times, it was winning a British Press Award for Journalist of the Year in 2009. \"It was such a great shock,\" says Tett. \"The idea that you'd give that award to someone like me, who was writing about complex finance, when usually it goes to someone for a big royal scoop. I was so convinced I didn't stand a chance of winning, I'd actually contacted the babysitter to say I'd be back before the award was announced. It was so out of leftfield and I think it marked a real shift.\" For Paul Mason, it was when he was first asked for his autograph. \"It only happened last week,\" he says. \"A man came up to me and asked for my autograph for his wife who is a sculptor in Devon.\" Mason sighs. \"I'd rather be in obscurity, to be honest.\" What has driven this upsurge in interest? There have, after all, been recessions and bank collapses before (albeit not on the same scale). But the current financial crisis seems to have captured the public imagination in a particularly potent fashion. According to Peston, the answer lies in the fact that we are now faced with an economic implosion that has forced us to put our hands in our pockets. \"Suddenly it became clear in 2007, when the markets were closing down and then Northern Rock collapsed, that what was happening in these funny organisations called 'banks' mattered to all of us because, as taxpayers, we're bailing them out,\" he says. \"We're getting poorer as a result of their actions. People just got it overnight, about how important understanding business is.\" Tett agrees: \"About five years ago, the only people interested in debt derivatives were complete geeks [but now], as Bill Clinton said, 'It's the economy stupid'. People have realised that the way money goes round the world really matters. \"As journalists, we had the immediate short-term issue, which was that people needed to understand the recession. But I like to think there is a wider civic issue too, because it's outrageous how long the public at large have been so laidback about understanding what goes on. \"It's like food: we used not to care so much about how it was produced but now we want to know what goes in it. In the same way, people need to understand that finance is about understanding how the world operates.\" Laura Kuenssberg says: \"The number one thing our viewers care about is not just how they make a living but what job their kids are going to do. As a reporter, you have to have knowledge of the context and explain it, but also a lot of our job is asking the question the audience wants to ask.\" Because, unlike the worlds of politics or sport \u2013 which can be explained and understood at a basic level in layman's terms \u2013 the language of business is an exercise in cultural semaphore for the uninitiated. The desire of vast swathes of the television audience to get a grip on what is happening means there is an ever-more pressing need for a communicator to act as go-between. In the conjoined spheres of business and economics, the role of the correspondent is paramount. \"Put it this way,\" says Stephanie Flanders, \"when I was studying monetary theory in the early 1990s, I never thought I'd have to explain quantitative easing to 6 million people watching the 10 o'clock news. At the end of a long day, even pronouncing 'quantitative easing' consistently can be a challenge\u2026 I call it 'dumbed-down highbrow'. I don't always manage it, but it's very satisfying when you feel you have said something that the experts would recognise, but the ordinary viewer can understand.\" Faisal Islam, Flanders's opposite number at Channel 4 News, agrees: \"At the heart of the financial crisis is complexity and people are looking for ways in which that complexity can be decoded. It poses a challenge for journalists because, essentially, complexity has been used and abused by financiers and politicians to mask what they didn't know and we, as journalists, have to explain that. \"We have to get to the bottom of what really happened at RBS or HBOS because the people who caused it really haven't been held to account.\" Occasionally, Islam admits, he can get obsessive. He recently got into a Twitter spat with the novelist Linda Grant for using too many acronyms in his coverage. \"But I would say: you as an intelligent person need to know what the EFSF [the European Financial Stability Facility] is doing and why it's going to fail. I'm quite passionate about that.\" As a rule of thumb, the Channel 4 producers insist that Islam's reports should pass \"the editor's mother test\" \u2013 ie that whatever he says should be capable of being digested by the average, non-specialist viewer. Does his own mother understand his broadcasts? Islam laughs. \"Not always, but then I'm not the editor. My dad used to work as an auditor in a bank in Oldham, so he does. In general, the most heart-warming thing someone can say to me is 'I didn't understand what that guy was saying, but then you explained it really clearly.'\u200a\" And, increasingly, business leaders and bank bosses are taking to the airwaves \u2013 either to defend themselves or to show the requisite amount of self-flagellation to ensure their share price stays buoyant. Prior to the financial crisis, most of them would have stayed behind the scenes, actively avoiding headlines. These days, there is a growing awareness that they need to talk to the public who are, in large part, bailing them out. When Robert Peston first became a financial journalist in the 1980s, \"governors of the Bank of England were very shadowy figures who almost never appeared on television or radio. They almost deliberately spoke in coded messages; their speeches were not understood by the majority of people. \"Now these figures are palpably important and terribly influential. Also our viewers are very intuitive \u2013 they sense that globalisation means the ability of elected politicians to determine the situation has been reduced. They want to know more about the figures who do have the impact.\" It helps, of course, that many of the disgraced financiers are such extraordinary characters \u2013 there is nothing better designed to leaven a dry discussion of off-balance sheet securitisation than a Bonfire of the Vanities-style tale of excess, ego and self-destruction. In the UK, there is Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, who lavished \u00a3350m on new office headquarters, enjoyed the use of a private jet and admitted having an affair with a senior colleague in the run-up to the bank's collapse. After RBS's \u00a345bn taxpayer-funded rescue, Goodwin left with a \u00a3342,500 annual pension. In America, there is Dick Fuld, the former CEO of Lehman Brothers, modern art enthusiast, real-estate millionaire and a man with a manner so gruff and brutal, he was nicknamed \"the Gorilla\" on Wall Street. \"It's almost like a soap opera you get locked into,\" says Jeff Randall. \"If I tell the story with dividends and yields, I've lost you, but if I tell the story of Fred Goodwin, it becomes more engaging\u2026 There are all these characters who can be power-mad, slightly crazy, venal, weak \u2013 all the human foibles \u2013 and that would make a good drama, except these people were playing for real and for higher stakes.\" Gillian Tett, a social anthropology graduate who studied marriage rituals in Soviet-era Tajikistan for her PhD, sees exactly the same human networks at work in the world of high finance. \"Finance is not just about numbers,\" she says. \"It's absolutely about social systems and political fabric. For me, learning about finance and the economy was like learning Tajik: they both need to be decoded in some way.\" In the modern media world of 24-hour communication, the act of decoding takes place on multiple platforms at breakneck speed. A typical day for Kuenssberg starts at 7am (for Peston and Flanders, who often appear on Radio 4's Today programme, it can start even earlier), when she will spend a couple of hours reading the papers and catching up with the overnight news before updating her blog or writing for the ITV website. The rest of the morning is spent meeting up with contacts in the city or Westminster unless she is travelling to film in different parts of the country (in the last fortnight, there have been trips to Manchester, Hereford, Edinburgh and a day spent accompanying the chancellor George Osborne to meet manufacturers in Sheffield). By 4pm, she is generally in the ITV's offices on Gray's Inn Road in London preparing for the evening news. At 8pm, she will start editing reports for News at Ten. \"Three or four nights a week, I'll finish work at 10.30pm,\" she says. \"But there really is no such thing as a typical day.\" As Laura Kuenssberg's experience shows, these days the business editor is expected not only to appear on our television screens, but to give their audience a blow-by-blow account of what is happening through social networking sites and blogs. This, in turn, has led to the correspondents becoming personalities in their own right. Although there have been recessions in the past, there has never before been the capacity for journalists to analyse them with such rapidity or to have this level of direct contact with the public \u2013 a public, moreover, that has grown to expect instant news. \"Twitter has become a huge part of what we do,\" says Kuenssberg. \"In quite simple terms, if lots of our audience start using a particular platform, it makes good sense for us to be there too, or else we're missing out. \"Three years ago, I would have the news wires up on my computer screen for breaking stories. Increasingly, people have their Twitter feeds up. The news about Standard and Poor's downgrading the EU bailout fund popped up on my Twitter feed before it was on the wires and before it came into my email inbox because people who are players in stories are on Twitter too. It's not just the chatterati.\" Flanders finds that her blog is \"a good place to flesh out arguments or put out stories and ideas that aren't ever going to make it on to the main news. For Robert Peston and me, I guess the blogs also help to show that we know our stuff, even if we can't always get all of it onto the bulletins or the Today programme.\" Will the rise of the business correspondent continue? Or will we all soon tire of endless doom-and-gloom predictions about the state of the economy? \"I slightly feared that at some point, people like me would be back in the same kind of ghetto as before,\" admits Peston. \"But that hasn't happened yet, fortunately.\" Whether these \"finance geeks\" will ever be forced back into comparative isolation to pore over complicated bar charts and thick textbooks explaining the finer points of negative amortisation, only time will tell. Until then, there is one extremely important question that needs addressing\u2026 \"No, I don't dye my hair, before you ask,\" says Peston, displaying all the anticipatory skills one would expect from the man who broke the story of Northern Rock's collapse. \"It's good Jewish genes. My dad, who's 80, has still got a full head of dark hair.\" There is a pause. \"Yes, if you could put that in, I'd be very grateful.\" Inside track: the correspondents' best sources JEFF RANDALL Sky News business commentator When Money Dies by Adam Fergusson is a brilliant account of how Germany's Weimar Republic was consumed by hyperinflation. This is what happens when government debt runs out of control, investors lose faith in a currency and, in the words of Ludwig von Mises, there is a \"flight to real\". Professor Robert Rowthorn at Cambridge University is one of the few academics with the intellectual capacity and moral integrity to debunk New Labour's myth that mass immigration would make us all richer. His analysis was ignored until it was too late: immigration does increase GDP, but not GDP per head. Insightful, mischievous and amusing, Bill Bonner's The Daily Reckoning is a refreshing antidote to the Gordon Brown school of economics that still insists we can borrow our way out of debt, overspend ourselves into prosperity and keep printing money until all the bills are paid. LAURA KUENSSBERG ITV News business editor Written by an anonymous group of people who all post under the pseudonym Tyler Durden, American financial blog Zero Hedge is a fun and spiky look at the City. Here is the City News, based in London, is also useful for an irreverent insider look. The Financial Times and the Economist are obviously great for comprehensive reporting, and for newcomers trying to figure out how we got here, The Money Machine by Philip Coggan is a straightforward, palatable guidebook. I found it to be like the Lonely Planet for things financial. But there's rarely any substitute for talking to as many people as you can! PAUL MASON BBC Newsnight economics editor American economist Hyman Minsky predicted that financially complex capitalism leads to slumps and predicted what comes after \u2013 a socialised finance system underpinning a much more entrepreneurial and socially just private sector. Robert Skidelsky's biography of Keynes, The Return of the Master \u2013 the economist as philosopher, policymaker, bisexual and cocktail drinker. Few people shaped the 20th century, or understood it, as Keynes did. It's the history of Versailles to Bretton Woods through the eyes of one man. Or Andrea Gabor's The Capitalist Philosophers, a genuinely original take on Taylor, Ford, Carnegie et al. As for blogs, Zero Hedge is the TMZ of economics, and Alphaville of course, which is the Financial Times as it would be if you started from scratch. GILLIAN TETT Financial Times US managing editor The best business blogs are, of course, Alphaville and Martin Wolf's Economist's Forum. Aside from that, Felix Salmon is entertaining, as is Brad de Long. My favourite business books include Roger Lowenstein's When Genius Failed, about long-term capital management, which is dated, but has been a model and inspiration for me in terms of taking an incredibly complex topic and trying to make it accessible to a wider audience, with intellectual credibility. Liaquat Ahamed's book Lords of Finance is truly wonderful too. I don't really have a favourite economist, as such, but I admire the works of Carmen Reinhart and Raghuram Rajan. Andy Haldane at the Bank of England has promoted some important, fresh thinking too. Outside the narrow definition of economics, however, anthropologists who have written fascinating stuff on economics include David Graeber (check out Debt: the First 5,000 Years) and Keith Hart. ROBERT PESTON BBC business editor Twitter is currently the best place for breaking news and even tips about fascinating views. The way to get the most out of it, I think, is to experiment with it, and make your own choices of those who are ahead of the game, or challenging, or insightful. If you read Adam Smith, Walter Bagehot and Keynes, I am not sure you really need to immerse yourself in anything much else. It's all there. Probably my favourite book about business is not what most people would see as a business book. It is Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, which tells you most of what you need to know about why businesses have a life cycle. FAISAL ISLAM Channel 4 economics editor The best book is The Big Short by Michael Lewis. It gets under the skin of how shadowy financial services players made money in ways that impacted upon all of us \u2013 not just consumers and borrowers, but ultimately, the taxpayer. Brilliant access and beautiful style. The best blog is by Felix Salmon at Reuters: a gadfly on all aspects of finance, economics and the overburdened egos of our corporate leaders and the inadequacy of our political leaders to deal with them. And Amartya Sen is a Nobel prize-winning economist who marries economics with philosophy and the ways in which countries run, with roots in ideas of justice and freedom.",

When the former BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg announced she was joining ITV News as the channel's business editor, the flurry of media attention resembled that of a high-profile football transfer (there was much heated debate about whether she should be allowed to take her Twitter account with her \u2013 in the end, Kuenssberg set up a new one and gained more than 73,000 followers without breaking sweat).</p> <p>Stephanie Flanders, the BBC's economics editor, recalls that her predecessor Evan Davis once complained that he had been in the job for eight years when \"absolutely nothing happened\".</p> <p>\"That's an exaggeration,\" says Flanders, \"but I suspect he spent more time battling to get economics on the news than I ever have. If anything, I have the opposite problem. When there have been days and days of bad economic news leading the nightly bulletins, I'm sometimes the one suggesting they put something else at the top of the running order for a change.\"</p> <p>For the first time in living memory, business correspondents are basking in the warm glow of the limelight. It is not just the hair dye. Every one of them I speak to recounts their own anecdote about the moment they realised their specialism had suddenly become cool. For Jeff Randall, the veteran business journalist and Sky News presenter, it was when cab drivers started asking \"Hey Jeff, what's going to happen to the markets?\" Randall laughs. \"If I could tell you that, I wouldn't be here,\" he jokes, sipping a cup of coffee on the top floor of the Gherkin building in London, overlooking an impressive sweep of the City. \"I'd be out there, making a million.\"</p> <p>For Gillian Tett, a regular television pundit and US managing editor of the <em>Financial Times</em>, it was winning a British Press Award for Journalist of the Year in 2009. \"It was such a great shock,\" says Tett. \"The idea that you'd give that award to someone like me, who was writing about complex finance, when usually it goes to someone for a big royal scoop. I was so convinced I didn't stand a chance of winning, I'd actually contacted the babysitter to say I'd be back before the award was announced. It was so out of leftfield and I think it marked a real shift.\"</p> <p>For Paul Mason, it was when he was first asked for his autograph. \"It only happened last week,\" he says. \"A man came up to me and asked for my autograph for his wife who is a sculptor in Devon.\" Mason sighs. \"I'd rather be in obscurity, to be honest.\"</p> <p>What has driven this upsurge in interest? There have, after all, been recessions and bank collapses before (albeit not on the same scale). But the current financial crisis seems to have captured the public imagination in a particularly potent fashion.</p> <p>According to Peston, the answer lies in the fact that we are now faced with an economic implosion that has forced us to put our hands in our pockets.</p> <p>\"Suddenly it became clear in 2007, when the markets were closing down and then Northern Rock collapsed, that what was happening in these funny organisations called 'banks' mattered to all of us because, as taxpayers, we're bailing them out,\" he says. \"We're getting poorer as a result of their actions. People just got it overnight, about how important understanding business is.\"</p> <p>Tett agrees: \"About five years ago, the only people interested in debt derivatives were complete geeks [but now], as Bill Clinton said, 'It's the economy stupid'. People have realised that the way money goes round the world really matters.</p> <p>\"As journalists, we had the immediate short-term issue, which was that people needed to understand the recession. But I like to think there is a wider civic issue too, because it's outrageous how long the public at large have been so laidback about understanding what goes on.</p> <p>\"It's like food: we used not to care so much about how it was produced but now we want to know what goes in it. In the same way, people need to understand that finance is about understanding how the world operates.\"</p> <p>Laura Kuenssberg says: \"The number one thing our viewers care about is not just how they make a living but what job their kids are going to do. As a reporter, you have to have knowledge of the context and explain it, but also a lot of our job is asking the question the audience wants to ask.\"</p> <p>Because, unlike the worlds of politics or sport \u2013 which can be explained and understood at a basic level in layman's terms \u2013 the language of business is an exercise in cultural semaphore for the uninitiated. The desire of vast swathes of the television audience to get a grip on what is happening means there is an ever-more pressing need for a communicator to act as go-between. In the conjoined spheres of business and economics, the role of the correspondent is paramount.</p> <p>\"Put it this way,\" says Stephanie Flanders, \"when I was studying monetary theory in the early 1990s, I never thought I'd have to explain quantitative easing to 6 million people watching the 10 o'clock news. At the end of a long day, even pronouncing 'quantitative easing' consistently can be a challenge\u2026 I call it 'dumbed-down highbrow'. I don't always manage it, but it's very satisfying when you feel you have said something that the experts would recognise, but the ordinary viewer can understand.\"</p> <p>Faisal Islam, Flanders's opposite number at Channel 4 News, agrees: \"At the heart of the financial crisis is complexity and people are looking for ways in which that complexity can be decoded. It poses a challenge for journalists because, essentially, complexity has been used and abused by financiers and politicians to mask what they didn't know and we, as journalists, have to explain that.</p> <p>\"We have to get to the bottom of what really happened at RBS or HBOS because the people who caused it really haven't been held to account.\"</p> <p>Occasionally, Islam admits, he can get obsessive. He recently got into a Twitter spat with the novelist Linda Grant for using too many acronyms in his coverage. \"But I would say: you as an intelligent person need to know what the EFSF [the European Financial Stability Facility] is doing and why it's going to fail. I'm quite passionate about that.\"</p> <p>As a rule of thumb, the Channel 4 producers insist that Islam's reports should pass \"the editor's mother test\" \u2013 ie that whatever he says should be capable of being digested by the average, non-specialist viewer. Does his own mother understand his broadcasts? Islam laughs. \"Not always, but then I'm not the editor. My dad used to work as an auditor in a bank in Oldham, so he does. In general, the most heart-warming thing someone can say to me is 'I didn't understand what that guy was saying, but then you explained it really clearly.'\u200a\"</p> <p>And, increasingly, business leaders and bank bosses are taking to the airwaves \u2013 either to defend themselves or to show the requisite amount of self-flagellation to ensure their share price stays buoyant. Prior to the financial crisis, most of them would have stayed behind the scenes, actively avoiding headlines. These days, there is a growing awareness that they need to talk to the public who are, in large part, bailing them out.</p> <p>When Robert Peston first became a financial journalist in the 1980s, \"governors of the Bank of England were very shadowy figures who almost never appeared on television or radio. They almost deliberately spoke in coded messages; their speeches were not understood by the majority of people.</p> <p>\"Now these figures are palpably important and terribly influential. Also our viewers are very intuitive \u2013 they sense that globalisation means the ability of elected politicians to determine the situation has been reduced. They want to know more about the figures who do have the impact.\"</p> <p>It helps, of course, that many of the disgraced financiers are such extraordinary characters \u2013 there is nothing better designed to leaven a dry discussion of off-balance sheet securitisation than a <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em>-style tale of excess, ego and self-destruction. In the UK, there is Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, who lavished \u00a3350m on new office headquarters, enjoyed the use of a private jet and admitted having an affair with a senior colleague in the run-up to the bank's collapse. After RBS's \u00a345bn taxpayer-funded rescue, Goodwin left with a \u00a3342,500 annual pension.</p> <p>In America, there is Dick Fuld, the former CEO of Lehman Brothers, modern art enthusiast, real-estate millionaire and a man with a manner so gruff and brutal, he was nicknamed \"the Gorilla\" on Wall Street.</p> <p>\"It's almost like a soap opera you get locked into,\" says Jeff Randall. \"If I tell the story with dividends and yields, I've lost you, but if I tell the story of Fred Goodwin, it becomes more engaging\u2026 There are all these characters who can be power-mad, slightly crazy, venal, weak \u2013 all the human foibles \u2013 and that would make a good drama, except these people were playing for real and for higher stakes.\"</p> <p>Gillian Tett, a social anthropology graduate who studied marriage rituals in Soviet-era Tajikistan for her PhD, sees exactly the same human networks at work in the world of high finance. \"Finance is not just about numbers,\" she says. \"It's absolutely about social systems and political fabric. For me, learning about finance and the economy was like learning Tajik: they both need to be decoded in some way.\"</p> <p>In the modern media world of 24-hour communication, the act of decoding takes place on multiple platforms at breakneck speed. A typical day for Kuenssberg starts at 7am (for Peston and Flanders, who often appear on Radio 4's <em>Today </em>programme, it can start even earlier), when she will spend a couple of hours reading the papers and catching up with the overnight news before updating her blog or writing for the ITV website.</p> <p>The rest of the morning is spent meeting up with contacts in the city or Westminster unless she is travelling to film in different parts of the country (in the last fortnight, there have been trips to Manchester, Hereford, Edinburgh and a day spent accompanying the chancellor George Osborne to meet manufacturers in Sheffield). By 4pm, she is generally in the ITV's offices on Gray's Inn Road in London preparing for the evening news. At 8pm, she will start editing reports for <em>News at Ten</em>.</p> <p>\"Three or four nights a week, I'll finish work at 10.30pm,\" she says. \"But there really is no such thing as a typical day.\"</p> <p>As Laura Kuenssberg's experience shows, these days the business editor is expected not only to appear on our television screens, but to give their audience a blow-by-blow account of what is happening through social networking sites and blogs. This, in turn, has led to the correspondents becoming personalities in their own right. Although there have been recessions in the past, there has never before been the capacity for journalists to analyse them with such rapidity or to have this level of direct contact with the public \u2013 a public, moreover, that has grown to expect instant news.</p> <p>\"Twitter has become a huge part of what we do,\" says Kuenssberg. \"In quite simple terms, if lots of our audience start using a particular platform, it makes good sense for us to be there too, or else we're missing out.</p> <p>\"Three years ago, I would have the news wires up on my computer screen for breaking stories. Increasingly, people have their Twitter feeds up. The news about Standard and Poor's downgrading the EU bailout fund popped up on my Twitter feed before it was on the wires and before it came into my email inbox because people who are players in stories are on Twitter too. It's not just the chatterati.\"</p> <p>Flanders finds that her blog is \"a good place to flesh out arguments or put out stories and ideas that aren't ever going to make it on to the main news. For Robert Peston and me, I guess the blogs also help to show that we know our stuff, even if we can't always get all of it onto the bulletins or the <em>Today </em>programme.\"</p> <p>Will the rise of the business correspondent continue? Or will we all soon tire of endless doom-and-gloom predictions about the state of the economy? \"I slightly feared that at some point, people like me would be back in the same kind of ghetto as before,\" admits Peston. \"But that hasn't happened yet, fortunately.\"</p> <p>Whether these \"finance geeks\" will ever be forced back into comparative isolation to pore over complicated bar charts and thick textbooks explaining the finer points of negative amortisation, only time will tell. Until then, there is one extremely important question that needs addressing\u2026</p> <p>\"No, I don't dye my hair, before you ask,\" says Peston, displaying all the anticipatory skills one would expect from the man who broke the story of Northern Rock's collapse. \"It's good Jewish genes. My dad, who's 80, has still got a full head of dark hair.\" There is a pause. \"Yes, if you could put that in, I'd be very grateful.\"</p> <h2><strong>Inside track: the correspondents' best sources</strong></h2> <p><strong>JEFF RANDALL Sky News business commentator</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk:80/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781906964443\" title=\"\"><strong><em>When Money Dies</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>by <strong>Adam Fergusson </strong>is a brilliant account of how Germany's Weimar Republic was consumed by hyperinflation.

      "bodyText": "A tobacco giant behind three of the UK's leading brands is under investigation after millions of its cigarettes were shipped to a firm linked to a billionaire accused of playing a key part in suppressing the popular uprising in Syria. The development has revived concerns about the ability of \"big tobacco\" to police its distribution networks \u2013 third party agents who move its product around the world. Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which owns the Silk Cut, Mayfair and Benson &amp; Hedges brands, faces questions over its relationship with a firm associated with Rami Makhlouf, who is subject to European Union and US sanctions.

      "bodyText": "When facing a freefalling economy in 2008-9 the Brown/Darling team in Downing Street, and the Bank of England, which was in even closer physical proximity to the financial crisis, decided to throw everything they could muster into stabilising the situation, including the kitchen sink. There were many uneasy moments, and Alistair Darling has already recorded his criticisms of Gordon Brown and the governor of the Bank of England for posterity. Nevertheless, he gave Brown full credit for playing a key role in the G20 rescue operation of April 2009, saying that it would not have happened without the prime minister's dedication to the task. Other world leaders also praised Brown. When the Conservative-dominated coalition arrived on the scene in summer 2010, unlike the Obama administration, it took an immediate decision to begin to withdraw the stimulus that had kept the show on the road \u2013 and which, indeed, had contributed to a burgeoning recovery. The position now is that the US economy, for all the doubts the widely respected economist Paul Krugman had about the size of the stimulus, is indeed recovering, albeit slowly. Why, the recovery has received Krugman's tentative blessing. The same cannot be said for the UK where, as predicted by the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, the economy is suffering from the premature withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus. Now, it is always important to try to see the other side's point of view. As far as I can work out, the respectable case for withdrawal is that it was obvious that at some stage the government would need to tighten policy, in response to the widespread belief that the fiscal situation was unsustainable in the medium term. As one veteran policy adviser put it: \"There was a need to act early, in order to avoid being forced by the markets to do more than was really necessary.\" This adviser had no political axe to grind. But the new government did. George Osborne, whom I continue to regard as the most dangerous chancellor I have known, took the cynical political calculation that it would pay to produce maximum pain in the early days, in the hope that the sunny uplands would be sighted in time for a 2015 election. He took the measures, but they did not produce the improvement in the finances on which he placed a very public bet. Ed Balls was right, but has so far received little credit for it. In my opinion the opposition needs to bear in mind the advice of Corporal Jones from Dad's Army: \"Don't panic\". Despite the soundness of their judgment since the 2010 election, Labour leaders are being blamed for placing so much faith in the City of London to provide the revenue to balance the books. The banking crisis dealt with that. Labour was not responsible for the Great Recession, and was doing its best to emerge from it. If Labour wins in 2015 \u2013 stranger things have happened \u2013 it is generally assumed that it will have a tough time. But my impression from talking to people almost everywhere I go is that, while Labour leaders are right to avoid making too many commitments at this stage, statements about not reversing cuts they have opposed make people wonder why they should vote Labour at all. Labour should stick to its guns. I cannot see the coalition's remarkable popular support lasting. Indeed, if the government goes ahead with its plans to all but privatise the NHS, we may have seen nothing yet. However, there also appears to be rising panic in the coalition's ranks. The Lib Dems must have consciences as guilty as anything ever thought up by the Jesuits over their commitment to the chancellor's policy. Clearly Nick Clegg would like a rather different budget from that being planned. For reasons not difficult to fathom, the relatively poor have a higher \"propensity to consume\" (a favourite piece of economists' jargon!) than the better-off. So, to the extent that the chancellor listens to Clegg on tax thresholds, there may be a minor alleviation of the fiscal squeeze. But the impact will be limited because the very poor, who do not pay income tax, are being hit by the frontal attack on welfare. The evidence seems to mount that the stimulus in this country was withdrawn too soon. Even the credit rating agencies are now concerned about excessive austerity. Having boxed himself in, the chancellor has had to resort to strange partners in order to encourage investment. I never thought I would see the day when a Conservative chancellor would approach a communist Chinese sovereign wealth fund to invest in Britain's infrastructure. Of course, Britain once had its own chance to build a sovereign wealth fund, with the endowment of North Sea oil and gas in the 1970s. But in the end short-term considerations dominated, both under Labour and Conservative governments. The story is told in The Official History of North Sea Oil and Gas by the economist Alex Kemp (Routledge), which sounds like a dry history, but is brilliantly written. Kemp notes: \"The role of an oil fund as an instrument to produce sustainable income and intergenerational equity \u2026 deserved more attention than it received.\" I'll say! As one member of Thatcher's cabinet cynically observed: \"We used North Sea revenues to finance unemployment.\"",
