First, no seller in a big IPO ever expects to squeeze out the last drop of value. Second, the \u00a3750m-\u00a31bn guesses rest heavily on the wild trading that occurred after Royal Mail\u2019s listing at 330p in October last year, which pushed the price as high as 600p in January (versus 405p today). But, as Myners argues, nobody could have predicted that Chris Hohn\u2019s hedge fund would turn up and, briefly, try to buy every share it could gets its hands on. Hohn\u2019s fund, incidentally, sold the lot within months for a large profit. Myners thinks the government might have got the float away at 350p-360p. That seems about right. No underpricing is good for taxpayers, of course, but a 6%-9% miss is not a hanging offence. Business secretary Vince Cable has taken a political beating over Royal Mail. He is entitled to revel in the finding that the sale was \u201ca complex exercise executed with considerable professionalism\u201d. That\u2019s the politics out of the way.

Or, more politely, it has \u201cinherent limitations\u201d. You bet it does. The worst flaw \u2013 painfully obvious at Royal Mail \u2013 is that so-called \u201cpilot fish\u201d are not incentivised to bid hard for shares. These marine creatures are actually City fund managers recruited at an early stage to test demand for stock and to debate price. They have their uses as it\u2019s generally good to have investors who know what they are buying. But there\u2019s a glaring drawback from the point of view of the seller: the people who are debating-cum-advising on the correct price are the very people who you are planning to sell to. Worse, the pilot fish are promised preferential allocations of stock at the end of the process. Worse still, the City convention is to announce a pricing range for a flotation, which amounts to setting a maximum before all interested parties have shown their hand. No auction house would operate that way. \u201cThe lack of motivation for pilot fish in the Royal Mail IPO to show price leadership during bookbuilding contributed significantly to the deficiencies of the process,\u201d says the report. Myners\u2019s solutions include injecting more automation into bookbuilding to make it more like an auction; being more flexible on the price range; and giving independent analysts access to information so they can write decent research. The last, in particular, seems critical. Current City practice too often involves hiring a full brigade of advisers, with the effect that those firms\u2019 analysts are gagged for a month and the quality of debate about price suffers.

The airport is operating close to capacity and a new runway, if it is ever approved, is at least a decade away. Would Heathrow\u2019s dominant carrier be allowed to become even more dominant? Actually, it probably would. Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are even more dominant in their own backyards. The bigger obstacles \u2013 assuming Walsh is prepared to put a decent bid on the table \u2013 are the Irish government, with a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, and Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s Ryanair, which has 29.9%. The Irish government might be persuaded with a few guarantees over flights to Ireland. O\u2019Leary is less predictable given that his own pursuit of Aer Lingus, in the face of objections from Europe, has been something of an obsession. But O\u2019Leary is also commercially minded. He might regard a sale to IAG at a whizzy price as a neat escape from the Brussels bureaucrats.

      "bodyText": "Government plans to rip \u201cthe cloak of secrecy\u201d from corrupt officials who hide stolen money in the UK, fail to tackle an obvious loophole in the London property market, say MPs and campaigners. The concerns were raised as the government unveiled a long delayed anti-corruption plan published on Thursday. Matthew Hancock, the Conservative business minister, faced questions in the Commons about why the new rules aimed at improving transparency of company ownership would not apply to the property market. Announcing the plan, he said: \u201cThis is the first UK anti-corruption plan that brings together actions across government. It makes significant steps forward \u2026 but nobody would say the job is complete.\u201d The government has promised to establish a central register of company owners, open to public scrutiny and not just accountants. The new rules make it a crime to provide false information or refuse to disclose the true owner of a company. At the G8 summit held in 2013 at Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, David Cameron promised to strip away \u201cthe cloak of secrecy\u201d around shell companies, which are often located in offshore tax havens. MPs across the political spectrum voiced concern that the government plan would not stop corrupt foreign officials or business people from sinking ill-gotten gains into the London housing market, because there would be no requirement to disclose ownership of property. About 45% of London homes worth more than \u00a32m are owned by overseas trusts, according to campaigners. The Labour MP Kerry McCarthy questioned why the government had left this gap. \u201cIs it not in public interest we should know who the beneficial owners are? Doesn\u2019t he [Hancock] think the time for action is now?\u201d The Conservative MP Stephen Barclay called the property loophole one of the \u201cnotable omissions of the plan\u201d. Robert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International, said the failure to include property was \u201ca really obvious\u201d gap. \u201cIf a house in London is owned by an offshore trust, absolutely no one has any idea who owns it.\u201d Hancock told MPs the government would look at expanding the register of beneficial ownership, without giving further details. He also announced that the government was creating a body to tackle bribery and money laundering, by bringing together anti-corruption investigators from the National Crime Agency, the Metropolitan police and City of London police into one unit. The National Crime Agency, dubbed the British FBI, was created in 2013 to tackle the UK\u2019s most serious crimes, including fraud, money laundering, organised crime and border policing. It replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other bodies, but was given a budget smaller by 20% than that of its predecessors. The bribery and corruption unit, housed within the NCA, will come into operation in April, but many fear it could take much longer for the new agency to find its feet. \u201cThe execution and integration risks are very, very, high,\u201d said Barrington. \u201cOne can make a case why it needs to be done, but it needs to be done very well. Otherwise there is a risk that cases might be severely interrupted or dropped\u201d. Barclay, who used to have a senior anti-money laundering role at the City regulator, raised concerns that the new unit would struggle to attract qualified officers, because NCA terms and conditions were not as good as there were for the regular police. He also said anti-corruption officers faced \u201ca pernicious time limit\u201d of just 38 days to prove complex corruption cases. The MP told the Guardian this December that the government\u2019s anti-corruption plan failed to address many flaws in the UK\u2019s anti-money laundering regime. Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, at the Royal United Services Institute, said that the private sector was also concerned about budget cuts to public anti-corruption agencies. He called on government agencies to work more closely with banks and businesses to make money-laundering investigations more effective. \u201cWe are not using the private sector as effectively as we could do. Private companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year [on anti-corruption measures] \u2013 way more than the government could ever dream of. There is an impressive aspirational list of things to do. But are they really doing to manage, across all these different departments to do all these 60 different things over a 12-15-month period that includes a general election?\u201d Observers have broadly welcomed the announced measures but have questioned the government\u2019s ability to implement the sprawling plan with its 66 different targets spread across multiple Whitehall fiefdoms. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 December 2014. An earlier version described Matthew Hancock as \u201cthe Liberal Democrat business minister\u201d.",

It makes significant steps forward \u2026 but nobody would say the job is complete.\u201d</p> <p>The government has promised to establish a central register of company owners, open to public scrutiny and not just accountants. The new rules make it a crime to provide false information or refuse to disclose the true owner of a company.</p> <p>At the G8 summit held in 2013 at Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, David Cameron promised to strip away <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24752633\">\u201cthe cloak of secrecy\u201d</a> around shell companies, which are often located in offshore tax havens.</p> <p>MPs across the political spectrum voiced concern that the government plan would not stop corrupt foreign officials or business people from sinking ill-gotten gains into the London housing market, because there would be no requirement to disclose ownership of property. About 45% of London homes worth more than \u00a32m are owned by overseas trusts, according to campaigners.</p> <p>The Labour MP Kerry McCarthy questioned why the government had left this gap. \u201cIs it not in public interest we should know who the beneficial owners are? Doesn\u2019t he [Hancock] think the time for action is now?\u201d</p> <p>The Conservative MP Stephen Barclay called the property loophole one of the \u201cnotable omissions of the plan\u201d.</p> <p>Robert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International, said the failure to include property was \u201ca really obvious\u201d gap. \u201cIf a house in London is owned by an offshore trust, absolutely no one has any idea who owns it.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock told MPs the government would look at expanding the register of beneficial ownership, without giving further details.</p> <p>He also announced that the government was creating a body to tackle bribery and money laundering, by bringing together anti-corruption investigators from the National Crime Agency, the Metropolitan police and City of London police into one unit.</p> <p>The National Crime Agency, dubbed the British FBI, was created in 2013 to tackle the UK\u2019s most serious crimes, including fraud, money laundering, organised crime and border policing. It replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other bodies, but was given a budget smaller by 20% than that of its predecessors.</p> <p>The bribery and corruption unit, housed within the NCA, will come into operation in April, but many fear it could take much longer for the new agency to find its feet.</p> <p>\u201cThe execution and integration risks are very, very, high,\u201d said Barrington. \u201cOne can make a case why it needs to be done, but it needs to be done very well. Otherwise there is a risk that cases might be severely interrupted or dropped\u201d.</p> <p>Barclay, who used to have a senior anti-money laundering role at the City regulator, raised concerns that the new unit would struggle to attract qualified officers, because NCA terms and conditions were not as good as there were for the regular police.</p> <p>He also said anti-corruption officers faced \u201ca pernicious time limit\u201d of just 38 days to prove complex corruption cases.</p> <p>The MP told the Guardian this December that the government\u2019s anti-corruption plan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/07/city-london-status-stolen-money-haven-stain-uk-regulator-mp-stephen-barclay\">failed to address many flaws in the UK\u2019s anti-money laundering regime</a>.</p> <p>Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, at the Royal United Services Institute, said that the private sector was also concerned about budget cuts to public anti-corruption agencies.</p> <p>He called on government agencies to work more closely with banks and businesses to make money-laundering investigations more effective. \u201cWe are not using the private sector as effectively as we could do. Private companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year [on anti-corruption measures] \u2013 way more than the government could ever dream of. There is an impressive aspirational list of things to do. But are they really doing to manage, across all these different departments to do all these 60 different things over a 12-15-month period that includes a general election?\u201d</p> <p>Observers have broadly welcomed the announced measures but have questioned the government\u2019s ability to implement the sprawling plan with its 66 different targets spread across multiple Whitehall fiefdoms.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 December 2014. An earlier version described Matthew Hancock as \u201cthe Liberal Democrat business minister\u201d.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u2018I like the idea of pushing the boundaries,\u201d says Ronny Gottschlich, the 40-year-old managing director of the UK arm of Lidl. But the German discounter is not just testing out a few new shopping ideas: together with compatriot chain Aldi it is changing the way we shop and threatening to end the big supermarkets\u2019 stranglehold on Britain\u2019s \u00a3175bn-a-year grocery market. Figures out this week showed takings through the Lidl tills over the last three months are up 18% on last year. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, meanwhile, have all seen sales suffer as shoppers realise they can buy very similar products at far lower prices in the discounters\u2019 aisles. At this time of the year discount store shoppers have traditionally traded up to the main chains to treat themselves to more expensive food: but in 2013 that pattern changed. Tesco and Morrisons in particular took a hammering last Christmas as customers decided there was little to be gained, other than a lighter wallet. Gottschlich thinks the same is happening this year. Sales at established Lidl stores, he says, were up by about 20% in the first week of December. \u201cWe have an increasing number of shoppers coming through our doors and they are going to keep doing exactly the same thing to do their Christmas shopping with us.\u201d The number of Lidl visits in early December was up 12%-15% and each time customers spent an average 8% more. The 612-store chain, which is expected to hit sales of \u00a34bn this year \u2013 up from \u00a33.3bn in 2013 \u2013 has already sold 413,000 bottles of its cut price champagne, twice as many as last Christmas. Double the number of lobsters have flown out of the freezers, while sales of sliced smoked reindeer meat are also going well with 7,000 boxes going through the checkouts so far. Such delicacies are designed to grab attention and persuade more middle-class shoppers to pop in and give the store a try. And it appears to be working, with nearly a quarter of Lidl\u2019s shoppers coming from the wealthier demographics \u2013 a couple of percentage points higher than last year. But as Gottschlich points out, most growth is coming from everyday items such as fresh fruit and vegetables and from people just buying more of their weekly goods in Lidl rather than just nipping in for a few items \u2013 what grocery executives call a \u201ctop-up shop\u201d.\u201cPeople are doing more and more of their weekly shop with us,\u201d he says. Morrisons boss Dalton Philips reckons that unless the big supermarkets cut prices and accept lower profits, the rout of the big four will continue \u2013 and that the \u00a38 of every \u00a3100 spent on UK groceries that goes to Lidl and Aldi will soon become \u00a325. He sees their arrival on the supermarket scene as similar to the emergence of low-cost airlines in the 1990s. Now nearly 50% of UK air passengers choose the no-frills operators \u201cbecause the legacy airlines don\u2019t react fast enough\u201d. Gottschlich, who grew up in East Germany, credits Lidl\u2019s runaway growth to a sustained effort to become much more British \u2013 stocking more fresh fruit, vegetables and meat from Britain and introducing bakeries and more chilled foods which cater to UK tastes. He said perceptions of the company have changed not just because it has adapted its product range, but because it has made a big effort to explain that by stocking a limited number of items in very similar stores it is able to work extremely efficiently and keep prices low. \u201cOne thing people have realised is that with too much choice, someone is charging you for that ... We have let people know there isn\u2019t anything happening behind the scenes we couldn\u2019t explain. We are just a simply organised business trying to save on all the things the customer can\u2019t eat or taste.\u201d Aldi is growing even faster than Lidl and expanding the range of products it sells \u2013 from 900 to more than 2,500 in the past few years \u2013 but Gottschlich says his business will stick to its tight selection of 1,550-1,650 products because that is the best way to keep prices low. The big four, stock 30,000-40,000 lines. Gottschlich\u2019s aim is to continually tweak the Lidl range, depending on the time of year and consumer trends, so shoppers gradually increase the proportion of their weekly shop they buy in Lidl. \u201cWe were previously known as a price-aggressive German discounter and we are becoming known for fresh food and quality. We are now a British family supermarket,\u201d he insisted. Others may challenge that assertion and not all the reviews of its foods are flattering, but the idea of the privately owned German business as a British consumer champion has sufficiently taken hold to enable Lidl to launch an inventive marketing campaign, using customer recommendations picked from Twitter. Its Christmas TV ad, only its second in the UK, is based around a free Christmas dinner for locals in Hertfordshire who ponder whether the food is from Marks &amp; Spencer or Waitrose before being told they\u2019ve be dining on Lidl. The same idea is behind a pop-up restaurant in London\u2019s trendy Brick Lane this month where a Michelin-starred chef has created a menu based on Lidl ingredients. Diners only find that out when they get the bill. The hope is that local trendies will be so impressed they\u2019ll take to social media to talk about it and help to raise Lidl\u2019s profile further. Clearly the social media-led campaign has gained some traction because Gottschlich has dumped Lidl\u2019s traditional house-to-house promotional leaflet drop without any negative impact on sales. The flyers, he says, are not coming back. It was a change in tactics viewed as controversial at the head office of the Schwarz Group \u2013 Lidl\u2019s parent group \u2013 in Neckarsulm, south west Germany: \u201cQuite a few people from the international headquarters asked whether we had done the right thing,\u201d says Gottschlich. \u201cWe started the campaign at the start of September and the feedback, if you look at Twitter and Facebook, has been incredibly positive. It\u2019s going to continue, as we really believe that the strongest voice and advocate for us is our customers.\u201d But holding on to those new Lidl customers in the year ahead may not be easy. The battle with the big four has been going Lidl\u2019s and Aldi\u2019s way in the past two years. Lidl is aiming to open up to 50 new stores a year and Gottschlich says he gets up to 50 emails a week from people asking Lidl to open in their town. But new sites are not easy to find and the big four supermarkets are beginning to get their fightback organised. Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have all cut prices on basics such as bread, milk and eggs to make themselves more competitive with the discounters while Morrisons has launched a loyalty card that claims to match the discounters on price. Next year Tesco is widely expected to use its position as Britain\u2019s biggest grocer \u2013 despite its recent problems it is still almost twice the size of its closest rivals Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 to seriously slash prices. Analysts believe the discounters\u2019 easy ride may be coming to an end.Gottschlich insisted: \u201cWe won\u2019t be beaten on price.\u201d He said Lidl had already cut prices on some items to maintain the differential with traditional supermarkets and he will cut again if he has to. He is thinking even further ahead: as we chatted in early December he had just come from a meeting to discuss what Lidl will be selling in Christmas 2015.",

Even a late fall in the oil price failed to upset investors, while both Russia and Greece seemed slightly more stable situations after recent volatility. Better than expected UK retail sales helped support the UK market, and some mixed economic signals from the US - poor services PMI, positive weekly jobless claims - only served to convince traders that dearer borrowing would not be on the cards for a while. The surprise news that the Swiss Central Bank had introduced negative interest rates also failed to upset the markets. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 129.52 points or 2.04% higher at 6466.00 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.79% to 9811.06 France\u2019s Cac climbed 3.35% to 4249.49 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.65% to 19,060.99 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.4% better at 10,391.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.47% to 874.69 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 262 points or 1.5% higher. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thank\u2019s for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back in the morning. Speaking of oil, it has lost early gains with Brent crude now down 1.8% at around $60 a barrel. Part of this is due to reports that a port strike in Nigeria has ended, allowing crude shipments to be resumed at a time when there is oversupply and falling demand. The recent oil price slump has claimed another victim, as Venezula gets its debt rating cut: In a move that will surely boost the argument that austerity is only counterproductive, the International Federation for Human Rights says no sector in Greek society has been spared from the hugely negative impact of belt-tightening measures. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Unveiled in Athens this afternoon, the 80-page report presents an excoriating case against austerity. Cost cutting measures had not only impacted on Greeks\u2019 pockets, they had curbed individuals\u2019 basic human rights and had a hugely negative effect on every sector in society \u201cfrom healthcare and labour, to freedom of expression and the right to express discontent through peaceful public protest.\u201d Questions had to be asked about those who were responsible for such human rights violations \u2013 and whether, ultimately, such bodies/persons could be held accountable. \u201cInternational financial institutions involved in the negotiation and financing of Greece\u2019s first and second economic assistance programmes, most notably the International Monetary Fund (IMF), must also be subject to scrutiny,\u201d it wrote. \u201cAs a subject of international law, the IMF is required to consider whether or not its actions or omissions constitute, or contribute to, violations of customary international rules , including in the field of human rights.\u201d Meanwhile, deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos has been eager to appear optimistic following last night\u2019s less than convincing (for the government) parliamentary vote. The socialist leader announced today that there was still plenty of room for \u201cmature choices to be made\u201d when the last round of the presidential vote is held on December 29. Extending an olive branch he suggested that a cross-party negotiating team be set up to deal with the country\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors. More from the Reuters interview with Alexis Tsipras, who said he would indeed cancel austerity programmes agreed by the current government if his Syriza party is elected, but would negotiate debt relief with its lenders. Reuters reports: Saying he was committed to keeping Greece in the euro, Tsipras told Reuters that Europe should cut or erase a big chunk of Greek debt. He said loans from the IMF must be paid but he would seek an extension to maturities on bonds held by the ECB. Syriza - which is expected to win if early elections were held now - has long said it would cancel Greece\u2019s EU/IMF bailout and demand debt relief if it came to power but the comments were the first time Tsipras has clearly spelled out the party\u2019s plan for debt renegotiation. \u201c\u2019Negotiation\u2019 means that we want an agreed solution,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview at his Syriza party\u2019s headquarters, adding he expected a \u201ctough\u201d stance from European leaders initially. \u201cRegarding the debt and the loan agreement which we will renegotiate: We have no intention to make unilateral moves unless they force us to make unilateral moves although I believe that no one will force us to make unilateral moves because no one will benefit from such a development, in the heart of Europe.\u201d He also ruled out cooperating with the conservative and centre-left parties in Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 ruling coalition to avoid elections, saying a wider political consensus would be achieved after a national election is held. Over in Greece, the Athens stock market has regained some ground after Reuters reported that the leader of opposition party Syriza wanted to keep the country in the euro if he won any forthcoming election. The government\u2019s decision to bring forward a presidential poll which, if it loses, could cause snap elections raised the prospect of Syriza gaining power. This rattled investors, since its leader Alexis Tsipras stands against the austerity associated with the Greek bailout package and seemed likely to rip up the deal or leave the European Union. But Reuters has reported Tsipras saying he wanted a negotiated solution with the EU to the debt relief problem and wanted to keep Greece in the euro. The latest Philadelphia business survey has also disappointed. The index of current activity dropped sharply from 40.8 in November to 24.5 compared to estimates of a level of 26. But firms were generally optimistic about the future, although there were worries about employment and rising healthcare costs. And here\u2019s some less good news from the US economy, which ironically eases the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise rates and therefore will probably be received positively. The US services sector expanded in December at its slowest rate since February, with the Markit initial purchasing managers index coming in at 53.6, down from 56.2 in November and well below expectations of a rise to 56.9 according to a Reuters poll. Markit\u2019s composite PMI - manufacturing and services - hit 53.8 in December, down from 56.1 in November. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The extent of the slowdown suggests that economic growth in the fourth quarter could come in below 2% which, with the exception of the downturn caused by adverse weather in the first quarter, would be the worst performance for two years. The US markets have opened and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up more than 1%, as investors continue to warm to the Federal Reserves desire to be \u201cpatient\u201d about raising US interest rates. With the dollar down and oil steadying, markets are rallying after their recent downward dip. Concerns that an early US rate rise could help derail global growth have eased, helping the overall mood. So the Dow is up 227 points at the moment, while the FTSE 100 is up 105 points or 1.6%. Germany\u2019s Dax has moved more than 2% higher while France\u2019s Cac is around 3% better. The rouble has also gained against the dollar after Wednesday\u2019s moves by the Russian central bank to support the financial system and try to halt the slide in the currency, as well as President Putin\u2019s annual press conference (which we live blogged here). On the corporate front Aer Lingus shares have soared on reports that British Airways owner IAG may be interested in bidding. Aer Lingus is up nearly 9% at the moment, valuing the business at around \u20ac1bn, following the FT story. Meanwhile IAG has jumped nearly 4% to 461p. Any deal would need the backing of Ryanair, which holds a 29.9% stake in Aer Lingus following its own failed bids for the airline. If you are in need of a diversion over the next few days, you could try our bumper business Christmas quiz, which you can find here. Following last night\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting which hinted at interest rises next year as the economy recovers, there is some more upbeat data. The number of Americans filing new unemployment benefit claims fell unexpectedly last week, dropping by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 289,000. This was lower than the 295,000 expected by economists, and down from 295,000 the previous week (revised from 294,000). It was also the lowest figure for six weeks. This is likely to support the US market when it opens, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures indicating a 182 point rise at the open after a 288 gain overnight. Later come Markit\u2019s services and composite PMI data and the latest Philadelphia Fed report. The surprise Swiss move to introduce negative interest rates could be a sign that the European Central Bank will proceed with some form of quantitative easing next month, says Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com. There are some fundamental reasons for the move, she said: Cutting rates is justified to bring Switzerland out of deflation. Its annual rate of inflation is -0.1%, however this could fall further after producer and import prices slid 1.6% year on year last month. The Swiss National Bank\u2019s Jordan gave explicit reasons for the cut in rates: to weaken the Swissie, to overcome deflation [and] to help spur growth, which is expected to be on the weak side in the first quarter. But she added: While the internal factors justify the SNB\u2019s actions, the timing of the move was surprising. The market had expected a move on rates sometime in January; however recent market volatility, and the sell-off in the rouble, threatened the 1.20 peg in euro/franc, which triggered this move. Other external factors included the ECB and the Fed. The SNB has a close relationship with the ECB, and if the SNB found it necessary to hike rates now it could have been designed to precede a move by the ECB in January. In fact the negative rate will only come into effect on the 22 January, which corresponds with the ECB\u2019s next meeting. Thus, today\u2019s move by the SNB suggests that the ECB may be getting close to QE, and since QE could weaken the EUR, the SNB had to act now to protect its euro/franc peg. We think that this move should keep euro/franc safely out of the 1.20 danger zone for now; however in the longer term we think the SNB will need to embark on more action to stem the franc\u2019s appreciation. Firstly, if this move by the SNB is a sign that QE is on its way from the ECB then we could see further downward pressure on the euro. Secondly, downward pressure on the euro could be compounded by last night\u2019s fairly hawkish Fed, which may cap euro/dollar gains. If the euro/franc peg is pressured once again in the coming days and weeks then the SNB has said that it will defend the peg, as it is an important policy tool. If we see another move back below 1.2010... watch out, the SNB may buy euro\u2019s in size to get this pair out of the danger zone. Time for a recap. Switzerland\u2019s central bank has imposed negative interest rates on bank deposits for the first time since the 1970s, as the Russian currency crisis causes ructions around the globe. The surprise move is meant to deter banks from holding francs at the National Bank\u2019s electronic vaults, and to buy something else with them. The Swiss franc has weakened. But the move may not be enough to prevent money surging into Switzerland in search of safety. The news came at 7am GMT. The Swiss National Bank has blamed rouble volatility for the move, and promised further action if necessary. SNB chairman Thomas Jordan told a news conference in Zurich: \u201cRapidly mounting uncertainty on the financial markets has substantially increased demand for safe investments. The worsening of the crisis in Russia was a major contributory factor in this development.\u201d Economists have predicted that that the SNB may need to intervene in the FX markets again, to preserve its cap of 1.2 francs to the euro. Angelo Ranaldo, Professor at the University of St Gallen, has warned that the move could spark a dangerous property bubble instead. As this Q&amp;A explains, the move only affects deposits placed at the SNB by commercial banks. In other news.... The Russian currency is hovering around 61 roubles to the US dollar, broadly flat today, after Vladimir Putin predicted that the Russian economy will recover in two years. Putin press conference: \u2018economy will rebound within two years\u2019 \u2013 live The Fitch rating agency, though, has warned that this week\u2019s turmoil has hurt the economy; it could downgrade Russia\u2019s credit rating next month. European stock markets are up, after the Federal Reserve pledged it would be patient about raising US interest rates. A former Greek PM has warned that snap elections in January could trigger its exit from the eurozone.... ..while the latest unemployment data shows that one in four adults are out of work. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has offered Greece an olive branch - telling MPs in Berlin that its economy is in better shape then expected. \u201cReforms are beginning to bear fruit for the people of Greece. The labour market reforms have made the country more competitive ... This year Greece will have a budget deficit within European Union rules.\u201d Not much comfort to those who have suffered from six years of austerity, I suspect. Over in Greece, the political wheels are turning after MPs rejected the government\u2019s nominee for the presidency last night, increasing the chance that the administration could collapse. One of Greece\u2019s former prime ministers, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, has warned that a snap election would inexorably push the country out of the Eurozone. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The elder statesman issued the clarion call as he held talks with the leader of the small Independent Greeks party (ANEL) Panos Kammanos. With its 12 MPs, ANEL is now among those now holding the keys to avoiding an early ballot. The 91-year-old Mitsotakis, the honorary president of the governing centre-right New Democracy party, said: \u201cI confirmed my view which is categoric: early elections, required in the case of parliament\u2019s inability to elect a president of the republic, will lead the country into turmoil whose end result will be to find ourselves out of the Eurozone.\u201d \u201cAt this point, the widest possible consent is required. We all have to put the interests of the country above personal or party interest. We owe it to the Greek people from whom we have asked huge sacrifices.\u201d Leaving the talks Kammenos, who had once belonged to New Democracy, dashed those hopes. \u201cHe asked me to come to a solution of consent in the name of national policy. We believe that a national solution will be found only after elections.\u201d ANEL\u2019s ratings are such that it might not make the 3% threshold needed to get into a new parliament. Imposing negative interest rates on commercial bank deposits could actually backfire on the Swiss economy and cause an asset bubble. So warns Angelo Ranaldo, Professor of Finance and Systemic Risk at the University of St Gallen. Negative rates are meant to discourage banks et al from holding large deposits in francs; if they shift into other currencies, that would weaken the currency (see earlier Q&amp;A). But Ranaldo reckons money could flow elsewhere in the economy. He says: \u201cBy introducing negative interest rates, the Swiss National Bank is reacting to the European Central Bank\u2019s recent decision and to the renewed pressure on its safe haven currency thanks to the Russian crisis. But there is a fundamental disconnect between the Swiss economy and the outlook for the Eurozone: the Swiss economy is in better shape and disinflation is not a concern. The introduction of negative interest rates is an attempt to stimulate the movement of money abroad. This measure could backfire if, rather than abroad, it pushed money towards asset bubbles such as property. This could undermine Switzerland\u2019s financial stability.\u201d Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that the Swiss central bank could be forced to intervene in the foreign exchange markets again, once the impact of negative rates wears off: Credit rating agency Fitch has warned that risks to Russia\u2019s economy have intensified. In a statement, Fitch sounded the alarm over the rouble\u2019s extreme volatility this week, and the interest rate hike to 17%. It says: The inflationary impact of recent falls (inflation is heading towards double digits) will erode real incomes, further damaging private consumption and domestic demand. If rates have to be kept high or increased to support the currency at a lower oil price, the impact could be greater still. The CBR has estimated that average oil prices of $60/barrel could cause GDP to shrink 4.5%-4.7% in 2015. Fitch is due to review Russia\u2019s credit rating in January. After a rocky start, Greek bonds are actually rising in value now, pushing down the interest rate (or yield) on the debt. That suggests fears over Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone are fading a little today. The feel-good factor from last night\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting continues to push European stock markets higher. Shares are rising on relief that the US central bank will be patient when deciding when to raise US interest rates. The Greek market is being dragged down by political uncertainty, though. Although US borrowing costs are expected to rise this year, the Fed was more dovish than expected, as Will Hedden of IG explains: Equities in Europe are trying hard to take advantage of a dovish, US Federal Reserve-led rally in the States last night. The S&amp;P 500 had its best day of the year, rising a shade over 2% to close back above the 2000 level. While the \u2018considerable time\u2019 statement remains in the minutes despite some reports to the contrary, the fact it changed its language slightly, and highlighted a \u2018patient\u2019 stance on when rates will start going up, maintained the dovish theme. The comments by chair, Janet Yellen, that this alteration in language did not actually mean a change in its outlook helped put a rocket under equities for the final part of last night\u2019s session. Greece\u2019s jobless rate has dipped a little, but remains in at depression-era levels. Elstat reports that the unemployment rate was 25.5% in the third quarter of 2014, down from 26.6% in April-June, and 27.2% a year earlier. The data also confirms that younger people are bearing the brunt of the crisis: As are women. The unemployment rate for females (29,2%) is considerably higher than the unemployment rate for males (22.6%). Swiss central bank chief Thomas Jordan also confirmed that the Russian crisis had prompted today\u2019s decision to charge commercial banks who deposit their francs with the SNB. Jordan revealed that the SNB has been intervening in the currency markets to prevent the franc surging in value above CHF 1.20 to the \u20ac1. That suggests wealthy Russians have been shifting money out of roubles and into safe currencies such as the Swiss franc in recent days. Back to Switzerland....and the head of the Swiss National Bank has predicted that the negative interest rates announced today will remain \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d. SNB chairman Thomas Jordan told a press conference that further measures could be imposed if it\u2019s necessary to weaken the franc and stimulate inflation again. \u201cIf it becomes necessary, we can take further measures. Possible measures include a further reduction of interest rates or a reduction of the exemption threshold\u201d. Jordan also suggested that retail savers shouldn\u2019t feel the impact of negative rates (which only apply to deposits left with the SNB by commercial banks) Britain appears to have caught the Black Friday bug. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that retail sales jumped by 1.5% month-on-month in November, the biggest rise this year. Sales were an impressive-looking 6.4% higher than a year ago; however, the ONS cautions that Black Friday (when stores offered US-style bargains) wasn\u2019t included in the November 2013 figures. The ONS also reports that average store prices fell by 2.0% in November 2014 compared with November 2013. This is the largest fall since August 2002, and contributing to falling inflation in the UK. Keith Richardson, Managing Director Retail Sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says: \u201cBlack Friday\u2019s shopping frenzy provided the sector with a timely boost and retailers will hope that this momentum is maintained throughout the festive period. \u201cA combination of aggressive discounting and consumer\u2019s determination to secure big ticket bargains ensured that electrical goods and household appliances were the standout categories. Clothing and footwear retailers used the event to reduce stockpiles of winter clothing, albeit to the detriment of their profit margins. Financial analyst are digesting Switzerland\u2019s decision to impose negative interest rates on cash deposits at its central bank. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swiss online bank Swissquote, says the move won\u2019t be a \u201csilver bullet\u201d. He predicts that the franc will probably strengthen back towards the National Bank\u2019s cap. The SNB continued to show its unwavering support for the EURCHF floor by introducing negative interest rates.... We doubt the action will have long term effect and expect to see EURCHF grind back towards the EURCHF 1.2000 minimum exchange rate.\u201d The prospect of new Eurozone stimulus measures may have forced the Swiss hand, reckons Andy Scott, spokesperson at foreign currency specialists HiFX: \u201cHaving seen the franc trading at, or very close to, the cap that it set of 1.20 to the euro over the past month, the SNB obviously felt it needed to shore up its defences against a building storm surge of money looking for a safe home. It is also faced with the potential for Q.E. by the ECB next year, which would likely put further downwards pressure on the euro across the board. Finally, Switzerland continues to face the risk of deflation as highlighted by the SNB at their last meeting, with the strength of the franc a key contributor to annual CPI running at just -0.1% in November. Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin in Zurich, points out that negative rates begin next month, on the same day as the European Central Bank\u2019s next meeting. \u201cThe timing is suspicious because the fee will be charged starting on January 22nd.\u201d German firms appear to be shrugging off the Russian crisis, and Europe\u2019s economic problems. The IFO survey of German morale, just released, has risen to 105.5 up from 104.7 last month. That\u2019s the highest reading since August. Heads-up; Vladimir Putin\u2019s press conference is about to start in Moscow. We\u2019re running a separate liveblog, as it\u2019s going to last for several hours: Vladimir Putin gives annual press conference \u2013 live Apparently cuddly toys are banned: Over in Berlin, German chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that sanctions against Russia over Ukraine remain unavoidable as long as Moscow does not respect Ukrainian sovereignty. She told the Bundestag, or German parliament, that: \u201cAs long as we do not reach this goal ... sanctions remain unavoidable, though I would like to reiterate that they were not and are not an end in themselves.\u201d Merkel added that she wants to see \u201cEuropean security with Russia, not against Russia\u201d. The Russian rouble is volatile around this morning, as traders await Vladimir Putin\u2019s annual press conference, from 9am. It\u2019s currently down 2.2% against the US dollar at 61.5 roubles/$1, having hit a low of 58/$1 in early trading. Yesterday the rouble staged its biggest rally in over 15 years, as Moscow announced measures to strengthen its banks. But the ramifications of the crisis are still being felt; major car firms say they have halted sales in Russia. Greek three-year bonds weakened this morning after MPs rejected the government\u2019s presidential candidate last night, pushing up the yield on the debt. The vote has moved Greece closer to a general election. A snap poll will be unavoidable if MPs don\u2019t back Stavros Dimas in the third vote, on December 29th. European stock markets have risen in early trading, taking their lead from Wall Street\u2019s rally last night. The German DAX and French CAC both surged 1.7%, while the FTSE 100 is up a more modest 0.5% or 30 points at 6366. There\u2019s relief that the Federal Reserve remained cautious about raising interest rates at last night\u2019s meeting. Although it dropped its its insistence that rates would be kept on hold for a \u201cconsiderable period\u201d, it promised to be \u201cpatient\u201d about future rises. Last night\u2019s story: US Federal Reserve edges closer to first interest rate rise since 2008 Ian Williams of Peel Hunt says this \u2018evolution\u2019 has been well received: Markets had been expecting such a move and, despite signs of some disagreement on the committee as three members dissented, the shift is a signal of confidence in the sustainability of the US recovery. Fed Chair Yellen reassured that policy continued to depend upon the data, with no move likely within the next \u201ccouple of meetings\u201d. Why has the Swiss central bank announced negative interest rates today? Because it wants to weaken its currency, the Swiss franc, by penalising banks who hold deposits. Aren\u2019t weak currencies bad things? Look at Russia! Switzerland\u2019s problem is that the franc has become too strong since the financial crisis began. It\u2019s a safe-haven asset, so when the eurozone crisis began five years ago investors piled into the franc. This pushed the franc close to parity with the euro, and in September 2011 the Swiss National Bank announced a cap. It would not allow the franc to be stronger than CHF 1.2 to the \u20ac1. Why has it done it now? One theory is that the rouble crisis has driven money out of Russia and into the safety of the Swiss franc, pushing up its value to the 1.2 cap -- forcing the SNB to spend more reserves defending it. Are negative rates a common tool? No, they\u2019re one of the unconventional weapons in the monetary policy toolbox. They already exist in the eurozone, but for different reasons. The ECB imposed them to encourage banks to lend to the real economy. Will Swiss savers have to pay negative rates? No, this is designed for commercial bank deposits held at the SNB. It applies to any bank, securities dealer, cash processing facility, clearing and settlement organisation, mortgage bond institution, insurance company, international organisation or central bank. The Swiss franc has weakened sharply after Switzerland\u2019s central bank surprised the markets by announcing it would impose negative deposit rates of 0.25% on commercial bank deposits. The franc fell by half a cent, to 1.2095 francs against the euro, a two month low. It had been pushing hard against the 1.2 cap set by the SNB; that cap is meant to keep the franc artificially weak. In a statement (online here), the SNB insisted that it would not allow the franc to become too strong. The SNB reaffirms its commitment to the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro, and will continue to enforce it with the utmost determination. It remains the key instrument to avoid an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions resulting from a Swiss franc appreciation. So why has the SNB imposed negative rates? It explains: Over the past few days, a number of factors have prompted increased demand for safe investments. The introduction of negative interest rates makes it less attractive to hold Swiss franc investments, and thereby supports the minimum exchange rate. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Dramatic news to start the morning - Switzerland\u2019s central bank has just announced that it will impose negative interest rates on commercial bank deposits. The move means banks will be charged to leave Swiss francs in the SNB\u2019s vaults, and is designed to prevent the franc strengthening against the euro, which it is currently pegged against. More to follow. World markets are rallying today after last night\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed was less hawkish than some investors had feared, saying it can afford to be \u2018patient\u2019 when deciding when tighten monetary policy. Asian markets have jumped overnight, and we\u2019re expecting a strong start in Europe. We\u2019ll also be watching the Russian crisis, as Moscow battles to preserve financial stability and support the rouble. President Putin is giving his annual press conference from 9am GMT. And Greek politics will be interesting, after parliament rejected the government\u2019s presidential candidate last night. There are two more votes yet, though... On the data front, we get the IFO survey of German investor confidence at 9am GMT, and the latest UK retail sales at 9.30am.",

Even a late fall in the oil price failed to upset investors, while both Russia and Greece seemed slightly more stable situations after recent volatility. Better than expected UK retail sales helped support the UK market, and some mixed economic signals from the US - poor services PMI, positive weekly jobless claims - only served to convince traders that dearer borrowing would not be on the cards for a while. The surprise news that the Swiss Central Bank had introduced negative interest rates also failed to upset the markets. So the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 129.52 points or 2.04% higher at 6466.00</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.79% to 9811.06</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac climbed 3.35% to 4249.49</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.65% to 19,060.99</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.4% better at 10,391.3</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 1.47% to 874.69</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 262 points or 1.5% higher.</p> <p>And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day.

Its annual rate of inflation is -0.1%, however this could fall further after producer and import prices slid 1.6% year on year last month. The Swiss National Bank\u2019s Jordan gave explicit reasons for the cut in rates: to weaken the Swissie, to overcome deflation [and] to help spur growth, which is expected to be on the weak side in the first quarter.</p> </blockquote> <p>But she added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the internal factors justify the SNB\u2019s actions, the timing of the move was surprising. The market had expected a move on rates sometime in January; however recent market volatility, and the sell-off in the rouble, threatened the 1.20 peg in euro/franc, which triggered this move. </p> <p>Other external factors included the ECB and the Fed.</p> <p>The SNB has a close relationship with the ECB, and if the SNB found it necessary to hike rates now it could have been designed to precede a move by the ECB in January. In fact the negative rate will only come into effect on the 22 January, which corresponds with the ECB\u2019s next meeting. Thus, today\u2019s move by the SNB suggests that the ECB may be getting close to QE, and since QE could weaken the EUR, the SNB had to act now to protect its euro/franc peg.</p> <p>We think that this move should keep euro/franc safely out of the 1.20 danger zone for now; however in the longer term we think the SNB will need to embark on more action to stem the franc\u2019s appreciation. Firstly, if this move by the SNB is a sign that QE is on its way from the ECB then we could see further downward pressure on the euro. Secondly, downward pressure on the euro could be compounded by last night\u2019s fairly hawkish Fed, which may cap euro/dollar gains.</p> <p>If the euro/franc peg is pressured once again in the coming days and weeks then the SNB has said that it will defend the peg, as it is an important policy tool.

      "body": "<p>The nervous Santa rally which began this week took flight in earnest on Thursday, and it was mainly central banks behind the surge once more.</p> <p>Markets were initially buoyed by the overnight news from the US Federal Reserve that it was \u201cpatient\u201d about raising interest rates, which saw the dollar slip and commodities climb. Concerns that an early Fed increase could dampen global economic growth were allayed - for now.</p> <p>Switzerland introduced negative rates in an effort to lower the franc\u2019s value, which had been partly boosted by investors fleeing the rouble.

Markets were initially buoyed by the overnight news from the US Federal Reserve that it was \u201cpatient\u201d about raising interest rates, which saw the dollar slip and commodities climb. Concerns that an early Fed increase could dampen global economic growth were allayed - for now. Switzerland introduced negative rates in an effort to lower the franc\u2019s value, which had been partly boosted by investors fleeing the rouble. Meanwhile the Russian currency remained steady after its crash earlier in the week, after the Russian central bank\u2019s measures to support the financial system and President Putin\u2019s annual address. Another positive factor was a Reuters interview with Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Greek opposition party Syriza.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aer Lingus has rejected a takeover approach from British Airways\u2019 parent company, IAG, saying it \u201cfundamentally undervalues\u201d the airline. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh \u2013 formerly a pilot and chief executive at Aer Lingus \u2013 had previously denied rumours that he was looking to add the Irish carrier to the group, which would bring with it valuable extra take-off slots at Heathrow airport. But industry observers had identified it as a possible target for IAG\u2019s continued consolidation of European airlines, particularly with Walsh\u2019s previous experience of the Dublin-based carrier. The Aer Lingus board said it had \u201creceived a preliminary, highly conditional and non-binding approach from IAG\u201d. Its statement continued: \u201cThe board has reviewed the proposal and believes it fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and its attractive prospects \u2026 there can be no certainty that any offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer. Shareholders are strongly advised to take no action.\u201d The airline\u2019s share price shot up almost 20% on news of the move, but dropped back after the Aer Lingus rejection. IAG had earlier issued a statement noting the movement in the share price of Aer Lingus and confirming it had \u201csubmitted a proposal to make an offer for the company, which has been rejected by the board of Aer Lingus\u201d. It added: \u201cThere can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming. A further statement will be made if and when appropriate.\u201d The approach was made at the start of this week and rejected by the Aer Lingus board on Wednesday. A takeover has become more likely as the Irish carrier\u2019s largest single shareholder, Ryanair, is expected to lose an appeal on Friday against a UK competition ruling to sell down its 29.9% stake. However, if Ryanair chooses to continue its battle in European courts, the process could be delayed further. Ryanair\u2019s own attempts to buy Aer Lingus in full were thwarted. On its third and last attempt in 2012, it signed a memorandum of understanding with IAG to allow BA to buy most of Aer Lingus\u2019s 24 slots at Heathrow if and when Ryanair won full control. A Ryanair spokesman said: \u201cRyanair does not comment upon or engage in rumour or speculation.\u201d Aer Lingus, which has close to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3780m) in cash on its balance sheet, is 25% owned by the Irish government while Gulf carrier Etihad also has a 4% stake. The Dublin government would be prepared to listen to buyers: Ireland\u2019s department of transport has said it would be open to selling its stake at the right price. While Aer Lingus\u2019s chief executive Christoph Mueller is to step down in May, to take over at embattled Malaysian Airlines, the Irish flag carrier is seen to be in good health: last month it raised its profits forecast after recording an operating profit for the summer months of \u20ac113m, up 20% for the quarter from 2013 and its strongest results since the financial crisis hit Ireland. Buoyed by a boom in transatlantic passengers using Dublin as a hub, it announced plans to increase its routes to the US with a ninth direct service, to Washington DC, as well as adding daily flights to San Francisco, expanding overall transatlantic capacity by 20% for 2015. Aviation analyst John Strickland said: \u201cA takeover would fit from an IAG position, but the airline would have challenges if it returns with another bid: there could be regulatory concern or challenges from other airlines on competition grounds \u2013 but not a show-stopper. \u201cAer Lingus has been successful even against a difficult economic climate in Ireland, and a deal would give IAG an even stronger network position at Heathrow.\u201d Walsh joined BA from Aer Lingus in 2005 and set up IAG in 2011 when he merged the national airline with Spanish flag carrier Iberia. It has since acquired Vueling, a Spanish airline, and Walsh has made no secret of his belief that there must be more mergers and takeovers if European airlines are to thrive. However, as recently as October he told Irish newspapers that he had \u201cno designs on Aer Lingus\u201d. Willie\u2019s round trip An IAG takeover would see Willie Walsh once again at the helm of Aer Lingus, where he started his aviation career in 1979 as a cadet pilot. He worked his way up to captain by 1990, then moved into the airline\u2019s management ranks after gaining an MBA at Dublin\u2019s Trinity College. After a brief sojourn running Futura, a Spanish charter airline in Mallorca, Spain, Walsh came back to Ireland in 2000 as chief operating officer, and was promoted to the top job a year later, replacing Michael Foley. He soon earned a reputation as a hard-nosed slasher, axeing jobs to turn the loss-making airline into one that generated large profits.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/16/high-school-senior-who-claimed-fake-72m-fortune-releases-video-apology\">a 17-year-old high school genius in Queen says he made $72m trading</a>, and people believe him, then people don\u2019t understand how finance works. To be successful on Wall Street you don\u2019t need to be a genius, but you do need to be able to do something that no 17-year-old can do: borrow money. A lot of money, and at low interest rates.</p> <p>To make money you need money, and how you get that money is the real game played on Wall Street. It is no different than any form of betting, from horse racing to lotto tickets. The more you can borrow, the more you can bet and the more you can make. To make $72m, you need to start with hundreds of millions of dollars. Wall Street is a crazy place but it isn\u2019t stupid. Lending and investing happens cautiously and with lots of rules, written and unwritten. One of the rules is not lending to a 17-year-old high school kid living in Queens. <br></p> <p>On my first day as a trader, my boss walked me around the trading floor, pointing out each group as we went by: \u201cTreasury, Mortgages, Equities, Derivatives, High Yield \u2026 \u201d They all had swagger. At the end he dropped me off with a small group in a darker corner of the floor, filled with badly dressed folks who all needed haircuts. \u201cSpend the rest of the week with these guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they need coffee, get them coffee. If they need sex ... Whatever they need, give it to them.\u201d \u201cWho are they?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe finance desk, the people who loan us money. They have our balls in their hands.\u201d <br></p> <p>That means if you need to trade, you need the finance guys on your side. There are two routes: find rich people, or find a bank.</p> <p>Hedge-fund managers and asset managers find rich people. They spend years, sometime decades, putting together a collection of rich people willing to invest with them. Not a little money, but billions of dollars. They convince the rich with stories: a history of returning money with profits; an expertise in economics, math or computers; unique access to market information.</p> <p>They then use the money to create an infrastructure: hiring other traders, back-office staff, accountants, lawyers and computer specialists. They build a company that then makes bets, obsessively, which they often wake up at 2am to check. When not watching the bets, they spend hours on the phone talking with economists and politicians and other bankers. At the end of the year, if those bets work out, they give rich people a nice profit and take a slice off the top for themselves and their employees as pay. <br></p> <p>Another way to get money is to work at a bank. Banks have a lot of money to lend because they have a lot of checking and savings accounts. Traders at banks start by being lent a little money, and then only after having a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes a lot of school. Each subsequent year, if the trader is successful, the bank gives him more money to invest, more money to gamble with. Over years \u2013 assuming the trader makes money, the bank makes money and the financial markets are working \u2013 the trader is allowed to borrow more and and more money. Eventually the banker is able to borrow enough to make enough to get paid enough to become someone worth $72m.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s working at a bank or a hedge fund, it takes a lot of work to borrow money, and a lot of work to make money from that money. It is not something you do on your lunch breaks. </p> <p>Borrowing money is a hard, sordid business. It doesn\u2019t make for a sweet genius-getting-rich-quick story. That narrative, played out in the media far more than in reality, elevates finance to an impenetrable science like quantum physics or pseudo-mysticism like alchemy. Wall Street also loves that story, because it inflates its worth, allowing money managers to charge higher fees: I can see the future, so pay me. <br></p> <p>The reality is a lot less sexy, and a lot cruder. You need to find someone to lend you money, and that search is hard work. A 17-year-old can\u2019t do that. <br></p> <p>Oh, there is a third way to get people to lend you money: fool them and dazzle them with bullshit. That, a 17-year-old can do.</p>",

To be successful on Wall Street you don\u2019t need to be a genius, but you do need to be able to do something that no 17-year-old can do: borrow money. A lot of money, and at low interest rates. To make money you need money, and how you get that money is the real game played on Wall Street. It is no different than any form of betting, from horse racing to lotto tickets. The more you can borrow, the more you can bet and the more you can make. To make $72m, you need to start with hundreds of millions of dollars. Wall Street is a crazy place but it isn\u2019t stupid. Lending and investing happens cautiously and with lots of rules, written and unwritten. One of the rules is not lending to a 17-year-old high school kid living in Queens. On my first day as a trader, my boss walked me around the trading floor, pointing out each group as we went by: \u201cTreasury, Mortgages, Equities, Derivatives, High Yield \u2026 \u201d They all had swagger. At the end he dropped me off with a small group in a darker corner of the floor, filled with badly dressed folks who all needed haircuts. \u201cSpend the rest of the week with these guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they need coffee, get them coffee. If they need sex ... Whatever they need, give it to them.\u201d \u201cWho are they?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe finance desk, the people who loan us money. They have our balls in their hands.\u201d That means if you need to trade, you need the finance guys on your side. There are two routes: find rich people, or find a bank. Hedge-fund managers and asset managers find rich people. They spend years, sometime decades, putting together a collection of rich people willing to invest with them. Not a little money, but billions of dollars. They convince the rich with stories: a history of returning money with profits; an expertise in economics, math or computers; unique access to market information. They then use the money to create an infrastructure: hiring other traders, back-office staff, accountants, lawyers and computer specialists. They build a company that then makes bets, obsessively, which they often wake up at 2am to check. When not watching the bets, they spend hours on the phone talking with economists and politicians and other bankers. At the end of the year, if those bets work out, they give rich people a nice profit and take a slice off the top for themselves and their employees as pay. Another way to get money is to work at a bank. Banks have a lot of money to lend because they have a lot of checking and savings accounts. Traders at banks start by being lent a little money, and then only after having a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes a lot of school. Each subsequent year, if the trader is successful, the bank gives him more money to invest, more money to gamble with. Over years \u2013 assuming the trader makes money, the bank makes money and the financial markets are working \u2013 the trader is allowed to borrow more and and more money. Eventually the banker is able to borrow enough to make enough to get paid enough to become someone worth $72m. Whether it\u2019s working at a bank or a hedge fund, it takes a lot of work to borrow money, and a lot of work to make money from that money. It is not something you do on your lunch breaks. Borrowing money is a hard, sordid business. It doesn\u2019t make for a sweet genius-getting-rich-quick story. That narrative, played out in the media far more than in reality, elevates finance to an impenetrable science like quantum physics or pseudo-mysticism like alchemy. Wall Street also loves that story, because it inflates its worth, allowing money managers to charge higher fees: I can see the future, so pay me. The reality is a lot less sexy, and a lot cruder. You need to find someone to lend you money, and that search is hard work. A 17-year-old can\u2019t do that. Oh, there is a third way to get people to lend you money: fool them and dazzle them with bullshit. That, a 17-year-old can do.",

      "bodyText": "The idea of providing low-income people with money to reduce poverty and insecurity was, until recently, regarded with scepticism in development circles. But that is changing rapidly. The World Bank and others have been converted to conditional cash transfers (CCT). These provide poor people with cash on condition they send their children to school and for medical treatment. It is extended to other conditions, such as doing designated work or undergoing some treatment, including sterilisation, the idea being to induce people to behave in ways deemed good for them. Numerous tests have concluded that these conditions work. But they should be rejected as morally dubious and paternalistic as poverty targeting always fails. However measured, there are huge exclusion and inclusion errors, and the outcome is often regressive. Recently, we have conducted three unconditional basic income schemes in India, funded by Unicef. A basic income is a modest cash payment (in this case, a third of subsistence), paid individually, unconditionally, universally and monthly, guaranteed as a right. Altogether, more than 6,000 men, women and children received it, with the children\u2019s money paid to the mother. In one pilot, everybody in eight villages were provided with a basic income for 18 months, and their experience evaluated by comparing what took place in 12 otherwise similar villages, in a modified randomised control trial. Making the experiment unique was that it tested for the independent and combined effects of the basic income and a collective body working on behalf of recipients. In half the villages, SEWA (the Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association) operated; in the rest, it was absent. The only condition was that every adult had to open a bank or co-operative account within three months, into which the basic income was paid. Despite scepticism from our advisory board, a 98% bank account rate was achieved in that period; the rest followed. The methodology is described in a new book. What the pilots show is that a basic income can be used as development aid and as regional policy in the European Union to deter migration from poor to richer countries. The main conclusion is that a basic income can be transformative. It had four effects, most accentuated by the presence of the collective body. First, it had strong welfare, or \u201ccapability\u201d, effects. There were improvements in child nutrition, child and adult health, schooling attendance and performance, sanitation, economic activity and earned incomes, and the socio-economic status of women, the elderly and the disabled. Second, it had strong equity effects. It resulted in bigger improvements for scheduled caste and tribal households, and for all vulnerable groups, notably those with disabilities and frailties. This was partly because the basic income was paid to each individual, strengthening their bargaining position in the household and community. Third, it had growth effects. Contrary to what sceptics predicted (including Sonia Gandhi), the basic incomes resulted in more economic activity and work. Conventional labour statistics would have picked that up inadequately. There was a big increase in secondary economic activities, as well as a shift from casual wage labour to own-account farming and small-scale business. Growth in village economies is often ignored. It should not be. Fourth, it had emancipatory effects. These are unappreciated by orthodox development thinkers. The poor\u2019s liberty has no value. But the basic income resulted in some families buying themselves out of debt bondage, others paying down exorbitant debts incurring horrendous interest rates. For many, it provided liquidity with which to respond to shocks and hazards. In effect, the basic income responded to the fact that in such villages money is a scarce commodity, and as such that has driven up its price, locking most in a perpetual cycle of debt and deprivation. To appreciate the full extent of the emancipation, one should hear the story of the young women who at first wore veils and were reluctant to offend their elders when having their photographs taken to obtain eligibility for the basic income. Within months, they had confidence enough to be sitting and chatting in the centre of the village unveiled. They had their bit of independence. These four effects \u2013 welfare, equity, growth and emancipation \u2013 combine to be transformative. Critics claim a universal scheme is unaffordable. But they would be a substitute for subsidies that in India account for a huge share of national income. They are distortionary, inefficient, regressive and prone to corruption. Switching is feasible and would have substantial positive effects. Another criticism is that a basic income would be inflationary. But it would be a substitute for more expensive policies. The criticism also neglects the elasticity of supply. Thus, it generated a sharp rise in food production, resulting in better nutrition and productivity and in lower unit prices. The primary value of a basic income would be its emancipatory effect. If development is about freedom, one should challenge sceptics to show a better way to expand it. Nobody should claim it would be a panacea. Public social services, infrastructural policies and so on are vital. But a basic income should be part of a package of reforms. The development aid community should lend a hand. \u2022 Guy Standing is Professor of Development Studies, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.",

      "bodyText": "Why has the Swiss National Bank announced negative interest rates today? Because it wants to weaken its currency, the franc, by penalising banks who hold deposits. It also hopes to push up inflation. Aren\u2019t weak currencies bad things? Look at Russia! Switzerland\u2019s problem is that the franc has become too strong since the financial crisis began. It\u2019s a safe-haven asset, so when the eurozone crisis began five years ago investors piled into the franc. This pushed the franc close to parity with the euro, and in September 2011 the Swiss National Bank announced a cap. It would not allow the franc to be stronger than CHF 1.2 to the \u20ac1. Why has it done it now? The rouble crisis has driven money out of Russia and into the safety of the Swiss franc, pushing up its value to the 1.2 cap \u2013 forcing the SNB to spend more reserves defending it. This appears to have triggered today\u2019s surprise move. The prospect of the European Central Bank starting to buy government bonds next year has also weakened the euro, putting the Swiss cap at risk. Will it work? Analysts aren\u2019t convinced that today\u2019s rate cut, which comes into force on 22 January, will be enough to keep the franc weak. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swiss online bank Swissquote, says the move won\u2019t be a \u201csilver bullet\u201d: We doubt the action will have long term effect and expect to see EURCHF grind back towards the EURCHF 1.2000 minimum exchange rate. Are negative rates a common tool? No, they\u2019re one of the unconventional weapons in the monetary policy toolbox. They already exist in the eurozone, but for different reasons. The ECB imposed them to encourage banks to lend to the real economy. Will Swiss savers have to pay negative rates? No, this is designed for commercial bank deposits held at the SNB. It applies to any bank, securities dealer, cash processing facility, clearing and settlement organisation, mortgage bond institution, insurance company, international organisation or central bank with deposits of at least CHF 10 million. Could the SNB cut rates again? Yes. Chairman Thomas Jordan told reporters that: \u201cIf it becomes necessary, we can take further measures. Possible measures include a further reduction of interest rates or a reduction of the exemption threshold\u201d.",
