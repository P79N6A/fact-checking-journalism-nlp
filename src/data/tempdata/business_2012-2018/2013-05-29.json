      "bodyText": "Mary Portas's scheme to revitalise ailing high streets has failed to stop the rot \u2013 with 10 out of the 12 towns selected to share \u00a31.2m of taxpayers' cash seeing an increase in empty shopping outlets. The towns \u2013 Bedford, Croydon, Dartford, Liskeard, Market Rasen, Nelson, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Stockport, Stockton-on-Tees and Wolverhampton \u2013 together saw more than 95 units close. The High Street Innovation Fund was launched last year after a report by TV retail guru Portas, known as \"Mary Queen of Shops\". But of the targets chosen, only Margate and Bedminster now have more shops and other high street businesses such as banks, cafes or pubs. Market Rasen in Lincolnshire was the worst performer in terms of shops, with a 3.2 percentage point rise in empty stores between March 2012 and the same month this year, according to information collated by research firm The Local Data Company for the BBC Radio 4 programme You &amp; Yours. However, the local mayor Stephen Bunney said the town's Portas Pilot team, called the Market Rasen Business Initiative Group \u2013 or MR BIG \u2013 had improved the prospects for the town by backing new businesses including a greengrocer's and setting up a local market, which had attracted thousands of new shoppers. \"Although there have been ups and downs, as a town council we are very supportive of MR BIG,\" he said. The team said in March that it had spent a third of the \u00a3100,000 it had been allocated under the government scheme and had already committed the rest of the cash for projects to be implemented later this year. Several pilot towns have come under fire for being slow to spend the government money and for blowing cash on questionable initiatives, such as the \u00a31,600 Peppa Pig costume hired by Dartford Council to appeal to families. In February, the first wave of Portas Pilot towns were revealed to have spent only 12% of the money handed to them. Roberta Blackman-Woods, Labour's high streets minister, said: \"The fact is the Portas Pilots have struggled to deliver the 'high street renaissance' that the government promised because they have not been given enough practical support from Eric Pickles and his ministers to use the money awarded to them efficiently and effectively in support of their local economy.\" Portas has been criticised for failing to visit four of the towns where she was expected to offer \"help and expertise\". Her office said each town had been contacted to arrange a visit. The Guardian also revealed that film-makers working with Portas on her reality TV show, Mary: Queen of the High Street, which featured a handful of pilot towns, lobbied government officials to direct taxpayer funds to particular locations because they would be popular with television audiences. Portas said in a statement: \"As I've said many times before, there is no simple solution to the crisis on our high streets, there are no quick fixes but 400 towns up and down the country are working on different plans to try and re-invigorate their high street.\" In February, the government set up a national network of retail and property business leaders to help support its high street schemes. They includea second wave of 15 Portas pilot towns, who were each awarded \u00a3100,000, and 330 \"town teams\" who were given a smaller amount of cash.",

By legislating today, we will prevent utility companies from making these claims, ensuring fairness for British taxpayers.\"</p> <p>The Exchequer claims that energy distributors have only recently started to try to claim \"windfall\" capital allowances for costs dating back decades. The draft legislation, introduced yesterday, will form part of the current Finance Bill but will be acted on by the tax authorities with immediate effect.</p> <p>It is only a matter of weeks since some of the big six companies such as RWE npower admitted to a House of Commons select committee that they had paid almost no tax and yet made huge profits from recent earnings.

      "bodyText": "Fresh attempts to crack down on alleged abuse by energy companies were underway last night with the UK government announcing plans to end a \u00a3900m \"windfall\" tax scheme, and a further inquiry into BP over possible fuel price fixing in Spain. In the middle of a series of existing investigations into alleged petrol and gas price manipulation by regulators, the chancellor, George Osborne accused gas and electricity distributors of trying to game the tax system. \"It is completely unacceptable that utility companies think they can claim for huge amounts of money, that business customers have already covered the cost for. By legislating today, we will prevent utility companies from making these claims, ensuring fairness for British taxpayers.\" The Exchequer claims that energy distributors have only recently started to try to claim \"windfall\" capital allowances for costs dating back decades. The draft legislation, introduced yesterday, will form part of the current Finance Bill but will be acted on by the tax authorities with immediate effect. It is only a matter of weeks since some of the big six companies such as RWE npower admitted to a House of Commons select committee that they had paid almost no tax and yet made huge profits from recent earnings. The energy companies claim that this is because they are investing billions of pounds on new power plants which can be legitimately \"written off\" against capital allowances. But Osborne's move also coincided with Spanish competition authorities announcing they were investigating BP and two local firms, Repsol and Cepsa, for possible collusion in the raising of local fuel prices. The local regulator, CNE, said it had been keeping a watch on the oil sector since witnessing a significant rise in power prices. The initial inquiry does not imply wrongdoing at this stage but if found guilty, BP and others could be fined 10% of total sales, CNE, explained. BP said it could not comment but is committed to helping the authorities with any inquiries. The British oil company is already in the middle of a wider price manipulation investigation being undertaken by the European Commission through a series of dawn raids only two weeks ago. The offices of two rival groups, Shell and Statoil of Norway, plus a price reporting agency, Platts, were also targeted by staff working for the competition authorities in Brussels. The pressure on oil, gas and electricity companies has partly mounted over recent years as they have continued to make increasing profits through higher prices at a time when customers are being hit by recession. But there is also increasing concern that the energy markets are not regulated toughly enough and are open to the kind of Libor- interest rate abuses for which the large banks have been fined hundreds of millions of pounds. The gas and electricity market in Britain is dominated by big six companies such as Centrica, the owner of British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power many of which have been fined by the regulator, Ofgem, for mis-selling or other breaches of their license agreements. Not all of the big six own the kind of distribution companies that have being tried to take advantage of the tax loophole being closed by the government. The Treasury declined to say which of them had been trying to claim extra allowances and some industry experts said they had been encouraged to do so by some of the big four accounting firms. But the government was recently embarrassed when it was highlighted that the former head of RWE npower, Volker Beckers, since January was working as a non-executive director for HM Revenue and Customs.",

      "bodyText": "That's all for today, after quite a busy session. Here's a very brief closing summary. \u2022 The European Commission has given seven countries more time to hit their budget targets, as it urged member states to back a new push on structural reform and growth. Spain, France, Poland and Slovenia get another two years, while a 12-month extension was handed to the Netherlands, Portugal, and Belgium (which also avoided being fined despite failing to address its budget deficit). Highlights from 1.12pm Summary of the key points here Analysis here Early reaction here \u2022 The OECD has lowered its growth forecasts for the world economy. In its latest economic update, the Paris-based organisation expressed particular concern about the eurozone - urging the European Central Bank to consider embarkin on quantitative easing. Highlights from 10.12am. \u2022 World markets fell, with the FTSE 100 dropping almost 2%. Closing prices here, and reaction at 5.25pm. \u2022 The day began with the IMF lowering its growth forecast for China. See 7.52am. \u2022 And ended with a successful-looking auction of US debt. See 6.29pm \u2022 And also saw Spanish firemen clash with riot police in Barcelona. See 5.58pm \u2022 In Greece, the Pasok party was hit by another defection. See 4.16pm \u2022 While the German jobless rate remained at 6.9%, despite rising by 21,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. See 9.12am onwards. Thanks, as ever, and goodnight. GW France's president, Francois Hollande, has denied that Brussels can order Paris around, following the recommendations on labour and pension reform announced by the EC today. AFP newswire reports that Hollande has said: The [European] Commission doesn't have to dictate to France what it has to do. It simply has to say that France must restore its public accounts. The US government's much-anticipated auction of $35bn of five-year bonds appears to have gone smoothly. The debt was all sold at yields of up to 1.045%, which Reuters says was in line with market expectations. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.79, which means total bids were almost three times as large as the amount of debt on offer. And US 10-year Treasury bills are rising in value since the auction results hit the newswires \u2013 suggesting it has been well received. Just in - photos of a protest by Spanish fireman in Barcelona against the government's spending cuts, which cuminated in clashes with riot police outside the Catalan parliament: Here's some analyst reaction to today's heavy falls on Europe's stock markets (see 4.49pm for the closing prices) Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: ToTo is the new RoRo In an almost complete reversal of yesterday\u2019s price action the bears have reasserted themselves today, overturning the brief return to optimism as European equity markets slide back sharply on the back of rising bond yields. The yield on US treasuries rose to its highest level in 12 months on growing concerns that the Fed could well be getting nearer to the point of a possible paring back in its current asset purchase program. Instead of the usual \u201crisk on, risk off\u201d scenario (RoRo), we\u2019ve become used to, now we have to contend with the new \u201ctaper on, taper off\u201d scenario or (ToTo) which is likely to dominate market sentiment until the next Fed meeting on June 18th and 19th, and even possibly beyond that. This concern saw Europe\u2019s markets open lower this morning, and the declines had further fuel added to the fire by the OECD who in their latest assessment of the global economy revised their outlook down again, this time from 3.4% to 3.1% on a global basis. The reductions in Europe were even deeper with a revision of EU GDP down from a contraction of 0.1% to a contraction of 0.6%, while France\u2019s GDP target was slashed as well from 0.3% to -0.3%. The OECD also voiced its concern that without some form of QE in Europe and negative deposit rates we could well see further forecast reductions in the coming months. ... Retailers have also taken a hit after CBI retail sales plunged the most in 16 months in May. (details at 11.27am). It seems higher energy prices and below inflation wage growth along with tax changes in the new tax year have constrained consumer spending. Yusuf Heusen of IG: is the market coming or going? Once again the uptrend is looking under threat. Yesterday\u2019s impressive gains are a distant memory as the FTSE gives up the ground gained on Tuesday and back to levels seen last Thursday. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen such volatility in both directions, which is at least a welcome reminder that markets can go down as well as up, but two consecutive triple-digit days suggests a market that doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s coming or going. Too many had probably forgotten that universal truth in the steady run higher this year. A warning from the OECD about the negative impact of the end of QE on global growth prospects has reignited fears that any reduction in easing will bring the global party to a halt. Such fears are understandable, but perhaps overdone; having seen the turmoil caused by even hinting at a reduction in QE, Ben Bernanke is going to tiptoe very carefully into this area Spain's slow struggle to emerge from a toxic mix of high unemployment, recession and swollen budget deficits looks set to take even longer than expected after both Brussels and the OECD changed their tunes on the country's future. Our Madrid correspondent, Giles Tremlett, explains: The OECD foresees the economy shrinking a further 1.7 percent this year, while growth of just 0.4 percent in 2014 will not create jobs - with growth now the major concern, ahead of the deficit. It sees Spain's deficit barely shifting next year, with a drop from 7% to 6.9% of GDP, while unemployment is set to rise to 28%. Brussels has also heard the warning bells and turned away from strict austerity, changing the country's deficit target to 6.5% of GDP from the previous 4.5%. Even reaching this target, however, will require fresh measures - with Brussels demanding further tax hikes, more labour reform and a radical change in the way Spain calculates its pension payments. These will have to be linked to the long-term sustainability of the pension system in an ageing population rather to inflation. The expected result is for pensions to fall in real terms. A gloomy day in Europe's stock markets has ended with heavy falls on the major exchanges. In London the FTSE 100 has dropped almost 2%, down 134 points at 6627, with 98 shares falling (utility firms National Grid and United Utilities both fell 5%). Here's a picture of the damage, including the latest prices from Wall Street. As Brenda Kelly of IG explained at lunchtime (see 12.37pm), shares have been hit by several factors - including this morning's downgraded OECD forecasts, fresh fears that the Federal Reserve might tighten its QE programme, predictions that the Japanese Nikkei will fall tomorrow, and a bout of profit taking after the recent rally. More reaction to follow.... The European Central Bank is warning this afternoon that Europe's banks to be further strengthened. The ECB's six-monthly review of the eurozone financial sector warned that it is still fragile, and that stresses in the 'real economy' could easily cause new problems: Here's the four main risks to stability (via Reuters): Further decline in bank profitability, linked to credit losses and a weak macroeconomic environment Renewed tensions in sovereign debt markets due to low growth and slow reform implementation Bank funding challenges in stressed countries Reassessment of risk premia in global markets, following a prolonged period of safe-haven flows and search for yield Quite a wide-ranging set of threats -- particularly as the eurozone economy continues to contract. Vitor Constancio, the ECB's vice-president, told reporters: Financial stability has improved but remains fragile ... due to weak growth and banking sector vulnerabilities. There is this disconnect between the significant improvements in financial markets in general and the real economy - and the situation in the real economy is affecting banks....So this is a cause of concern. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith reports that the formerly all-powerful socialist Pasok party has suffered yet another defection over government economic policies. She writes: If ever proof was needed that the once mighty socialist Pasok is imploding at an alarming rate, it came today when the prominent euro MP Kriton Arsenis also threw in the towel prompting a furious reaction from the party. In an incendiary letter to party chief Evangelos Venizelos, the MEP said he had decided to become an independent because that way he could best continue the fight against the \u201cirrational and destructive policy of unilateral austerity in Europe and Greece.\u201d A former green activist, Arsenis wrote that he was vehemently opposed to the privatization program ordered by the country\u2019s troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF and sale of \u201cprofitable\u201d public utilities and sate-owned land which Pasok has endorsed as a partner in prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 tri-partite coalition. Arsenis's defection \u2013 on the heels of last week\u2019s decision by former EU commissioner and stalwart party cadre Anna Diamantopoulou to also break ranks -- appears to have unleashed a massive row with the party demanding this afternoon that Arsenis return the seat. Helena explains: In a withering statement, Fofi Gennimata, Pasok\u2019s spokeswoman, said it was now up to Arsenis, who was appointed to the parliament by Venizelos\u2019 predecessor George Papandreou, to do the \u201cdecent\u201d thing. \u201cHe was not elected himself but appointed by the previous president of Pasok. This position belongs to the party. The euro parliamentarian post belongs to Pasok,\u201d she told a local radio station. \u201cSo whoever does not wish to have anything to do with Pasok \u2026 I think must first leave that position and then make clear their objections which we can then talk about.\u201d Earlier this week Thanassis Ikonomou, another MP, also defected to the left-wing Dimar, saying \u201cfor a long time now Pasok has lost all its personality and identity.\u201d The party\u2019s free fall has become a major headache for the pro-bailout Samaras alliance with analysts fearing it could further weaken a coalition already combatting daily (if abated) anger over austerity measures. We shouldn't get carried away with suggestions that Europe is abandoning austerity altogether. Even though Spain, France, Portugal, Poland, the Netherlands and Slovenia are getting up to two years more time to lower their deficits, Brussels is still pushing for some of its favourite measures including labour market reforms, welfare adjustments and (although slower) fiscal consolidation. Open Europe, the think tank, has rounded up some of the key recommendations, and concludes: For all the talk of this being the \u2018end of austerity\u2019 or \u2018austerity in retreat\u2019, is much really changing? Sure, there is some tinkering with timelines for deficit reduction (Spain, France and others have been given more time to cut public deficit), but ultimately the eurozone is still going along the same policy path - just slightly more slowly. It adds that structural reform, welfare reform, fiscal consolidation economic liberalisation are all necessary, but adds: The question remains whether they can all be done at the same time by a group of countries which are closely interlinked, and many of which are currently in recession. And as an example, here's France's to-do list: France should do more to cut labour costs, in particular by reducing social security contributions for employers. The European Commission says France should adopt new measures by the end of the year to \u201cbring its pension system into balance in a sustainable manner no later than 2020.\u201d France should improve the business environment and help its firms become more competitive; France\u2019s unemployment benefit system should be \u201curgently\u201d reformed, so that it is sustainable but also \u201cprovides adequate incentives to return to work\u201d. France should do more to tackle labour market segmentation, and remove \u201cunjustified restrictions in the access to and exercise of professional services.\u201d More here: Despite much fanfare, the European Commission recommends much of the same for the eurozone The OECD underlined the challenges facing the eurozone today, when it slashed its forecast for 2013 to a 0.6% drop in GDP. Here's a video clip of Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist, explaining why Europe is lagging: (if you scroll back to 10.12am there are details of the OECD's new forecasts, in which it predicted slower growth across the world economy). Central bank news - Canada left rates unchanged at 1% at its monetary policy meeting today (quite a rarity, with so many choosing to ease borrowing costs in recent weeks). Here's the statement from the Bank of Canada, which includes this assessment of the world economy: In the United States, the economic expansion is progressing at a modest pace, with continued strengthening in private demand partly offset by fiscal consolidation. Japan\u2019s economy is beginning to respond to significant policy stimulus. Europe, in contrast, remains in recession. Growth in China has continued to ease from very strong rates, weighing somewhat on global commodity prices. The Bank continues to expect global economic activity to grow modestly in 2013 before strengthening over the following two years. Italy's new prime minister, Enrico Letta, has declared that the Italian people can be \"proud\" of the news that the country has been removed from the EC's excessive deficit list: Our Rome correspondent, Lizzy Davies, reports that Letta also paid tribute to the efforts of his predecessor, Mario Monti, who suffered a bruising rebuff from the electorate in February's general election. News from Brussels is not generally something to celebrate for the Italians, so the European Commission's announcement today that it is recommending the abrogation of the eurozone's third-largest economy from its Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) has understandably been welcomed in Rome. In a statement on the Italian government's website, prime minister Enrico Letta said the move was \"cause for great satisfaction\" and something of which the Italian people should be \"proud\". The new premier, whose fragile grand coalition government was sworn in just a month ago, said Italy was now \"reaping the rewards\" of the previous technocratic government, which pushed the country through a series of punishing austerity measures. He expressed his \"personal gratitude\" to Mario Monti, and affirmed his own government's intention to stick to fiscal goals set down by Brussels. The move, which had been long anticipated but confirmed only this afternoon, has been hailed in the Italian media as a \"shot of oxygen\" for the new government. It is estimated that it will free up around \u20ac8bn of public money which would have gone on getting its annual borrowing down under the EDP. However Letta has been careful not to raise expectations, reportedly saying earlier this week that the benefits would only been seen on next year's budget. He was quoted in the Italian press as telling a meeting of regional governors: \"As we know, it will not free up resources immediately.\" Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, has welcomed the confirmation of a two-year extension to bring its deficit below 3%. He declaried it as a sign that austerity is moving off the agenda, flags up journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo: Another point to flag up from the EC's recommendations today \u2013 it is worried about the Slovenian banking system. Its nine recommendations for Slovenia include this ominous warning: Slovenia should arrange an independent review of the entire system, stand ready to re-capitalise further banks, if necessary, and adopt a comprehensive banking sector strategy. and also: Linked to the recommendation above, Slovenia should also review the supervision of the banking sector and act to strengthen its capacity and transparency. Slovenia is already battling to avoid being forced to take a bailout, primarily due to the problems in its mainly state-owned banking sector. (hat-tip to fastFT, who have more details on their new site) All 27 country-specific recommendations are online here. A quick summary of the main decisions from the European Commission: \u2022 Six countries have been given more time to bring their deficits under 3% of GDP: Spain, France, Poland and Slovenia get two more years, while the Netherlands and Portugal get a year each. \u2022 Belgium has also been given another 12 months to correct its deficit, but will not be fined despite the lack of any 'effective action' in the past \u2022 Five countries are being released from the Excessive Deficit Procedure having mended their ways: Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. \u2022 An Excessive Deficit Procedure is being opened on Malta, which will take the total number of countries under a EDP to 16. And here's the key quote from President Barroso: Now is the time to step up the fundamental economic reforms that will deliver growth and jobs, which our citizens, especially our young people, anxiously expect. This is the only way to address the two lasting legacies of this crisis \u2013 the serious loss of competitiveness in many of our Member States, and persistent unemployment, with all its social consequences. The recommendations issued by the Commission today are part of our comprehensive strategy to move Europe beyond the crisis. They are concrete, realistic, and adapted to the situation of each of our Member States. Here's the first reaction to the Commission's new country-specific recommendations: Olli Rehn also singled out the French pension system, saying that the Paris government must clarify its reform plans so that the system is sustainable. Rehn summed up the EC's new budget targets as an \"important breathing space\" for countries in which member states must use to implement structural reforms. Belgium appears to have avoided being fined for violating the Commission's budget rules: Rehn reiterates Barroso's point that it is \"essential\" that France uses extra time to tackle the underlying problems with its economic competitiveness. Now Olli Rehn, the commissioner for monetary policy, is speaking in Brussels. He explains that the Commission is recommending that Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania should all be removed from the 'excessive deficit' list. However, it wants to put Malta back on the list, just six months after removing it. Rehn also defends the EU's growth and stability pact: Finally, Jose Manuel Barroso warns that Italy cannot abandon its austerity programme, despite being removed from the list of countries with excessive deficits. He explains that its national debt, at over 120% of GDP, remains a concern. The high debt/GDP ratio is still a burden to the Italian economy... That is why we cannot say Italy should relax its efforts. Next question: Should Germany do more to help the rest of the eurozone? Barroso replies that the EC would like to see Germany pay packets rise: Germany should ally wages with productivity - that means increased wages. He also warns that it is currently too difficult for small firms from outside Germany to access its economy, as our Europe editor Ian Traynor flags up from the press conference: The live feed just froze for a moment, so I missed Barroso cracking a joke (of sorts): Question time, and Barroso denies that the EC has bowed to pressure from Paris when it gave France an extra two years grace to lower its deficit. It was our decision, he insists, adding: We believed, on a very sound basis, that this is what makes sense from an economic and financial point of view. France must use this time to make its economy more competitive, he adds. Jose Manuel Barroso says that the EC's main recommendation this year is that all member states must be more ambitious on making economic reforms to boost economic growth. He cited the need to improve the single market for services, and to make changes to labour reforms. He also said member state must monitor the \"critical relationship\" between wage rises and productivity, suggesting that unemployment would increase if wages rose too quickly. He ended by calling for a new \"European consensus\" , saying this was vital for confidence, and thus growth. The EC's new country-specific recommendations are online here. Barroso adds that talk of a battle between growth and austerity has been futile. The key, he insists, is to make structural reforms to deliver long-term growth, Jose Manuel Barroso is outlining the EC's new recommendations now: He say Europe now has time to slow down the pace of fiscal consolidation, which is why it has decided to allow France, Spain, Poland, Slovenia the two-year extensions just announced, and the 12-month extensions for the Netherlands and Portugal. He is explaining that these member states need to use the extra time to make structural reforms. But because those changes will take time to deliver results, Barroso adds, \"specific focused action is needed for the unemployed, especially young people\". Breaking: the EC has agreed to give six European countries more time to bring their deficits under the official target. France, Spain, Poland and Slovenia are all being granted two-year extensions. Netherlands and Portugal both get one-year extensions. And as expected, the EC is also ending its 'excessive deficit procedure' against Italy, recognising the fact that its deficit is now below the 3% mark. The European Commission is announcing the details of its assessment of the EU member states national budgets NOW. A press conference is getting underway in Brussels - it will be streamed here. Speaking of the markets, the US government will be selling $33bn of five-year debt this afternoon (1pm New York time, or 6pm BST). That sale will be closely watched by bond investors, after the yield on 10-year Treasuries spiked 16 basis points to 2.17 per cent overnight (that's via fastFT, the Financial Times's new rolling markets news and views service which launched this morning, and is well worth checking out). Tuesday's rise in US bond yields has been blamed on concerns that the Federal Reserve will start 'tapering' its quantitative easing programme soon, especially after strong consumer confidence and house price data from America on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 is flirting with a triple-digit loss as Europe's financial markets turn south again. Here's the latest prices: FTSE 100: down 98 points at 6664, -1.44% German DAX: down 140 points at 8340, - 1.6% French CAC: down 54 points at 3997, -1.3% Spanish IBEX: down 61 points at 8449, -0.7% Italian FTSE MIB: down 120 points at 17398, -0.7% I just spoke with Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG, who cited three reasons for falling markets; 1) the OECD's new, lower economic forecasts (and the news that the IMF lowered its growth forecast for China) 2) Concern over Japan, after a coalition party member warned that the country's bond yields must not rise much higher (details here) 3) profit-taking ahead of next week's US jobs data (the non-farm payroll), which will give \"clarity and direction\" to the markets. She also explained that there's been volatility in the foreign exchange markets today, ahead of the European Central Bank's meeting next week. Will it impose negative interest rates on bank deposits, as the OECD advised today? As Kelly put it: There's a lack of real certainty over what's going on with central bank policy makers. The Dow Jones index is expected to fall around 100 points, or 0.7%, when it opens in two hours time. The futures market is also indicating that Japan's Nikkei will fall up to 3% tomorrow morning.... And here's the biggest fallers on the FTSE this lunchtime: Back to the OECD's economic forecasts, and secretary general Angel Gurria has offered hope that the pain in the eurozone's periphery will end. Speaking to reporters in Paris, Gurria argued that the economic measures being implemented in Europe's weaker countries will yield results. He told reporters that: In the periphery in particular, which was hardest hit by the crisis, that is where the reforms are taking place at the faster pace and where things eventually are, I believe, going to be looking better faster once we go through the acute stage of the crisis. Gurria was speaking after the OECD had urged the ECB to take more unconventional methods to end the eurozone recession (see 10.56am). Retail sales in the UK have fallen at their fastest rate in over a year. The CBI\u2019s latest Distributive Trades Survey, released a few moments ago, showed that 33% of firms reported a fall in sales this month, while just 23% said sales were up. That's the weakest year-on-year performance since January 2012, the CBI said. Sales of most items, including clothing and footware, fell, while grocery spending was flat. The survey also found that retailers are cutting back on their own spending, with investment intentions now the weakest since the start of last year. Barry Williams, Asda's chief merchandising office for food, warned that consumers are being squeezed: Retail sales growth has weakened since the start of the year as households continue to feel the pinch, with wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living. Analysts warned that the data shows the UK economy remains weak. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First, said: Unemployment has remained high, but the disparity between wages and prices is hurting those who still have a job as well. Energy and food prices have stayed high throughout the spring and unless they fall, or wages start to recover, the High Street will remain a tough place to be this summer\u2026 The big news from the OECD's new economic outlook (see 10.12am onwards) is that it has called on the European Central Bank to take more dramatic measures such as quantitative easing to drag the eurozone out of recession. The OECD wants the ECB to give serious consideration to launching an electronic money-print operation, in the face of a steadily shrinking economy. It also recommended cutting the interest rate paid to bank deposits into negative territory, meaning banks would effectively be charged to leave money sitting with the ECB rather than in the real economy. OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan warned (via Reuters): Europe is in a dire situation. We think that the euro zone could consider more aggressive options. We could call it a euro zone-style QE. The call came as the OECD slashed its forecast for the eurozone to a contraction of 0.6% this year, down from 0.1%. It warned that activity was falling in the face of fiscal consolidation, falling consumer confidence and tight credit conditiions, It urged government's to allow \"automatic stabilisers to operate\" -- ie, accept that tax receipts will fall during a recession while welfare payments will rise. \"High unemployment and excess capacity will depress inflationary pressures,\" it added, alongside this graph showing the grim state of the eurozone economy: And here's the key section from the report (page 78 onwards): The ECB should supplement its recent cut in the refinancing rate by reducing the deposit rate to below zero and issue forward guidance based on inflation prospects. Further non-standard measures might be needed to improve monetary policy transmission. In particular, additional asset purchases could be considered. Stronger bank balance sheets would enhance credit expansion and a banking union is critical to reduce negative feedback loops between sovereigns and banks. Structural reforms in labour and product markets, including completing the Single Market, would boost growth and jobs. You can download the OECD's latest economic forecasts here. Here's a round-up of the OECD's new economic forecasts for 2013: \u2022 It has slashed its growth forecast for the global economy, to 3.1% this year, from 3.4% six months ago. \u2022 It trimmed its US growth forecast to 1.9%, from 2%. \u2022 It cut its China forecast from 8.5% to 7.8% (so slightly higher than the iMF's own prediction this morning - see 7.52am) \u2022 The OECD now expects the eurozone to shrink by 0.6%, not the 0.1% contraction expected \u2022 German GDP is tipped to rise by 0.4%, down from 0.6% six months ago \u2022 While France's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3%, not grow by 0.3% as expected last November The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has just published its economic outlook, and slashed its growth forecast for the UK this year The OECB warned that Britain will grow slower than expected, due to the government's spending cuts and struggling consumer and business confidence. From Paris, our economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports: In its half-yearly forecasts, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that a long and bumpy recovery in the eurozone will continue to hit exports while the government's deficit reduction programme and the paying down of consumer debt will act as a brake on growth. The OECD said it expected UK national output to grow by 0.8% this year, in line with most economic forecasts, but down from 0.9% six months ago. It also cuts its growth forecast for 2014 to 1.5%, down from 1.6% six months ago. Here's Phillip's full story: UK economic growth forecasts cut for 2014 by OECD BMW is recruiting a small number of unemployed young Spaniards to work in Germany in a pilot programme to \"give something back\" to its customer countries. Here's the full story: BMW to recruit unemployed Spanish young people to 'give something back' And here's more details: Twenty-five workers aged 18 to 25 will be trained for a year at the German carmaker's headquarters in Munich, the BMW personnel chief, Milagros Caina-Andree, told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Wednesday. \"They should be immersed in German culture, possibly live with a BMW host family and work in development, sales, marketing or another area. After that, these young people can go back home or stay here,\" she said Yesterday, French president Francois Hollande argued that one solution to Europe's youth jobless crisis was to make it easier for appentices, as well as students, to study overseas. BMW's small pilot scheme could be the start of something bigger.... Loans to Eurozone companies fell again in April for the 12th month in a row, as the region's private sector found it hard to invest and some banks struggled to lend. The European Central Bank reported that loans to the private firms fell by 0.9% year-on-year last month, a drop of \u20ac18bn. But M3 money supply \u2013 which measures the amount of cash in the economy \u2013 was up by 3.2%. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global insight, said the data was disappointing, and \"clearly reflected an ongoing combination of limited supply and muted demand.\" And here's some early reaction of Twitter, from the BBC's Gavin Hewitt and Societe Generale's currency expert, Kit Juckes. And here's a graph showing how German unemployment has outperformed the eurozone average since the crisis struck (following today's data) Here's a full story about the IMF cutting its growth forecasts for China: IMF lowers China growth forecast and urges reforms. Here's Carsten Brzeski of ING's take on this morning's German jobless data (see 9.12am) Despite the stable unemployment rate, it remains noteworthy that the non-seasonally adjusted drop was the weakest May performance since 2005. To some, this is a clear warning that the debt crisis is finally taking its toll on the German labour market. In our view, however, the weak spring revival of the labour market can also be explained by the relatively high number of public holidays in May and the still cold weather. Therefore, it is far too premature to start singing Swan Songs on the labour market. Brzeski argues that the German labour market remains \"the showcase example\" for successful labour market reforms \u2013 topical, with the EC's latest budget recommendations due later today. Even the current success has also received a helping hand from strong export growth and the first wave of ageing, the reforms of the mid-2000s are still paying off. Up to the early 2000s, the German economy required growth of at least 1.5% to create new jobs. In recent years, GDP growth rates of less than 1% were sufficient for job creation. This bodes well for the near-term outlook, indicating that despite an expected GDP growth rate of only roughly 0.5% this year, the labour market should remain stable. At the Eurozone level, it is obvious that the success of its own structural reforms will further encourage the German government to continue hammering on structural reforms. The German government has declared that its labour market remains in good shape, after its latest unemployment data was released. The number of people out of work fell below the 3 million mark for the first time since December, dropping by more than 83,000. This pulled the jobless rate down to 6.8%, from 7.1% last month. However, on a seasonally-adjusted basis the number of people out of work rose by 21,000, much more than the 4,000 increase expected. That left the seasonally-adjusted jobless rate at 6.9%, unchanged from April. Labour office chairman Frank-Juergen Weise commented: Overall the German labour market is still in a good condition and is putting in a solid performance in a tough economic environment. Upbeat economic news from Sweden. It just beat analyst forecasts with growth of 0.6% in the first three months of 2013. That's twice as fast as economists had expected \u2013 in a quarter when the eurozone fell deeper into recession. The other main event in the diary today comes from the OECD, which will publish its latest economic outlook in Paris this morning. That, and the EC's latest budget review (8.20am), means Europe's struggling economy could be under particular scrutiny. \u2022 OECD economic outlook released. 10am BST \u2022 EC announces annual budget review and makes policy recommendations: from 1pm BST \u2022 UK retail sales: 11am BST \u2022 Portuguese parliament debates latest budget: afternoon The Bank of Thailand has just become the latest central bank to ease monetary policy, by cutting interest rates by a quarter-point to 2.5%. Around \u20ac8bn of public money will be 'unlocked' if Italy is freed from the EC's excessive deficit procedure today (as appears likely). That money had been earmarked for deficit reduction, but could now be spent by Enrico Letta's government. The Italian PM, though, has already tried to dampen hopes of a spending splurge, saying resources will not be freed immediately (more details here). The European Commission is expected to formally shift its focus away from austerity and in favour of growth later today, when it publishes its annual review of the national budgets of all 27 EU members. The EC is expected to give three of its largest countries, France, Spain and the Netherlands, more time to bring their deficits down to the 3% target. They'll be encouraged to reshape their economies, open up their labour markets, and implement structural reforms, but the underlying message will be that the pace of fiscal consolidation can be slowed. As one official put it to Reuters: The main message will be that the emphasis is shifting to structural reforms from austerity. That is likely to mean two-year extensions for both Spain and France, giving them until 2015 to cut their annual borrowings below 3% of national output. The Netherlands is expected to get 12-months grace. The EC will probably argue that the move is justified because the threat of a eurozone break-up has faded away. But opponents of full-blooded austerity could also take heart that the pendulum has swung, finally, in their favour. The EC won't abandon its push for reform, either. Instead, it is likely to criticise a number of governments for failing to implement reforms quickly enough. Francois Hollande's government could be singled out. As the FT puts it: Brussels is expected to criticise several governments for their slow pace of reform and will demand immediate action by several it believes are at risk of prolonged economic stagnation. These include France, where senior officials in Brussels and Berlin believe time is running out for sufficient labour and economic reforms. Italy, though, is likely to be freed from the EC's excessive deficit procedure, having cut its annual borrowing below 3% of GDP. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the eurozone and the wider global economy. Overnight, the International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth forecast for China, in the latest signal that the world's second-largest economy is slowing. The IMF urged the Beijing government to take \"decisive\" action to stimulate domestic consumption and to control the recent expansion of credit, as it trimmed its growth forecast for 2013 and 2014 to 7.75%, from 8% this year and 8.2% next year. David Lipton, the first managing director of the IMF, warned that China's ability to absorb troubles in the global economy was shrinking. Lipton said; While China still has significant policy space and financial capacity to maintain stability even in the face of adverse shocks, the margins of safety are narrowing and a decisive impetus to reforms is needed to contain vulnerabilities and move the economy to a more sustainable growth path. The IMF fears that the growth of credit in China is creating a stock of bad debts that will hamper future growth. As Lipton put it: China\u2019s economy faces important challenges. In particular, the rapid growth in total social financing raises concern about the quality of investment and its impact on repayment capacity. Bloomberg has more details from Beijing: China Growth Outlook Cut by IMF as \u2018Decisive\u2019 Reforms Urged. China needs a \u201cdecisive push for rebalancing toward higher household incomes and consumption,\u201d Lipton said. The nation should allow more competition in industries \u201ccurrently considered strategic\u201d and increase dividends from state-owned enterprises to \u201cimprove financial discipline and provide additional fiscal revenue,\u201d Lipton said. The IMF's annual report comes a week after China's factory output took a surprise drop. Today's growth forecasts brings the IMF roughly into line with City analysts, but will add to concerns that the Chinese economy is losing its zip. I'll pull together more reaction to the report this morning. Also coming up today... the EC is to announce its annual review of compliance with its budget rules. It is expected to give several countries more time to hit their deficit targets. More to follow....",

      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, is to be Kirsty Young's guest on Desert Island Discs. King, who is being by replaced the Canadian central bank governor Mark Carney, will be the castaway on Sunday on the popular BBC Radio 4 programme. The BBC revealed King would be the first Bank of England governor to appear on the programme in listings published on Wednesday, but declined to reveal any of King's records or his choice of luxury. However, that has not stopped the Twittersphere speculating. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) who is a fan of 1970s rock and a band member himself, suggested Easy Money \u2013 stipulating the songs of that name by King Crimson, Rickie Lee Jones, Billy Joel or ELO \u2013 while the consumer campaign SaveOurSavers suggested: \"Surely ANYTHING by Dire Straits.\" Dire Straits tracks were popular with Twitter users using the hashtag #MervynSongGuesses. Iron Lad suggested Money for Nothing, which he said would be \"Very apt song and artist names I think!\". Several others suggested Edith Piaf's Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien, and Meat Loaf's Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are. The BBC also refused to reveal anything King has said in the pre-recorded interview, but it seems unlikely that he will slip into retirement without, once again, calling for further economic stimulus. He may also call for an end to \"banker bashing\". In a valedictory interview with Sky News this month he called on the public and the media to stop \"demonising\" bankers. \"Don't demonise individuals here. This wasn't a problem of individuals, this was a problem of failure of a system,\" he said. \"We collectively allowed the banking system to become too big, we gave them far too much status and standing in society and we didn't regulate it adequately by ensuring it had enough capital.\" He said regulatory reforms to the way the City operates would lead to a \"revolution in the way in which banking is handled and we will be able to be proud again of British banking\". King was brought up in Wolverhampton \u2013 and may therefore favour a tune by one of its famous musical sons \u2013 Slade perhaps, or Kevin Rowland of Dexy's Midnight Runners. He read economics at Cambridge University \u2013 so may choose a little Radiohead in honour of student bandmember Colin Greenwood \u2013 before going on to be an academic at Cambridge, Birmingham, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the London School of Economics. King, 65, joined the Bank of England as chief economist in 1991 and rose to become governor in 2003.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's retailers are facing their toughest trading conditions in almost 18 months as cash-poor consumers cut back on their spending, the CBI said. The monthly healthcheck of the high street from the employers' organisation recorded the steepest fall in sales since January 2012 \u2013 continuing the weakening trend over the past six months. In findings that will raise doubts about the pace of the UK's likely economic recovery, the CBI said sales of clothing, footwear and household durable goods were all lower in May than a year earlier. Online sales \u2013 a source of growing retail strength in recent years \u2013 were down for the first time since August 2011. Barry Williams, Asda chief merchandising officer for food and chair of the CBI distributive trades survey panel, said: \"Retail sales growth has weakened since the start of the year as households continue to feel the pinch, with wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living.\" Just under a quarter of the firms (23%) questioned in the CBI survey said sales were higher this month than in May 2012, while 33% said they were lower. The rounded balance of -11 percentage points was the weakest since the -22 points in January 2012, when Britain was in recession. Only 8% of retailers said business was good for the time of year, against 25% who said they were bad. Retailers had been expecting a poor May, the CBI said, but had been surprised by the lack of consumer spending. Shops and stores expect a modest bounceback in June to be sustained across the summer months but are still planning to cut back on investment. Almost half of retailers (41%) said they would trim capital expenditure over the next year while only 18% said they would increase investment. The balance was the weakest since February 2012. Despite the disappointing level of sales, the survey found that as many firms were hiring staff in May as were laying them off.

    "webTitle": "OECD cuts UK economic growth forecasts for 2014", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The west's leading economic thinktank yesterday backed George Osborne's spending cuts as Brussels conceded that half a dozen debt-ridden EU countries should be given up to two extra years to reduce their budget overspends. In its half-yearly forecast, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the UK was on the right path to a more balanced budget, despite warning that cuts and low consumer and business confidence would put a brake on growth. It said the economy would grow by 1.5% in 2014, down from its previous forecast of a stronger 1.6% increase. \"The muted global recovery, especially in Europe, and the necessary adjustment of still-impaired public and private sector balance sheets continue to weigh on growth,\" the thinktank said in its much anticipated economic forecast. The OECD, which has 34 rich country members, added that despite a resilient labour market, UK consumer spending was being held back by weak real earnings, fragile confidence and the determination of householders to cut their debts. Private investment was also restrained by weak demand and \"high uncertainty\", it said. But it backed George Osborne's plans for further spending cuts, saying: \"With a high budget deficit and gross government debt rising to 90% of GDP in 2012, further fiscal consolidation is necessary to restore the sustainability of public finances.\" The European Commission, which is also keen to force national governments to reduce their debts, said Spain, France, Portugal, Poland, the Netherlands and Slovenia can take up to two extra years to lower their deficits. Intense lobbying persuaded Brussels that previous deficit reduction plans would be self-defeating and lead to lower growth and tax receipts, and in turn higher debts. However, several analysts argued that Brussels had made only a tactical retreat and countries would be forced to press ahead with many of the same spending cuts. The Open Europe thinktank said: \"For all the talk of this being the 'end of austerity' or 'austerity in retreat', is much really changing? Sure, there is some tinkering with timelines for deficit reduction, but ultimately the eurozone is still going along the same policy path - just slightly more slowly.\" The OECD highlighted concerns that the euro will remain a danger for the world economy if policy decisions prolong the current recession. Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist, said: \"In the euro area, still-rising unemployment is the most pressing challenge for policymakers. Protracted weakness could evolve into stagnation with negative implications for the global economy.\" This, he said, would raise the spectre of further weakening banks, higher government borrowing and the threat of a country being forced to leave the single currency. Throughout the euro crisis the European Central Bank (ECB) has resisted following the unconventional monetary policies pursued by the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and more recently the Bank of Japan, preferring to act as an insurer of last resort to debt-ridden eurozone nations. But the OECD urged the ECB to cut interest rates further and take a more active role in supporting an increase in lending to businesses. Even without a change of heart at the ECB's Frankfurt offices, the eurozone will begin to exit its recession in the second half of the year, the OECD said, though several countries including Italy and Spain will still be contracting into 2014. It sees Spain's economy shrinking a further 1.7% this year, while growth of just 0.4 percent in 2014 will not create jobs. Its deficit will barely shift next year, with a drop from 7% of GDP in 2012, not including the cost of bailing out its banks, to 6.9%, while unemployment is set to rise to 28%. Italy is forecast to grow in 2014, but by less than 1%. The OECD had little better news for France, which has seen its economy flatline for two years and its new socialist government focus more on reducing debt than creating jobs. The OECD welcomed this stance, recommending that Paris allow welfare benefits to support those who are thrown out of work as public sector cuts bite. The thinktank said Britain needed to make strides to increase investment and especially to improve infrastructure spending and housebuilding to spur jobs growth. It warned there could be another house price bubble without a building programme. Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said the OECD joined a long list of organisations to say that the government needs to increase the number of homes being built. \"After the IMF's damning criticism last week the government must act to build the affordable homes we need to kickstart the economy, tackle the housing crisis and strengthen our economy for the long term. And they must tackle the youth unemployment crisis with a compulsory jobs guarantee for every young person out of work for over a year, funded by a tax on bank bonuses,\" he said. The slow recovery in Britain and the eurozone contrasted with the forecast for the US, which is expected to reach almost 3% growth next year. The OECD heaped praise on Washington's successful recapitalisation of its banks, which allowed the banking system to get back on its feet and kickstart lending to households and businesses. Unemployment in the US is forecast to fall from its current 7.5% level and its budget deficit to decrease steadily while the UK unemployment rate is predicted to remain stuck on 8% and its deficit to fall only slowly. Nevertheless, the picture for the UK is mildly better than six months ago, when, in the depths of the euro crisis, the OECD said unemployment would rise to 8.3% this year. Padoan, who urged countries to co-operate to facilitate growth, said: \"While still disappointing, the global economy is moving forward, and it is doing so at multiple speeds. These multiple speeds reflect different paths towards self-sustained growth, with each path carrying its own mix of risks.\" He criticised moves by the US Congress to impose public spending cuts, known as the sequester, before the recovery is entrenched, which it said would limit the country's growth spurt, but praised the longer-term path of government policy. \"In the United States, the combination of a repaired financial system and a revival in confidence is driving growth. Private sector demand is stabilising as household deleveraging is far advanced, house prices are rebounding and wealth accumulation is supporting consumption. Employment is growing, adding to confidence.\" The OECD as a whole is expected to grow by just 1.2% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014, with unemployment falling from 8.1% to 8% over the two-year period.",
