    "webTitle": "Malaysia Airlines cuts 6,000 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Malaysia Airlines is to slash its staff numbers by a third, cutting 6,000 jobs, after the airline suffered the two worst disasters in modern aviation only five months apart. The carrier had been struggling financially even before the disasters that beset it this year, starting with the unexplained disappearance of flight MH370 with 239 people aboard in March. The airline's name became synonymous with disaster after a second major tragedy in July, when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing 298 passengers and crew. The 6,000 job losses announced in Kuala Lumpur on Friday are part of a major restructuring of the airline, including the appointment of a new chief executive by next year. The state announced plans to take full ownership of its 77-year-old flag carrier after trading in the airline's shares was suspended last month, when it was valued at less than 15% of its 2012 peak. Currently Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional, is the 69% majority owner, and plans to buy out other shareholders at a premium. Malaysia Airlines will also review its routes, after flying with high numbers of empty seats on many of its planes. The airline has been adding flight capacity and slashing fares to get customers aboard, meaning overall passenger numbers have only dropped by 0.3% year on year. Revenue dropped 5% in the three months from April to June even as available seats rose 9% from 2013. The full effect on sales has yet to be seen as the airline offered full refunds to passengers who had booked to fly later in the year after the shooting down of MH17. One route that will continue is the twice-daily service between Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur, a high-capacity service operated with Malaysia's Airbus A380 superjumbo. A London-based Malaysia Airlines spokesman said: \"The London-Kuala Lumpur route is highly successful and will carry on. Today's announcement is all about rebuilding the airline after these two awful incidents. The airline is being reshaped and the aim is to return it to profitability.\" Analysts anticipate that Malaysia's restructuring could extend to selling off its engineering, airport services or budget airline units. Not all of Malaysia's staff may be unwilling to leave the airline: it emerged this week that almost 200 cabin crew had already quit this year, citing family pressure and fear of flying after the two disasters, which claimed the lives of 27 crew. Unions reported that those who remained were often working extended hours due to staff shortages. Sales have been hit hard since March, with customers from China deserting the airline after the disappearance of MH370, which was carrying 152 Chinese citizens among the 227 passengers presumed to have died. The airline lost \u00a358.5m in the last quarter, putting it on track to exceed the \u00a3222m loss it recorded in 2013. John Strickland, of the independent aviation consultancy JLS Consulting, said turning around Malaysia Airlines' fortunes was not impossible but \"a very steep mountain to climb\". He added: \"It's not going to be a quick fix. On one hand, they should be well placed: they are in an extremely buoyant market in Asia. But they have got stiff competition from budget rivals Air Asia and Air Asia X, quality neighbouring airlines like Singapore, and the Gulf carriers. \"They face all these current challenges on top of a lengthy history of being overmanned and suffering state interference. They have to reduce their operations, take capacity out of the market where it's not profitable, and overcome the public reaction to these incidents: to show they are compassionate and restore confidence that they are nothing but safety focused as an airline.\" An intensive underwater search for MH370 will resume next month, after the mapping of a 34,000sq mile area of the southern Indian Ocean floor by two survey ships. The Boeing 777 disappeared on 8 March en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A broad international search operation revealed no physical trace of the plane, but analysis of satellite signals has led authorities to believe it crashed in the sea west of Australia. Dutch investigators are expected to issue an interim report soon on the MH17 crash in eastern Ukraine. It is believed that pro-Russian separatists fired the missile that brought down another Malaysian Boeing 777 plane, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July.",

In short, there is a revolution under way in the grocery business and Tesco has taken way too long to wake up to that fact. Complacency and arrogance set in, and the current problems are the result.</p> <p>The discounters and upmarket rivals \u2013 Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose \u2013 are eating Tesco\u2019s breakfast, lunch and tea. Shoppers are moving away from the grocer\u2019s vast out-of-town stores in droves, as they find better prices and easier ways to shop - the high street and on their sofa with an iPad.</p> <p>It will be far from easy for [incoming chief executive] Lewis. He faces the mother of turnaround challenges. Tesco is a vast supertanker and it will take a long time to change direction. He faces issues in almost every one of the dozen markets where Tesco operates, from Turkey to Thailand, but it is the UK, which still generates two thirds of group profits, where he must first focus.</p> <p>Lewis must find a way to reverse the trend of shoppers drifting away from out-of-town stores and provide a reason for them to return. That probably means substantially lower prices (and lower profits). He needs to decide whether to keep the Clubcard, which was once viewed as a hugely powerful tool but has been devalued by constant tinkering.</p> <p>Lewis must also beef up his management. The latest trading update indicates that large parts of Tesco\u2019s top team are too wedded to the past. He needs new talent. And he needs to tackle all of this while the discounters continue to turn the screw. Both Aldi and Lidl have recently outlined major expansion plans. The former is spending \u00a320m on a new advertising campaign. Christmas is now on the horizon in the grocery business, and Lewis\u2019s priority is to somehow arrest the decline \u2013 fast. If he cannot, Friday\u2019s profit warning will certainly not be the last.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54006d5ce4b06f5272fb426d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-29T12:21:42.461Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3a3bc25d-d5d4-4cca-b6a5-7b92824fbed2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/29/1409314888197/b306ed51-9237-481f-93d1-8775b2739532-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Russian soldiers near the border with Ukraine\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian soldiers near the border with Ukraine.

Moreover, with inflation inching towards zero, the cushion against deflation is getting smaller and smaller. <br></p> <p>To be sure, based on current oil and food prices, headline inflation should start to pick up from October onwards.

Since the moment those projections were published in June we have been arguing that the ECB\u2019s baseline profile contained more than a tincture of rose-tinted optimism: the belief that inflation this year would manage to average 0.7%, and would subsequently eke out an \u2018improvement\u2019 to 1.1% in 2015, seemed fanciful to us from the very outset. <br></p> <p>And in light of subsequent outturns, our more grim prognostication has been largely vindicated (our own forecasts are annual averages of 0.5% and 0.8% respectively). As a consequence, it is now highly likely (in our view) that those staff projections will be cut down to size next week.</p> <p>That said, weaker projections do not necessarily correspond to ECB policy action. We think that while there is a risk of a small interest rate reduction next week from the ECB, the market is getting too far ahead of itself in talking about large-scale asset purchase programmes. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54004b7be4b0231e2167f142\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-29T09:50:07.196Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reaction is coming in on this morning\u2019s eurozone data.</p> <p><strong>Christian Schulz</strong>, senior economist at <strong>Berenberg</strong> on inflation:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What looks like good news for many Eurozone consumers is mixed news for the ECB. Eurozone headline inflation edged down further in August, reaching only 0.3% yoy. That strengthens households\u2019 real spending power, but for the ECB, the distance of actual inflation to the 2% target keeps growing. That is likely to feed into more discussions in Frankfurt about further policy easing. </p> <p> However, most of the decline continues to be driven by volatile energy and food prices. Core inflation actually increased slightly from 0.8% to 0.9% in August. The ECB will look through the monthly volatility in inflation at its forthcoming meetings.</p> <p>Much more important than inflation rates now is the economic rough patch caused by the crisis in Eastern Ukraine. Forward-looking indicators continue to fall, raising the risk that the Eurozone recovery may be interrupted for longer. That could delay any reversion in inflation trends and mean lower inflation for longer. As that risks de-anchoring inflation expectations, the ECB is likely to step up its response by December at the latest.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on <strong>unemployment</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The eurozone\u2019s labour market is not showing any impact from the Ukraine crisis yet. Unemployment was virtually unchanged in July and the rate stayed at 11.5%. </p> <p>The trends at the country level were unchanged: unemployment fell in Germany and the reform countries on the periphery. </p> <p>By contrast, unemployment rose in the reform-laggards France (+0.1ppt to 10.3%) and Italy (+0.3ppt to 12.6%). The labour market usually lags the economy, so that latest economic slowdown may take some time to affect statistics. <br></p> <p>However, with much of the periphery relatively unaffected by the crisis in Ukraine, chances are that the improvement there will continue. Germany is strong enough to weather temporary setbacks. France and Italy seriously need structural reforms that would make it more attractive for firm to hire.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, after a day that brought us another profit warning from Tesco, a drop in eurozone inflation, and a fall in US consumer spending. European stock markets have erased earlier gains amid fading expectations that Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the European Central Bank will further loosen monetary policy at next week\u2019s meeting. In the US, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq have also slipped into the red after opening higher. There was no light at the end of the tunnel for Tesco, which issued a surprise profits warning this morning - its third since the beginning of 2014. The supermarket slashed its interim dividend by 75% to 1.16p a share, in a major blow for shareholders. Outgoing chief executive Philip Clarke is leaving today, making way for his replacement, David Lewis who starts on Monday - a month earlier than planned. UK house prices rose by 0.8% in August according to Nationwide. Annual house price inflation rose to 11 %. The average price of a UK home is now \u00a3189,306. Annual inflation in the eurozone fell to 0.3% in August from 0.4% in July, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistics agency. The eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate was unchanged in July at 11.5%. Both were in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. Bonuses paid out in the UK rose almost 5% in the year to April to more than \u00a340bn, which means they now make up the biggest proportion of workers\u2019 pay packages since before the economic downturn. US consumer spending fell unexpectedly in July, as households chose to boost their savings rather than spend their cash. In Ukraine, prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk urged the IMF to release the next tranche of a $17bn loan as fighting with pro-Russian rebels continued. The IMF board was meeting today to discuss the $1.4bn installment. Thank you very much for reading the blog today. Have a great weekend. AM Over to Greece, where new figures suggest the country\u2019s archaeological gems are the biggest source of untapped revenue. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith reports from Athens. It may be a no-brainer but, finally, Greek authorities have caught onto the fact that the country\u2019s myriad archaeological treasures sell. Data collated by the culture ministry has shown a phenomenal rise in the number of visitors to sites since prime minister Antonis Samaras, a former culture minister who is known to take an active interest in the sector, announced that opening hours would be extended from 8am to 8am to capitalise on the record number of tourists (at 21.5 million almost twice the entire Greek population) this year. Visits to all major sites were up by 27% between April and June with revenues rising by 21%, compared to the same period last year. Sites such as Hadria\u2019s Library, a Roman gem that had previously fallen victim to the haphazard opening hours kept by culture ministry staff, saw an increase of 151% in visitor numbers. The Archaeological Museum of Herakleion, a treasure trove in the Cretan capital that had been under renovation for the past year, experienced an increased turnover of 103%. In times of yore, powerful unions of guards and other officials, had been known to walk off the job when summer temperatures swelled leaving tourists fuming outside the gates of monuments like the 5th century BC Acropolis in Athens. The pound is heading for its first week of gains in eight against the dollar as expectations persist that the Bank of England will be the first major central bank to raise interest rates. Sterling is roughly flat against the dollar this afternoon, at $1.6584, above the five-month low of $1.6501 it hit on Monday. Friday\u2019s upbeat UK consumer confidence index and stronger than expected Nationwide house prices survey - as well as weak US consumer spending figures - helped to push up the pound against the dollar. US shares rose in early trading on Wall Street, ahead of the long Labor Day weekend. Dow Jones: +0.13% at 17,101.21 S&amp;P 500: +0.17% at 2,000.11 Nasdaq: +0.3% at 4,571.20 The European Union must consider additional sanctions against Russia according to the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. Current sanctions \u201chave not worked\u201d in curbing Moscow\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine, he told journalists. He said the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine was \u201cextremely concerning and violates international law\u201d. Rutte added: \u201cWe do not accept it and additional sanctions should not be ruled out.\u201d Rob Carnell, economist at ING, is putting the weak US consumer spending numbers down to volatility in the monthly data. But, he adds, \u201cwe will have to consider downward revisions to growth forecasts if the August numbers do not improve markedly\u201d. US consumers were unwilling to part with their cash in July, instead choosing to bolster their savings. Spending fell unexpectedly by 0.1%, marking the first fall since January according to the Commerce Department\u2019s data. Savings however rose to the highest level in more than a year and a half, reflecting caution despite an improving economic backdrop. Consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the US economy, and analysts had expected it to increase by 0.2% in July. The Guardian\u2019s Julia Finch has given her verdict on Tesco after its profit warning this morning. Tesco\u2019s arrogance and complacency towards rivals has cost them dearly What has gone wrong? In short, there is a revolution under way in the grocery business and Tesco has taken way too long to wake up to that fact. Complacency and arrogance set in, and the current problems are the result. The discounters and upmarket rivals \u2013 Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose \u2013 are eating Tesco\u2019s breakfast, lunch and tea. Shoppers are moving away from the grocer\u2019s vast out-of-town stores in droves, as they find better prices and easier ways to shop - the high street and on their sofa with an iPad. It will be far from easy for [incoming chief executive] Lewis. He faces the mother of turnaround challenges. Tesco is a vast supertanker and it will take a long time to change direction. He faces issues in almost every one of the dozen markets where Tesco operates, from Turkey to Thailand, but it is the UK, which still generates two thirds of group profits, where he must first focus. Lewis must find a way to reverse the trend of shoppers drifting away from out-of-town stores and provide a reason for them to return. That probably means substantially lower prices (and lower profits). He needs to decide whether to keep the Clubcard, which was once viewed as a hugely powerful tool but has been devalued by constant tinkering. Lewis must also beef up his management. The latest trading update indicates that large parts of Tesco\u2019s top team are too wedded to the past. He needs new talent. And he needs to tackle all of this while the discounters continue to turn the screw. Both Aldi and Lidl have recently outlined major expansion plans. The former is spending \u00a320m on a new advertising campaign. Christmas is now on the horizon in the grocery business, and Lewis\u2019s priority is to somehow arrest the decline \u2013 fast. If he cannot, Friday\u2019s profit warning will certainly not be the last. Berenberg economists Holger Schmieding and Christian Schulz have put a note out entitled The impact of Putin\u2019s war. They have cut their eurozone growth forecast for this year to 0.6% from an earlier forecast of 0.7%, and downgraded expectations for 2015 to 1.1% from 1.4%. For Germany, they lowered their 2014 and 2015 forecasts to 1.3% (-0.2 points) and 1.4% (-0.5 points), respectively. This week, Russia has seriously escalated the conflict by opening a new front. Near-term, the war could still become worse as Ukraine tries its utmost to stop the aggressor, while Russia\u2019s more open incursions into Ukraine have raised fears that Russian-backed forces may possibly move all the way along the coast to occupied Crimea. We have argued since March that the confidence shock of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine could cause a brief German recession. While that scenario is not unfolding yet, we are edging closer. We cannot fully exclude a brief technical recession, even if we expect Germany to still avoid it. Putin\u2019s war has interrupted the eurozone\u2019s mediocre upswing. Growth will resume after tensions fade and businesses dare to invest again. The underlying fundamentals for major parts of core Europe, as well as for the reform countries on the periphery, remain positive. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler and Julia Kollewe have put together a handy timeline on Tesco here. Back to the big corporate story of the day - Tesco\u2019s surprise profit warning. Tesco\u2019s shares have recovered some of the earlier losses but are still down 4%. Retail analysts have been busy cutting their price targets for the supermarket chain. Outgoing chief executive Philip Clarke is still getting a lot of stick over Tesco\u2019s dwindling fortunes, and his replacement David Lewis has got a massive job on his hands when he starts on Monday (a month early). Here is some of the reaction to today\u2019s gloomy update. Darren Shirley, analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers, is not amused. We have now lost count of the number of times that we have downgraded our forecasts for Tesco over the last three years. Whilst so, we have another announcement today (29th August 2014) that represents the inverse of whatever the icing on the cake stands for. It is very disappointing to see this update, which fundamentally raises questions in our minds about the capability of the management under Mr. Clarke at this once great company. As such, we expect, as part of a range of measures, there to be considerable senior management change under Mr. Lewis in time, as Tesco needs a world class top team to take it forward. Phil Dorrell, director of Retail Remedy, says there is a silver lining for incoming chief executive David Lewis. A dividend cut of this degree underlines the extent of the problems Tesco is facing. Throw in the fact that Dave Lewis is being parachuted in a month early and you have a grocer that is truly on the rack. Dave Lewis has his work cut out, and then some, when he joins next week. Dave Lewis will probably be delighted that such bad news precedes his start. It highlights the continuing saga of profit leak that clearly runs deeper than most feared. For Tesco, right now, it will be feeling like Autumn metaphorically, not just literally. What\u2019s certain is that we won\u2019t be seeing a rapid turnaround. Tesco is an oil tanker and any material change of direction will not happen quickly. In the weeks and months ahead, Dave Lewis and his team will need to rethink the entire Tesco model.\u201d More reaction here. Ukraine\u2019s prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk has urged the IMF to release the next tranche of a $17bn loan as fighting with pro-Russian rebels continues. The heavily industrialised areas of Donetsk and Luhansk contributed almost 17% of Ukranian GDP in 2013 and have been plagued with fighting. The PM said: The [revenue] that we haven\u2019t been receiving from Donetsk and Luhansk is miniscule compared with the billions we are spending on war. For us it is critically important to get a positive decision from the IMF and we\u2019ve done everythin [to achieve] this. The IMF\u2019s board is meeting later today to decide whether or not to release a second $1.4bn tranche of funding. Martin van Vliet of ING says the pressure is on Mario Draghi and the ECB as the eurozone heads closer towards deflation. The very low eurozone inflation reading for August reinforces pressure on the ECB to consider further monetary stimulus on top of what is already in the pipeline. The ECB may argue that the latest down-leg in eurozone inflation is driven by the volatile energy component and therefore does not warrant a reassessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. But to the extent that it further dampens inflation expectations, the latest inflation drop is of significance. Moreover, with inflation inching towards zero, the cushion against deflation is getting smaller and smaller. To be sure, based on current oil and food prices, headline inflation should start to pick up from October onwards. But it will likely continue to significantly undershoot the ECB\u2019s medium-term target. As such, there remains a compelling case for a more expansionary macroeconomic policy stance in the eurozone. James Ashley, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets, says the ECB\u2019s inflation forecasts are looking hopelessly out of date. This latest inflation reading is surely the demise for the ECB staff\u2019s existing forecasts. Since the moment those projections were published in June we have been arguing that the ECB\u2019s baseline profile contained more than a tincture of rose-tinted optimism: the belief that inflation this year would manage to average 0.7%, and would subsequently eke out an \u2018improvement\u2019 to 1.1% in 2015, seemed fanciful to us from the very outset. And in light of subsequent outturns, our more grim prognostication has been largely vindicated (our own forecasts are annual averages of 0.5% and 0.8% respectively). As a consequence, it is now highly likely (in our view) that those staff projections will be cut down to size next week. That said, weaker projections do not necessarily correspond to ECB policy action. We think that while there is a risk of a small interest rate reduction next week from the ECB, the market is getting too far ahead of itself in talking about large-scale asset purchase programmes. Reaction is coming in on this morning\u2019s eurozone data. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg on inflation: What looks like good news for many Eurozone consumers is mixed news for the ECB. Eurozone headline inflation edged down further in August, reaching only 0.3% yoy. That strengthens households\u2019 real spending power, but for the ECB, the distance of actual inflation to the 2% target keeps growing. That is likely to feed into more discussions in Frankfurt about further policy easing. However, most of the decline continues to be driven by volatile energy and food prices. Core inflation actually increased slightly from 0.8% to 0.9% in August. The ECB will look through the monthly volatility in inflation at its forthcoming meetings. Much more important than inflation rates now is the economic rough patch caused by the crisis in Eastern Ukraine. Forward-looking indicators continue to fall, raising the risk that the Eurozone recovery may be interrupted for longer. That could delay any reversion in inflation trends and mean lower inflation for longer. As that risks de-anchoring inflation expectations, the ECB is likely to step up its response by December at the latest. And on unemployment: The eurozone\u2019s labour market is not showing any impact from the Ukraine crisis yet. Unemployment was virtually unchanged in July and the rate stayed at 11.5%. The trends at the country level were unchanged: unemployment fell in Germany and the reform countries on the periphery. By contrast, unemployment rose in the reform-laggards France (+0.1ppt to 10.3%) and Italy (+0.3ppt to 12.6%). The labour market usually lags the economy, so that latest economic slowdown may take some time to affect statistics. However, with much of the periphery relatively unaffected by the crisis in Ukraine, chances are that the improvement there will continue. Germany is strong enough to weather temporary setbacks. France and Italy seriously need structural reforms that would make it more attractive for firm to hire. Only then will they benefit more quickly once the next upswing begins. The Eurostat figures on eurozone unemployment show the number of people out of work in the region was roughly stable in August at 18.4m. Germany and Austria had the lowest unemployment rate at 4.9%. Greece had the highest rate, at 27.2% (in May), followed by Spain, at 24.5%. Youth unemployment fell in the eurozone, but remains high. The jobless rate among the region\u2019s under 25s fell to 23.2% in July, from 24% in June. It was the lowest rate since June 2012. The number of young people without a job fell to 3.3m, down 226,000. Again, there are still big variations between countries. Spain had the highest rate in July at 53.8%, while Germany had the lowest at 7.8%. Eurozone annual inflation fell to 0.3% in August from 0.4% in July, as expected. Economists also got it right on the region\u2019s unemployment rate, which was unchanged at 11.5% in July. This (slightly) takes the heat off ECB president Mario Draghi. A bigger dip in inflation would have raised calls for the central bank to announce quantitative easing at next week\u2019s policy meeting. The Office for National Statistics has published bonuses data for the period May 2013 to April 2014. The bonus pot increased by 4.9% to \u00a340.5bn. Bonuses amounted to 6% of total pay during the year, the higest since before the financial crisis. \u00a314.4bn of bonuses were paid in the finance and insurance industry, which increased by 2.9% over the year, and \u00a326.1bn was paid out in the rest of the economy, up 6.1%. Malaysia Airlines is cutting 6,000 jobs - a third of the workforce - in the wake of the disappearance of flight MH370 over the southern Indian Ocean in March and the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine last month. Press Association reports: The job losses, announced in Kuala Lumpur, are part of a major restructuring of the airline which will see a new chief executive in place next year, as well as the carrier being completely taken over by the Malaysian government. There will also be a restructuring of routes flown, although the twice-daily service between Heathrow airport in west London and Kuala Lumpur, on which the world\u2019s largest passenger plane the Airbus A380 superjumbo operates, is set to continue. A London-based Malaysia Airlines spokesman said: \u201cThe London-Kuala Lumpur route is highly successful and will carry on. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is all about rebuilding the airline after these two awful incidents. The airline is being reshaped and the aim is to return it to profitability.\u201d Overnight we had GfK\u2019s latest snapshot of the UK consumer\u2019s mood. The headline confidence index increased three points in August to 1. It might not sound too impressive, but it is only the second time since March 2005 that the index has made it into positive territory. GfK\u2019s Nick Moon said confidence had been fairly stable over recent months. It looks as if we might be in a new period of relative stability for the Index. After several months of almost constant increase, the last four months have all seen the Index within a range of 0 (plus or minus 2). And indeed the last five months have all been within a range of -1 (plus or minus 2). There is no guarantee how long this stable position will last \u2013 a rush of good or bad economic news could set off a marked rise or fall, but things could stay like this for a while \u2013 in 2011/12 there was more than a year when the index stayed in the range of -31 (plus or minus 2). It is worth noting that the score for the two questions concerning the last 12 months rose by more than the two concerning the next 12 months, suggesting that people are reassessing the past more than feeling more hopeful about the future. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s board will meet today to review Ukraine\u2019s programme and decide on a $1.4bn (\u00a3844m) tranche of funding. At a regular press briefing on Thursday, Gerry Rice, IMF communications director, had this to say on Ukraine: If the situation was exacerbated, the programme would have to be significantly recalibrated, including the financing. The degree of uncertainty is large. Investors in Europe do not appear overly concerned this morning by the news that there are more than 1,000 Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. FTSE 100: +0.3% at 6,827.34 CAC 40: +0.6% at 4,393.6 FTSE MIB: +1% at 20,538 DAX: +0.5% at 9,508.42 IBEX 35: +0.4% at 10,764.30 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, thinks investors should be thinking ahead on Ukraine. For all President Putin\u2019s denials that Russian troops aren\u2019t operating in Ukraine, we get new evidence every day to pretty much confirm that they are, and yesterday\u2019s reports of Russian backed separatists moving into Ukraine further south appears to have raised the stakes further in the ongoing conflict between the Ukrainian army and separatist forces. There had been some optimism earlier this week that the meeting between President Putin and Ukraine President Poroshenko could well be a catalyst for a reduction in tensions, while in fact it turns out the opposite could well be the case, as once again President Putin\u2019s conciliatory words are not matched by his deeds, or more to the point to the actions of his forces. One thing is certain, the escalation in the last 24 hours would suggest that more sanctions are likely to be in the offing, as the tension goes up a notch, and investors would do well to take note of this. Later this morning we will be bringing you the latest news from the eurozone: Annual inflation is expected to slow to 0.3% in August from 0.4% in July. A bigger fall will pile some serious action on Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the European Central Bank to take action next week at its September policy meeting. The region\u2019s unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 11.5%. Tesco shares are down 7.5% at 227.6. It is the FTSE\u2019s biggest faller in early trading and has dragged its fellow supermarkets down with it. J Sainsbury: -5% at 288 WM Morrison: -3.75% at 179.8 Marks and Spencer: -3.45% at 423.2 Read our full story on Tesco here. Another day, another gloomy statement from Tesco. The supermarket chain has published a surprise trading update this morning, warning trading profit is likely to be between \u00a32.4bn-\u00a32.5bn in 2014/15. Previously it was guiding \u00a32.8bn. Tesco attributes the profit downgrade to \u201cchallenging trading conditions and ongoing investment in our customer offer\u201d. The bad news doesn\u2019t end there. Tesco is slashing its interim dividend by 75% to 1.16p a share. It is also scaling back investment to no more than \u00a32.1bn in the current financial year - \u00a3400m less than originally planned and \u00a3600m less than the previous year. IT and store refurbishments will take the hit. New chief executive Dave Lewis will start his job on Monday, a month earlier than planned. Lots to be getting on with. Tesco\u2019s chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, said: The board\u2019s priority is to improve the performance of the group. We have taken prudent and decisive action solely to that end. Our new chief executive, Dave Lewis, will now be joining the business on Monday and will be reviewing every aspect of the group\u2019s operations. This will include consideration of all options that create value for customers and shareholders. The actions announced today regarding capital expenditure and, in particular, dividends have not been taken lightly. They are considered steps which enable us to retain a strong financial position and strategic optionality. Further details on trading performance will be provided as usual in our Interim results announcement, scheduled for release on 1 October. Annual house price inflation over the past couple of years looks like this according to Nationwide Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. There are no signs of a cooling UK housing market according to the headline data from Nationwide this morning. House prices rose 0.8% in August, a bigger increase than the 0.1% forecast by economists. It pushed annual house price inflation up to 11%, again stronger than the 10.1% predicted by the City. The average price of a UK home is now \u00a3189,306. Here is what Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist had to say about the figures: UK house prices edged up by 0.8% in August, marking the sixteenth successive monthly price rise. As a result, the annual pace of house price growth is up to 11% from 10.6% in July. While this is still below the 11.8% recorded in June, house price growth continues to outpace earnings by a wide margin, with average wage growth running at less than 1% in recent months. Surveyors report that new buyer enquiries have moderated somewhat in recent months, and the prospect of interest rate increases together with subdued wage growth may temper demand in the quarters ahead. However, the brightening economic outlook is likely to provide ongoing support for housing demand. Consumer sentiment remains buoyant thanks to declining inflation and sustained increases in employment.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group's board will try to put more than a year of turmoil behind it on Saturday by seeking approval for changes to how Britain's biggest mutual is governed. Delegates representing regional cooperatives and independent societies will vote at a meeting in Manchester on proposals designed to run the group in a more business-like way after governance failings were blamed partly for its near-collapse. Despite concessions made by the board, the reforms are deeply unpopular with many members and activists. With a majority vote of two-thirds required, approval is far from certain. The proposals are based on a structure recommended by Lord Myners, the City veteran who was called in to review the group's governance. Myners' critics accused him of trying to turn the group, founded 170 years ago by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, into a plc. The main proposal is to slash the size of the board and have it made up mainly of independent directors alongside two executives. The unwieldy board, comprising mainly member representatives with little business experience, has been blamed for failing to control top managers for approving the Co-op Bank's near-fatal merger with Britannia Building society. Britannia's bad debts helped blow a \u00a31.5bn hole in finances of the bank, whose woes were largely to blame for the group's \u00a32.5bn loss last year. Myners called for no member-elected directors but in a concession to his critics the reforms provide for three to sit alongside the executives and six independents. There will also be a 100-strong membership council to hold the board to account. They will elect a \"senate\" of 15 to lead talks with the board. Some former critics of Myners' proposals have decided to back the changes. Ben Reid, chief executive of the Midcounties cooperative, the biggest independent cooperative society, said: \"We are broadly supportive. We're not happy with all the details but we all know that things need to change so we need to get past Saturday and move on.\" The meeting will be open to debate but there will be no chance to amend the new rules. Critics are also unhappy that the rules will be difficult to change in future. Jo Bird, a director at Cooperative Business Consultants, said: \"I'm very disappointed that the board has chosen to go about it in this way and made it all or nothing and has not encouraged or allowed amendments. The best outcome would be a withdrawal or a rejection of the proposals and more genuine consultation with the wider membership.\" If the rules are passed, critics will try to make sure the council and senate elections in May produce people willing to preserve the group's distinctiveness. Jim Lee, a cooperative activist for more than 20 years, said: \"If we get to next May and we have an unelected board running the business with no accountability I think at that point I would cease to be interested.\"",

      "bodyText": "Well, no one saw that coming. If the outlook for Tesco was grim less than six weeks ago, when the grocer ousted chief executive Phil Clarke, issued its second profit warning of the year and described trading conditions as \"weak\" \u2013 it is now a whole lot worse. The retailer on Friday issued a third, and thumping, profit warning in eight months, taken the axe to its dividend and its spending plans, and announced it is sending for the cavalry. This will take the shape of new chief executive Dave Lewis (hired from Unilever and with zero experience of running shops) earlier than expected. Instead of joining in October he will now have his feet under the desk at Tesco's Cheshunt HQ on Monday morning. The shares \u2013 already down a third in the past year \u2013 are down more than 5% as investors react to the bad trading news and, in particular, the dividend cut. At around 6% the yield had been one of the few attractions for shareholders. The shares are now trading at their lowest level since September 2003. What has gone wrong? In short, there is a revolution under way in the grocery business and Tesco has taken way too long to wake up to that fact. Complacency and arrogance set in, and the current problems are the result. The discounters and upmarket rivals \u2013 Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose \u2013 are eating Tesco's breakfast, lunch and tea. Shoppers are moving away from the grocer's vast out-of-town stores in droves, as they find better prices and easier ways to shop - the high street and on their sofa with an iPad. The UK's biggest retailer is bleeding sales. Only this week new data from Kantar \u2013 regarded as the gold standard in the supermarket business \u2013 showed Tesco's sales down 4% in the past three months compared to a year ago. Its market share is now 28.8% \u2013 still vast, but down from 30.2% a year ago. In a \u00a3175bn market that is a huge decline, and has happened at a worryingly fast rate. In detail, Tesco has slashed its guidance on trading profits for this year to \u00a32.4bn-\u00a32.5bn, 30% down year on year. The half-year dividend payout has been scythed by 75%, saving \u00a3280m. Capital expenditure \u2013 mainly IT upgrades and the expensive new store refits, which Clarke insisted were essential to improving performance \u2013 is being scaled back by \u00a3400m a year to no more than \u00a32.1bn. This will provide Lewis with a useful cash buffer to make changes and invest in price cuts, especially if the dividend cut is repeated at the full year, which would save \u00a3900m. It will be far from easy for Lewis, however. He faces the mother of turnaround challenges. Tesco is a vast supertanker and it will take a long time to change direction. He faces issues in almost every one of the dozen markets where Tesco operates, from Turkey to Thailand, but it is the UK, which still generates two thirds of group profits, where he must first focus. As chairman Sir Richard Broadbent made clear on Friday, nothing will be sacred. In the grocer's statement to the stock exchange, Broadbent said: \"The board's priority is to improve the performance of the group.\" He added that Lewis \"will be reviewing every aspect of the group's operations\" and considering \"all options that create value for customers and shareholders\". Analysts immediately speculated that could mean hiving off the Asian division as a separate business, quoted in Hong Kong. But it is in the UK where his priorities must lie. He needs to sort out the brand. What does it stand for now? He needs to revamp the marketing \u2013 the price promise, which offers shoppers reductions if they can buy cheaper elsewhere, serves only to tell customers that Tesco may not be the wisest choice of shopping destination. Lewis must find a way to reverse the trend of shoppers drifting away from out-of-town stores and provide a reason for them to return. That probably means substantially lower prices (and lower profits). He needs to decide whether to keep the Clubcard, which was once viewed as a hugely powerful tool but has been devalued by constant tinkering. Lewis must also beef up his management.

      "body": "<p>Well, no one saw that coming. If the outlook for Tesco was grim less than six weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/21/tesco-boss-philip-clarke-quits-profits-warning\" title=\"\">when the grocer ousted chief executive Phil Clarke</a>, issued its second profit warning of the year and described trading conditions as \"weak\" \u2013 it is now a whole lot worse.</p> <p>The retailer on Friday issued a third, and thumping, profit warning in eight months, taken the axe to its dividend and its spending plans, and announced it is sending for the cavalry. This will take the shape of new chief executive Dave Lewis (hired from Unilever and with zero experience of running shops) earlier than expected. Instead of joining in October he will now have his feet under the desk at Tesco's Cheshunt HQ on Monday morning.</p> <p>The shares \u2013 already down a third in the past year \u2013 are down more than 5% as investors react to the bad trading news and, in particular, the dividend cut. At around 6% the yield had been one of the few attractions for shareholders. The shares are now trading at their lowest level since September 2003.</p> <p>What has gone wrong? In short, there is a revolution under way in the grocery business and Tesco has taken way too long to wake up to that fact. Complacency and arrogance set in, and the current problems are the result.</p> <p>The discounters and upmarket rivals \u2013 Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose \u2013 are eating Tesco's breakfast, lunch and tea. Shoppers are moving away from the grocer's vast out-of-town stores in droves, as they find better prices and easier ways to shop - the high street and on their sofa with an iPad.</p> <p>The UK's biggest retailer is bleeding sales. Only this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/27/uk-grocery-market-growth-price-inflation-supermarket\" title=\"\">new data from Kantar</a> \u2013 regarded as the gold standard in the supermarket business \u2013 showed Tesco's sales down 4% in the past three months compared to a year ago.</p> <p>Its market share is now 28.8% \u2013 still vast, but down from 30.2% a year ago. In a \u00a3175bn market that is a huge decline, and has happened at a worryingly fast rate.</p> <p>In detail, Tesco has slashed its guidance on trading profits for this year to \u00a32.4bn-\u00a32.5bn, 30% down year on year. The half-year dividend payout has been scythed by 75%, saving \u00a3280m. Capital expenditure \u2013 mainly IT upgrades and the expensive new store refits, which Clarke insisted were essential to improving performance \u2013 is being scaled back by \u00a3400m a year to no more than \u00a32.1bn. This will provide Lewis with a useful cash buffer to make changes and invest in price cuts, especially if the dividend cut is repeated at the full year, which would save \u00a3900m.</p> <p>It will be far from easy for Lewis, however. He faces the mother of turnaround challenges. Tesco is a vast supertanker and it will take a long time to change direction. He faces issues in almost every one of the dozen markets where Tesco operates, from Turkey to Thailand, but it is the UK, which still generates two thirds of group profits, where he must first focus.</p> <p>As chairman Sir Richard Broadbent made clear on Friday, nothing will be sacred. In the grocer's statement to the stock exchange, Broadbent said: \"The board's priority is to improve the performance of the group.\" He added that Lewis \"will be reviewing every aspect of the group's operations\" and considering \"all options that create value for customers and shareholders\".</p> <p>Analysts immediately speculated that could mean hiving off the Asian division as a separate business, quoted in Hong Kong. But it is in the UK where his priorities must lie. He needs to sort out the brand. What does it stand for now? He needs to revamp the marketing \u2013 the price promise, which offers shoppers reductions if they can buy cheaper elsewhere, serves only to tell customers that Tesco may not be the wisest choice of shopping destination.</p> <p>Lewis must find a way to reverse the trend of shoppers drifting away from out-of-town stores and provide a reason for them to return. That probably means substantially lower prices (and lower profits). He needs to decide whether to keep the Clubcard, which was once viewed as a hugely powerful tool but has been devalued by constant tinkering.</p> <p>Lewis must also beef up his management. The latest trading update indicates that large parts of Tesco's top team are too wedded to the past. He needs new talent. And he needs to tackle all of this while the discounters continue to turn the screw. Both Aldi and Lidl have recently outlined major expansion plans. The former is spending \u00a320m on a new advertising campaign. Christmas is now on the horizon in the grocery business, and Lewis's priority is to somehow arrest the decline \u2013 fast. If he cannot, Friday's profit warning will certainly not be the last.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is parachuting in new boss Dave Lewis a month ahead of schedule to lead a radical shakeup of the business after the supermarket issued its third profit warning in eight months and slashed its dividend by 75%. Lewis, who starts on Monday, will be \"reviewing every aspect of the group's operations\" to tackle a sales slump at the UK's biggest retailer, which is losing out to vigorous competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl as well as upmarket rivals Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. More than \u00a31.3bn was wiped off Tesco's value as its shares dived nearly 7% to 230p, their lowest level in 11 years. Investors fear Lewis will escalate the supermarket price war, which has already seen Tesco invest more than \u00a3200m in price cuts. Those concerns also pushed down the share price of both Sainsbury's and Morrisons by about 5%. Sir Richard Broadbent, Tesco's chairman, said Lewis's review would consider \"all options that create value for customers and shareholders\". He said: \"The board's priority is to improve the performance of the group. We have taken prudent and decisive action solely to that end.\" Last month, when Tesco ousted Phil Clarke as chief executive, Broadbent insisted his departure was not linked to any deterioration in financial performance and insisted the outgoing boss had \"started the job of realigning the business\". Tesco said on Friday that it now expected to a make a trading profit of between \u00a32.4bn and \u00a32.5bn in the year to April, down from an expected \u00a32.8bn. Last year the retailer turned in \u00a33.3bn. The company is also cutting planned investment \u2013 mainly linked to IT spending and Clarke's store refurbishment plan \u2013 by \u00a3400m, which is \u00a3600m lower than last year. The half-year dividend payout is being slashed by 75% to 1.116p a share, which will save \u00a3900m if repeated at the end of the year. Together those moves will give Lewis, who left the consumer goods conglomerate Unilever on Friday, a fighting fund of up to \u00a31.3bn, which analysts expect him to spend on a combination of price cuts and improvements to service in stores. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research said: \"By doing this work now, it creates a sense of urgency internally and externally. Lewis is admitting there are big problems and big problems need big solutions. \"Tesco has failed to adapt to the changes in the UK competitive landscape, such as more local competition and better execution by the discounters. By raising prices in the UK faster than anybody else, Tesco also lost its historical differentiation of being a value retailer, giving a free ride to the targeted retailers at both ends of the [price] spectrum.\" Tesco is now the worst performer among the UK's biggest supermarkets. Its market share is down more than a percentage point on a year ago as it has slowed spending on promotions while failing to see much benefit from its efforts to improve the look of stores. Some analysts believe the retailer is losing more than a million customer visits a week as cash-strapped shoppers hunt around for a way to save money. In a tough grocery market, which is growing at the slowest pace in almost a decade, Morrisons and Sainsbury's are also losing ground. But Aldi and Lidl saw sales rise by 29.5% and 18.3% respectively as shoppers react positively to their mix of low prices and convenience. Tesco's profits warning is seen as a clearing of the decks before Lewis's arrival. A previous profit warning, in July, led to the ousting of Clarke, who failed to stem the slide in sales and profits during his three-year tenure. Clarke invested \u00a31bn in improving the look of stores and improving service, but allowed Tesco to become gradually more expensive than its biggest rival Asda and well ahead of the discounters. Darren Shirley, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: \"We have now lost count of the number of times that we have downgraded our forecasts for Tesco over the last three years.\" Broadbent said: \"The business continues to face a number of uncertainties, including market conditions and the pace at which benefits from the investments we are making flow through.\" Market observers welcomed the early arrival of Lewis ahead of the important Christmas trading season, but many expect Tesco's profits will take further hits, most likely in the spring, as Lewis works through his longer-term strategy for the business. \"Is this the trough? We cannot assume so,\" wrote James Grzinic, an analyst at Jefferies in a note. Analysts said further adjustments to profits could come as it was not clear how much Tesco's new boss will invest in price cuts, increasing the number of staff in stores or whether he will have to make redundancies at head office. While the priority will be turning around the UK business, which delivers the majority of profits, Tesco is also struggling in a number of overseas markets. Shirley suggested Tesco could float its Asian business in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Tesco has investments in a number of small UK businesses such as the Dobbies garden centre group, the Blinkbox digital streaming service and the Giraffe restaurant chain that could also be sold off. Other analysts suggested Tesco needs to get rid of its Clubcard loyalty scheme or Fuelsave promotion in order to focus on cutting prices on everyday groceries.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>Here is what analysts made of Tesco\u2019s third profit warning this year</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Tesco <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/29/tesco-profit-warning-dividend-slashed-75-per-cent\">issued its third profit warning of the year on Friday</a> and slashed its half-year dividend and capital spending. New chief executive Dave Lewis is being parachuted in a month earlier than planned and will now take the reins on Monday. Here is what analysts made of the news.</p> <h2>James Anstead, Nicolas Champ and Julie Zhuang, retail analysts at Barclays</h2> <p>The profit guidance reflects the ongoing difficult trading conditions and the slower-than-expected response to recent initiatives. However, the cuts in the dividend and in capex are designed to give maximum flexibility to the incoming CEO \u2013 Dave Lewis \u2013 who will now take up his role a month earlier than expected, next week. </p> <p>Although another cut in profit forecasts sharply illustrates the challenges Tesco faces in its core UK business, the statement hints at the possibility of more radical approaches towards restoring health to the UK core business and towards highlighting the value in its other assets. We would expect the initial reaction to this statement to be negative, although it may also generate the expectation of more creative and positive news from the new CEO in time. </p> <h2>Darren Shirley, retail analyst at Shore Capital</h2> <p>We have now lost count of the number of times that we have downgraded our forecasts for Tesco over the last three years. Whilst so, we have another announcement today that represents the inverse of whatever the icing on the cake stands for. </p> <p>We are pleased that the appointment of Mr Lewis has now been brought forward to 1st September (i.e. this Monday).</p> <p>It is very disappointing to see this update, which fundamentally raises questions in our minds about the capability of the management under Mr. Clarke at this once great company. As such, we expect, as part of a range of measures, there to be considerable senior management change under Mr. Lewis in time, as Tesco needs a world class top team to take it forward.</p> <p>We can speculate but not predict Mr. Lewis\u2019 priorities. As such, we should also respect the fact that he needs time to assess matters and manage the business. Hence, whilst this update is unhelpful, it does not adjust our view that Tesco UK needs fundamentally better management and that this is a group where the pint can still be more than half full. In time Mr. Lewis may also have views on the make-up of Tesco but stemming the tide of decline in the core has to be the priority. </p> <p>However, potential upside will only emerge from what Mr. Lewis can deliver; as such we need to await his prognosis of how he perceives the prospects at the most fundamental level for Tesco; earnings and income stream. \u200eIn this respect where does capital expenditure settle, any potential disposal strategy (e.g. should Tesco list its Asia business in Hong Kong) and restructuring charges are also at the front of mind. </p> <h2>Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers</h2> <p>Having been parachuted in a month earlier than planned, one of the chief executive\u2019s immediate aims will be to prevent a Tesco profits warning becoming an annual event. Even at the upper end of its revised trading profit forecast, the figure is 11% lower than originally thought. From an investment perspective, one of the attractions of the stock for long-suffering shareholders had been the dividend yield, around 6% prior to this update, which is now being decimated.</p> <p>Of course, the rationale for the crimp on overall capital expenditure s understandable and prudent, whilst the timing of the announcement enables the incoming chief executive to begin with the kitchen sinking having been done.

      "bodyText": "Tesco issued its third profit warning of the year on Friday and slashed its half-year dividend and capital spending. New chief executive Dave Lewis is being parachuted in a month earlier than planned and will now take the reins on Monday. Here is what analysts made of the news. James Anstead, Nicolas Champ and Julie Zhuang, retail analysts at Barclays The profit guidance reflects the ongoing difficult trading conditions and the slower-than-expected response to recent initiatives. However, the cuts in the dividend and in capex are designed to give maximum flexibility to the incoming CEO \u2013 Dave Lewis \u2013 who will now take up his role a month earlier than expected, next week. Although another cut in profit forecasts sharply illustrates the challenges Tesco faces in its core UK business, the statement hints at the possibility of more radical approaches towards restoring health to the UK core business and towards highlighting the value in its other assets. We would expect the initial reaction to this statement to be negative, although it may also generate the expectation of more creative and positive news from the new CEO in time. Darren Shirley, retail analyst at Shore Capital We have now lost count of the number of times that we have downgraded our forecasts for Tesco over the last three years. Whilst so, we have another announcement today that represents the inverse of whatever the icing on the cake stands for. We are pleased that the appointment of Mr Lewis has now been brought forward to 1st September (i.e. this Monday). It is very disappointing to see this update, which fundamentally raises questions in our minds about the capability of the management under Mr. Clarke at this once great company. As such, we expect, as part of a range of measures, there to be considerable senior management change under Mr. Lewis in time, as Tesco needs a world class top team to take it forward. We can speculate but not predict Mr. Lewis\u2019 priorities. As such, we should also respect the fact that he needs time to assess matters and manage the business. Hence, whilst this update is unhelpful, it does not adjust our view that Tesco UK needs fundamentally better management and that this is a group where the pint can still be more than half full. In time Mr. Lewis may also have views on the make-up of Tesco but stemming the tide of decline in the core has to be the priority. However, potential upside will only emerge from what Mr. Lewis can deliver; as such we need to await his prognosis of how he perceives the prospects at the most fundamental level for Tesco; earnings and income stream. \u200eIn this respect where does capital expenditure settle, any potential disposal strategy (e.g. should Tesco list its Asia business in Hong Kong) and restructuring charges are also at the front of mind. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers Having been parachuted in a month earlier than planned, one of the chief executive\u2019s immediate aims will be to prevent a Tesco profits warning becoming an annual event. Even at the upper end of its revised trading profit forecast, the figure is 11% lower than originally thought. From an investment perspective, one of the attractions of the stock for long-suffering shareholders had been the dividend yield, around 6% prior to this update, which is now being decimated. Of course, the rationale for the crimp on overall capital expenditure s understandable and prudent, whilst the timing of the announcement enables the incoming chief executive to begin with the kitchen sinking having been done. Meanwhile, Tesco will continue to examine each aspect of the group\u2019s operation in an effort to stabilise its profitability and market share, both of which remain far ahead of its rivals. However, if investors\u2019 resolve was being tested up until this statement, it is now nearing breaking point. Even before today\u2019s precipitous fall, the share price had declined 34% over the last year, as compared to a 5% hike for the wider FTSE100. Patience may be a virtue which investors no longer possess, and the market consensus of the shares as a sell will surely remain intact.\u201d Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK Tesco\u2019s problems aren\u2019t unique to it with its peers in the sector Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons getting buffeted by similar headwinds in the retail sector as all lose market share to the young upstarts of the retail sector as Aldi and Lidl eat into their market share, at the bottom end and Waitrose at the top end. This morning\u2019s announcement has all the hallmarks of a clearing of the decks as the new CEO Dave Lewis starts work on Monday 1st September. The key question being asked now is whether these actions will be enough to stop the haemorrhaging of value that we\u2019ve seen in the past few months. The company has announced it will be cutting capital expenditure and slowing down its store revamp programmes, as it works to stem a slide in its market share from levels of 30.2% a year ago to 28.8% now. Given the presence of the new kids on the block and pressure on consumers wallets the company will have to work very hard to stand still and given its market share and the lower cost bases of the budget retailers it almost seems inevitable that we will see further erosion in that market share, towards the 25% level. In that regard when you are top of the pile the only way is down, just ask Manchester United. What that means for the share price is anyone\u2019s guess but from a purely confidence point of view we would need to see a significant move back above the previous lows at 240p to increase confidence that we are near to a short term base. The one thing Tesco does have on its side is its size and scale, in that it can afford to shrink its margins further, and in the process squeeze its competitor\u2019s margins that much harder. That may not be good for the share price values of the food retail sector, but it\u2019s bound to be good for the consumer\u2019s wallet as the weekly shop gets cheaper.",
