      "bodyText": "Michael Horn, president and CEO of Volkswagen (VW) Group of America, will confirm he knew of the company\u2019s emission rigging issues as early as spring 2014, according to a statement released ahead of a congressional inquiry. In prepared remarks before what looks set to be an intense public hearing on Thursday, Horn will apologize once again for VW\u2019s use of software to \u201cdefeat the regular emissions testing regime\u201d. \u201cIn the spring of 2014 \u2026 I was told that there was a possible emissions non-compliance that could be remedied,\u201d he will tell the House committee on energy and commerce before questioning begins. \u201cI was informed that EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] regulations included various penalties for non-compliance with the emissions standards and that the agencies can conduct engineering tests which could include \u2018defeat device\u2019 testing or analysis. I was also informed that the company engineers would work with the agencies to resolve the issue.\u201d Europe\u2019s largest carmaker is under pressure to identify those responsible for the scandal and to say how vehicles with illegal software will be fixed. The company\u2019s new chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, told a news conference in Wolfsburg: \u201cNobody is served by speculation or vague, preliminary progress reports. \u201cTherefore it will take some time until we have factual and reliable results and can provide you with comprehensive information.\u201d VW use of emission-rigging software came to light on 18 September when the EPA ordered the company to recall almost 500,000 US cars fitted with the software. According to the EPA, since 2008 the software allowed the cars to cheat emissions tests while producing up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The scandal was first discovered in spring 2014 by John German, an automotive engineer who checked the car\u2019s emissions on real roads instead of in the lab. German told the Guardian that he provided VW with a copy of his findings. \u201cVW had a chance to fix the problem, and they continued to try and cheat and do what they had done,\u201d German said. While Thursday\u2019s hearing will mainly focus on VW, the congressional investigation could eventually look at other carmakers as well to determine whether they have also used similar software. \u201cThe first thing is to look at the VW issue, in and of itself. Second is to ask the same question of other carmakers and see if there is any such activity taking place,\u201d Tennessee congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who is vice-chairman of the committee, told Reuters. Horn is not the only one, who will be in the hot seat during Thursday\u2019s hearing. The EPA is also being taken to task to determine why the agency failed to detect the use of such software earlier. \u201cVW manufactured and installed software in the electronic control module of these vehicles that sensed when the vehicle was being tested for compliance with EPA emissions standards,\u201d Christopher Grundler, director of the EPA\u2019s office of transportation and air quality, will testify on Thursday according to his prepared remarks. \u201cPut simply, these cars contain software that turns off or significantly reduces the effectiveness of emissions controls when driving normally, and turns them on when the car is undergoing an emissions test.\u201d Grundler will also inform the committee that on 25 September the EPA contacted all auto manufacturers to inform them that the agency is \u201cstepping up our testing activities in response to VW\u2019s alleged violations\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe married for beauty, not for money,\u201d the head of the Santo Domingo clan said when he sold the family\u2019s brewing business to SABMiller in 2005, collecting a 14% stake in return. That remark was given an airing here last week to suggest that maybe the Santo Domingos would not rush to jump into bed with Anheuser-Busch InBev to create the unlovely Megabrew monster. So far, the Santo Domingos have indeed declined to switch partners. They are backing the SAB board\u2019s view that a \u00a365bn takeover offer \u201cvery substantially undervalues\u201d the company. Is romance still alive? Probably not. More likely, the Santo Domingos are making a few hard-headed calculations. First, SAB has been a terrific investment. The Colombians took their SAB stock when it was worth 900p and they have more than trebled their capital value in a decade, as well as enjoying an ever-stronger stream of dividends. You would want to be paid handsomely to part with an investment like that. Second, there is every chance that SAB can continue its winning run. The group is so strong in Africa \u2013 which is why AB InBev wants to buy it \u2013 that a couple of decades of growth should be guaranteed. There are always upsets in emerging markets, as now, but multibillionaire owners can afford to take a long view. Third, AB InBev\u2019s offer isn\u2019t generous. Carlos Brito, its chief executive, argues that SAB\u2019s board \u201cshould\u201d recommend an offer at a 44% premium to the pre-bid share price. But he\u2019s referring to the value of the cash offer of \u00a342.15. The Colombians are being offered a share alternative at \u00a337.49, which is hardly compelling when you remember that SAB was trading at that level as recently as March. Brito, sounding furious, protests that the share alternative was \u201cdesigned with and for\u201d the Santo Domingos. But it looks as if he overlooked the critical component in the design \u2013 the actual value of the paper. Altria, the Marlboro cigarette folk with 27% of SAB, take the opposite view and have aligned themselves with the bidder. The weight of that 27% means AB InBev is the favourite to win if it improves its terms by, say, 8%-10%. The Santo Domingos, in truth, are probably holding out for AB InBev\u2019s improved and final offer. A bid with a headline value of \u00a345 a share, with the share alternative increasing in tandem, may be the level at which resistance crumbles. Will AB InBev go that high? SAB\u2019s shares were flat at \u00a336.03, suggesting this deal is finely balanced \u2013 it looks a 50/50 call. Members of the beer-drinking classes, though, should hope that romance really is alive and the Santo Domingos act as an insurmountable obstacle. AB InBev\u2019s vision of \u201cthe first truly global beer company\u201d, with bland Budweiser spread to every corner, is depressing and charmless. This deal, an attempt to grab a third of the market, is straightforwardly anti-competitive; and the claim that cost-cutting Megabrew would improve choice for consumers is laughable. The fruits of Dave Lewis\u2019s labour Boasting about your fruit and veg has become a habit among supermarket bosses. Last week, Mike Coupe at Sainsbury\u2019s was warbling about his ripe avocados; on Wednesday, Dave Lewis at Tesco banged on about his extra large blackberries, apparently to illustrate innovation in the aisles. Maybe it is a distraction technique. It was odd, for example, to hear Lewis talk about \u201csustained improvement across a broad range of key indicators\u201d even as Tesco\u2019s first-half profits more than halved. But let\u2019s not be too churlish. On arrival a year ago, Lewis had a choice. He could have launched a rights issue to fix the balance sheet and provide ammunition for a sharp attack on rivals. Instead, he declined a cash-call and took an incremental approach to improving prices and products. It was the least painful route for shareholders \u2013 provided it worked. At the moment, the evidence suggests it is working. Like-for-like sales are still falling, but not like they used to. The harder trick, of course, lies ahead: improving profit margins, not to the greedy 5% of old, but to 3%-4%. But Lewis has completed his first lap without a stumble. Call the O2-Three deal Of Sharon White, the head of Ofcom, has no formal powers to kill the proposed merger between O2 and Three, since the European commission will decide. But she put a large dent in the deal on Wednesday night by arguing that consumers suffer when the number of national mobile operators reduces from four to three, which would be the effect of an O2-Three combo. She also happens to be right, to judge by evidence elsewhere in Europe. Her view that \u201ccompetition, not consolidation, drives investment and delivers lower prices\u201d also chimes with common sense. The deal should be blocked.",

The group is so strong in Africa \u2013 which is why AB InBev wants to buy it \u2013 that a couple of decades of growth should be guaranteed. There are always upsets in emerging markets, as now, but multibillionaire owners can afford to take a long view.</p> <p>Third, AB InBev\u2019s offer isn\u2019t generous. Carlos Brito, its chief executive, argues that SAB\u2019s board \u201cshould\u201d recommend an offer at a 44% premium to the pre-bid share price. But he\u2019s referring to the value of the cash offer of \u00a342.15. The Colombians are being offered a share alternative at \u00a337.49, which is hardly compelling when you remember that SAB was trading at that level as recently as March. Brito, sounding furious, protests that the share alternative was \u201cdesigned with and for\u201d the Santo Domingos. But it looks as if he overlooked the critical component in the design \u2013 the actual value of the paper.</p> <p>Altria, the Marlboro cigarette folk with 27% of SAB, take the opposite view and have aligned themselves with the bidder. The weight of that 27% means AB InBev is the favourite to win if it improves its terms by, say, 8%-10%. The Santo Domingos, in truth, are probably holding out for AB InBev\u2019s improved and final offer.</p> <p>A bid with a headline value of \u00a345 a share, with the share alternative increasing in tandem, may be the level at which resistance crumbles. Will AB InBev go that high? SAB\u2019s shares were flat at \u00a336.03, suggesting this deal is finely balanced \u2013 it looks a 50/50 call.</p> <p>Members of the beer-drinking classes, though, should hope that romance really is alive and the Santo Domingos act as an insurmountable obstacle. AB InBev\u2019s vision of \u201cthe first truly global beer company\u201d, with bland Budweiser spread to every corner, is depressing and charmless. This deal, an attempt to grab a third of the market, is straightforwardly anti-competitive; and the claim that cost-cutting Megabrew would improve choice for consumers is laughable.</p> <h2><strong>The fruits of Dave Lewis\u2019s labour</strong></h2> <p>Boasting about your fruit and veg has become a habit among supermarket bosses. Last week, Mike Coupe at Sainsbury\u2019s was warbling about his ripe avocados; on Wednesday, Dave Lewis at Tesco banged on about his extra large blackberries, apparently to illustrate innovation in the aisles. Maybe it is a distraction technique. It was odd, for example, to hear Lewis talk about \u201csustained improvement across a broad range of key indicators\u201d even as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/tesco-profits-more-than-halved\">Tesco\u2019s first-half profits more than halved</a>.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not be too churlish. On arrival a year ago, Lewis had a choice. He could have launched a rights issue to fix the balance sheet and provide ammunition for a sharp attack on rivals. Instead, he declined a cash-call and took an incremental approach to improving prices and products. It was the least painful route for shareholders \u2013 provided it worked.</p> <p>At the moment, the evidence suggests it is working. Like-for-like sales are still falling, but not like they used to. The harder trick, of course, lies ahead: improving profit margins, not to the greedy 5% of old, but to 3%-4%. But Lewis has completed his first lap without a stumble.</p> <h2><strong>Call the O2-Three deal Of</strong></h2> <p>Sharon White, the head of Ofcom, has no formal powers to kill the proposed merger between O2 and Three, since the European commission will decide. But she put a large dent in the deal on Wednesday night <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/ofcom-chief-expresses-concern-over-potential-o2-and-three-merger\">by arguing that consumers suffer</a> when the number of national mobile operators reduces from four to three, which would be the effect of an O2-Three combo.</p> <p>She also happens to be right, to judge by evidence elsewhere in Europe. Her view that \u201ccompetition, not consolidation, drives investment and delivers lower prices\u201d also chimes with common sense. The deal should be blocked.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Zoe Williams (It\u2019s fine to print money, so long as it\u2019s not for the people, 5 October) raises an important question about quantitative easing (QE). In the wake of the global financial crisis, it was adopted by the Bank of England. Capital markets had ceased to function. The banking system was in deep crisis. In the US and Britain, governments were driven to inject equity into the collapsing banking system. These huge outlays had to be funded by the issuance of public debt. The Bank made clear to the prime brokers (mainly the major commercial banks) that they would be offered access to zero-cost funds in order to bid in Treasury auctions. These funds were provided electronically by the Bank into the accounts of those banks held with it. These no-cost credits enabled the prime brokers to purchase the government debt, and by agreement swap back the debt to the Bank at a modest profit. Once this happened, the electronic advances made by the Bank were cancelled. The net effect was threefold. First, the government\u2019s solvency was preserved. Second, the prime brokers were able to secure profit from guaranteed transactions to replace more traditional forms of lending. Third \u2013 the odd bit \u2013 the Bank ultimately ended up holding the debt of the British government, not the private sector of the economy. This reveals the \u201cefficient secret\u201d of central banking. The Bank is effectively financing the state through the indirect purchase of government debt. Zoe Williams asks the question: why can\u2019t this \u201cmechanism\u201d be used to finance other major projects? The answer is that it could. QE involves little or no monetary expansion. It has no inflationary consequences. But these matters are not widely understood. Time for a reasoned debate on the merits of its wider use in these most unusual times. Richard Tudway Centre for International Economics \u2022 Zoe Williams says \u201call money is created from nowhere\u201d. She is talking through her hat. The basis of money, which is gold or, in some cases, other commodities (mainly metals) is as founded in the real world as any other product. To find, mine, refine and distribute gold requires vast amounts of human labour, which is why it is valuable \u2013 all value coming from the labour embedded in something. Paper money and credit is simply a claim on real money, a paper or electronic token which saves carrying around bags of gold and it runs back to real money eventually. Issuing more tokens than there is gold is a large part of credit and banking, relying on everyone not turning up at the same time to claim it. It has a place and helps the world economy spin round, but detach it too far from real value (print too much) and it starts to create problems \u2013 like raging inflation, bank defaults etc. When Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, the US was effectively bankrupt, surviving only by devaluing its debts and reneging on the agreed price for its imports. It has continued doing so ever since. Someone pays the price, and that is the developing world mainly. And eventually it collapses anyway, like it did in 2008. The capitalist world has lately got away with throwing vast amounts of QE into the system only because the results have not yet come home to roost; but once more other people are paying, such as the Greek workers, the Middle East and, above all, China soaking up the paper money. It cannot go on much longer. Even the Guardian routinely points out the imminence of further crisis. So, no, more of the same, however it is directed, solves nothing. Don Hoskins Economic and Philosophic Science Review \u2022 How refreshing to read some common sense on macroeconomic policy. As long ago as 1948, Dudley Dillard (The Economics of John Maynard Keynes) was saying similar things: \u201cIs there any necessity for subsidising the commercial banks by paying them huge amounts of interest to create the new money which is required for economic expansion? Is not the creation of new money properly a government function?\u201d He clearly advocates \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d, though it is not called that. To the extent that there are underemployed resources and supply is responsive, it should not be inflationary. John Levi (Retired economics lecturer), Abingdon, Oxfordshire \u2022 Zoe Williams\u2019 article about printing money which does not grow on trees reminds me of an incident that took place in my university days.

If the $10.2bn (\u00a36.6bn) deal goes through, it would make the combined entity the UK\u2019s largest mobile group, with a 40% market share, and would reduce the number of UK mobile operators from four to three. In a speech on Wedneesday evening to the London School of Economics and Political Science, Sharon White said that with the planned merger of mobile operators O2 and Three, as well as BT\u2019s plan to buy EE going through, there are \u201crisks to consumers and businesses who have enjoyed one of the most competitive markets of recent years\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a busy day for central banks on Thursday, with the latest Bank of England interest rate decision as well as the minutes. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its September meeting, when it held rates when it was widely expected to sanction a rise. So we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to cover all that, as well as the IMF meeting in Lima and the rest of the day\u2019s financial news. For now it\u2019s time to close up, so thanks for all your comments and see you tomorrow. Global stock markets have been supported in recent days by the hope that the Federal Reserve will not raise US interest rates this year, in the wake of Friday\u2019s weak US jobs data. Other central banks are also expected to continue to support the global economy with further stimulus measures. And a recent surge in the oil price, with output predicted to fall and demand stabilising, has also helped, as has the fact that China\u2019s stock market - so volatile - has been closed for a holiday which ends tomorrow. Hence an early surge on stock markets, with the FTSE 100 at a seven week high despite more gloomy comments from the IMF on the global economy. However as the markets came towards the close of trading, much of the optimism fizzled out. One factor is the oil price losing all the day\u2019s gains after US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week. Brent crude is currently down 0.08% at $51.88 following the US data, having earlier climbed as high as $53.15. But with commodity companies still ahead on the day, most markets have ended in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 10.19 points or 0.16% at 6336.35 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.68% to 9970.40 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.14% at 4666.94 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.79% to 22,007.34 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.66% at 10,170.0 In Greece the Athens market added 1.4% to 680.10 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 11 points or 0.07%. More on oil, and the effect of a falling crude price on exporters, from the International Monetary Fund. Larry Elliott reports: The full extent of the impact of slumping crude prices on Saudi Arabia\u2019s public finances has been highlighted by the International Monetary Fund in a new report telling oil exporters to be braced for a prolonged period of disruption to their budgets. The fund\u2019s half-yearly fiscal monitor report shows that in the past three years a hefty budget surplus in Saudi Arabia has been turned into a deficit of more than 20% of GDP \u2013 double the shortfalls seen in the UK and the US during the worst of the global slump of 2008-09. Other leading oil exporters \u2013 Russia, Libya, Venezuela, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Angola \u2013 have also suffered marked deteriorations in their public finances as a result of the fall in crude from a peak of almost $130 a barrel in 2012 to just under $53 currently. \u201cNatural resource-rich countries benefited from an exceptional commodity price boom during the 2000s, with metal and oil prices reaching historic highs,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis provided a substantial boon to resource-rich developing countries, which benefited from large increases in fiscal revenues and the opportunity to promote economic transformation and development.\u201d Full story here: The recent rise in oil prices may not last, according to Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. He said: While the recent rise in the price of oil has led mining firms higher, it is clear that oil price volatility could easily see everything crash lower once more like a house of cards. This afternoon saw oil inventories rise by 3.1m barrels, taking some of the wind out the sails of this recent rally. The continued build-up of US crude inventories undermines the idea that US producers are finally feeling the pinch and cutting back on production. Oil is and will remain in strong supply going forward. The question is whether demand will pick up at these lower prices. The EIA today announced expectations that 2016 will see oil demand rise by the most in six years. However, perhaps the most telling announcement from the EIA today was that the past four weeks saw lower demand than this time last year when oil prices were $40 higher that today. There is a feeling that despite a possible spike in oil prices, the long term cold see them move lower yet. Oil prices have edged down from their highest levels of the day as US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, up by 3.1m barrels compared to forecasts of a 2.3m increase. Brent crude is currently up 0.96% at $52.42 a barrel after earlier climbing as high as $53.15. The price has been supported in recent days by signs that Russia and Opec were willing to discuss the oversupply situation and the US energy department said it expected production to fall next year. Here\u2019s Heather Stewart\u2019s analysis of the IMF financial stability report: The next financial crisis is coming, it\u2019s a just a matter of time \u2013 and we haven\u2019t finished fixing the flaws in the global system that were so brutally exposed by the last one. That is the message from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest Global Financial Stability report, which will make sobering reading for the finance ministers and central bankers gathered in Lima, Peru, for its annual meeting. Massive monetary policy stimulus has rekindled growth in developed economies since the deep recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008; but what the IMF calls the \u201chandover\u201d to a more sustainable recovery \u2013 without the extra prop of ultra-low borrowing costs \u2013 has so far failed to materialise. Meanwhile, the cheap money created to rescue the developed economies has flooded out into emerging markets, inflating asset bubbles, and encouraging companies and governments to take advantage of unusually low borrowing costs and load up on debt. \u201cBalance sheets have become stretched thinner in many emerging market companies and banks. These firms have become more susceptible to financial stress,\u201d the IMF says. The full piece is here: US markets are joining in the global rally, helped by energy companies as crude continued to rise on talk of falls in output. The prospect of the US Federal Reserve raising interests has grown less likely, which is also giving some support to shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 145 points or 0.8% while the S&amp;P 500 is around 0.7% higher. The FTSE 100 is up 0.95%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.7% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.2%. Risks to financial stability are pointing firmly to the downside, says the IMF (ie, there\u2019s more chance of a nasty ending than a nice one). In its new report, it warns: The possibility of a global asset market disruption, whereby market risk premiums would decompress in a disorderly way and spread financial contagion, remains heightened. What might cause it? The IMF says it could come from the eurozone, or from emerging markets: Potential near-term adverse shocks in the presence of system vulnerabilities could prematurely halt the rise in U.S. interest rates, degrade \u001dnancial stability, and stall the economic recovery. Shocks could originate in advanced economies\u2014possibly owing to greater spillovers from Greece to the euro area and international markets\u2014or emerging markets, for example, from greater-than-expected spillovers from China. And here\u2019s a nicely colour-coded chart of how things might play out: The International Monetary Fund has warned that that the global economy faces a \u2018triad of risks\u2019 which could trigger a new phase of the crisis. Its new Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF identifies \u2018crisis legacies\u2019 in advanced economies, vulnerabilities in emerging market economies, and systemic market liquidity concerns. It says: If these challenges are mishandled, they could materialize as significant risks to financial stability. Here\u2019s some detail from the report, being released now. Emerging markets: the IMF warns that bank and corporate balance sheets are stretched, meaning they are vulnerable to a downturn. It singles out China, and its \u201cdelicate balance of transitioning to more consumption-driven growth without activity slowing too much\u201d. Legacy issues from the crisis in advanced economies: these include high public and private debt, and the remaining problems in the architecture of the eurozone (ie, the need for more fiscal union) Weak systemic market liquidity: The IMF is concerned that risk premiums are below historical averages, even though the Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates son: As such, the global financial system faces an unprecedented adjustment as risk premiums \u201cnormalize\u201d from low levels alongside rising policy rates, amid a modest global cyclical recovery. Last October, there was a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in the market for US Treasuries (government bonds), and analysts wonder if it could happen again.... The challenge will be for abnormal market conditions to adjust smoothly to the new environment. However, there are risks from a rapid decompression, particularly given what appear to be more brittle market structures and market fragilities concentrated in credit intermediation channels, which could come to the fore as financial conditions normalize. And this chart confirms that liquidity is a growing worry for the IMF: UK economic growth slowed in the third quarter compared to the previous three months, according to the think tank The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR\u2019s latest monthly estimate of GDP suggests that output grew by 0.5% in the three months to the end of September after growth of 0.5% in the three months ending in August. That compares to official figures for the second quarter to the end of June of a 0.7% rise in GDP. NIESR said: This slight softening in the third quarter is expected to be temporary. It is consistent with our latest forecast for the year as a whole. Economic growth remains reasonable and, although we do not expect the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee to vote to raise rates at its October meeting [on Thursday], we continue to expect the first rise in Bank Rate in the first half of 2016. The broad story of output growth post-recession is little changed and the return to the pre-recession peak following the most recent recession remains the most protracted in the last 100 years. NIESR is forecasting GDP growth of 2.5% per annum in 2015 and 2.4% in 2016. On Tuesday the IMF predicted UK growth of 2.5% in 2015, falling to 2.2% in 2016. Heads-up. In 30 minutes the International Monetary Fund will issue its latest Global Financial Stability Report, outlining its latest concerns over the world economy. The pick-up in commodity prices today hasn\u2019t prevented Glencore from laying off 800 staff in South Africa. Reuters is reporting that the company has put its platinum mine on \u2018care and maintenance\u2019 , and reining in production at the site. When a slowdown in China hits a global mining firm HQ\u2019d in Switzerland and listed in London, the ripples are felt worldwide. You have have heard conspiracy theories that our central banks don\u2019t actually own all the gold they claim to. Well, worry not! At least if you\u2019re in Germany, where the Bundesbank has now published a list of every single gold bars, individually numbered. Germany has been in quite a tizz over its gold reserves. Campaigners have protested that the bullion shouldn\u2019t be kept in New York and Paris, while the country\u2019s top auditors court politely suggested three years that an audit should take place. Bloomberg\u2019s Lorcan Roche Kelly explains: Perhaps the Bundesbank has learned a lesson here and realized that if it had just complied with the wishes of the Federal Court of Auditors back in 2012 it could have avoided this mess. Or perhaps it has just become tired of people asking and decided to give the doubters enough data to keep them busy for a very, very long time. AB InBev will have to dig rather deeper into its pockets if it wants to sate its thirst for SABMiller (an experience many familiar to many in the City, I suspect). It\u2019s official - SABMiller has resoundingly rejected AB InBev\u2019s \u00a368bn takeover proposal. After mulling it for a few hours, the SAB board have concluded that the \u00a342.15 per share offer, made this morning, undervalues them. Here\u2019s the statement: The Board of SABMiller has now met formally to consider the new proposal announced by AB InBev today (the \u201c\u00a342.15 Proposal\u201d as defined in the announcement by SABMiller earlier today). The Board, excluding the directors nominated by Altria Group Inc., has unanimously rejected the \u00a342.15 Proposal as it still very substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique and unmatched footprint, and its standalone prospects. After the turmoil in late August and September, the stock markets have quietly posted some solid gains in October. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Barton is tweeting some key charts: Europe\u2019s stock markets are refusing to be downhearted by the German and Spanish factory slowdown. The FTSE 100 has hit its highest level in seven weeks, with four mining companies leading the way. Anglo American is leading the risers, up 10%. Oil companies are also gaining, reflecting a 1.7% rise in the cost of crude oil today. The trigger is a research note from Morgan Stanley, who reckons sentiments against emerging markets have turned too sour. They argue: We recommend investors raise their exposure to emerging markets/commodities given the combination of very low sentiment, attractive relative valuations and a likely inflection in macro sentiment... We upgrade mining/materials from underweight to overweight and reiterate our overweight position in energy. Full details in Nick Fletcher\u2019s latest market report: UK companies that actually make things are lagging behind those who dig stuff out of the ground: Encouraging news from Greece. The European Central Bank has cut the amount of emergency support it is providing to the country\u2019s banks by \u20ac1bn, to \u20ac87.9bn. That\u2019s at the request of the Bank of Greece. The ECB explains: The reduction of \u20ac1.0bn in the ceiling reflects an improvement of the liquidity situation of Greek banks, amid a reduction of uncertainty and the stabilization of private sector deposits flows. Britain\u2019s factories posted a 1.0% rise in industrial output in August, beating Germany and Spain. That\u2019s much stronger than the 0.3% rise which economists had expected. It was mainly driven by stronger oil and gas production, and a pick-up in car production after shutdowns in July. UK manufacturing output (a more narrow measure) rose by 0.5% during the month, but was still 0.8% lower than a year ago after some tough months. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the UK industrial sector has been through a soft patch: August\u2019s rebound in industrial production means that the sector may have managed to eke out marginal growth in the third quarter rather than contracting as had previously looked likely. Even so, industrial production was still only up 0.1% in the three months to August compared to the three months to May. Brewing giant SABMiller has just issued a lukewarm, borderline chilly, response to AB InBev\u2019s new \u00a368bn takeover offer. In a statement to the City, SAB points out that the new proposal, at \u00a342.15 per share, is only 15p higher than the previous proposal which was rejected on Monday. It\u2019s not a full-blown rejection, as the board are planning to meet to discuss this new plan. However, chairman Jan du Plessis was pretty blunt, saying: \u201cSABMiller is the crown jewel of the global brewing industry, uniquely positioned to continue to generate decades of standalone future volume and value growth for all SABMiller shareholders from highly attractive markets. AB InBev needs SABMiller but has made opportunistic and highly conditional proposals, elements of which have been deliberately designed to be unattractive to many of our shareholders. AB InBev is very substantially undervaluing SABMiller.\u201d A UK lawyer representing around 1,200 Volkswagen owners in the UK is extremely unimpressed by Matthias M\u00fcller\u2019s plan to start vehicle recalls in January: Ms Michalowska-Howells of Leigh Day says drivers need more answers: \u201cThe way in which this is being handled by Volkswagen is staggering. Rather than responding to very serious concerns from their customers, they are providing the minimal information. \u201cThe latest lamentable statement, given today to a German newspaper, does reveal that some customers will need serious interventions to parts of their vehicle. Which cars and what interventions? \u201cHow will anyone be able to buy or sell an affected car without knowing this essential information?\u201d Volkswagen shares have jumped by 5% this morning after the German carmaker coughed up its plan to fix the emissions scandal. CEO Matthias Mueller told the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that it will start recalling cars in January. \u201cIf everything goes as planned, we can start the recall in January...All the cars should be in order by the end of 2016.\u201d This pushed VW\u2019s share price up to \u20ac102.5, from \u20ac97 last night. But that is still more than a third below its pre-crisis level: In another development, Volkswagen has reported that more than 50,000 defective cars were sold in Australia, plus 17,000 trucks. This chart shows that a) monthly German industrial orders are volatile, b) August\u2019s 1.2% decline was the biggest in a year: European stock markets are all gaining ground this morning, despite the disappointing factory output figures from Spain and Germany. Speculation that the US Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise interest rates this year is driving up the value of commodities. Weak data probably means looser monetary policy, for even longer. The FTSE 100 has gained 41 points, hitting its highest level since late August, led by mining stocks. Anglo American is up 8.5%, with Rio Tinto gaining almost 6%. In Germany, the DAX has gained 0.4%. Another blow to the eurozone. Output at Spain\u2019s factories shrank by 1.4% month-on-month in August. That\u2019s rather worse than the 0.4% decline which economists had expected, and even sharper than the reversal in Germany. There\u2019s a frisson of deal mania in the City this morning, after brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev hiked its proposed takeover offer for British brewer SABMiller to \u00a368bn. This would be one of the biggest half-dozen deals ever, creating a brewing giant producing a third of the world\u2019s beer. There\u2019s not response from SAB yet, but its shares are up 2.7% as traders anticipate more developments. According to Reuters, a quarter of the average daily volume of SAB shares changed hands in the first four minutes of trading today. Shares in Tesco have fallen by more than 3% after the supermarket chain told shareholders that operating profits more than halved in the last six months, to \u00a3354m. As my colleague Fiona Walsh explains, today\u2019s figures show that the turnaround job at Tesco isn\u2019t over yet: Tesco has had a traumatic year, hit by an accounting scandal and the fierce grocery price war. It has been losing sales to discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl and last year posted a record \u00a36.4bn loss, one of the biggest in British corporate history. The company\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who joined from Unilever just over a year ago, has embarked on a turnaround plan for the group, cutting prices and improving customer services. But some City analysts say progress has been too slow. Lewis said: \u201cWe have delivered an unprecedented level of change in our business over the last 12 months and it is working. The first half results show sustained improvement across a broad range of key indicators.\u201d Germany\u2019s economy ministry is urging us not to panic, and claiming that the drop in factory output is partly due to the summer holidays. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, agrees that\u2019s a factor -- but says the figures are still disappointing. Yesterday\u2019s drop in new orders already signalled a note of caution. The August drop marked the first decline for two consecutive months since the beginning of the year. A clear sign for caution. Over the last couple of months, the industrial safety net of low inventories and filled order books has become thinner. The German economy doesn\u2019t need any more bad news at present, given the VW emissions scandal: Christian Lips, an economist at NordLB in Hanover, says today\u2019s report shows Germany\u2019s industry is now lagging behind the consumer sector. He told Bloomberg: \u201cA certain weakness in the [German] manufacturing sector cannot be ignored, even though it stands in stark contrast to strong private consumption.\u201d Production of \u201cinvestment goods\u201d (such as machinery) shrank by 2.1% in August; a sign that companies aren\u2019t splashing out on new equipment. Germany\u2019s powerhouse manufacturing sector has suffered a poor August, in another signal that the global economy is feeling a chill. Figures just released show that industrial output across Germany shrank by 1.2% in August, much worse than the +0.2% which economists had expected. These monthly figures can be volatile - but it comes a day after German firms reported a slide in factory orders in August too. It indicates that the slowdown in emerging economies such as China is now hitting Europe\u2019s largest economy. More reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a subdued feeling in the markets this morning, after the International Monetary Fund warned that the global economy is on the brink of stagnation As we covered yesterday, the IMF has cut its growth forecast again and warned that \u201ca return to robust and synchronised global expansion remains elusive\u201d. It\u2019s another reminder that the slowdown in emerging markets could cause more pain for developing nations, as America\u2019s central bank keeps its finger hovering over the rate rise button. New industrial production data released this morning from Germany, Spain, and the UK will show whether factories are now finding conditions tougher In the City, traders are crunching through financial results from Tesco. Britain\u2019s largest supermarket has posted a 55% drop in operating profits, to \u00a3354m down from \u00a3779m last year. More on that shortly. And Greece\u2019s parliament will conclude the debate on its 2016 budget today, with a confidence vote at midnight Athens time (so we might pick up the result tomorrow morning). Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has predicted that Greece could pull out of recession by the middle of 2016, if all goes well. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day",

      "bodyText": "The next financial crisis is coming, it\u2019s a just a matter of time \u2013 and we haven\u2019t finished fixing the flaws in the global system that were so brutally exposed by the last one. That is the message from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest Global Financial Stability report, which will make sobering reading for the finance ministers and central bankers gathered in Lima, Peru, for its annual meeting. Massive monetary policy stimulus has rekindled growth in developed economies since the deep recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008; but what the IMF calls the \u201chandover\u201d to a more sustainable recovery \u2013 without the extra prop of ultra-low borrowing costs \u2013 has so far failed to materialise. Meanwhile, the cheap money created to rescue the developed economies has flooded out into emerging markets, inflating asset bubbles, and encouraging companies and governments to take advantage of unusually low borrowing costs and load up on debt. \u201cBalance sheets have become stretched thinner in many emerging market companies and banks. These firms have become more susceptible to financial stress,\u201d the IMF says. Meanwhile, the failure to patch up the international financial system after the last crash, by ensuring that banks in emerging markets hold enough capital, and constraining risky borrowing, for example, means that a new Lehman Brothers-type shock could spark another global panic. \u201cShocks may originate in advanced or emerging markets and, combined with unaddressed system vulnerabilities, could lead to a global asset market disruption and a sudden drying up of market liquidity in many asset classes,\u201d the IMF says, warning that some markets appear to be \u201cbrittle\u201d. So as the US Federal Reserve lays the groundwork for a return to peacetime interest rates, from the emergency levels of the past seven years, financial markets face what the IMF calls an \u201cunprecedented adjustment\u201d; and the world looks woefully underprepared. The IMF\u2019s warning echoes a chorus of others. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has argued that the world is entering the latest episode of a \u201cthree-part crisis trilogy\u201d. Unctad, the UN\u2019s trade and development arm, would like to see advanced economies boost public spending to offset the downturn in emerging economies. The Bank for International Settlements believes interest rates have been too low for too long, encouraging too much risk-taking in financial markets. All of them fear that the global financial system is primed for a crisis. The IMF has not given up hope of what it calls a \u201csuccessful normalisation\u201d \u2013 it lays out a series of conditions that would need to be met, from a successful rebalancing of growth in China, to \u201csafeguarding against market illiquidity\u201d in financial markets. Yet the failure of the world\u2019s policymakers to get to grips with the shortcomings of the international financial system over the past seven years, despite the long shadow cast by Lehman and its aftermath, suggests that any measures enacted now are likely to be too little, too late. The message many may take home from Lima is, \u201cbatten down the hatches\u201d.",

These firms have become more susceptible to financial stress,\u201d the IMF says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the failure to patch up the international financial system after the last crash, by ensuring that banks in emerging markets hold enough capital, and constraining risky borrowing, for example, means that a new Lehman Brothers-type shock could spark another global panic.</p> <p>\u201cShocks may originate in advanced or emerging markets and, combined with unaddressed system vulnerabilities, could lead to a global asset market disruption and a sudden drying up of market liquidity in many asset classes,\u201d the IMF says, warning that some markets appear to be \u201cbrittle\u201d.</p> <p>So as the US Federal Reserve lays the groundwork for a return to peacetime interest rates, from the emergency levels of the past seven years, financial markets face what the IMF calls an \u201cunprecedented adjustment\u201d; and the world looks woefully underprepared.<br></p> <p>The IMF\u2019s warning echoes a chorus of others. The Bank of England\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/interest-rates-rise-bank-of-england-chief-economist-andy-haldane\">chief economist, Andy Haldane</a>,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/interest-rates-rise-bank-of-england-chief-economist-andy-haldane\"> </a>has argued that the world is entering the latest episode of a \u201cthree-part crisis trilogy\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/06/wealthy-countries-public-spending-global-slump-un-unctad\">Unctad, the UN\u2019s trade and development arm</a>, would like to see advanced economies boost public spending to offset the downturn in emerging economies. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/28/interest-rates-growth-warning-bank-for-international-settlements\">Bank for International Settlements</a> believes interest rates have been too low for too long, encouraging too much risk-taking in financial markets. All of them fear that the global financial system is primed for a crisis.</p> <p>The IMF has not given up hope of what it calls a \u201csuccessful normalisation\u201d \u2013 it lays out a series of conditions that would need to be met, from a successful rebalancing of growth in China, to \u201csafeguarding against market illiquidity\u201d in financial markets.</p> <p>Yet the failure of the world\u2019s policymakers to get to grips with the shortcomings of the international financial system over the past seven years, despite the long shadow cast by Lehman and its aftermath, suggests that any measures enacted now are likely to be too little, too late. The message many may take home from Lima is, \u201cbatten down the hatches\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s plan to recall cars affected by the diesel emissions scandal is lamentable and the lack of information being provided to customers is staggering, lawyers representing motorists have said. Matthias M\u00fcller, chief executive of VW, told a German newspaper the company would launch a recall of the 11m affected cars in January and complete the fix by the end of next year. He said a software update could fix many of the cars fitted with a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to cheat emissions tests, but some could require new injectors and catalysers. Temporary workshops could be set up to deal with complex cases. In a further blow to the crisis-hit German company, the influential US Senate finance committee said on Wednesday it was investigating whether VW used the defeat devices to benefit from $50m (\u00a333m) of tax credits on diesel cars sold in the US. VW and the buyers of its diesel cars benefited from more than $50m in subsidies in the belief the vehicles caused less pollution then they actually did. In a letter sent to VW, Orrin Hatch, chairman of the committee, said the use of the defeat devices to manipulate tests means the company may have made false representations to the US government in securing the tax incentives. Meanwhile, VW has confirmed it has appointed Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, its former finance director, as chairman of the supervisory board \u2013 despite calls from stakeholders for an external figure to be appointed chairman. The company was due to submit its plan to fix vehicles involved in the scandal to regulators in Germany on Wednesday. However, VW motorists remain in the dark about what will happen to their cars. Bozena Michalowska-Howells at law firm Leigh Day, which is representing more than 1,200 VW drivers considering legal action against the company, said the carmaker needed to explain exactly how it would repair the vehicles. \u201cThe way in which this is being handled by Volkswagen is staggering. Rather than responding to very serious concerns from their customers, they are providing the minimal information,\u201d she said. \u201cThe latest lamentable statement, given to a German newspaper, does reveal that some customers will need serious interventions to parts of their vehicle. Which cars and what interventions? \u201cHow will anyone be able to buy or sell an affected car without knowing this essential information?\u201d M\u00fcller told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that scandal was the result of the actions of a few employees and that Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive, did not know the company was rigging emissions tests. Four members of staff have been suspended, three of whom were senior managers responsible for engine development, M\u00fcller added. On the fate of affected vehicles, he said: \u201cIf all goes according to plan, we can start the recall in January. All the cars should be fixed by the end of 2016.\u201d VW will face further scrutiny on Thursday when Michael Horn, its US boss, appears in front of the energy and commerce committee in Congress. Horn has written to VW\u2019s customers in the US, where the scandal began, to apologise and warn them that it will take \u201csome time\u201d to resolve the issue. On Monday the UK boss of VW will appear in front of Britain\u2019s transport select committee. Paul Willis will be questioned along with Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, and Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry trade body. VW has put aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to meet the cost of recalling the cars and fixing them so they meet environmental standards. It also faces a fine of up to $18bn from US regulators as well as legal claims from customers and shareholders. M\u00fcller has told staff the fallout from the diesel emissions scandal \u201cwon\u2019t be painless\u201d and that the company needs to make massive savings as it faces the prospect of a multibillion-euro bill. \u201cIt [the \u20ac6.5bn] includes the estimated cost to fix the affected vehicles. But it won\u2019t be enough,\u201d he told them at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. \u201cWe must prepare for significant penalties, and many could take the events as an opportunity to claim damages against Volkswagen. \u201cThat is why we have initiated a further critical review of all planned investments. Anything that is not absolutely necessary will be cancelled or postponed, and it is why we will be intensifying the efficiency programme. To be perfectly frank: this will not be a painless process.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has widened the scope of legislation aimed at tackling multinational tax avoidance, increasing the number of large companies under the tax office\u2019s microscope from 30 to 80. The government announced budget measures in May that allow the Australian Tax Office (ATO) to receive information on 30 multinationals that have a global revenue of more than $1bn. \u201cFrom the beginning of next year that would extend to around 80,\u201d the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said. Legislation was introduced into parliament in September to enhance the integrity of the tax system by closing loopholes that allow large corporations to avoid paying their normal share of tax. The government wants legislation passed in time for the laws to come into effect on 1 January. A Senate inquiry looking into multinational tax avoidance recommended that companies that deliberately avoid tax be named and shamed. The tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, rejected the idea. \u201cUnder our secrecy laws, we are compelled to hold our discussions in private,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t see any particular advantage in us sort of trying to name and shame companies.\u201d The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has released a 15-point plan to increase transparency and minimise tax avoidance practices. The organisation estimates that between 4% to 10% of global revenue is lost through base erosion and profit shifting measures, amounting to up to US$240bn annually. G20 leaders will discuss the OECD anti-avoidance measures when they meet in Peru on Thursday. Morrison said Australian laws were stronger than those in other countries, meaning the tax recouped would not be as high. \u201cYou need to be wary here when others are making claims about how much can be raised here, and suggesting it can be used for any number of things. I think there\u2019s a very big question mark over that,\u201d the treasurer said. The budget included a strengthening of penalties for companies that deliberately shirk their tax burden. Jordan said it was \u201cnot possible\u201d to give a precise figure on the amount of tax lost in Australia. \u201cI\u2019m very reluctant to try to sort of throw a figure out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have said in the past is we know there are billions of dollars of sales that are booked overseas from activities that directly occur here in Australia.\u201d \u201cI should acknowledge that the majority of corporates do pay the right amount of tax in Australia and are open and transparent in their dealings with us. However, there is a minority that try to avoid their obligations and we do act on behaviour that is questionable.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Anheuser-Busch InBev has urged SABMiller shareholders to telephone the UK brewer\u2019s chairman to press him to enter serious talks after it turned down a $100bn (\u00a365bn) takeover proposal from the world\u2019s biggest beermaker. Carlos Brito said SABMiller\u2019s rejection of three bid proposals meant that its shareholders risked losing out on a valuation that could take the company many years to achieve on its own. AB InBev, the Belgian-based owner of Budweiser and Stella Artois, went public with its proposed bid in an attempt to force SABMiller\u2019s hand with a week to go until the deadline for a firm offer. If a deal went ahead, it would be the biggest takeover of a UK company, creating a brewing giant that would produce a third of the world\u2019s beer. AB InBev said it was willing to pay \u00a342.15 a share in cash for SABMiller, which makes Grolsch, Peroni and Coors. It had previously made private approaches to the board, chaired by Jan du Plessis, suggesting a deal at \u00a338 a share and \u00a340 a share. The latest proposal would value SABMiller at \u00a368bn. However, AB InBev also proposed a part-share offer aimed at SABMiller\u2019s biggest shareholders, which own 41% of the company. It would be worth 11% less than the proposed offer to other investors, making the potential deal worth \u00a365bn. The two major shareholders, Altria of the US and BevCo, owned by Colombia\u2019s Santo Domingo family, appear to be split on AB InBev\u2019s approach. Altria announced public support for the proposal and told SABMiller\u2019s board to work on a deal. But Brito was forced to backtrack on a claim made early on Wednesday that he expected BevCo to back the proposal. He said he still hoped to get the support of BevCo, which owns almost 14%. Brito did not rule out making a hostile bid before the 14 October takeover rules deadline, but he said he still hoped to get SABMiller\u2019s board to support an offer. He said: \u201cWe still want to get the recommended deal, but now it\u2019s time for shareholders to pressure the board. If they think they are not going to see this \u00a342.15 any time soon if this deal falls apart because of a lack of engagement, they should call the chairman. The board is the biggest risk in this transaction and that is why it\u2019s important for shareholders to voice their opinions because time is running out.\u201d SAB Miller said its board met on Wednesday and decided unanimously to rebuff AB InBev\u2019s approach. Representatives of Altria, with 27% of the shares did not take part in the vote. SABMiller said: \u201cThe board, excluding the directors nominated by Altria Group Inc, has unanimously rejected the \u00a342.15 proposal as it still very substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique and unmatched footprint, and its standalone prospects.\u201d The rejection of the proposal sets the scene for further manoeuvring between the companies and shareholders. Brito said the part-share offer was devised \u201cwith and for\u201d Altria and BevCo by an unnamed shareholder of AB InBev. AB InBev\u2019s latest proposal is 44% more than SABMiller\u2019s closing share price the day before rumours of an impending approach reached the market last month. SABMiller shares edged up 11p, or 0.3%, to close at \u00a336.33 after the company rejected the proposed offer. SABMiller announced on 15 September that AB InBev had approached it about a takeover to create a company worth about $280bn. Under UK takeover rules, AB InBev was given 28 days to make a firm offer or walk away unless SABMiller asked for the deadline to be extended. Brito said his company had considered a bid for SABMiller on and off for years but that in the past year it had carried out a detailed analysis of the beer market in Africa, where SAB Miller is the dominant brewer. It had also learnt that Altria and BevCo might be receptive to an approach, he said. The combined company would be able to sell more brands in different countries, he said. Apart from the US and China, there is little overlap between the two companies\u2019 markets, and the deal would be about expansion rather than cutting costs, Brito added. AB InBev said the alternative to its cash offer, available to all shareholders but intended for Altria and BevCo, would pay \u00a32.37 a share in cash and the rest in a new class of AB InBev shares. SABMiller said this option was worth \u00a337.49 a share and that the shares would be untraded and convertible into ordinary AB InBev shares after five years. RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones said he believed both companies wanted to strike a deal and that price was the sticking point. \u201cThis is not, in our view, intended as ABI\u2019s concluding proposal but it is likely to put pressure on SAB\u2019s management to engage (witness Altria\u2019s comments) and at least there is now a formal proposition to discuss,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco profits tumble by more than half", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco is planning further rounds of price cuts after profits more than halved in the first six months of its financial year. The UK\u2019s biggest retailer made operating profits of \u00a3354m, excluding exceptional items and its now offloaded Korean business, in the six months to 29 August, compared with \u00a3779m in the same year before. Sales at established stores in the UK slid by 1.1% in the six months to 29 August and the group warned that trading conditions remained challenging. Profits in the UK and Ireland dived 70%, but a 26% fall in profits at Tesco\u2019s international businesses also disappointed the City. Tesco said the fall was largely down to the impact of new tax and Sunday trading laws on its business in Hungary. Dave Lewis, the Tesco chief executive who joined from Unilever just more than a year ago, insisted that the six months to the end of February, the second half of the group\u2019s last financial year, were Tesco\u2019s \u201cyear zero\u201d, and that the company was rebuilding from there. He said underlying sales were now rising in Tesco\u2019s Asian and central European operations, while the trend in the UK was improving as Tesco attracted more shoppers who were buying more items on each visit. Lewis said: \u201cWe have delivered an unprecedented level of change in our business over the last 12 months and it is working. The first-half results show sustained improvement across a broad range of key indicators.\u201d Underlying sales in the UK had continued to fall as a basket of food from Tesco was now 3% cheaper than a year ago, he said. Tesco said price cuts \u2013 as a result of grocery market deflation and its own action \u2013 had cost it around \u00a3200m over the half year. Lewis said Tesco would continue to cut prices. \u201cI think there is more deflation to come \u2013 some we have to do as we invest ourselves and I don\u2019t see the market changing,\u201d he said. The next six months would be significant, he believed, as Tesco would be trading against a period when it boosted sales with heavy promotions and use of discount vouchers, schemes that Lewis said he did not want to repeat. \u201cThere is still volatility in our business,\u201d he said. Tesco shares closed up 2.5% at 197p as analysts welcomed better than expected UK trading from from the retailer. Lewis said Tesco had undergone a dramatic transformation in the year since he joined the business. He has cut thousands of jobs, closed loss-making stores and enticed shoppers back with seven waves of price cuts. \u201cEvery important part of Tesco has been or is being transformed operationally, culturally or financially,\u201d he said. \u201cA virtuous circle in the UK is starting to work. Every bit of benefit that we get we have invested back in the business.\u201d He said Tesco had dramatically improved the availability of its products and introduced hundreds of new ideas - from super-hot Kimono Dragon chillis to large blackberries that can be eaten as a snack. \u201cWhen I joined, we were losing customers to every competitor. Now we are net gainers. As we improve our offer, people are coming back to Tesco.\u201d There was a marked improvement at Tesco\u2019s largest stores, which are being hit by changing shopping habits towards buying small amounts at neighbourhood stores. Sales at Tesco Extra sites dropped by 1.1% in the three months to the end of August compared to a 6.3% slide when Lewis arrived at the business. \u201cI look at them as assets and our job in retail is to make them much more worth the trip,\u201d he said. The improvement in trading puts Tesco on track to achieve its target of annual profits on a par with last year. Excluding the Korean business and changes to the way Tesco calculates profit, the retailer is now targeting \u00a3950m of full-year operating profit, compared with \u00a31.4bn previously. Lewis said that if there was any sign that Tesco was trading well enough to beat that target, the difference would be invested in improving services, products or prices for customers. Phil Dorrell, of consultants Retail Remedy, said the results showed Tesco was \u201cready to move from intensive care into the recovery ward\u201d. The group \u201cisn\u2019t cured but it is definitely over the worst\u201d, he added. Tesco has had a traumatic year, hit by an accounting scandal and the fierce grocery price war. It has been losing sales to discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl and last year posted a record \u00a36.4bn loss, one of the biggest in British corporate history. The company was forced to sell off its South Korean business Homeplus for \u00a34bn to alleviate the \u00a38.6bn debt that has reduced its credit rating to junk status. On Wednesday, Lewis said Tesco would not be selling its loyalty card data business, Dunnhumby, which was put on the market as part of the debt reduction plan. Lewis said he wanted to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under talk of major restructuring and the company had decided not to offload any other major assets, such as retail operations in eastern Europe or Thailand. Tesco now hopes to rebuild its balance sheet by improving cash generation rather than major asset sales or a rights issue, Lewis said. \u201cWe will stay focused on generating better returns from the assets we\u2019ve got.\u201d He did not rule out sales of smaller businesses that no longer fitted with Tesco\u2019s strategy, however, raising speculation that the Dobbies garden centres or Giraffe restaurants businesses could yet be offloaded.",

Excluding the Korean business and changes to the way Tesco calculates profit, the retailer is now targeting \u00a3950m of full-year operating profit, compared with \u00a31.4bn previously. Lewis said that if there was any sign that Tesco was trading well enough to beat that target, the difference would be invested in improving services, products or prices for customers.</p> <p>Phil Dorrell, of consultants Retail Remedy, said the results showed Tesco was \u201cready to move from intensive care into the recovery ward\u201d. The group \u201cisn\u2019t cured but it is definitely over the worst\u201d, he added. </p> <p>Tesco has had a traumatic year, hit by an accounting scandal and the fierce grocery price war. It has been losing sales to discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl and last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/22/tesco-suffers-record-64bn-loss\" draggable=\"true\">posted a record \u00a36.4bn loss</a>, one of the biggest in British corporate history. The company was forced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/07/tesco-reduce-net-debt-homeplus-korean\" draggable=\"true\">sell off its South Korean business Homeplus for \u00a34bn</a> to alleviate the \u00a38.6bn debt that has reduced its credit rating to junk status.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Lewis said Tesco would not be selling its loyalty card data business, Dunnhumby, which was put on the market as part of the debt reduction plan. Lewis said he wanted to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under talk of major restructuring and the company had decided not to offload any other major assets, such as retail operations in eastern Europe or Thailand. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Tesco now hopes to rebuild its balance sheet by improving cash generation rather than major asset sales or a rights issue, Lewis said. \u201cWe will stay focused on generating better returns from the assets we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>He did not rule out sales of smaller businesses that no longer fitted with Tesco\u2019s strategy, however, raising speculation that the Dobbies garden centres or Giraffe restaurants businesses could yet be offloaded.</p>",
