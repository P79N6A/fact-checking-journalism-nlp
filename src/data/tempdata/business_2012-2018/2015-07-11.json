      "bodyText": "So, another crunch meeting fails to deliver a breakthough. But this wasn\u2019t any old failed eurogroup meeting. This might be remembered as a classic. We had Germany producing a half-baked scheme to boot Greece out for five years, Finland\u2019s new government on the edge of meltdown, and Italy preparing to raise the stakes on Sunday by telling Germany that enough is enough. Meanwhile, Greece\u2019s economy is in freefall, its banks are on the edge, and its political class are reeling after Alexis Tsipras offered billions of euros in fresh austerity to get a deal. From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor sums up the situation after another frustrating, and sometimes bizarre, day: Greece\u2019s final attempt to avoid being kicked out of the euro by securing a new three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac80bn ran into a wall of resistance from the eurozone\u2019s fiscal hawks on Saturday. Finland rejected any more funding for the country and Germany called for Greece to be turfed out of the currency bloc for at least five years. The last chance talks between the 19 eurozone finance ministers in Brussels ran into the early hours of the morning as they struggled to draft a policy paper for national leaders at yet another emergency summit on Sunday that was billed as the decisive meeting. With Greece on the edge of financial and social implosion, eurozone finance ministers met to decide on the country\u2019s fate and on what to do about its debt crisis, after experts from the troika of creditors said that new fiscal rigour proposals from Athens were good enough to form \u201cthe basis for negotiations\u201d. But the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, dismissed that view, supported by a number of northern and eastern European states. A German finance ministry paper said: \u201cThese proposals cannot build the basis for a completely new, three-year [bailout] programme, as requested by Greece.\u201d It called for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone for a minimum of five years and demanded that the Greek government transfer \u20ac50bn of state assets to an outside agency for sell-off. Timo Soini, the nationalist True Finns leader, meanwhile, threatened to bring down the government in Helsinki if Alex Stubb, the finance minister, agreed to a new bailout for Greece. Stubb apparently came to the crunch meeting on a new bailout without a mandate to agree one..... Here\u2019s Ian\u2019s full story: Tomorrow\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit could be explosive, given we\u2019re expecting Matteo Renzi to urge Angela Merkel to show some leadership and end the crisis. And with eurogroup president Dijsselbloem warning that the situation is \u201cvery difficult\u201d, there\u2019s no guarantee of a breakthrough when ministers resume talks. But a good night\u2019s sleep might help. So in that spirit, I\u2019m going to end this liveblog until the morning. (unless anything sensational happens). Thanks, as ever, for reading and helping. Goodnight! GW The message from Greece tonight - don\u2019t blame us, we\u2019re doing our best: European solidarity, eh? If eurozone finance ministers cannot reach a deal on Sunday morning, they will pass the hot potato onto the 28 leaders of EU countries in the afternoon: The FT\u2019s Duncan Robinson confirms that the eurogroup is far from a deal. Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos spoke to the media before hotfooting it into the darkness. I missed Christine Lagarde\u2019s departure, but a replay shows that the IMF chief only gave a wave to the cameras. Here comes Euclid Tsakalotos.....and there goes Euclid Tsakalotos! Greece\u2019s finance minister exited the building at a marching pace, mobile phone glued to his ear, deep in conversation. Not a word for the press, alas. Here\u2019s a video clip of Pierre Moscovici\u2019s comments tonight: Some ministers are walking past the media and refusing to speak, including Ireland\u2019s Michael Noonan. I guess they\u2019ve got nothing encouraging to say. Mario Draghi just got into a car without comment. Here comes Pierre Moscovici....and actually he (for once) doesn\u2019t look too upbeat. He tells reporters (in French) that there is always hope. Michel Sapin\u2019s optimism is unquenchable! Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb told reporters that tonight\u2019s meeting made \u2018good progress\u2019 This is the same Alex Stubb who apparently can\u2019t back a third bailout? Jerosn Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, is speaking now at the exit. He confirms that the meeting is adjourned until 11am tomorrow morning. We have had an in-depth discussion of the Greek proposals. The issue of credibility and trust was discussed, and also of course the financial issues involved. It is still very difficult, but work is still in progress. It does NOT look good, I\u2019m afraid. Eurozone ministers are being collared as they leave the meeting - here\u2019s a live feed. Ian adds that there won\u2019t be a press conference tonight. No statement either. We\u2019re basically in limbo until the morning. Ian confirms that the eurogroup is breaking up, to resume in the morning Eurogroup ministers are going to resume talks in 11 hours time: The prime minister of Malta has tweeted that the eurogroup meeting failed to reach an agreement (as had become clear in recent hours) Muscat, like other EU leaders, will be attending Sunday\u2019s emergency summit on Greece. But is that to discuss Grexit, or to hammer out political agreement on a third bailout? The Eurogroup meeting is over! Until the morning...... The Finns really have put a spanner in the works, by the sound of it: So the source isn\u2019t Euclid, anyway. Hopes of an early finish are being trampled into the carpet. The Brussels press pack are heading that the eurogroup may run for another three hours. Here\u2019s something to chew on. A eurozone bailout, as Jennifer flagged up earlier, only needs 85% support if the situation is an emergency. But some country\u2019s have rather more muscle than others, reflecting their financial contribution to bailout funds. Many of the smaller countries only have a tiny share of the vote. Finland and Slokavia may have hard-talking finance ministers, but when the chips are actually down, it\u2019s France, Italy, and of course Germany who actually have veto power, while Spain just needs a few allies. The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria also have enough power to influence a really tight vote. So much for finishing at 10pm Brussels time..... Tomorrow, Italy is reportedly going to demand that Germany hammers out an agreement with Greece, our datablog editor, Alberto Nardelli, hears tonight. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has had enough, Alberto understands. It\u2019s time to stop humiliating Greece, and end this crisis. Tomorrow, at the summit of eurozone leaders, Renzi will insist that chancellor Angela Merkel finds an agreement, for the good of the European Union. This crisis just gets more, and more, and more serious. And compelling. Back in Greece, economy minister George Stathakis has warned that the country could face some capital controls all though the summer. Reuters has the details: Stathakis told Greece\u2019s Mega TV that the banks could reopen as soon as next week, if an agreement with creditors is reached this weekend, but other restrictions on withdrawals and currency exports would remain in place for most. \u201cThat will stay in play for two months or some months,\u201d he said. This appears to be the German finance ministry\u2019s paper, which suggests Greece could be offered a \u2018temporary\u2019 exit from the eurozone. As you can see, it argues that this would allow Greece to restructure its debts, and also get humanitarian support. Finnish TV is reporting that the Helsinki government will not support a new Greek aid package. So, it\u2019s over? Not necessarily. There\u2019s an emergency procedure which allows financial assistance to be granted from the ESM with just 85% support, in a real emergency: That may not help get an agreement through the eurogroup tonight, though..... Sounds like a statement is being drawn up tonight....but it\u2019s not a decisive Yes or No to a Greek deal. It sounds more like an Ummmmm....: The Eurogroup meeting is buzzing with talk that the Finnish government might collapse, if it backs a third Greek bailout. My colleagues Ian and Jennifer have the latest: (that\u2019s Timo Soini, leader of the True Finns) Eurozone ministers have been discussing Greece\u2019s bailout request for hours, with no signs of an major breakthrough. The meeting may end soon, though, after around six hours which began with smiles, and frowns. EU sources say that creditors are demanding tougher measures, on top of the \u20ac13bn plan of tax rises, pension reforms and spending cuts already offered. Several countries have already questioned whether Greece has done enough, and warned that trust in the Greek government has been badly hit by the last few weeks\u2019 events. Germany has reportedly drawn up a paper suggesting Greece could temporarily exit the eurozone, to general disbelief: And Finland\u2019s government is rumoured to be taking a very hard line, with reports suggesting its coalition could break up over Greece. It could all be bargaining tactics, though, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s leaders summits Economists have warned that Greece needs a deal urgently, so that its banking sector can be replenished with desperately needed liquidity. And in Athens, a senior government minister has suggested that Syriza MPs who can\u2019t support the austerity plan should quit. Life has been carrying on in Athens tonight, as the eurogroup meeting rolls on: The Greek crisis is putting serious strain on Finland\u2019s new government. Maria Stenroos, EU correspondent for state broadcaster Yle, reports that the Finnish delegation is taking an even tougher line than Germany. (The right-wing, euro-sceptic True Finns are coalition partners in the new government, which was formed in May) This is getting a lot of play on Finnish TV tonight. But would Helsinki really outflank Berlin on this? Jarno Hartikainen of business newspaper Kauppalehti reckons not: The BBC\u2019s Chris Morris has more details on the measures that Greece is being pushed for tonight (as Ian reported earlier) A week of nail-biting votes in Athens, as well as crunch meetings in Brussels? Oh great. Could ministers come back in the morning for another crack at the problem? Apparently, tonight\u2019s dinner isn\u2019t going too well: Given the sheer number of eurogroup meetings in recent weeks, ministers must have exhausted their reserves of small talk. \u201cBeen anywhere nice recently?\u201d \u201cBrussels, Brussels, Brussels, Brussels, oh yes Luxembourg..... and Brussels.\u201d Rumour watch: the eurogroup meeting might finish in just over an hour\u2019s time: (there\u2019s a scheduled Eurogroup meeting on Monday, but a second meeting would be unscheduled) So much for kicking out the Troika.... Greece\u2019s creditors are drafting a response to Athen\u2019s bailout proposal - outlining what extra measures are needed, reports our Europe editor: Ian also hears that eurozone ministers may fail to reach an agreement tonight - kicking the can upstairs to the euro leaders meeting tomorrow. Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason has a handy summary of the state of play this evening: Now here\u2019s a tasty rumour: We\u2019ve been told that French officials provided \u201cinvaluable\u201d help in drawing up the current Greek proposals. Can\u2019t imagine why Berlin would be cross..... More head-shaking in Brussels: Wolfango Piccoli, analyst at Teneo Intelligence, reckons that Alexis Tsipras has four options following the mini-rebellion at last night\u2019s vote over his reform plan: He could resign and trigger snap polls after reaching a deal with his lenders. This would leave Greece in limbo for around 3-4 weeks, a development that would raise significant concerns among the lenders and complicate meeting the relevant targets (milestones) attached to the likely sub-tranches of a new bailout. He could decide to tackle decisively the situation by breaking with the dissenters and replacing those MPs who voted \u201cNo\u201d or abstained, including the two ministers and the parliament speaker. This could be achieved by enforcing SYRIZA\u2019s internal rule forcing (on paper) MPs to give up their seats after leaving the parliamentary group. He could seek to enlarge the governing coalition by including one or more of the opposition parties, notably POTAMI and Pasok. The creation of a wider coalition would reassure the lenders but it is, in our view, the least likely of the available options. Finally, he could decide to move cautiously (as he has done in the past) by replacing only the two MPs who voted \u201cNo\u201d, meaning that an unstable balance would prevail in the short-term, at least. But whatever Tsipras chooses, there\u2019s a high chance of another general election this year, Wolf adds. Over in Athens, economy minister Giorgos Stathakis has said he\u2019s confident the government will be able to get parliamentary approval for its reform plans. And he also warned that any Syriza MP who disagrees should resign their seat. Stathakis told Mega TV that: \u201cIf a lawmaker of a leftist party disagrees with the policies of the government...they should follow the rules and if they strongly disagree resign their seat. Stathakis added that \u201cif it were me, I would resign\u201d. (that\u2019s via Reuters) Last night, 17 Syriza MPs either opposed the plan, abstained or were absent during the vote. That included energy minister, and influential Syriza member, Panagiotis Lafazanis. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, may feel vindicated by the news of a German government paper proposing a temporary Grexit. He\u2019s written an opinion piece in today\u2019s Guardian, claiming Sch\u00e4uble wanted to drive Greece out to \u201cput the fear of God\u201d into the French. And he\u2019s just tweeted: Eurozone finance ministers are pausing to refuel after three hours of talks, Cyprus government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides flags up. Talks could go well into the night, we hear.... Although there is growing optimism in Athens, there is also fear for the future after weeks of unsettling drama, as Helena Smith reports: I just chatted with Vicky Pryce, the prominent economist. She says she has been taken aback not only by the yearning for normality she has encountered since arriving in Athens but the sheer level of anxiety she has also seen. \u201cEveryone wants the banks to reopen so that some normality can return and businesses can re-open,\u201d she told me. \u201cPeople are really very, very, fearful, a lot have been telling me they have been having panic attacks because of the anxiety that this situation has produced. No one wants to even go to the beach [in the southern suburbs]. When I asked why, I was told they are all at home guarding their money!\u201d There were mass withdrawals of savings by Greeks fearing the collapse of the banking system, before capital controls were imposed nearly two weeks ago. Pryce, who has openly opposed the tough austerity measures being asked of Athens, said it was now crucial that an agreement was reached with the country\u2019s creditors. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very painful but we are where we are and right now so very much hangs on signing it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Greece gets this bailout it will not only bring liquidity into the system but open the possibility of the country entering the quantitative easing scheme [set up] by the European Central Bank which would then allow rates to come down in the capital markets. That would be terribly, terribly important in helping to turn things around.\u201d Maybe Wolfgang\u2019s just waiting for the right moment to drop it into the conversation.... More leaks, as ministers take a break after three hour of talks. Reuters says that Euro zone finance ministers told Euclid Tsakalotos that Athens must offer deeper reforms to persuade them to open talks on a third bailout. Two sources said there was consensus among the other 18 ministers around the table that the leftist government in Athens must take further steps to convince them it would honour any new debts. That fits with the noises coming out of Germany, that Athens can\u2019t simply propose measures \u2018left undone\u2019 from its second bailout to qualify for a third aid package. The Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Khan points out another reason that temporary Grexit is somewhat bonkers: Ie, it reduces the eurozone to a mere fixed exchange rate system, not an expression (however flawed) of European solidarity. Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, agrees that \u2018temporary\u2019 Grexit is a non-starter: But it might reassure German voters and MPs: Greek officials have denied that Germany has suggested they clear off for five years, reports Euronews\u2019s Efi Koutsokosta. Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper is reporting that the German finance ministry has proposed two options for Greece - including a temporary \u2018timeout\u2019 from the eurozone! Under the first course, Greece would improve its existing proposals, and also transfer some \u20ac50bn of property assets to sell off to pay debts (not clear which assets they have in mind. Islands? The Parthenon perhaps?) The second option would see Greece leaves the monetary union for at least five years and restructures its debt. It would remain as the EU Member and receives further \u201cgrowth-enhancing, humanitarian and technical assistance\u201d. Here\u2019s the story: Sch\u00e4uble bringt \u201eGrexit\u201c auf Zeit ins Gespr\u00e4ch The finance ministry are declining to comment: I suppose they could be serious (assuming FAS are right). But it\u2019s riddled with problems. For starters, if Greece shifts to a depreciated Drachma it\u2019ll find it even harder to service its existing euro debts. What happens to the banking sector once the emergency liquidity is removed, and the euro deposits locked inside. And once you\u2019re left the eurozone, even \u2018temporarily\u2019, can you really be certain you\u2019ll be allowed back in? Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports that despite the obstacles Greece and its creditors have to overcome, there is optimism that a deal can be reached. And it is beginning to show. The age-old adage that psychology is everything in economics was evident for all to see on the streets of Athens today. A deal may be as far away as ever, but prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 abrupt decision to embrace reforms he once vehemently opposed has raised optimism. Taverna owners, shop keepers and families enjoying the summer sun in Athens\u2019 old town of Plaka, this afternoon, spoke of relief that the drama of recent weeks might, finally, be coming to an end. \u201cEveryone is praying for this uncertainty to end,\u201d said Georgia Poulidou who owns a local gift shop. \u201cEveryone just looks a lot happier and I am not talking about tourists. Let\u2019s hope Germany doesn\u2019t make it too difficult.\u201d The improved psychology was also reflected in business with firms reporting an increase in turnover on hopes of a financial lifeline being thrown to Greece. \u201cSince yesterday Greeks have started eating again,\u201d said Michalis Alexiou an employee in a catering firm in the northern suburb of Maroussi. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, people are suddenly no longer afraid to spend. Everyone is hoping for a solution,\u201d he told me. Analysts said despite the political tumult Tsipras was bound to face, almost six months after assuming power, he had \u201ccrossed the rubicon\u201d by agreeing to take on the cost of reforms and hardliners in the ranks of his own Syriza party. \u201cHe is going to confront a lot of problems with former comrades, some of the more extremist elements in Syriza\u2019s ranks,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, professor of economics and law at Athens University. \u201cI see a reshuffle very soon and many of those who refused to endorse the proposed reforms in the parliament will probably resign.\u201d Across the room, Italy\u2019s Pier Carlo Padoan (left) and France\u2019s Michel Sapin (right) discussed matters with commissioner Pierre Moscovici.... While Slovakia\u2019s Peter Kazimir caught up with Portugal\u2019s Maria Luis Albuquerque: And Christine Lagarde gave Euclid Tsakalotos quite a look:.... This is Euclid Tsakalotos\u2019s second eurogroup meeting as Greece\u2019s finance minister, and he got a friendly welcome from, among others, France\u2019s Michel Sapin: He\u2019s next to Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos (taking his seat here), who hopes to be elected as the eurogroup\u2019s new president on Monday. The current incumbent, Jeroen Dijsselbloem has been giving the thumbs-up:.... But also looking rather gloomy as he spoke with Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb (centre) IMF chief Christine Lagarde is in the room too: And has been comparing notes with Klaus Regling, who runs the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) While Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble looked like a man expecting \u201cextraordinarily difficult negotiations\u201d today: My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels has rounded up events so far today: Here\u2019s the video of Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s caustic remarks on Greece as he arrived at the Eurogroup meeting (in German): Away from Brussels and back to some of the people most affected by the current crisis. From Thessaloniki: Vassilis, 48, is exactly the kind of Greek who will be most affected by whatever is or isn\u2019t agreed in Brussels tonight. Today he sells Thessaloniki\u2019s version of the Big Issue on one of the city\u2019s main streets \u2013 the result of losing his job as a truck driver three years ago, and ending up homeless. The deal as it currently stands would bring Vassilis more pain: a huge rise in VAT on food. But perhaps surprisingly, he is in favour of it passing. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote in the referendum,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with difficulty and with pain, I would have voted yes.\u201d A hike in food prices will hurt Vassilis as much as it\u2019ll hurt everyone. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s needed, he claims: the government doesn\u2019t have too many alternative means of levying tax. \u201cOnly the restaurants and cafes are making money,\u201d reckons Vassilis. \u201cWith 50 euros, people will buy food not clothes, and so [the government] doesn\u2019t have any other way of making money.\u201d Apart from slashing public sector salaries, he adds. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do that.\u201d Resignation to more austerity extends even to \u2018no\u2019 voters, people who only a week ago rejected more cuts and debts. \u201cFor the people who don\u2019t have money, the VAT will be an issue,\u201d says Giorgios Voutas, a 56-year-old no-voter who sells rice, nuts and spices in a market in central Thessaloniki. \u201cBut what I\u2019m guessing is that the increase will be absorbed by us sellers \u2013 and we\u2019ll try to make the money back by finding new wholesalers, or reducing the packaging.\u201d As a no-voter, does he feel betrayed by Alexis Tsipras? The prime minister has agreed to more austerity, despite a mandate for the opposite from the electorate. \u201cNo way,\u201d says Voutas, arguing Tsipras tried his best against an intransigent Europe. \u201cThe Europeans aren\u2019t capable of surprising us with something good.\u201d But austerity doesn\u2019t really make any sense, Voutas adds. \u201cWould these European countries like their money back?\u201d he asks. \u201cIn order to find the money to pay them we need investment and economic development \u2013 but when will we see all this?\u201d Here is the Associated Press take on the German finance minister\u2019s tough comments as he arrived for the Eurogroup meeting: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, warned that that Saturday\u2019s meeting of the eurozone\u2019s 19 finance ministers over Greece\u2019s bailout request was going to be tough. Schaeuble, who has taken a hard line on Greece over recent months, says the Greek government will have to do a lot more than just say it wants to reform if it\u2019s going to get the three-year bailout it requested for earlier this week. \u201cWe will definitely not be able to rely on promises,\u201d he said when arriving at the talks in Brussels. Schaeuble put the blame for the current crisis firmly on the shoulders of the radical left Syriza government that was elected in January. The \u201chopeful\u201d situation regarding Greece at the end of last year has been \u201cdestroyed by the last months,\u201d he said. Schaeuble said Saturday\u2019s discussions would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult.\u201d So the tone from finance ministers going into the meeting was that the Greeks have made some progress with their latest proposals, but can they be trusted to implement what they have promised? Given that the Greek government called its referendum and advised voting against the proposals which were then on the table, only to put forward broadly similar plans a few days later, you can understand the scepticism. It almost seemed that if Alexis Tsipras received a euro for every time the word \u201ctrust\u201d was mentioned, Greece\u2019s financial problems would be over immediately. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble of course put it most bluntly, saying trust had been destroyed \u201cin an incredible manner.\u201d But there were plenty of officials trying to keep an open mind, clearly aware that pushing Greece over the brink would be an irreversible step. There were even suggestions that the thorny issue of debt relief was up for discussion, even if reaching an agreement would seem rather unlikely. Still, with the institutions (the EU, ECB and IMF) sounding cautiously positive about the Greek proposals, albeit with some reservations, there is at least the basis for discussion. And they\u2019re off. (Just when we thought Finland\u2019s finance minister was being uncommunicative) Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos said he hoped Greece would not leave the eurozone: And here is German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: In a broadside at the Greeks he said we cannot only rely on promises. Trust has been destroyed over the past months in an incredible manner. Pierre Gramegna, finance minister of Luxembourg which currently holds the EU presidency, said he was \u201cin a lighter heart than two days ago.\u201d We have proposals on the table, which are comprehensive. What can Greece do about the lack of trust? It is important to find out about the concrete steps [which will be taken] and how they are prepared to translate that into legislative initiatives which can be voted for in parliament. Draft bills, the prospect of a vote will build confidence. On debt: We are prepared to discuss debt restructuring today, whether we all agree is another matter. He said the Greek proposals were enough for a second bailout programme but not a third. Slovakia\u2019s Peter Kazimir sees debt sustainability as \u201ca huge problem\u2019. It\u2019s going to be a difficult meeting, says Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. We are not there yet, there is still some criticisms of the proposals, on the fiscal front and the reforms. But there is the issue of trust. Can the Greek government be trusted to do what they are proposing. How can they prove trust? They\u2019ll have to listen to the institutions and show their commitment to implementing [the proposals] And speaking of France. French finance minister Michel Sapin said there were two positive signs, that the Greek government had shown courage and determination in presenting its proposals to parliament, and secondly that the institutions see them as a good basis for discussions. He added that the topic of debt was not taboo: \u201cWe have the right to talk about debt.\u201d Meanwhile the conciliatory tone by France, which helped with the Greek proposals, continues. Reuters reports: A bailout package for Greece needs to include a reduction in the country\u2019s debt burden, French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron told German daily Die Welt in an interview published on Saturday. The German government has resisted a restructuring of Greece\u2019s debts... but Macron insisted the burden must be eased. \u201cIt is necessary to reduce the debt burden so that the Greek economy does not go under,\u201d he told Die Welt. Outlining the path to solving the Greek problem, Macron said structural reforms needed to be deepened, adding: \u201cMore competition doesn\u2019t mean saving more!\u201d Investment was also essential to supporting growth in Greece, said. \u201cNot to try everything possible to keep Greece in the euro zone would be to accept a step backwards in Europe,\u201d Macron said. Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan said: The purpose of the meeting is to kick off negotiations on [an] ESM [bailout]. We are all here with open minds. It is the beginning of negotiations, not about striking a deal tonight. Malta\u2019s finance minister Edward Scicluna said the Greek issue has to be solved today, but he summed up the mood: There are some who are very sceptical, some less so. This doesn\u2019t sound particularly helpful: It\u2019s hard to call how things will go at the Eurogroup meeting, with much talk from the arriving officials of progress being made, but also many calls for the Greek government to actually implement whatever may be agreed. Alexander Stubb, the Finnish finance minister who has taken to tweeting developments, has not been so forthcoming today: More from Noonan\u2019s comments, courtesy of Open Europe: Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said Greece must get on with implementing agreed proposals: It is hard to deliver if your parliamentary majority diminishes. While they have a majority I believe they should move to carry out the legislative changes. [Presumably a reference to those Greek MPs who did not support the proposals in the earlier vote] EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis sounds more positive: We are clearly making progress. The Greek government proposal is pretty much along the lines of what the institutions proposal was before the referendum. There is a willingness on the Greek side to reach an agreement. [But] there are still many issues and many concerns of the member states to be addressed. Today we are discussing giving a mandate to [the EU, ECB and IMF] to start negotiations about an ESM programme. Dutch finance minister Eric Wiebes is taking a fairly tough line: The Greeks have clearly made a step forward. At the same time the institutions have been critical.. the plan is weaker in some areas than it should be. Their suggestion is we can only start negotiations when these conditions are filled in. Many governments including my own [are worried about] implementation. We are discussing a proposal that was rejected [in the referendum]. Clearly there has to be a step made towards restoring trust. What if there is no agreement tonight? That is up to the Greek government. More from Schelling: And again, the emphasis on implementation, this time from Austria\u2019s Schelling (almost as if the finance ministers do not trust the Greeks to do what they say.) (and in the foreground Austrian finance minister Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling). Here\u2019s a video of EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici arriving for the Eurogroup meeting (in French): EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the Greek government had made a significant gesture but it needed to implement reforms: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said, \u201cWe are here to make a lot more progress.\u201d And the finance ministers are starting to arrive. Here is Greece\u2019s Euclid Tsakalotos, keeping his own counsel: If you haven\u2019t yet seen the piece on Alexis Tsipras and Syriza from our economics editor Larry Elliott, it\u2019s well worth a read (spoiler: he says untold damage has been caused to the Greek economy for no purpose whatsoever): The lack of support from some members of his partly for Alexis Tsipras\u2019 proposals in last night\u2019s vote could have repercussions, according to Niki Kitsantonis of Greek newspaper Kathimerini: And the chances of a deal seem to be getting worse by the minute: In Thessaloniki, many Greeks appear resigned to further austerity even though theyi voted against that very thing in last Sunday\u2019s referendum. Patrick Kingsley reports: Clara Sklavounou, a toy-shop owner in central Thessaloniki, might have reason to feel let down. Sklavounou voted no in last week\u2019s referendum \u2013 \u201cno to austerity\u201d, she says \u2013 and yet a week later her parliament has agreed to a deal that many feel is just as austere as what she said no to. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel betrayed,\u201d says Sklavounou, reiterating her backing for Alexis Tsipras. \u201cHe tried to find a viable solution but he couldn\u2019t do anything else, and I hope he stays in government to try to do some of what he set out to do.\u201d Outside her shop there stands a life-size Playmobil pirate. Inside, though, the big, pricier brands like Playmobil and Lego aren\u2019t shifting. And despite the sales of up to 80% in this shopping district, the footfall in her shop is less than half of what she\u2019d expect for the sales season. The new deal, if it becomes the basis of a new bailout, will make matters worse \u2013 raising corporation tax, and making her pay it in advance. \u201cBut what else can we do?\u201d says Sklavanou. \u201cI said no to austerity \u2013 not no to the EU.\u201d This sense of resignation is mirrored by shoppers at AB Vasilopoulos, a well-known supermarket chain down the road. Customers here face a price-hike for food if the deal goes ahead, with VAT on food set to rise to 23%. At the moment, says 50-year-old Fotini Toli as she leaves with a clutch of groceries, \u201cI\u2019m only buying the things that I need to buy, and nothing extra. I don\u2019t know what will happen now.\u201d But like Sklavounou, Toli is resigned to further austerity. \u201cWe have to choose between the bad and the worse,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so we have to prefer the bad.\u201d Hold the optimism. Reuters is reporting two sources saying they are not so sure a deal will be done. With the officials in the Euro Working Group meeting ahead of the gathering of finance ministers, a Reuters source who said late on Friday he was almost sure an agreement would be reached appeared to have had second thoughts: The high figures for financing needs over the next three years may be too high and too sudden. The second source told Reuters he put the chances of reaching an agreement which would allow talks to begin at 60-40. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor says if a deal is to be done, there needs to be a lot of negotiation, and Alexis Tsipras may end up with tougher demands from the troika (the EU, IMF and ECB) than his predecessors: Sky\u2019s Ed Conway confirms that the proposals appear to be the basis for talks: But he adds: Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, continues to make waves. In a piece for the Guardian he has attacked eurozone policies towards Greece and said German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble wanted the country out of the eurozone: Sch\u00e4uble is convinced that as things stand, he needs a Grexit to clear the air, one way or another... Based on months of negotiation, my conviction is that the German finance minister wants Greece to be pushed out of the single currency to put the fear of God into the French and have them accept his model of a disciplinarian eurozone. The full piece is here: And here\u2019s one interesting reaction: Which has prompted a response from the man himself: Here\u2019s the Bild story (in German). The key part suggests German chancellor Angela Merkel wants an agreement but finance minister Sch\u00e4uble \u201cbelieves Athen\u2019s plans are insufficient and is against further talks.\u201d This is not the first time, of course, that talk of a rift between Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble has emerged. The outcome of the day\u2019s Eurogroup meeting is completely open, according to a German finance ministry spokesman. According to Reuters, Frank Paul Weber refused to comment on a story in Germany\u2019s Bild that finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble thought the Greek proposals were inadequate and he opposed further talks. Weber said: The minister this afternoon will discuss with his eurozone colleagues the assessment of the institutions. The result of the discussion is completely open. There is growing talk that Greece will need more that the \u20ac53bn package it is asking for:| And the Wall Street Journal has reported: Greece will need \u20ac74 billion ($82.55 billion) in fresh funding, the three institutions overseeing the eurozone bailout program said in their assessment of the country\u2019s request for a new aid package, according to three European officials. The \u20ac74 billion could include \u20ac16 billion from the International Monetary Fund, should the Washington-based institution decide to participate in the new aid program, the officials said. A fourth official said some funding could come from Greece raising money on debt markets. Not everyone in Greece is overjoyed about the new proposals, of course, especially given that Sunday\u2019s referendum - was it really less than a week ago - had rejected something very similar. Here\u2019s some pictures from yesterday\u2019s rallies as parliament voted: German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine is also reporting that the Greek proposals have been well received by the institutions, and are a basis for discussion but further steps may be needed (full story here in German). The EU, IMF and ECB are \u201ccautiously positive\u201d, says the report but they want any new bailout programme to contain \u201cstructural benchmarks, milestones and quantitative benchmarks\u201d for the future And the reforms are not enough to meet primary budget surplus targets given the \u201csignificant deterioration in macroeconomic and financial conditions.\u201d The Eurogroup has now listed the press conference following the meeting for 22.00 Brussels time (21.00 BST). That seems to indicate a long meeting. A good sign? As a reminder, here\u2019s what is in the latest Greek proposals, and how they differ from what has gone before: And on Sunday there is a meeting of eurozone leaders and a separate gathering of the whole European Union. If there is an agreement today to start loan talks, Sunday\u2019s summit could well be cancelled although leaders may still want to hear more from Alexis Tsipras about his proposals in the wake of the turbulent events of the last few days. However if there is no sign of a possible deal, then the summit is likely to be dedicated to coping with Greece\u2019s removal from the single currency. Here is the formal agenda for Sunday\u2019s get-together: Following up the special Euro Summit on Greece on 7 July, EU leaders will meet again on Sunday 12 July to take stock of the situation and set out the political guidelines for the next steps. On 7 July, leaders from the euro area member states discussed the situation in Greece following the referendum held on 5 July. President Donald Tusk confirmed that the euro area authorities were ready to do all that is necessary to ensure financial stability in the euro area. This is the way the day ahead is looking. Advisers to the finance ministers were due to begin a meeting of the Euro Working Group at 8.00 GMT (9.00 BST) to discuss the Greek proposals. They will pass on their views to the ministers before the Eurogroup meets at 13.00 GMT (14.00 BST). A reminder of the agenda of the Eurogroup: The Eurogroup will discuss the recent request by the Greek authorities for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and their new proposals for a reform agenda. The European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will present their assessment of risk to financial stability in the euro area, Greece\u2019s financing needs and the sustainability of its public debt. Based on this assessment ministers will exchange views on whether there is a sufficient basis to start formal negotiations on a new financial assistance programme for Greece. ESM financial assistance programmes are negotiated by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, on the basis of a mandate by the Eurogroup. When possible, active participation of the IMF is sought. The Eurogroup has confirmed it has received the initial assessment by the institutions - the EU, IMF and ECB - via the spokesman for Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. More details on the reasons for optimism. The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have said the Greek proposals are a basis for negotiation, Reuters is reporting. An unnamed EU official is quoted by the agency as saying: The three institutions have made a first joint assessment of the Greek reform proposals submitted Thursday night. Under certain conditions, they jointly see the proposals as a basis for negotiating an ESM [bailout fund] programme. This assessment was sent to the Eurogroup president last night. Good morning and welcome to what is one of the most crucial weekends since the eurozone crisis began more than five years ago. Finance ministers from the 19 members of the single currency will meet in Brussels later to discuss whether the latest set of Greek proposals are enough to start negotiations on a desperately needed third bailout for the beleaguered country. If they cannot agree, that could be the beginning of the end for Greece as a member of the eurozone, with a summit of EU leaders on Sunday likely to discuss the impact of such a move and how they can deal with the fallout. In that case the European Central Bank would be unlikely to offer any more assistance to Greek banks - which are still shut at the moment - and the country could be plunged into further chaos. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has proposed \u20ac13bn of austerity cuts in return for \u20ac53bn over three years, a plan which effectively amounts to a U-turn after last week\u2019s No vote in the hastily called referendum rejected a pretty similar deal. But late last night Tsipras managed to get the backing of the Greek parliament for his proposals, albeit not without some dissent. After a tense debate 251 MPs out of 300 voted to give Tsipras, and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, the go-ahead to negotiate with the Eurogroup of finance ministers. But two MPs from the governing Syriza party voted no, eight abstained and seven were absent, which could prove a problem for the getting any agreed measures through law at a later stage. Some in the eurozone, notably in Germany, doubt whether they can trust the Greek government to live up to its promises. Even so, Tsipras claimed the backing of parliament gave his a strong mandate to complete negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors towards a viable solution. Here is our report by Ian Traynor and Graeme Wearden of the night\u2019s drama: And there are some signs that the measures may be enough to restart talks, with EU officials saying today there was a basis for negotiations.",

This would leave Greece in limbo for around 3-4 weeks, a development that would raise significant concerns among the lenders and complicate meeting the relevant targets (milestones) attached to the likely sub-tranches of a new bailout.</li> <li>He could decide to tackle decisively the situation by breaking with the dissenters and replacing those MPs who voted \u201cNo\u201d or abstained, including the two ministers and the parliament speaker. This could be achieved by enforcing SYRIZA\u2019s internal rule forcing (on paper) MPs to give up their seats after leaving the parliamentary group.</li> <li>He could seek to enlarge the governing coalition by including one or more of the opposition parties, notably POTAMI and Pasok. The creation of a wider coalition would reassure the lenders but it is, in our view, the least likely of the available options.</li> <li>Finally, he could decide to move cautiously (as he has done in the past) by replacing only the two MPs who voted \u201cNo\u201d, meaning that an unstable balance would prevail in the short-term, at least.</li> </ul> <p>But whatever Tsipras chooses, there\u2019s a high chance of another general election this year, Wolf adds.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a1574de4b05111b7559b12\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-11T17:52:43.682Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek minister: Syriza rebels should resign</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Athens, economy minister Giorgos Stathakis has said he\u2019s confident the government will be able to get parliamentary approval for its reform plans.</strong></p> <p>And he also warned that any Syriza MP who disagrees should resign their seat. </p> <p>Stathakis told Mega TV that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf a lawmaker of a leftist party disagrees with the policies of the government...they should follow the rules and if they strongly disagree resign their seat.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stathakis added that \u201cif it were me, I would resign\u201d. </p> <p>(<em>that\u2019s via Reuters</em>)<br></p> <p>Last night, 17 Syriza MPs either opposed the plan, abstained or were absent during the vote.

Today he sells Thessaloniki\u2019s version of the Big Issue on one of the city\u2019s main streets \u2013 the result of losing his job as a truck driver three years ago, and ending up homeless.</p> <p>The deal as it currently stands would bring Vassilis more pain: a huge rise in VAT on food. But perhaps surprisingly, he is in favour of it passing. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote in the referendum,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with difficulty and with pain, I would have voted yes.\u201d</p> <p>A hike in food prices will hurt Vassilis as much as it\u2019ll hurt everyone. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s needed, he claims: the government doesn\u2019t have too many alternative means of levying tax. \u201cOnly the restaurants and cafes are making money,\u201d reckons Vassilis. \u201cWith 50 euros, people will buy food not clothes, and so [the government] doesn\u2019t have any other way of making money.\u201d Apart from slashing public sector salaries, he adds. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>Resignation to more austerity extends even to \u2018no\u2019 voters, people who only a week ago rejected more cuts and debts. \u201cFor the people who don\u2019t have money, the VAT will be an issue,\u201d says Giorgios Voutas, a 56-year-old no-voter who sells rice, nuts and spices in a market in central Thessaloniki. \u201cBut what I\u2019m guessing is that the increase will be absorbed by us sellers \u2013 and we\u2019ll try to make the money back by finding new wholesalers, or reducing the packaging.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97a29e90461b58b60fcd29f0c8911799cb9af215\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436618512531/1bbc36ae-be23-4a6d-9624-3921aa4d6882-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Giorgios Voutas\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgios Voutas</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kingsley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>As a no-voter, does he feel betrayed by Alexis Tsipras?

Patrick Kingsley reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Clara Sklavounou, a toy-shop owner in central Thessaloniki, might have reason to feel let down. Sklavounou voted no in last week\u2019s referendum \u2013 \u201cno to austerity\u201d, she says \u2013 and yet a week later her parliament has agreed to a deal that many feel is just as austere as what she said no to.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t feel betrayed,\u201d says Sklavounou, reiterating her backing for Alexis Tsipras. \u201cHe tried to find a viable solution but he couldn\u2019t do anything else, and I hope he stays in government to try to do some of what he set out to do.\u201d</p> <p>Outside her shop there stands a life-size Playmobil pirate. Inside, though, the big, pricier brands like Playmobil and Lego aren\u2019t shifting. And despite the sales of up to 80% in this shopping district, the footfall in her shop is less than half of what she\u2019d expect for the sales season. The new deal, if it becomes the basis of a new bailout, will make matters worse \u2013 raising corporation tax, and making her pay it in advance.</p> <p>\u201cBut what else can we do?\u201d says Sklavanou. \u201cI said no to austerity \u2013 not no to the EU.\u201d</p> <p>This sense of resignation is mirrored by shoppers at AB Vasilopoulos, a well-known supermarket chain down the road. Customers here face a price-hike for food if the deal goes ahead, with VAT on food set to rise to 23%. At the moment, says 50-year-old Fotini Toli as she leaves with a clutch of groceries, \u201cI\u2019m only buying the things that I need to buy, and nothing extra. I don\u2019t know what will happen now.\u201d</p> <p>But like Sklavounou, Toli is resigned to further austerity. \u201cWe have to choose between the bad and the worse,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so we have to prefer the bad.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b0e980f96d44a3f5ba1e1930e34f70a9850fda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b0e980f96d44a3f5ba1e1930e34f70a9850fda/0_0_4110_2467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman shopping at the main meat market in Thessaloniki.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman shopping at the main meat market in Thessaloniki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a0ea2ee4b05111b7559a19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-11T10:07:38.982Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hold the optimism.</p> <p>Reuters is reporting two sources saying they are not so sure a deal will be done. </p> <p>With the officials in the Euro Working Group meeting ahead of the gathering of finance ministers, a Reuters source who said late on Friday he was almost sure an agreement would be reached appeared to have had second thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>The high figures for financing needs over the next three years may be too high and too sudden.</p> </blockquote> <p>The second source told Reuters he put the chances of reaching an agreement which would allow talks to begin at 60-40.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a0e933e4b07fc6a121fa04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-11T10:02:50.813Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our Europe editor Ian Traynor says if a deal is to be done, there needs to be a lot of negotiation, and Alexis Tsipras may end up with tougher demands from the troika (the EU, IMF and ECB) than his predecessors:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/statuses/619794545295929344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/greece?src=hash\">#greece</a> 3-page troika paper backs tsipras plan, with ifs and buts...<a href=\"http://t.co/flRjFRqGZR\">http://t.co/flRjFRqGZR</a></p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "With its shuttered banks, furious public protests and iconoclastic politicians, the plight of Greece, brought to its knees by a crippling debt burden, has been gripping and heartbreaking in equal measure: a full-blown sovereign debt crisis on the doorstep of some of the wealthiest countries in the world. Yet new analysis by the Jubilee Debt Campaign reveals that Greece\u2019s plight is far from unique: more than 20 other countries are also wrestling with their own debt crises. Many more, from Senegal to Laos, lie in a debt danger zone, where an economic downturn or a sudden jump in interest rates on world debt markets could lead to disaster. One of the lessons from the 2008 crash was that hefty debt levels can leave countries vulnerable to sudden shifts in market mood. But Jubilee reports that the rock-bottom interest rates across major economies, which have been a key response to the crisis, have in many cases prompted governments, firms and consumers to go on a fresh borrowing binge, storing up potential problems for the future. Judith Tyson of the Overseas Development Institute thinktank says the flipside of the latest round of borrowing has been investors and lenders in the west looking for bigger returns than they could get at home, a process known in the markets as a \u201csearch for yield\u201d. \u201cSince 2012, there\u2019s been a huge increase in sovereign debt, in Africa in particular,\u201d she says. Some of the countries involved were beneficiaries of the debt relief programme that G8 leaders signed up to at the Gleneagles summit in 2005. \u201cThey were given debt relief with the idea that it would give a clean slate to go forward,\u201d Tyson says. She warns that a number of countries have since \u201cloaded up\u201d on debt \u2013 and while some governments had invested the money wisely, diversifying their economies and improving infrastructure, others have not. She points to Ghana, in west Africa, where a sharp increase in borrowing has been spent on what she calls \u201cpork-barrel politics. They\u2019ve spent it in a frivolous way.\u201d Jubilee\u2019s analysis defines countries as at high risk of a government debt crisis if they have net debt higher than 30% of GDP, a current-account deficit of over 5% of GDP and future debt repayments worth more than 10% of government revenue. \u201cWe estimate that 14 countries are rapidly heading towards new government debt crises, based on their large external debts, large and persistent current account deficits, and high projected future government debt payments,\u201d it says. One vulnerable example is Tanzania, a country that suffered a severe debt crisis in the 1990s. In many ways, it has been a success story since receiving international debt relief in 2001 and 2006, allowing repayments to fall from 27% of government revenue to 2%. Child mortality has dropped; fees for primary schools have been abolished; more children are completing their schooling. Yet borrowing has steadily risen since 2009, including from multilateral donors such as the World Bank, which tend to offer aid in the form of cheap loans rather than handouts. It\u2019s a measure of success in some ways that the country managed to raise money from private investors in the capital markets by issuing bonds. But Tanzania\u2019s economic growth, and government revenues, are heavily dependent on exports of gold and precious metal ores, which have fallen in price in recent months. Jubilee\u2019s numbers show that slower than expected growth could see debt repayments shoot up from an expected 10% of government revenue in 2018 to double that \u2013 well into the danger zone. Falling commodity prices as growth in China slows, as well as the strong dollar \u2013 a danger because much of African governments\u2019 borrowing is dollar-denominated \u2013 will create pressures on many other developing countries. Ethiopia, where ministers from around the world will gather this week to discuss how to fund the next wave of international development, is another country whose debt levels have been steadily rising, and which could prove vulnerable. Mongolia, which has welcomed foreign investment to exploit its huge natural resources, including coal, has plans to borrow $1bn over the next year; but with its currency, the tugrik, declining sharply, it could be hit hard if the economic boom of recent years comes to an end. \u201cCurrent levels of lending to impoverished countries threaten to recreate debt crises,\u201d warns Jubilee\u2019s policy officer Tim Jones. But it\u2019s not just in the developing world where low interest rates and the legacy of the crisis have increased the temptation to paper over the cracks with borrowed money. Jubilee found that net cross-border lending worldwide, including the private sector as well as governments, has increased from $11.3 trillion in 2011 to $13.8tn in 2014 \u2013 and forecasts that it will reach $14.7tn this year. That\u2019s a 30% rise in just four years and a sign that the \u201cglobal imbalances\u201d many experts saw as a key cause of the crisis are far from resolved. \u201cThe world is still very out of kilter,\u201d says Russell Jones, economist at Llewellyn Consulting. The lacklustre global recovery has also been a factor in driving up debt levels as policymakers seek to restore pre-crisis living standards. \u201cAll this debt is probably being accumulated because other sources of growth are increasingly in decline,\u201d says Russell Jones. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on governments and central banks to keep things going at the old rate.\u201d As Greece\u2019s government found, debts that seem manageable one day can quickly become unsustainable the next if conditions in financial markets or the economy abruptly shift. Northern Rock, Britain\u2019s bailed-out mortgage bank, made the same discovery in August 2007 when, as its then boss Adam Applegarth put it, \u201cthe world changed\u201d. Many experts believe that if, as expected, the US Federal Reserve starts to increase interest rates from their record low later this year, that could act as the catalyst for a shake-up in global debt markets that could have far-reaching consequences. Tyson points out that many loans taken out by African governments in recent years carry fixed interest rates for five years. When they come to be refinanced, it may have to be at much higher rates. As US rates increase, she says, investors will be keen to pull their money out of smaller emerging economies: \u201cWe will see a sharp reversal of capital flows. Some of these countries are quite fragile.\u201d In its twice-yearly report on the global economy last month, the World Bank warned that developing countries facing up to the prospect of the flood of cheap money being turned off should be \u201choping for the best, preparing for the worst\u201d. Russell Jones says: \u201cWhen the Fed has a very itchy trigger finger, you have the potential for some fairly serious issues.\u201d Countries at high risk of government external debt crisis \u25a0 Bhutan \u25a0 Cape Verde \u25a0 Dominica \u25a0 Ethiopia \u25a0 Ghana \u25a0 Laos \u25a0 Mauritania \u25a0 Mongolia \u25a0 Mozambique \u25a0 Samoa \u25a0 Sao Tome e Principe \u25a0 Senegal \u25a0 Tanzania \u25a0 Uganda Countries currently in government external debt crisis \u25a0 Armenia \u25a0 Belize \u25a0 Costa Rica \u25a0 Croatia \u25a0 Cyprus \u25a0 Dominican Republic \u25a0 El Salvador \u25a0 The Gambia \u25a0 Greece \u25a0 Grenada \u25a0 Ireland \u25a0 Jamaica \u25a0 Lebanon \u25a0 Macedonia \u25a0 Marshall Islands \u25a0 Montenegro \u25a0 Portugal \u25a0 Spain \u25a0 Sri Lanka \u25a0 St Vincent and the Grenadines \u25a0 Tunisia \u25a0 Ukraine \u25a0 Sudan \u25a0 Zimbabwe",

      "body": "<p>With its shuttered banks, furious public protests and iconoclastic politicians, the plight of Greece, brought to its knees by a crippling debt burden, has been gripping and heartbreaking in equal measure: a full-blown sovereign debt crisis on the doorstep of some of the wealthiest countries in the world.</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"http://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/The-new-debt-trap_07.15.pdf\" title=\"\">new analysis by the Jubilee Debt Campaign</a> reveals that Greece\u2019s plight is far from unique: more than 20 other countries are also wrestling with their own debt crises. Many more, from Senegal to Laos, lie in a debt danger zone, where an economic downturn or a sudden jump in interest rates on world debt markets could lead to disaster.</p> <p>One of the lessons from the 2008 crash was that hefty debt levels can leave countries vulnerable to sudden shifts in market mood. But Jubilee reports that the rock-bottom interest rates across major economies, which have been a key response to the crisis, have in many cases prompted governments, firms and consumers to go on a fresh borrowing binge, storing up potential problems for the future.</p> <p>Judith Tyson of the Overseas Development Institute thinktank says the flipside of the latest round of borrowing has been investors and lenders in the west looking for bigger returns than they could get at home, a process known in the markets as a \u201csearch for yield\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince 2012, there\u2019s been a huge increase in sovereign debt, in Africa in particular,\u201d she says. Some of the countries involved were beneficiaries of the debt relief programme that G8 leaders signed up to at the Gleneagles summit in 2005. \u201cThey were given debt relief with the idea that it would give a clean slate to go forward,\u201d Tyson says.</p> <p>She warns that a number of countries have since \u201cloaded up\u201d on debt \u2013 and while some governments had invested the money wisely, diversifying their economies and improving infrastructure, others have not. She points to Ghana, in west Africa, where a sharp increase in borrowing has been spent on what she calls \u201cpork-barrel politics. They\u2019ve spent it in a frivolous way.\u201d</p> <p>Jubilee\u2019s analysis defines countries as at high risk of a government debt crisis if they have net debt higher than 30% of GDP, a current-account deficit of over 5% of GDP and future debt repayments worth more than 10% of government revenue. \u201cWe estimate that 14 countries are rapidly heading towards new government debt crises, based on their large external debts, large and persistent current account deficits, and high projected future government debt payments,\u201d it says.</p> <p>One vulnerable example is Tanzania, a country that suffered a severe debt crisis in the 1990s. In many ways, it has been a success story since receiving international debt relief in 2001 and 2006, allowing repayments to fall from 27% of government revenue to 2%. Child mortality has dropped; fees for primary schools have been abolished; more children are completing their schooling.</p> <p>Yet borrowing has steadily risen since 2009, including from multilateral donors such as the World Bank, which tend to offer aid in the form of cheap loans rather than handouts. It\u2019s a measure of success in some ways that the country managed to raise money from private investors in the capital markets by issuing bonds.</p> <p>But Tanzania\u2019s economic growth, and government revenues, are heavily dependent on exports of gold and precious metal ores, which have fallen in price in recent months. Jubilee\u2019s numbers show that slower than expected growth could see debt repayments shoot up from an expected 10% of government revenue in 2018 to double that \u2013 well into the danger zone.</p> <p>Falling commodity prices as growth in China slows, as well as the strong dollar \u2013 a danger because much of African governments\u2019 borrowing is dollar-denominated \u2013 will create pressures on many other developing countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"337b93472a8030f84d1d8077532eeca50ce95112\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436558360537/0870c816-d361-4361-8c80-84e4062df2b3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A car driving through Addis Ababa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Addis Ababa: Ethiopia\u2019s debt level is steadily rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Cendon/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ethiopia, where ministers from around the world will gather this week to discuss how to fund the next wave of international development, is another country whose debt levels have been steadily rising, and which could prove vulnerable. Mongolia, which has welcomed foreign investment to exploit its huge natural resources, including coal, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-05/mongolia-plans-stake-sale-in-biggest-coal-mine-to-revive-growth\" title=\"\">has plans to borrow $1bn over the next year</a>; but with its currency, the tugrik, declining sharply, it could be hit hard if the economic boom of recent years comes to an end.</p> <p>\u201cCurrent levels of lending to impoverished countries threaten to recreate debt crises,\u201d warns Jubilee\u2019s policy officer Tim Jones.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just in the developing world where low interest rates and the legacy of the crisis have increased the temptation to paper over the cracks with borrowed money. Jubilee found that net cross-border lending worldwide, including the private sector as well as governments, has increased from $11.3 trillion in 2011 to $13.8tn in 2014 \u2013 and forecasts that it will reach $14.7tn this year.</p> <p>That\u2019s a 30% rise in just four years and a sign that the \u201cglobal imbalances\u201d many experts saw as a key cause of the crisis are far from resolved. \u201cThe world is still very out of kilter,\u201d says Russell Jones, economist at Llewellyn Consulting.</p> <p>The lacklustre global recovery has also been a factor in driving up debt levels as policymakers seek to restore pre-crisis living standards.</p> <p>\u201cAll this debt is probably being accumulated because other sources of growth are increasingly in decline,\u201d says Russell Jones. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on governments and central banks to keep things going at the old rate.\u201d</p> <p>As Greece\u2019s government found, debts that seem manageable one day can quickly become unsustainable the next if conditions in financial markets or the economy abruptly shift.</p> <p>Northern Rock, Britain\u2019s bailed-out mortgage bank, made the same discovery in August 2007 when, as its then boss Adam Applegarth put it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/01/credit-crunch-pinpointed-august-2007\" title=\"\">\u201cthe world changed\u201d</a>. Many experts believe that if, as expected, the US Federal Reserve starts to increase interest rates from their record low later this year, that could act as the catalyst for a shake-up in global debt markets that could have far-reaching consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24686223f7cbd33dbf64300627cce1b323ca80f8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436558498706/681d9034-5fbb-4d1c-8612-5e550faf5c6d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mongolian shaman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Mongolian shaman: the country has plans to borrow $1bn over the next year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: How Hwee Young/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tyson points out that many loans taken out by African governments in recent years carry fixed interest rates for five years.

      "bodyText": "Christopher Robinson worked at a charity fundraising call centre earlier this year, but he couldn\u2019t take it for long. The work, he says, was demoralising. There was one man he called who said he\u2019d been rung 10 times already that day. \u201cPeople were getting really fed up with it, and I don\u2019t blame them,\u201d he says. He remembers one call, while trying to raise money for a cancer charity, to a woman who had just been diagnosed with breast cancer and told him she didn\u2019t want to give any more money. He says his supervisor told him he should have pushed it, that she \u201cmight have been more prone to give\u201d. For all the criticism of the tactics used by the callers, and the irritation and guilt trip you will probably have experienced if you\u2019ve ever been called by one begging for money, working at a call centre doesn\u2019t sound much fun. It\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d, says one former worker; it\u2019s \u201csoul-destroying\u201d, says another. When they talk about their experience, they offer an agonised account of the moral complexity of their profession. For without those tactics, the charities that rely on them would be facing a funding shortfall. This week, that moral dilemma was brought to the fore yet again, after a Daily Mail reporter worked undercover at GoGen, one of the biggest charity call centres, which is based in east London. It emerged that on behalf of at least four charities \u2013 Oxfam, the NSPCC, Macmillan and British Red Cross \u2013 they had been ringing people registered with the Telephone Preference Service (which should stop them receiving cold calls), and were accused of calling vulnerable people, including those with dementia. And it\u2019s not the first such example. Charities\u2019 fundraising practices have attracted a lot of attention since the death of Olive Cooke, a 92-year-old poppy seller, in May, with media reports linking her suicide to hundreds of letters and phone calls from charities asking for money, which had left her \u201cexhausted\u201d. But the criticism has been building for much longer. Last year, a Dispatches documentary for Channel 4 went undercover at two call centres, Pell &amp; Bales, which is one of the biggest in the market, and NTT in Bristol, and found staff were encouraged to lie to donors \u2013 about having children, for instance, to \u201chelp the rapport-building\u201d \u2013 and that some people, including one woman with a terminally ill child and another who suffered from depression, were not taken off the call list. Not everyone has been surprised by the claims. \u201cNo one needed to go undercover to see what had been going on,\u201d says Charlie Hulme, managing director of DonorVoice, which advises charities on how to retain supporters. Charities, he says, could have just gone to the call centres to listen to calls (indeed, some do this). The companies \u201cwere doing what they had been asked to do, which is to get as much money out of people as possible. Charities go to call centres and say \u2018we want to get x thousand direct debits\u2019. But clearly they want to keep their costs down as much as possible. The results are inevitable if the pressure is high and the costs are low, what did they think was going to happen?\u201d \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen in documentaries, the practices haven\u2019t changed,\u201d says Chris Willsher, who worked for a fundraising call centre for four months a few years ago. A musician, he says many other musicians and actors were targeted for the work, told they would be able to fit casual shifts in around auditions, and that their creativity was valued. But then, he says, \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to go off script. You have a script on screen on front of you and you click your way through it ... You leave each call really exhausted because you\u2019ve put so much effort in to depressing the person on the other end of the phone as much as you possibly can, just to get some money out of them.\u201d He says each caller\u2019s computer system monitors them, \u201cso as soon as you hang up there is a timer on your screen and it starts counting the amount of time that you\u2019re not making calls. If you want to go to the loo, or grab some water, you\u2019re being monitored and it can go against you in how many shifts you\u2019ll be offered in the future. They expect you to be on the phone constantly.\u201d Amara, who now runs her own business, remembers a male campaign manager standing outside the women\u2019s loos to monitor how long she would be (she says three minutes was considered the acceptable limit). And on the other end of the phone, she would regularly have to put up with abuse. \u201cI do understand people\u2019s frustration, but some of them would say really obscene things, like if I was calling for a charity that raises money for people with cancer, I\u2019d be told: \u2018I really wish you\u2019d get cancer.\u2019\u201d She would have to continue the phone call as long as possible and still try to get a donation. She worked for an agency for three years, first as a fundraiser on the phones, then as a trainer who would monitor the new recruits. \u201cYou have to make the three asks,\u201d she says. Everyone talks about the three asks \u2013 the number of times each fundraiser has to ask a donor for money per call. \u201cYou can hear these people on the phone saying, \u2018Don\u2019t ask me again\u2019. And then you have to teach [the fundraisers] a way that they can put the three asks in.\u201d She says calls were monitored randomly by supervisors, and fundraisers were pulled up on it if \u201cthey didn\u2019t make a strong third ask\u201d. There were answers for every \u201cexcuse\u201d for why people didn\u2019t want to give more money, whether they were unemployed, on a small pension or seriously ill. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because you become desensitised,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening to the fact that this person is hurt, you\u2019re listening to the fact that they\u2019ve had a direct experience [of a disease related to a charity] and they\u2019re going to give me money, and if they don\u2019t give me money, I\u2019m going to get fired. It\u2019s only when you leave at the end of the day with such negative energy that you feel what you\u2019ve done is ethically wrong.\u201d After Olive Cooke\u2019s death, the Fundraising Standards Board (FSB) launched an inquiry into fundraising practices (her family said charities were not to blame for her death, and that she had been suffering from depression; a full inquest is still to be held). \u201cThere have been some serious issues raised and as charities, we are taking that very seriously, and it\u2019s really important that we get things right,\u201d says Alan Gosschalk, director of fundraising for Scope, who is chairing a task group on telephone fundraising. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t want people to feel pressure, we want people to feel inspired to give.\u201d According to the FSB\u2019s most recent complaints report, released this week, in 2014 most complaints about fundraising methods were about direct mail and telephone calls (more than 8,000 people complained about being called at home, and about the tone of the calls). Scope, like most big charities, use call centres. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to fundraise that is more efficient than employing lots of people within the charity. The last thing we want to do is upset people, so we\u2019re taking what has emerged very seriously.\u201d But he adds that phone contact with supporters, and potential supporters, is still a valuable way of engaging with people. \u201cCharities have been using call centres to call people for 25 to 30 years, and there is nothing inherently wrong or unethical in using them,\u201d says Ian MacQuillin, director of Rogare, a fundraising thinktank at Plymouth University. \u201cEthical fundraising has to balance the duty of charities to ask for money to provide resources for their beneficiaries with duties to other stakeholders, including donors. At the moment, we\u2019re seeing a kneejerk rush to shift that balance in favour of protecting the donor, and if you restrict fundraisers\u2019 abilities to ask, you\u2019ll end up damaging the people who everyone wants to serve.\u201d But isn\u2019t it counterproductive to call people, asking for money, annoying them? \u201cAre the people you\u2019re annoying those who are likely to give to you anyway,\u201d he replies. \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask, people don\u2019t give you money. It\u2019s a bit of a myth that people give to charities when they choose to. The whole reason there is a fundraising profession is that people give when they\u2019re asked to do so.\u201d MacQuillin doesn\u2019t think fundraising is becoming more aggressive, but acknowledges competition is fierce and acquisition of new donors is getting harder. One of the popular models to attract new supporters is to run a big campaign asking for \u00a32 a month, but he says that is a loss leader. \u201cYou don\u2019t make money out of a TV advert at \u00a32 a month. What you do is try to upgrade them \u2013 you phone them and try to convert them from \u00a32 a month to \u00a35 a month.\u201d Or more. Nearly half will stop their direct debits within a year, but charities are banking on the others staying longer, and increasing their donations. Sarah, who is in her mid-20s, has worked for GoGen since 2011. She feels much of the criticism is unfair, particularly the idea that every elderly person the charity calls is vulnerable. \u201cThe reality is, not every 91-year-old can help us with a direct debit, but some can, and we\u2019re never going to know unless we call them.\u201d She insists she has never felt uncomfortable about asking someone for money. \u201cWe\u2019re not evil people who are trying to prey on vulnerable people. We are trying to make a living, and some of us have a passion for the work. It\u2019s not your average cold-call centre \u2013 we\u2019re not sitting here trying to sell double-glazing or PPI or whatever. If I make a call for the British Red Cross and I [get someone to give] \u00a310 a month, I know that gift is going to be helping someone.\u201d She is motivated, she says, by a desire to help: \u201cWhen the earthquake in Nepal hit, the moment I heard it had happened, I called [work] and asked if I could pick up a shift. I wanted to be a part of that fundraising.\u201d Others worry about the impact of the negative press \u2013 and any future tough regulation \u2013 on the charities. Oxfam has already suspended telephone fundraising, and Cancer Research UK told the Daily Mail they have stopped their contract with GoGen. \u201cIt has been astonishing to see allegations that any charity, or our organisation, has ever specifically targeted vulnerable or elderly people,\u201d says Philip, a call-centre fundraiser who works at Listen, the company investigated by the Mail on Sunday. \u201cThis is untrue and unfortunately changes public opinion of our work.\u201d He says he enjoys his job \u2013 he has been at the call centre for four years \u2013 but his description of workers\u2019 days sounds tightly controlled: 10 minutes of break time allowed during each three-and-a-half hour shift, with half an hour between shifts for lunch; there are targets set for number of donations, and the average value of donations they bring in is monitored by supervisors. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s for charity, it\u2019s a sales job and a sales environment,\u201d says Alex Love, now a web editor and comedian, who worked for one agency in 2010. \u201cTo do well in sales you\u2019ve got to have a particular mindset.\u201d Of the 20 people he trained with, he was the only one left after a couple of months, and he only lasted a year. He remembers one campaign he worked on where every person he called must have been in their 80s or 90s \u2013 people who gave an annual donation at Christmas, but who he was trying to get to sign up to a regular direct debit. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it again. You\u2019ve got a script in front of you that is carefully crafted to be emotive, and it was just forcing people to part with money.\u201d Some days he says, with a quiet laugh, \u201cyou would just be grateful when there was no one answering the phone\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Christopher Robinson worked at a charity fundraising call centre earlier this year, but he couldn\u2019t take it for long. The work, he says, was demoralising. There was one man he called who said he\u2019d been rung 10 times already that day. \u201cPeople were getting really fed up with it, and I don\u2019t blame them,\u201d he says. He remembers one call, while trying to raise money for a cancer charity, to a woman who had just been diagnosed with breast cancer and told him she didn\u2019t want to give any more money. He says his supervisor told him he should have pushed it, that she \u201cmight have been more prone to give\u201d.</p> <p>For all the criticism of the tactics used by the callers, and the irritation and guilt trip you will probably have experienced if you\u2019ve ever been called by one begging for money, working at a call centre doesn\u2019t sound much fun. It\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d, says one former worker; it\u2019s \u201csoul-destroying\u201d, says another. When they talk about their experience, they offer an agonised account of the moral complexity of their profession.</p> <p>For without those tactics, the charities that rely on them would be facing a funding shortfall. This week, that moral dilemma was brought to the fore yet again, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3151533/Shamed-charity-cold-call-sharks-Britain-s-biggest-charities-ruthlessly-hound-vulnerable-cash-try-opt-receiving-calls.html\">after a Daily Mail reporter</a> worked undercover at GoGen, one of the biggest charity call centres, which is based in east London. It emerged that on behalf of at least four charities \u2013 Oxfam, the NSPCC, Macmillan and British Red Cross \u2013 they had been ringing people registered with the Telephone Preference Service (which should stop them receiving cold calls), and were accused of calling vulnerable people, including those with dementia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/07/charities-investigated-for-calling-vulnerable-people-for-money\">Charities investigated for 'calling vulnerable people for money'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And it\u2019s not the first such example. Charities\u2019 fundraising practices have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/15/olive-cooke-poppy-sellers-death-raises-charity-hounding-concerns\">attracted a lot of attention since the death of Olive Cooke</a>, a 92-year-old poppy seller, in May, with media reports linking her suicide to hundreds of letters and phone calls from charities asking for money, which had left her \u201cexhausted\u201d. But the criticism has been building for much longer. Last year, a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/how-to-stop-your-nuisance-calls-channel-4-dispatches\">Dispatches documentary for Channel 4 went undercover at two call centres</a>, Pell &amp; Bales, which is one of the biggest in the market, and NTT in Bristol, and found staff were encouraged to lie to donors \u2013 about having children, for instance, to \u201chelp the rapport-building\u201d \u2013 and that some people, including one woman with a terminally ill child and another who suffered from depression, were not taken off the call list.</p> <p>Not everyone has been surprised by the claims. \u201cNo one needed to go undercover to see what had been going on,\u201d says Charlie Hulme, managing director of DonorVoice, which advises charities on how to retain supporters. Charities, he says, could have just gone to the call centres to listen to calls (indeed, some do this). The companies \u201cwere doing what they had been asked to do, which is to get as much money out of people as possible. Charities go to call centres and say \u2018we want to get x thousand direct debits\u2019. But clearly they want to keep their costs down as much as possible. The results are inevitable if the pressure is high and the costs are low, what did they think was going to happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen in documentaries, the practices haven\u2019t changed,\u201d says Chris Willsher, who worked for a fundraising call centre for four months a few years ago. A musician, he says many other musicians and actors were targeted for the work, told they would be able to fit casual shifts in around auditions, and that their creativity was valued. But then, he says, \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to go off script. You have a script on screen on front of you and you click your way through it ... You leave each call really exhausted because you\u2019ve put so much effort in to depressing the person on the other end of the phone as much as you possibly can, just to get some money out of them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85add40fdcdd53c7a8f9124913c0dde124602e21\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547552864/83a03d8f-9769-47e1-bd0a-88254c148fab-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A taskforce has been formed to investigate telephone fundraising. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A taskforce has been formed to investigate telephone fundraising.

If you want to go to the loo, or grab some water, you\u2019re being monitored and it can go against you in how many shifts you\u2019ll be offered in the future. They expect you to be on the phone constantly.\u201d</p> <p>Amara, who now runs her own business, remembers a male campaign manager standing outside the women\u2019s loos to monitor how long she would be (she says three minutes was considered the acceptable limit). And on the other end of the phone, she would regularly have to put up with abuse. \u201cI do understand people\u2019s frustration, but some of them would say really obscene things, like if I was calling for a charity that raises money for people with cancer, I\u2019d be told: \u2018I really wish you\u2019d get cancer.\u2019\u201d She would have to continue the phone call as long as possible and still try to get a donation.</p> <p>She worked for an agency for three years, first as a fundraiser on the phones, then as a trainer who would monitor the new recruits. \u201cYou have to make the three asks,\u201d she says. Everyone talks about the three asks \u2013 the number of times each fundraiser has to ask a donor for money per call. \u201cYou can hear these people on the phone saying, \u2018Don\u2019t ask me again\u2019. And then you have to teach [the fundraisers] a way that they can put the three asks in.\u201d She says calls were monitored randomly by supervisors, and fundraisers were pulled up on it if \u201cthey didn\u2019t make a strong third ask\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/may/31/charity-cold-caller-im-the-person-who-dials-your-number\">Charity cold caller: I'm the person who dials your number</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were answers for every \u201cexcuse\u201d for why people didn\u2019t want to give more money, whether they were unemployed, on a small pension or seriously ill. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because you become desensitised,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening to the fact that this person is hurt, you\u2019re listening to the fact that they\u2019ve had a direct experience [of a disease related to a charity] and they\u2019re going to give me money, and if they don\u2019t give me money, I\u2019m going to get fired. It\u2019s only when you leave at the end of the day with such negative energy that you feel what you\u2019ve done is ethically wrong.\u201d</p> <p>After Olive Cooke\u2019s death, the Fundraising Standards Board (FSB) launched an inquiry into fundraising practices (her family said charities were not to blame for her death, and that she had been suffering from depression; a full inquest is still to be held). \u201cThere have been some serious issues raised and as charities, we are taking that very seriously, and it\u2019s really important that we get things right,\u201d says Alan Gosschalk, director of fundraising for Scope, who is chairing a task group on telephone fundraising. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t want people to feel pressure, we want people to feel inspired to give.\u201d According to the <a href=\"http://www.frsb.org.uk/2014-fundraising-complaints-echo-public-concerns/\">FSB\u2019s most recent complaints report, released this week</a>, in 2014 most complaints about fundraising methods were about direct mail and telephone calls (more than 8,000 people complained about being called at home, and about the tone of the calls).</p> <p>Scope, like most big charities, use call centres. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to fundraise that is more efficient than employing lots of people within the charity. The last thing we want to do is upset people, so we\u2019re taking what has emerged very seriously.\u201d But he adds that phone contact with supporters, and potential supporters, is still a valuable way of engaging with people.</p> <p>\u201cCharities have been using call centres to call people for 25 to 30 years, and there is nothing inherently wrong or unethical in using them,\u201d says Ian MacQuillin, director of Rogare, a fundraising thinktank at Plymouth University. \u201cEthical fundraising has to balance the duty of charities to ask for money to provide resources for their beneficiaries with duties to other stakeholders, including donors. At the moment, we\u2019re seeing a kneejerk rush to shift that balance in favour of protecting the donor, and if you restrict fundraisers\u2019 abilities to ask, you\u2019ll end up damaging the people who everyone wants to serve.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"543cd171739a9381302eec5071e4414a5493eb59\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436544601809/fe27b984-0f09-4862-80ee-350bb92749b1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Olive Cooke, Britain's oldest poppy seller, was found at the bottom of Avon Gorge, near Bristol, in May.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olive Cooke, Britain\u2019s oldest poppy seller, was found at the bottom of Avon Gorge, near Bristol, in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But isn\u2019t it counterproductive to call people, asking for money, annoying them? \u201cAre the people you\u2019re annoying those who are likely to give to you anyway,\u201d he replies. \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask, people don\u2019t give you money. It\u2019s a bit of a myth that people give to charities when they choose to. The whole reason there is a fundraising profession is that people give when they\u2019re asked to do so.\u201d</p> <p>MacQuillin doesn\u2019t think fundraising is becoming more aggressive, but acknowledges competition is fierce and acquisition of new donors is getting harder. One of the popular models to attract new supporters is to run a big campaign asking for \u00a32 a month, but he says that is a loss leader. \u201cYou don\u2019t make money out of a TV advert at \u00a32 a month. What you do is try to upgrade them \u2013 you phone them and try to convert them from \u00a32 a month to \u00a35 a month.\u201d Or more. Nearly half will stop their direct debits within a year, but charities are banking on the others staying longer, and increasing their donations.</p> <p>Sarah, who is in her mid-20s, has worked for GoGen since 2011. She feels much of the criticism is unfair, particularly the idea that every elderly person the charity calls is vulnerable. \u201cThe reality is, not every 91-year-old can help us with a direct debit, but some can, and we\u2019re never going to know unless we call them.\u201d She insists she has never felt uncomfortable about asking someone for money. \u201cWe\u2019re not evil people who are trying to prey on vulnerable people. We are trying to make a living, and some of us have a passion for the work. It\u2019s not your average cold-call centre \u2013 we\u2019re not sitting here trying to sell double-glazing or PPI or whatever. If I make a call for the British Red Cross and I [get someone to give] \u00a310 a month, I know that gift is going to be helping someone.\u201d She is motivated, she says, by a desire to help: \u201cWhen the earthquake in Nepal hit, the moment I heard it had happened, I called [work] and asked if I could pick up a shift. I wanted to be a part of that fundraising.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/17/for-olive-cooke-sake-end-charity-cold-calls\">For Olive Cooke\u2019s sake, charities must be less brutal | Lucy Siegle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others worry about the impact of the negative press \u2013 and any future tough regulation \u2013 on the charities. Oxfam has already suspended telephone fundraising, and Cancer Research UK told the Daily Mail they have stopped their contract with GoGen. \u201cIt has been astonishing to see allegations that any charity, or our organisation, has ever specifically targeted vulnerable or elderly people,\u201d says Philip, a call-centre fundraiser who works at Listen, the company investigated by the Mail on Sunday. \u201cThis is untrue and unfortunately changes public opinion of our work.\u201d He says he enjoys his job \u2013 he has been at the call centre for four years \u2013 but his description of workers\u2019 days sounds tightly controlled: 10 minutes of break time allowed during each three-and-a-half hour shift, with half an hour between shifts for lunch; there are targets set for number of donations, and the average value of donations they bring in is monitored by supervisors.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s for charity, it\u2019s a sales job and a sales environment,\u201d says Alex Love, now a web editor and comedian, who worked for one agency in 2010. \u201cTo do well in sales you\u2019ve got to have a particular mindset.\u201d Of the 20 people he trained with, he was the only one left after a couple of months, and he only lasted a year. He remembers one campaign he worked on where every person he called must have been in their 80s or 90s \u2013 people who gave an annual donation at Christmas, but who he was trying to get to sign up to a regular direct debit. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it again. You\u2019ve got a script in front of you that is carefully crafted to be emotive, and it was just forcing people to part with money.\u201d Some days he says, with a quiet laugh, \u201cyou would just be grateful when there was no one answering the phone\u201d.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras is giving his statement following tonight\u2019s vote right now. The Greek PM says that his government has a strong mandate to complete negotiations with its creditors towards a viable solution. The priority now is a positive outcome in the negotiations....everything else comes afterwards. So questions of reshuffles, new coalition partners, fresh elections, unity governments, and all the other rumours flying around will have to wait. But probably not for long. And that means it is time for bed. We\u2019ll be back with a new Greek crisis liveblog in a few hours, to cover the crucial Eurogroup meeting. Thanks for reading, following, and helping - goodnight! GW It\u2019s almost 5am, and journalists are waiting for Tsipras to issue his statement. As we wait, here\u2019s a picture of Alexis Tsipras voting earlier: Well, I was about to knock off, but apparently there\u2019s a statement coming from the Greek PM. So we\u2019d better hang on.... Alexis Tsipras has won crucial approval from the Greek parliament for the \u20ac13bn of austerity measures he is proposing to creditors, to obtain a third bailout programme. After a late-night debate, 250 MPs out of 300 voted to give Tsipras, and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, a mandate to negotiate this weekend. But, two Syriza MPs voted no, eight abstained, and seven were absent, potentially undermining the PM\u2019s authority at a critical time. Before the vote, Alexis Tsipras described the last few months as a war in which difficult battles were fought and some were lost. \u201cNow I have the feeling we\u2019ve reached the demarked line. From here on there is a minefield,\u201d Tsipras also admitted that the package of tax rises and pension reforms do not match the pledges he ran for office on in January. But he pledged that some of the measures would help the economy, eliminate the danger of Grexit, and lead to meaningful discussion on debt relief: \u201cFor the first time, we have on the table a substantial discussion for a debt restructuring.\u201d According to reports, some creditors have decided that Greece\u2019s plan is serious enough to merit discussion on a third bailout Reuters says: EU and IMF officials have given euro zone governments a positive assessment of Greece\u2019s request for a new bailout, a source close to the matter said, making it likely they will agree on Saturday to open talks on lending Athens tens of billions of additional euros. Eurozone finance ministers will discuss the issue at a Eurogroup meeting on Saturday. Diplomats have told the Guardian that there is no guarantee of a third aid package. Grexit is still a serious possibility, they say. And there were protests outside parliament tonight, by groups opposed to a new austerity package. Although the bill has passed with a big majority, 250 out of 300, the big question is how the coalition split. And it appears that only 145 Syriza-ANEL MPs backed the plan, out of 162. Some eight Syriza MPs abstained, two voted no, and seven didn\u2019t turn up. (Under Greek parliamentary law, those seven absentee MPs don\u2019t count as rebels). The scale of the rebellion is a blow to Alexis Tsipras, and raises doubts over his ability to get these measure put into law. BUT, this wasn\u2019t a formal vote of confidence. So you can\u2019t assume that these MPs would rebel on a knife-edge vote that could bring the government down. But analysts are suggesting that this could force a government shake-up. Here\u2019s the official result: 250 MPs voted in favour, 32 against 8 abstained Which means another 10 were absent, I think. Lots of speculation swirling about how close the result was...... Now the influential energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, has abstained! Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party has 149 seats; its coalition partner ANEL has 13, giving 162 votes in the 300-strong parliament. So he can only afford 11 rebels, before he\u2019s relying on opposition MPs to back him. A majority of MPs have now backed the motion - but how many more Syriza MPs will rebel? This is a nailbiter for Tsipras - he\u2019s running the risk of not carrying enough of his own party with him..... Another member of Syriza\u2019s Left Platform (the most radical wing), Costas Lapavitsas, has abstained.... Six rebels have now abstained, raising the possibility that Alexis Tsipras will be dependent on opposition votes to get his plan through... Make that four abstentions from the government ranks: Much excitement when former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is asked to vote (he\u2019s gone off on a family trip) Two government MPs have already abstained..... AND WE\u2019RE OFF. Voting is underway......on whether to give Alexis Tsipras the authority to negotiate with lenders, based on the \u20ac13bn package of measures drawn up yesterday. The clocks have struck 3am in Athens, so we should be close to a vote (hopefully). After that attack on Greece\u2019s creditors, Zoe Konstantopoulou says she will abstain. Zoe Konstantopoulou, the Syriza MP and House speaker, is now accusing Greece\u2019s lenders of blackmail, and criticising Germany for not making war reparations. There was speculation earlier that she might defy Alexis Tsipras and oppose the reform plan. The Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party are claiming tonight\u2019s vote is unconstitutional, so we may have to wait longer for a result.... Over to Reuters, to explain how Greece\u2019s creditors have given a positive assessment of the bailout request: EU, IMF give thumbs up to Greek bailout request -source EU and IMF officials have given euro zone governments a positive assessment of Greece\u2019s request for a new bailout, a source close to the matter said, making it likely they will agree on Saturday to open talks on lending Athens tens of billions of additional euros. Experts from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund spent Friday reviewing the Greek case for aid and proposals for economic reforms from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that will be conditions for any loans. The positive evaluation, along with a conclusion that Athens currently needs some \u20ac74bn to meet its obligations, will form a key part of discussions among euro zone finance ministers when they meet in Brussels at 3 p.m. (2pm BST). With Greek banks shut and subject to capital controls for the past week, failure to agree a new programme following five months of abortive negotiations had threatened effectively to force Greece out of the 19-state currency area, alarming EU leaders who have scheduled an emergency summit for Sunday. One euro zone source, who has been sceptical of the leftist government\u2019s commitment to a new reform programme, said it was now \u201c100 percent certain\u201d the ministers would agree to launch negotiations. In the meantime, they will also consider short-term aid to tide Athens over until the three-year loan deal that Tsipras requested has been agreed and funds can be disbursed. Euro zone officials also expect to discuss Greek requests for some of its outstanding debt, currently worth some 175 percent of its GDP, to be rescheduled, although the creditor governments insist they cannot legally write any off entirely. Germany, which has contributed more to the previous two Greek bailouts since 2010 than any other country, sounded wary on Friday after Tsipras submitted proposals broadly similar to terms that Greek voters rejected in a referendum last Sunday. But France, Greece\u2019s strongest supporter among the euro zone\u2019s major powers, rushed to offer praise. President Francois Hollande called the offer of reforms \u201cserious and credible\u201d. Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of his euro zone peers and also the board of the European Stability Mechanism, which would provide any loans to Greece, described Tsipras\u2019s proposals as a \u201cthorough piece of text\u201d but he declined to go into specifics on Friday. Elected in January to end the austerity that has accompanied previous rescue programmes, Tsipras sought parliamentary backing for a new deal in a debate that is continuing into the early hours of Saturday. The vast majority of Greeks want to keep the euro. Michael Michaelides, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group, is also concerned that a deal may not come on Saturday: He told clients: \u201cOur concern has always been the hardening position of Germany and Netherlands in the negotiations,\u201d \u201cA deal, whilst now more likely, is not quite nailed.\u201d Now Fofi Gennimata, head of the left-wing Pasok party, speaks. She warns that Tsipras\u2019s \u201cbizarre and dangerous\u201d negotiations have put Greece at risk, but confirms that her party will support the proposal. Here\u2019s how Panos Kammenos explained why the Independent Greeks would back the plan: \u201cWe are going against what our conscience dictates, we are going against our public mandate ... with a heavy heart we will vote to not allow others to return on Monday with the same measures,\u201d Despite those misgivings, Kammenos says his Independent Greeks party will back the austerity proposals. That suggests the package will definitely get voted through tonight, given the ND, To Potami and Pasok opposition parties are also going to back it. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn (3rd largest in parliament) has refused to support the plan; I\u2019m sure Alexis Tsipras won\u2019t miss their votes though. Panagiotis Kammenos, leader of the Independent Greeks (Tsipras\u2019s junior coalition partner) has the floor. He claims Greece\u2019s creditors are using the euro as \u201ca stick\u201d to hit Greece with. Kammenos criticises tonight\u2019s austerity package, saying it contains \u201ctough measures\u201d that will hit Greece\u2019s shipping industry, its farmers, ordinary workers. And he claims that he\u2019s not afraid of Greece\u2019s exit from the euro; but suggests the threat of social breakdown is a worry. That may mean he\u2019s a reluctant Yes.... Greece is the splash in Saturday\u2019s Guardian: Back in the Athens parliament, communist leader Dimitris Koutsoumbas says his KKE party won\u2019t back the proposals (not a surprise). Full marks to Stavros Theodorakis, leader of the centrist To Potami party, whose speech tonight lasts barely half a minute. He had a simple message - we need a deal, so go and get it. Reuters is also reporting that Greece\u2019s creditors have made a \u2018positive\u2019 initial assessment of the austerity plan (you can see full details here) Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech, urging MPs to support his austerity programme in the national interest, is now online: As flagged up earlier, this deal is NOT done yet. AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp has heard that it\u2019s a 50-50 shout; Greece still has serious work to do to persuade some eurozone neighbours. That includes the bigger, and most powerful, member whose verdict will ultimately determine how this crisis plays out. HEADS-UP. Greece\u2019s lenders have kicked the tires of the new austerity programme, and they\u2019re not unimpressed. AFP has the story: Greece\u2019s international creditors believe its latest debt proposals are positive enough to be the basis for a new bailout worth 74 billion euros, an EU source said Friday. \u201cThere has been positive evaluation of the Greek programme,\u201d the source said, with the EU\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism ready to consider putting up \u20ac58bn plus \u20ac16 bn from the International Monetary Fund for a new debt rescue. That suggests that Saturday\u2019s crucial Eurogroup meeting could pave the way towards a third aid programme, rather than Grexit.... The interim leader of the New Democracy party, Vangelis Meimarakis, now has the stand. He blames Tsipras for creating the crisis; no other leader has brought Greece within three days of being thrown out of Europe. ND are still backing Tsipras, though. The message is: with our support, go to Brussels and bring home a deal: Fighting talk from Alexis Tsipras; Tsipras says he hopes Greece has reached the end of a very difficult battle that has scarred the country\u2019s recent history. When he can get a word in, Tsipras is making the key point that the issue of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability is finally on the table. He says: \u201cFor the first time, we have on the table a substantial discussion for a debt restructuring.\u201d With tensions high, former Greek deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos begins yelling at Tsipras. Prime minister Tsipras is arguing that, by backing his austerity plan, Greece can put the threat of Grexit behind it, and start the process of growth and investment. I did the best I could, argues Alexis Tsipras: And Tsipras also points out that it wasn\u2019t he who claimed Greece was voting whether to stay, or leave, the eurozone. Alexis Tsipras begins by admitting that he has made mistakes in the negotiating process. And he concedes that the offer has many differences from his pre-election promises (indeed!) We negotiated as long as we could, and are now looking to avert a \u201cpolitical\u201d Grexit. But there are are pitfalls ahead. Euclid Tsakalotos, the new finance minister, introduces the bill. He reminds MPs that the IMF was prompted to release its debt sustainability analysis after last Sunday\u2019s referendum was called. We\u2019re in a better position than before the referendum, he argues, but concedes that the austerity programme on the table will hurt growth. You can watch the debate here: And they\u2019re off! Greek MPs are finally debating the bailout plan. Result, with any luck, in 3 hours. Greece\u2019s capital controls will remain in place at least until Monday, and possibly rather longer than that. So local readers should check out this guide by journalist Omaira Gill on how to keep accessing ATMs as safely and easily as possible: The real opprobrium this evening has been left for former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis whose unexpected take of leave, on such an important occasion, has caused outrage among his fellow MPs. Accusing the academic-turned-politician of leading Greece to this place - where it has been left staring into the abyss of euro exit, its banks closed, capital controls enforced - the Pasok MP Andreas Loverdos told SKAI TV. \u201cYanis Varoufakis was the worst finance minister this country had since the restoration of democracy in 1974. The fact that he has preferred to get on a boat and go to Aegina [the Saronic Gulf island 16 miles north of Athens] for family reasons is totally unacceptable and shows just how superficial he is.\u201d The Greek government produced a statement saying Varoufakis had written the president of the parliament a letter explaining that he could not be present \u201cfor family reasons.\u201d It says: \u201cIn fact he makes it clear he supports the government, and if he were present would vote \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d And here\u2019s the reason we are facing a long night, from our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith. It may be the most important vote in recent modern Greek history but the president of the parliament, Zoe Konstantopoulou, has decided its 300 members will have to wait. A stickler for following the rules, the young Konstantopoulou is insisting that as the bill is being fast-tracked parliament will have to convene on two consecutive days. As lawmakers were waiting for the session to begin, the fiery leftist called a meeting of parliamentary vice presidents to explain the situation. The meeting is still ongoing. Sources are saying that as a result the chamber will not start debating until one minute past midnight. The vote is expected to take place around 4 AM (2am BST) although if MPs are feeling loquacious, ballots may not be cast until around 6am (4am BST) Konstantopoulou\u2019s formalism is causing waves with several MPs criticising the move on television tonight. With the eyes of the world now focused on Athens, they want to endorse the proposed reforms ASAP. Quite. It\u2019s going to be a late night, guys... It\u2019s important to remember that Greece hasn\u2019t actually agreed anything with the eurozone. And there\u2019s no guarantee of success this weekend. As one eurozone official told our Ian Traynor: \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic,\u201d \u201cThere are too many problems, not enough time, too many people who do not believe the Greeks will deliver their side of the bargain.\u201d An EU diplomat said eurozone creditors were very fed up with \u201cfive months of manipulation\u201d by the Greek side and worried whether or not Tsipras would really push through the reforms demanded by creditors. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they say, they will never do it.\u201d Here\u2019s Ian\u2019s scene-setter for a dramatic weekend, possibly historic, weekend ahead: Another poll has shown that just over 60% of Greeks favour a new bailout programme; coincidentally, the same percentage that voted NO last week. More than half of Greeks fear the impact of leaving the eurozone, according to a poll tonight: Exactly a week ago, tens of thousands of passionate no campaigners packed out Syntagma Square, in a huge demonstration calling for Greece to reject its creditors demands. It\u2019s a different picture tonight: The FT has launched an profile of Alexis Tsipras tonight, outlining how a pragmatic leader has morphed into a hardliner, to Brussels\u2019 growing annoyance: Until: For months, eurozone officials assumed Mr Tsipras was simply attempting to maximise concessions before he struck a deal. But some now believe the brinkmanship has always been a way to exit the binding constraints of the euro while blaming European authorities if Grexit goes wrong. I guess we\u2019ll find out on Saturday whether Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble really wants Grexit, or whether the blame lies elsewhere..... In the Guardian tonight, Yanis Varoufakis argues that German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been leading a cabal of eurozone countries who want Greece kicked out: That, the former finance minister says, is why they refused to engage with the debt restructuring issue which is vital to Greece\u2019s recovery. After the crisis of 2008/9, Europe didn\u2019t know how to respond. Should it prepare the ground for at least one expulsion (that is, Grexit) to strengthen discipline? Or move to a federation? So far it has done neither, its existentialist angst forever rising. Sch\u00e4uble is convinced that as things stand, he needs a Grexit to clear the air, one way or another. Suddenly, a permanently unsustainable Greek public debt, without which the risk of Grexit would fade, has acquired a new usefulness for Schauble. What do I mean by that? Based on months of negotiation, my conviction is that the German finance minister wants Greece to be pushed out of the single currency to put the fear of God into the French and have them accept his model of a disciplinarian eurozone. Here\u2019s the full piece: After days of putting pressure on Europe, the US government has welcome the news that Greece has submitted new reform plans. It\u2019s not celebrating yet, though. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: \u201cWe are pleased to see that Greece has taken the step of putting forward a specific proposal, but it\u2019s one that their creditors will have to evaluate.\u201d Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has been spied on a boat, heading away from Athens (reminder, he\u2019s already showed support for the government\u2019s proposal). And Varoufakis hit back against criticism on social media ; he is spending time with his daughter (who lives in Australia) Perhaps Yanis could also explain to islanders why their low VAT rates are to be abolished, despite his best efforts... The actual rally in Athens looks quite peaceful: And well-attended: Riot police have scuffled with protesters at tonight\u2019s anti-austerity rally in central Athens: Greek media are reporting that the Left Platform of Syriza will support the reform plan in tonight\u2019s vote, despite their misgivings over piling fresh austerity on Greece. That raises the chances that Tsipras gets the deal though, without losing his own majority: More on the rally, from Emma Graham-Harrison in Athens: Hundreds of marchers at a \u201cno\u201d rally, many carrying the flag of communist trade union PAME are marching though Syntagma square in front of parliament. \u201cThey took the no and made it a yes\u201d said protestor Giorgos Tsolakas, 34. \u201cI don\u2019t support Tsipras, I support the no, because I believe there is no future for us, the youth and workers\u201d Meanwhile an anti-austerity rally has been taking place in Athens, as parliament debates the new Greek proposals to its creditors. There are few red lines in the quest to keep Greece in the eurozone for years to come, but nominal debt reduction is one of them, according to Slovakian finance minister Peter Kazimir . Writing in the Financial Times (\u00a3) he said his government\u2019s preference was not to eject any country from the eurozone. And he warned of two dangers in the background: \u201cprotracted chattering and political bickering without reforming action\u201d and, even after resolving the current crisis, how to reinvent the European project to make sure the same problems do not recur. Stock markets have moved sharply higher on optimism that Greece\u2019s new proposals can form the basis of a deal with its creditors to avoid the country being ejected from the eurozone: The FTSE 100 finished 1.39% higher at 6673.38 Germany\u2019s Dax has climbed 2.9% to 11,315.63 France\u2019s Cac has closed up 3.07% at 4903.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has added 3% to 22,937.40 Spain\u2019s Ibex has ended up 3.08% to 11,036.1 Meanwhile on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 1.28% or 224 points higher. On the bond markets, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese yields fell back between 4 and 7 basis points. Greek ten year yields fell 5 percentage points while the two year dropped 25 basis points. More from Tsakalotos courtesy of Nick Malkoutzix, deputy editor of Greek daily Kathimerini: Tsakalotos also said the European Central Bank exerted pressure on the eurozone countries to find a solution to the crisis in the last month (quote from Reuters). Here is Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos addressing parliament now: Greek banks have a cushion of around \u20ac750m, enough to last until Monday night, a senior Greek banker has told Reuters. But they will need \u20ac10bn to \u20ac14bn of fresh capital to keep them afloat, the banker told Reuters, even if a deal is reached with the country\u2019s creditors over the weekend. Earlier Moody\u2019s had suggested the banks could run out of deposits by Sunday. The ratings agency said: Bank deposits could run out by Sunday because of outflows. With emergency liquidity assistance from the Eurosystem frozen at \u20ac89 billion, we estimate that Greek banks have limited headroom to deal with daily deposit outflows (estimated at between \u20ac100-150 million) and will likely exhaust their liquidity resources in the coming days. Policymakers from the European Central Bank have also hinted that, in the absence of any agreement by Sunday, the ECB may curtail ELA, rather than just keeping it at the current level. We expect banks\u2019 asset quality to deteriorate significantly and for the banks to require recapitalisation, with or without a third bailout. And even when the banks re-open capital controls could still be kept in place: So it could all get very tight: However: Yanis Varoufakis may not be in parliament for the vote but he has shown his support for his successor Euclid Tsakalotos in tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: Which seems to roughly translate as Tomorrow Euclid deserves the support of us all. My own has in full. Then we will evaluate the effect. The YouGov poll also shows that support in Germany for a Grexit is falling. A month ago 59% of Germans wanted Greece to leave the eurozone but that number has now fallen below 50% for the first time since February, and opposition is at a high of 37%. The full results are here: Greece: Germans and Finns back a hard line, but support for Grexit wanes Some interesting results from a YouGov poll on attitudes towards Greece, which shows the British and French much more sympathetic than Germany or the Nordic states. Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite is sounding a cautious note. Reuters reports her comments to reporters: It is probably too early to evaluate [the proposals] because they are based on old information and it seems those proposals will really not be enough. We take the document of proposals as [indicating] Greece\u2019s wish to go back to the negotiating table. It\u2019s too early to start guessing how the negotiations will end. Here\u2019s the formal agenda for Saturday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: The Eurogroup will discuss the recent request by the Greek authorities for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and their new proposals for a reform agenda. The European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will present their assessment of risk to financial stability in the euro area, Greece\u2019s financing needs and the sustainability of its public debt. Based on this assessment ministers will exchange views on whether there is a sufficient basis to start formal negotiations on a new financial assistance programme for Greece. ESM financial assistance programmes are negotiated by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, on the basis of a mandate by the Eurogroup. When possible, active participation of the IMF is sought. Here\u2019s a nice chart showing the looming repayments which face Greece. The ECB looks particularly looming: Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament who laid into Alexis Tsipras on Wednesday and saw his attack go viral, seems a little more consiliatory now. He tweeted earlier: And it\u2019s not just France that deserves some credit if a deal is done, apparently: The US and Russia have both been voicing their views on the latest developments in Greece. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew said both sides needed to rebuild trust, but a deal did appear closer and the position was better than just a couple of days ago. He said it was critical Greece took the difficult steps necessary, including structural reform. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s president Putin said he hoped the crisis would be resolved soon, and confirmed once more that Greece had not asked for financial aid. Reuters reports: Implying criticism of the European Union\u2019s handling of the crisis, he asked at a news conference in the Russian city of Ufa where the EU had been when problems were accumulating in Greece. How do the latest set of Greek proposals differ from those on the table when negotiations were abandoned nearly two weeks ago? Here we take a look at the differences: Yanis Varoufakis will apparently not be at today\u2019s vote: If a deal to keep Greece in the eurozone fails, and the country leaves the single currency, it would need up to \u20ac33bn in transitional funding to help support its economy, according to Open Europe. Up to \u20ac1.84bn of this could come from the UK, which would not go down well with the UK\u2019s eurosceptics ahead of a referendum. Open Europe\u2019s Raoul Ruparel writes: Open Europe estimates that, in terms of bare essentials, Greece could need between \u20ac18bn and \u20ac33bn in transitional funding to help support its economy after Grexit. This would cover things such as certain debt payments, some deficit funding and money to bolster reserves to aid in managing the new currency. It does not include the cost of bank recapitalisation which might be managed via nationalisation. If money was needed for this the cost could jump by tens of billions. Of course, there would be much wider costs to Grexit to both the Eurozone and Greece in terms of economic decline, contagion and Greek default on direct Eurozone exposures. This money is unlikely to be provided entirely by the Eurozone. Open Europe expects it could be split equally between the Eurozone, the EU and the IMF. The Eurozone could provide funds bilaterally while the EU would utilise either the Balance of Payments assistance facility or the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism. From the UK perspective this could mean underwriting shares of between \u20ac1bn and \u20ac1.84bn. While the cost of transitional funding should be predominantly shouldered by the Eurozone, there is a geopolitical and humanitarian case on the part of other EU members for helping stabilise Greece and keep it inside the EU. Furthermore, with a default and devaluation there might be more hope of these loans being repaid by Greece. The full report is here: How much financial help might Greece need under Grexit? A quick recap. Greece is inching closer to agreeing a third bailout deal that would avert bankruptcy and preserve its place in the eurozone, but it\u2019s not a done deal yet. Alexis Tsipras has urged his party to support the \u20ac13bn of austerity measures proposed late last night, which broadly match the policies which he refused to accept in the protracted battle with creditors. The Greek prime minister told MPs that: We are confronted with crucial decisions. \u201cWe got a mandate to bring a better deal than the ultimatum that the Eurogroup gave us, but certainly not given a mandate to take Greece out of the eurozone. We are all in this together.\u201d Five MPs have said they will rebel, but the plan will be approved at a vote - probably late tonight - as opposition parties are supporting it. The heads of Greece\u2019s creditors have discussed the plan by phone, but no details of the call have leaked (yet). France has thrown its weight behind the plan -- reflecting its strong desire to keep Greece in the eurozone (and the fact French officials helped with the plan). But Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has questioned whether Greece has delivered enough, while Latvia\u2019s PM isn\u2019t sure that their parliament would approve a bailout. Angela Merkel faces a tough fight getting a deal through the Bundestag, says the joint CEO of the Berlin stock exchange. And Michael Fuchs, deputy parliamentary floor leader of Merkel\u2019s CDU party, has said it\u2019s hard to trust the Greek proposal. Tsipras also faces criticism for proposing measures which he spent months opposing: One Greek newspaper says the country has reached its \u2018day of judgement\u2019. Another hopes that the European Central Bank might offer more emergency liquidity, to allow its banks to reopen. Here\u2019s our round-up. Eurozone finance ministers will meet on Saturday to evaluate the proposal. That meeting will be crucial to deciding whether Greece gets a third bailout. If they give the thumbs down, then EU leaders will gather on Sunday to plan for Greece\u2019s exit from the single currency. Over in Thessaloniki, young voters have told us they are still proud of last Sunday\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d vote, even though Tsipras now appears to be saying \u201cYes\u201d to lenders. Greek islands are facing up to the prospect of higher VAT rates, which could hurt tourism. And European stock markets have continued to surge, as the chances of Greece leaving the single currency and default recede. France\u2019s CAC has soared over 3%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains. \u201cEquities are handsomely positive this morning thanks to Greece delivering what appears to be a more promising set of reforms proposals required to unlock the \u20ac53.5bn bailout it needs to secure its future within the Eurozone. A potential softening of neighbouring (read German) rejection on Greek debt relief after international pressure is also helping as is a second day of gains in China, reversing some of the recent rout. The largest opposition party, New Democracy has declared that it \u2018authorises\u201d Alexis Tsipras to reach a deal to keep Greece in the euro. I suspect *that* time will come soon enough.... The French ambassador to the US has no doubts about where the credit should go if a compromise is reached by the two sides: Meanwhile Fitch has said an eventual exit from the eurozone is now the probable outcome for Greece: [The ratings agency\u2019s global head of sovereigns] James McCormack, says the referendum\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 vote was a defining moment, providing a substantial boost to the position of the Syriza-led government in its negotiations with creditors. However, Greece may have miscalculated: \u201cGreece\u2019s strong argument in favour of greater accommodation on the part of creditors faces several hurdles that are likely to prove collectively insurmountable. The referendum might have tipped the balance of how other eurozone countries weigh the risks of Greece\u2019s continued membership in the common currency area versus its exit, but this may become clear only once the history is written.\u201d Greek\u2019s banks could run out of deposits by Sunday, according to ratings agency Moody\u2019s. Meanwhile Reuters is reporting that the European Central Bank is likely to hold a telephone conference on Monday to discuss emergency liquidity assistance to Greece\u2019s banks. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said he is waiting for a technical analysis of the latest Greek proposals before commenting on its content (courtesy Reuters). Busy, busy as the last ditch talks continue. Here\u2019s the Finnish finance minister: Non-stop? Still enough time to tweet, it seems.. Artur Fischer, the joint CEO of the Berlin Stock Exchange has just told Kate Connolly in Berlin about the huge domestic consequences a third bailout might have for Merkel. \u201cThis is the toughest time in her chancellorship so far. Can she resist the voices of opposition within her own party to push through a third bailout in the Bundestag that most of them are against?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe is facing huge internal difficulties that have the potential to end her chancellorship.\u201d He told The Guardian that no one involved in politics or finance in Berlin was taking a summer break \u201cor else they\u2019re not going far so that they can get back quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause no one expects this to be over soon.\u201d If a bailout were to be on the cards, it is likely the Bundestag would vote on it early next week, he said. \u201cBut then it has to be agreed on amongst all the parties and we\u2019re looking at another two weeks\u201d. He added that the Greek government\u2019s \u201cwilly nilly\u201d attitude to agreeing to new proposals, including setting the referendum, had set the country back even further, citing the number of Greek businesses that have and will go to the wall as a result of the banks having been closed. \u201cThe Greek government has destroyed a huge amount of value over the past few months, which has not been factored in.\u201d\u201dIn my mind it has lost all its credibility,\u201d he said. Germans, Fischer added, have been willing to back previous bailouts for Greece, but had the feeling that the money had gone no where. \u201cThere are many cultural differences at play here, including the fact that we Germans hate uncertainty. We invent a DIN Norm (or standard) for everything, including chairs, to ensure they will fit under tables, we like that certainty so much. That love of certainty means I always turn up at a meeting on time. So we don\u2019t like throwing money at something not knowing where it\u2019s going.\u201d And here are the five holdouts: Greece\u2019s new austerity plan is being discussed at committee level now, and some MPs are unhappy: There are around 40 MPs in the Left Platform, the more radical left-wing of Syriza, so only losing 5 votes would be quite a triumph for Tsipras.... Other MPs have warned that Greece isn\u2019t in a position to rupture from Europe. There is an interesting take in today\u2019s Bild as to why US President Barack Obama is taking such an interest in the Greek crisis, apparently calling Merkel and Tsipras on a regular basis, out of fear of the impact on the global economy and even global security that a Grexit might have, writes Kate Connolly in Berlin. The German tabloid quotes a top German diplomat who explains why the US is so flummoxed over why Greece - which after all has an economy about the size of Tennessee\u2019s - is considered such a headache in Europe. \u201cViewed from Washington, it\u2019s to do with keeping on feeding a cute little animal with peanuts,\u201d the diplomat said. It goes on to quote German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who said yesterday that: \u201cI offered to my friend Jack Lew (his US counterpart) that we would take Puerto Rico into the Eurozone, if the USA took Greece into the Dollar Union. He thought I was joking\u201d. Former Germany ambassador to Washington, Wolfgang Ischinger told the paper: \u201cIt\u2019s easy for President Obama to advise us to save Greece. It\u2019s the Europeans who have to bear the costs, not the USA.\u201d Debt campaigners have been reminding Germany that Greece needs meaningful debt relief: The IMF\u2019s outgoing chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, has published a defence of the Fund\u2019s role in the Greek bailout saga. It includes a pop at the eurozone for ignoring the need for Greek debt relief: Until the referendum and its potential implications for growth, we believed that, under these assumptions about the primary surplus, debt sustainability could be achieved through the rescheduling of existing debt, and long maturities for new debt. This was reflected in the preliminary debt sustainability analysis (DSA) we put out before the referendum. Our assessment was seen as too pessimistic by our European partners to whom we had communicated our views about the need for debt relief long before publishing the debt sustainability analysis. We believe that current developments may well imply the need for even more financing, not least in support of the banks, and for even more debt relief than in our DSA. Blanchard gives rather less attention to ghastly forecasting record of Greece\u2019s lenders, arguing: The decrease in output was indeed much larger than had been forecast. Multipliers were larger than initially assumed. But fiscal consolidation explains only a fraction of the output decline. Output above potential to start, political crises, inconsistent policies, insufficient reforms, Grexit fears, low business confidence, weak banks, all contributed to the outcome. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister isn\u2019t convinced (yet, anyway) that Greece\u2019s reforms plan is solid enough to deliver a deal: Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr also has misgivings over Athens\u2019 ability to deliver these proposals: The view from Latvia has been expressed by prime minister Laimdota Straujuma, speaking on state broadcaster Deutschlankfunk (dlf.de) this morning. Straujuma said that the Latvian parliament would have to vote on any new bailout. It would be the first time it had been directly involved, as during bailouts 1 and 2, the country was not yet part of the Euro. She told DLF she would have difficulty persuading her parliament to support such a move. \u201cIt will be very hard for me to persuade the parliament. And for the parliament it will be difficult to vote for it, because the average Pension in Latvia is considerably less than in Greece, and if you were to ask the Latvians today whether they are willing to lend money to Greece, you can probably guess what their answer would be.\u201d Straujuma said that discussions with her counterparts in the other Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania - all of whom have gone through extensive periods of austerity and reform implementation - had shown they were of the same opinion. \u201cAt the moment I see no reason for Latvia to give money to Greece,\u201d Straujuma said, adding: \u201cHumanitarian aid is another matter. If money is needed for Greek hospitals or for medicines, the Latvians will help. Greece is an EU member, but it\u2019s the Greek government that is responsible for what happens\u201d. In the Czech Republic, there are deep-seated anxieties that the Greek crisis could unleash old Cold War tensions. Writing in the leading financial daily, Hospodarsky Noviny, leading commentator Daniel Anyz explains the geopolitical dimensions of the crisis, and the consequences of Grexit. \u201c(Russian president Vladimir) Putin needs very little imagination to consider what an exit of Greece from the Eurzone would trigger. The feeling of bitterness towards Europe would deepen and Greece would move a step closer towards Russia.\u201d Anyz says that Greece could alter its behaviour on the world stage, according to how the crisis is dealt with. \u201cWould Athens change its view on the sanctions against Russia? Would Greece continue to support Nato military operations? Would it still allow the military ships of its partner countries into its harbours? \u201cA Grexit would play right into Putin\u2019s hands. Greece would turn into an extremely problematic European partner with separatist tendencies. Then it\u2019ll be even harder to find consensus in Nato on important decisions.\u201d More here: Grexit by \u0158ecko p\u0159ibl\u00ed\u017eil Putinovi Back in Athens, Syriza MPs are arguing that Greece should hunker down, and live to fight another day. Angelique Chrisafis has been speaking to young No voters in Thessaloniki about the latest bailout proposals: In Greece\u2019s northern second city, where younger Greeks mainly voted No in Sunday\u2019s referendum on a bail-out deal, many people in their 20s have come to see themselves as a lost generation whose adult lives have been dominated by austerity. With a youth unemployment rate in the city that has reached 65%, there are few job prospects and many face living with parents and relatives for years to come. Among some young No voters in the city this morning, there was a feeling that there was still a lot to play for and much bargaining to be done in Brussels before a deal shaped up. Many felt that now that Greeks\u2019 voice had been heard with the No vote, any austerity measures \u2014 which many felt had always been inevitable \u2014 could be tempered by debt-relief in a more favourable package. Christos, 27, who had a Masters degree in transport engineering, was standing at the bar of the coffee-shop where he had managed to get a job after graduating. He was lucky as many of his engineer friends were unemployed. But the coffee-shop\u2019s trade has halved since the banks were shut and capital controls imposed. He voted for Alexis Tsipras in January but didn\u2019t vote in the referendum. But he said he now had faith in Tspiras\u2019s negotiations and the new proposals were not a betrayal. \u201cI think everyone has always known that things were going to be very difficult now and in the coming years. The deal will be very difficult for us, but it\u2019s probably the best solution. Better a deal than no deal. I think our only chance is to continue on our road in the eurozone. The No vote was a way for Greeks to express their feelings to Europe, there\u2019s a certain happiness that the No vote has been heard. And it seems there has been an understanding that more should be put on the table for Greece, in the form of debt relief. There has been progress.\u201d Valentine, 26, who runs a retro vintage clothing shop that sells clothes by the kilo, said: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of the No vote, it will be remembered as a key moment in Greek history. I trust Tspiras, even if some people don\u2019t.\u201d She felt much was going on behind the scenes and the next few days would show whether a deal could be made or whether Greece would roll towards a Grexit. \u201cWe always knew, whatever the referendum result, that it would be difficult whatever happens. We had never forgotten that.\u201d Greece\u2019s fate will effectively be decided tomorrow, flags up Ian in Brussels: Saturday\u2019s eurozone finance ministers meeting will be decisive in deciding whether negotiations over a third bailout begin, or whether leaders should start planning for Grexit on Sunday. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s battle against the creditors has ended in ignominy, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott: Greece now faces a fresh wave of austerity policies \u2013 increases in VAT, public sector wage cuts, less generous pensions \u2013 that will put the brake on activity. This approach has been tried repeatedly over the past five years and it has failed repeatedly. It will fail again. Greece is like Sisyphus, the king of Corinth who according to legend angered the gods and was condemned to push an enormous rock to the top of a hill. When Sisyphus neared the summit, the boulder would slip from his grasp and tumble back down to the bottom of the slope, forcing him to start again. Alexis Tsipras, too, has angered the gods, in this case the European commission, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and most of the 18 other countries that are members of the single currency. His punishment for his five-month show of defiance will be to have Greece\u2019s boulder replaced by an even bigger one. More here: German Social Democrat MEP Axel Sch\u00e4fer has welcomed the Greek reform list. He calling it an \u201cimportant development, because the government as well as the most important opposition parties have agreed on it.\u201d As to whether the creditors will accept it, he said: \u201cI hope so.\u201d Greece must receive a further bailout package, he said, adding: \u201cThat is to say, it needs new financial measures that can be paid back over a very very long timeframe.\u201d Sch\u00e4fer is of the view that a majority of the Bundestag would vote in favour of a third bailout, although he added Merkel would find it easier to get the agreement of SPD politicians than those within her own conservative bloc. [SPD are the junior coalition partner with Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU] A group of pensioners have held a protest outside the Greek finance ministry this morning: Update: I thought this was an anti-austerity demo, but a reader kindly flags up that they are actually protesting against having to queue up at banks for hours once or twice a week to get just a fraction of their pensions, under the current capital controls. Tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting will be a clash between the countries who are determined to keep Greece in the euro, and those who are (or were) ready to see them leave: Royal Bank of Scotland have divided up the teams: My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison has rifled through the Greek newspapers, and reports: I Avgi, a leftist paper close to Syriza has a large picture of Tsipras with the headline \u201cThe day of judgement\u201d over an article laying out some of the basic details of the proposal. An editorial titled \u201cStructural violence\u201d condemns Greece\u2019s partners for their cruelty. Several other front page articles remind readers of the cost of austerity, including a warning from the statistics agency that one in three Greeks are in danger of falling into poverty. Ta Nea, the country\u2019s top selling daily newspaper went with one of the top concerns for middle-class Greeks, the fate of their savings. \u201cHow the deposits are being saved\u201d was the headline, over an article detailing how Tsipras\u2019 plans push back the risk of \u201chaircuts\u201d to the savings accounts of ordinary citizens. It also has a cartoon of Greeks queuing on a diving board over an empty public swimming pool, with the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, holding a slowly dripping hose. \u201cOh Draghi!\u201d a would-be swimmer shouts. Centre-right paper Kathimerini has an opinion piece by influential managing editor Nikos Konstandaras saying the heavy burden of Greece\u2019s future hangs on the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, alone (here is the English language version). \u201cIn these hours, Tsipras must be desperately lonely. It is inconceivable that a whole country \u2013 one that is a long-time member of the European Union \u2013 should come to a point where it depends on one person to determine its fate, not on institutions or procedures,\u201d Konstandaras writes in the front-page editorial. \u201cTsipras has to measure himself against history, to choose a road that will lead either to salvation or tragedy.\u201d He says if Tsipras is willing to take on his own party to push though a deal some of its harder-left members don\u2019t support, he will find more allies than he has lost, \u201cmany more than he can imagine\u201d Rightwing paper Democratia gave the impression that the package was all but a done deal: \u201cYou have a package \u2013 the moment of truth\u201d, the front page headline read, adding \u201cParliament rushes to give approval.\u201d German politicians have been reacting through the morning to the Greek proposals, and all of them are voicing scepticism. First up this morning on the state broadcaster ZDF\u2019s Morgenmagazin programme, was Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, vice president of the European Parliament, and a member of Germany\u2019s liberal FDP . Kate Connolly watched the interview and has translated the most salient points: Lambsdorff said he had been studying the document this morning, but felt that several issues were missing from it: \u201cfor example there\u2019s nothing in there about the roll of the Orthodox Church, which is after all, the biggest landowner in Greece. There\u2019s little about reform of the financial authorities and that is a very decisive question, because whether you set the corporate tax at 26% or 28% is in the end not nearly so important as whether you actually collect it. That is the problem. Several important things are missing in this programme.\u201d To ZDF\u2019s question as to what the difference was between these proposals and what the Greeks turned down at the referendum, Lambsdorff said: \u201cThat\u2019s precisely the point. That is the core issue here. And it is also the reason why we in the FDP say how can... a Tsipras government that allowed precisely this programme to be rejected by his people with 61%, now stand again in front of the people and credibly say: \u2018we\u2019re doing all of that afterall\u2019 and then to credibly stand up on the international stage and say: \u2018yes, we take \u2018ownership\u2019, as it\u2019s called \u2013 we\u2019ll take that on board as our responsibility and implement it\u2019. I\u2019m missing the belief that a third bailout is possible.\u201d Lambsdorff added that he was sceptical that the Greek problems were anyway near to being solved. \u201cHe has Frau Merkel and Herr Sch\u00e4uble precisely where he wants to have them...that might put pressure on them to give in, but I think that cannot possibly happen. A third bailout with a haircut in the Eurozone \u2013 that will not solve the Greek problems.\u201d Lambsdorff isn\u2019t the only one voicing doubts: Bild have uploaded a pdf of the Greek proposals, in English. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, points out that these austerity measures, although tough, are largely what was being demanded by creditors to unlock the final \u20ac7bn of Greece\u2019s last bailout. They\u2019re could now unlock a three-year aid package instead: However some creditors, such as Germany, argue that a new bailout should come with tougher conditions and deeper reforms. We shall see.... So, what has Alexis Tsipras got for five months of deadlock, angst and the lockdown of his banking sector? Well, he\u2019s managed to get EU officials to take a hard look at Greece\u2019s debt mountain, and consider measures to make them sustainable. And although debt relief would probably have been discussed eventually, the crisis has \u201csmoked out\u201d the IMF and the US Treasury to demand debt relief for Greece. Greek MPs are expected to start debating this package of measures this evening, with a vote \u201cvery late\u201d tonight: (and where the Greek parliament is concerned, that can be really quite late indeed) As German politicians pore over the Greek proposals, some officials and economists are voicing scepticism about much of the Greek\u2019s reform ideas, writes Kate Connolly from Berlin. Michael Fuchs, deputy parliamentary floor leader of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, was quick to raise concerns. Fuchs warned: \u201cWe have to be very careful because honestly, because I have a little bit of a problem to trust it because what is the difference between Sunday and today? On Sunday the Greek people voted against these measurements. But financial experts have welcomed what they see as growing signs that an agreement can be reached. Markets reacted positively to the existence of a document, saying that it sent out a positive signal. In the first quarter hour of trading the Dax rose by around two per cent, the Mdax climbed by a similar amount, and the TecDax by 2.5 per cent. The Postbank\u2019s chief economist Marco Bargel welcomed the proposals as a starting point, saying: \u201cThe Greeks are coming closer to the creditors. That was not to be expected after Sunday\u2019s referendum. The markets are expecting a successful conclusion, as the appreciation of the Euro and the higher returns of German federal bonds shows\u201d. However others were more sceptical: J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer from the Commerzbank says that the Greek government has not presented anything new. \u201cOther than a few cosmetic improvements, the Greek government has presented the very same list of reforms which it advised its people to reject just a week ago.\u201d He told Spiegel, the list was no guarantee that the reforms would actually be implemented. \u201cOften times in the past they have not been implemented,\u201d he said. Any agreement on the basis of the document looked like being a \u2018lazy compromise\u2019 which would \u201cstrengthen the reform opponents of other countries, and would ultimately lead to the weakening of the single currency\u201d. The Sunday crisis summit might yet be cancelled, reports our Europe editor Ian Traynor. If, and it\u2019s a big if, eurozone finance ministers give the thumbs-up on Saturday. Newsflash: IMF chief Christine Lagarde, ECB president Mario Draghi, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem are to discuss the Greek proposals at noon BST. This is worrying - industrial output across Greece\u2019s factories tumbled by 4% in May. That suggests the country was falling deeper into recession even before the imposition of capital controls at the end of June. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup of finance ministers, received Greece\u2019s proposal overnight. And he has suggested that the eurogroup could take a \u201cmajor decision\u201d on the Greek crisis on Saturday: Euro ministers should give an early verdict today: An influential Syriza MP, party secretary Dimitris Vitsas, has told Greek TV that he believes Tsipras\u2019s party will stay united, if creditors commit to discussing debt relief this autumn. Readers with a decent grasp of Greek can read the full proposals here, on the Athens parliament website. There\u2019s an English translation here on Naftemporiki.gr. Greek bond yields are tumbling this morning, as investors deduce that Athens is less likely to default on its loans. (yields measure the interest rate on a bond, and fall when prices rise) The yield on Greek two-year bonds is still alarmingly high, at 36%, which suggests there is still a high chance of restructuring. But that\u2019s down from almost 55% yesterday. French president Francois Hollande has also called Greece\u2019s proposals \u201cserious and credible\u201d, and a sign that Athens is determined to stay in the eurozone. The French government is urging its fellow eurozone members to support Greece\u2019s bailout proposal. European affairs minister Harlem Desir told Radio Classique this morning that: \u201cIt is a very significant moment for Greece, but also for Europe. \u201cThe proposals which have been put forward are all serious, credible, comprehensive.\u201d And economy minister Emmanuel Macron has just said that \u201cmajor advances\u201d have been made in recent days. He\u2019s \u201creasonably optimistic\u201d about a deal. French officials have been in Athens this week, working on the reform plan. So having assisted with Greece\u2019s homework, they\u2019re helping to mark it too... The tax status of certain far-flung Greek islands will be affected by the new proposals, reports my colleague Angelique Chrisafis who is in Greece. The creditors had insisted last month that Greece completely scrap its special low VAT rates for distant Greek islands. This special VAT discount rate has been in place for decades, to help certain islands which are far away from the mainland and have to pay high costs to bring essential goods long distances from Athens or Thessaloniki. Under the new proposals, the Greek government has agreed to remove the special VAT discount, initially targeting only the richest and least remote of those islands, which would include the tourist-magnet of Mykonos. But it seems that the special measures would remain in place to help the most remote islands - and presumably the smaller and poorer of those islands, whose dwindling populations have already been hit hard by the crisis. Fuller details of which islands are concerned should emerge later today. You can read Angelique\u2019s report from Rhodes last month on why the VAT rate on the islands is a contentious issue and was previously one of the Greek government\u2019s sticking points. Alexis Tsipras has met with MPs from his Syriza coalition in Athens. The PM has urged them to back the \u20ac13bn austerity plan submitted last night, according to one government official who spoke to Reuters. Tsipras said: \u201cWe are confronted with crucial decisions,\u201d We got a mandate to bring a better deal than the ultimatum that the Eurogroup gave us,but certainly not given a mandate to take Greece out of the eurozone.\u201d And there was an appeal for party unity: \u201cWe are all in this together.\u201d It really is a dizzying turnaround: But many Syriza MPs are likely to back Tsipras, judging from these photos: Here\u2019s the picture across Europe\u2019s major stock markets, via Reuters: Investors are a little surprised by the scale of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s climbdown: As Connor Campbell of Spreadex.com explains: In a strange turn of events considering the resounding \u2018no\u2019 cried out by the Greek people to austerity, Tsipras submitted a proposal to creditors on Thursday that contains around \u20ac13 billion in cuts and tax rises, \u20ac4 billion more than the plan the public rejected. The concessions this reflects, especially on primary budget surpluses, VAT and pensions (i.e. all the \u2018red lines\u2019), and the swelling chances of a deal actually being made, is in no doubt the reason behind the robust early gains of the DAX and CAC. However there is still more work for Tsipras to do, and in many ways the most difficult task lies ahead; the Greek PM now has to try and convince his government this Friday to back the \u20ac13 billion plan, one that seemingly flies in the face of the anti-austerity rhetoric that has been Syriza\u2019s bread and butter since before the party was elected. From VAT rises to defence spending cuts, here\u2019s a breakdown of what Greece ahs submitted to: Another sign of market confidence: Money is flowing out of German government bonds this morning and into Italian debt. The euro is rallying this morning too, up over half a cent against the US dollar in early trading. European stock markets have jumped, as investors hail the news that Alexis Tsipras has submitted a new list of reforms to Greece\u2019s creditors. The French CAC leapt by 2.4%, the German DAX gained 1.6%, and in London the FTSE 100 is up 70 points or 1%. Traders are still a little cautious, though, after the roller-coaster ride this year. As Chris Weston of IG explains: The Greek public voted against austerity last Sunday, yet what we have seen is a giant step closer towards the Creditors\u2019 prior proposal which was subsequently rejected, ironically by Tsipras. There will be factions within the Greek parliament that simply won\u2019t know what Tsipras is playing at, so when the Greek parliament vote on these measures today it is by no means a done deal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout crisis. Leonardo Da Vinci once scribbled in his notebook: It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end. And Alexis Tsipras appears to have taken this to heart. Last night, the Greek PM finally submitted an economic reform plan that looks terribly similar to the measures he\u2019s been battling for months, in return for a \u20ac53.5bn bailout. Greece is now proposing sweeping changes to VAT, standardising at 23%, and abolishing exemptions on its islands (starting with the most popular). Corporation tax will rise to 28% (as its creditors demanded), not the 29% Greece wanted. And it will crack on with raising the retirement age to 67. As we covered in last night\u2019s liveblog, analysts say it looks like a comprehensive climbdown by Athens, after European leaders called a summit on Sunday to plan for Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone. Alexis Tsipras is meeting with his MPs this morning to discuss the plan. That could be a bumpy meeting, given Syriza\u2019s opposition to austerity. But it does appear that Greek MPs will approve the plan; a vote is expected today, so that the country\u2019s PM and finance minister can negotiate at this weekend\u2019s crunch meetings. The goal - an agreement that would allow Greece\u2019s banks to reopen and some level of normality to return. But how will the plan be received across Europe? And how will the Greek people react to the news of another programme, especially after being promised that Syriza would end the cycle of austerity? We\u2019re about to find out....",

In the meantime, they will also consider short-term aid to tide Athens over until the three-year loan deal that Tsipras requested has been agreed and funds can be disbursed.</p> <p>Euro zone officials also expect to discuss Greek requests for some of its outstanding debt, currently worth some 175 percent of its GDP, to be rescheduled, although the creditor governments insist they cannot legally write any off entirely.</p> <p>Germany, which has contributed more to the previous two Greek bailouts since 2010 than any other country, sounded wary on Friday after Tsipras submitted proposals broadly similar to terms that Greek voters rejected in a referendum last Sunday.</p> <p>But France, Greece\u2019s strongest supporter among the euro zone\u2019s major powers, rushed to offer praise.

This would cover things such as certain debt payments, some deficit funding and money to bolster reserves to aid in managing the new currency. It does not include the cost of bank recapitalisation which might be managed via nationalisation. If money was needed for this the cost could jump by tens of billions. Of course, there would be much wider costs to Grexit to both the Eurozone and Greece in terms of economic decline, contagion and Greek default on direct Eurozone exposures.</p> <p>This money is unlikely to be provided entirely by the Eurozone. Open Europe expects it could be split equally between the Eurozone, the EU and the IMF. The Eurozone could provide funds bilaterally while the EU would utilise either the Balance of Payments assistance facility or the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism. From the UK perspective this could mean underwriting shares of between \u20ac1bn and \u20ac1.84bn. While the cost of transitional funding should be predominantly shouldered by the Eurozone, there is a geopolitical and humanitarian case on the part of other EU members for helping stabilise Greece and keep it inside the EU. Furthermore, with a default and devaluation there might be more hope of these loans being repaid by Greece.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/how-much-financial-help-would-greece-need-under-grexit/\">How much financial help might Greece need under Grexit?</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559fbf6ae4b05111b75597af\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T13:32:49.783Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Tsipras seeks support, but has he done enough?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick recap.</p> <p><strong>Greece is inching closer to agreeing a third bailout deal that would avert bankruptcy and preserve its place in the eurozone, but it\u2019s not a done deal yet.</strong></p> <p>Alexis Tsipras has urged his party to support the \u20ac13bn of austerity measures proposed late last night, which broadly match the policies which he refused to accept in the protracted battle with creditors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28c3ec206234d7afa43891cbf7d78bbc054ad694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28c3ec206234d7afa43891cbf7d78bbc054ad694/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras<br>Greece\u2019s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras attends a meeting with lawmakers of Syriza party at the Greek Parliament in Athens, Friday, July 10, 2015.

With a youth unemployment rate in the city that has reached 65%, there are few job prospects and many face living with parents and relatives for years to come. <br></p> <p>Among some young No voters in the city this morning, there was a feeling that there was still a lot to play for and much bargaining to be done in Brussels before a deal shaped up. Many felt that now that Greeks\u2019 voice had been heard with the No vote, any austerity measures \u2014 which many felt had always been inevitable \u2014 could be tempered by debt-relief in a more favourable package.</p> <p><strong>Christos</strong>, 27, who had a Masters degree in transport engineering, was standing at the bar of the coffee-shop where he had managed to get a job after graduating. He was lucky as many of his engineer friends were unemployed. But the coffee-shop\u2019s trade has halved since the banks were shut and capital controls imposed.</p> <p>He voted for Alexis Tsipras in January but didn\u2019t vote in the referendum. But he said he now had faith in Tspiras\u2019s negotiations and the new proposals were not a betrayal.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cI think everyone has always known that things were going to be very difficult now and in the coming years. The deal will be very difficult for us, but it\u2019s probably the best solution. Better a deal than no deal. I think our only chance is to continue on our road in the eurozone.</p> <p>The No vote was a way for Greeks to express their feelings to Europe, there\u2019s a certain happiness that the No vote has been heard. And it seems there has been an understanding that more should be put on the table for Greece, in the form of debt relief. There has been progress.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Valentine</strong>, 26, who runs a retro vintage clothing shop that sells clothes by the kilo, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of the No vote, it will be remembered as a key moment in Greek history. I trust Tspiras, even if some people don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>She felt much was going on behind the scenes and the next few days would show whether a deal could be made or whether Greece would roll towards a Grexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe always knew, whatever the referendum result, that it would be difficult whatever happens.

There\u2019s little about reform of the financial authorities and that is a very decisive question, because whether you set the corporate tax at 26% or 28% is in the end not nearly so important as whether you actually collect it. That is the problem. Several important things are missing in this programme.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>To ZDF\u2019s question as to what the difference was between these proposals and what the Greeks turned down at the referendum, Lambsdorff said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely the point. That is the core issue here. And it is also the reason why we in the FDP say how can... a Tsipras government that allowed precisely this programme to be rejected by his people with 61%, now stand again in front of the people and credibly say: \u2018we\u2019re doing all of that afterall\u2019 and then to credibly stand up on the international stage and say: \u2018yes, we take \u2018ownership\u2019, as it\u2019s called \u2013 we\u2019ll take that on board as our responsibility and implement it\u2019. </p> <p>I\u2019m missing the belief that a third bailout is possible.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Lambsdorff added that he was sceptical that the Greek problems were anyway near to being solved.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cHe has Frau Merkel and Herr Sch\u00e4uble precisely where he wants to have them...that might put pressure on them to give in, but I think that cannot possibly happen.
